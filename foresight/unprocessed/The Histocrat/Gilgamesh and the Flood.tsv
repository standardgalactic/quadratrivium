0	12880	By the middle of the 7th century BC, northern Mesopotamia had become the heartland of the
12880	19440	largest state the world had ever seen. Known today as the Neo-Assyrian Empire, its control
19440	26720	stretched throughout Mesopotamia, Syria, the Levant, and even as far north as Anatolia.
26720	32400	In the west, its territory ran as far as Egypt, whilst in the east its rule held sway over
32400	40160	Sousa and parts of the Zagros Mountains. At its peak, it was ruled by a king named Ashubanipal
40160	46320	who would tout his military prowess and conquests in inscriptions scattered throughout his realm.
46320	50760	In the centre of his palace, he built a great library that eventually grew to include some
50920	55800	30,000 clay tablets and that attracted scribes from the four corners of the known world.
57160	62680	In modern times, this library is often seen by scholars as Ashubanipal's crowning achievement
62680	67320	and its remains provide a vivid snapshot into the world that he and his dynasty inhabited.
68600	73160	Yet as grand and ancient as Ashubanipal and his empire might seem to us now,
73160	77640	contained amongst the tablets of his library was the story of another king who had already
77720	83960	been famous throughout Mesopotamia for millennia. In the epic that bore his name, he ruled over
83960	89320	the great metropolis of Uruk, the son of a goddess and a mortal man possessed of strength and stature
89320	95240	beyond all others. His exploits took him the length and breadth of Mesopotamia and saw him
95240	102120	contend with monsters, gods, and his own mortality alike. So great was his quest to thwart death
102120	106360	that it even took him beyond the lands of mortal men to meet the immortal survivor
106360	110920	of a worldwide flood and event that still echoes in modern religions to this day.
112680	118120	Since the very dawn of writing, he'd provided an ideal of kingship that surpassed all others
118120	124120	and achieved a fame beyond almost any of his successors. Ashubanipal would prove no exception.
125160	131000	By the end of that same century, his dynasty would be extinct, his library buried and forgotten.
131240	136440	The great tablets that held this story remain sealed within its ruins for another two millennia,
136440	141560	waiting patiently for the day when they would be rediscovered. From that day,
141560	146440	the exploits of this legendary king would draw the attention of a worldwide audience
146440	150040	and once again one of the world's oldest known stories would be told.
152040	154840	The Epic of Gilgamesh
161000	166840	The Epic of Gilgamesh
191000	194280	Since its rediscovery at the tail end of the 19th century,
194280	198920	the Epic of Gilgamesh has inspired excitement among scholars and the general public alike.
200200	203720	Originally unearthed amongst the ruins of the library of Ashubanipal,
203720	208360	the discovery of its tablets came amidst a period of newfound interest in both archaeology
208360	214600	and early human history. Its deciphering would inspire headlines in newspapers on both sides
214600	218760	of the Atlantic, with this publicity being overwhelmingly centred on the flood story
218760	223960	contained within one of its tablets. In succeeding decades, knowledge of the
223960	230120	Epic itself grew amongst the wider public. Soon it became recognised that in the exploits of
230120	236120	Gilgamesh lay the blueprints of those of many later mythical figures, including those of Heracles
236120	239640	and the heroes of the Homeric poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad.
241000	245560	Much like these later heroes, Gilgamesh's restless spirit would take into what were then
245560	250760	the very edges of the known world, to the cedar forest in what is now modern Lebanon
250760	256360	and Syria, throughout the land of Babylonia and south to the land of Dilman in the Persian Gulf.
257880	262200	Throughout these travels, he was joined by his faithful companion, Enkidu,
262200	266760	who he loved as he would a wife, and whose death at the hands of the eternal gods would
266760	273560	drive his own quest to fort death. Today these central themes of companionship, love,
273640	278440	and the human struggle against mortality continue to resonate, and Gilgamesh himself
278440	283720	has taken on a life outside of the Epic, often appearing as a character far removed from his
283720	290360	earliest roots. Even then, to many he remains inseparable from the Babylonian Epic that bears
290360	295320	his name, which this day holds the status of a foundational work in world literature.
296280	304760	But what is perhaps less known, is that this work is far from Gilgamesh's first appearance
304760	311000	in Mesopotamian myth. In fact, by the time the most famous version of his Epic was composed
311000	316360	in the late 2nd millennium BC, knowledge of his name and exploits was already more than a thousand
316360	322520	years old. Long before Babylon was even a city, there is evidence that Gilgamesh's name was
322520	327800	being sung at the courts of the later Sumerian kings, where a rich body of hymns and poems
327800	335320	were composed to celebrate his feats and virtues. And before even these works were created, we know
335320	340760	that objects were being dedicated in Gilgamesh's honour right back to the precipice of prehistory,
340760	345800	and as heroic figures performing deeds resembling his own appear in some of the earliest artwork
345800	353000	of the 3rd millennium BC. And it is here in the hazy world of the earliest kings of Mesopotamia
353000	357480	that some scholars have even argued that a historical figure may have existed,
357480	362760	whose life and deeds formed a core ideal of kingship around which the literary Epic was crafted.
364200	370680	So who was Gilgamesh? How did the Epic that bears his name come to be? Was there a historical
370680	376520	king of Uruk who bore his name, whose reputation later offers built upon to craft a more familiar
376520	383160	Epic? And outside of Gilgamesh himself, how did the famous flood myth become part of the Epic?
384360	389720	In this video, we'll explore these questions by examining more than 2,000 years of history.
390760	395320	We'll start by familiarising ourselves with the setting of Gilgamesh's exploits,
395320	402040	the Mesopotamian society at the 3rd millennium BC. We'll take a look at what evidence exists for
402040	407240	a historical king bearing his name, along with his earliest appearances in the inscriptions of the
407240	413480	period. From here, we'll track the development of the Epic from its earliest origins among some of
413480	419240	the world's first empires, through to the standardised text of the late 2nd millennium BC.
419560	425400	Along the way, we'll also examine how Mesopotamia itself changed during the millennia of its existence,
425400	430280	and examine what parallels can be drawn between it and the society in which it originated.
431640	436440	Finally, we'll examine the origins of an event with which the Epic is inexorably tied,
436440	445400	the Mesopotamian flood myth, the discovery of which brought the Epic to worldwide attention.
449400	453160	But before we do any of this, let us begin with the story itself.
454840	459320	For those unfamiliar with Gilgamesh and his appearances in Mesopotamian myth,
459320	461880	here's a quick summary of the Epic for which he is known.
463800	469480	In its story, Gilgamesh is the ruler of Uruk, the son of a mortal king named Lugar Banda,
469480	475240	and of the goddess Ninsun. Possessed of superhuman size and strength, Gilgamesh
475240	480440	reigns as a tyrant over the city, exhausting its men and taking its women into his bed.
481640	486280	As punishment for abusing his subjects, the gods craft an opponent who is his equal,
486280	492760	the wild man Enkidu. After initially residing in the steppe, where he grazes alongside wild
492760	497080	animals, Enkidu is discovered by a hunter, then civilised through intercourse with the
497080	503480	temple prostitute, Shamhat. After adopting human dress and manners, he travels to Uruk
503480	508600	in order to confront Gilgamesh, where the two wrestle in the streets until the very houses of
508600	515320	the city shake. Eventually, however, the two cease their battle, and Enkidu instead becomes
515320	520680	Gilgamesh's dearest friend, who he loves as he would a wife and who he frequently refers to
520680	527880	as the axe by his side. After this, a restless Gilgamesh then proposes a journey to the cedar
527880	533080	forest in honour of the sun god Shamash, where he intends to slay its monstrous guardian,
533080	539640	Humbaba. With Shamash's help, the two journey to the forest and overcome Humbaba,
539640	546120	then construct a raft from the cedar trees to return to Uruk. On arriving back in the city,
546120	551640	Gilgamesh then draws the eye of the goddess of love, Ishtar, who rejects her offer of marriage
551640	558120	due to her mistreatment of her former suitors. Angered by Gilgamesh's refusal, Ishtar then
558120	563720	forces her father Anu to unleash the mighty bull of heaven, which devastates Uruk and its people.
565320	570520	Together, Gilgamesh and Enkidu overcome this bull, whose horns Gilgamesh dedicates to his
570520	576360	father, Lugalbanda, whilst Enkidu tears off the bull's right haunch and hurls it in Ishtar's face.
576840	581880	As peace seems to have been restored to Uruk, Enkidu has a dream of a gathering of the gods,
581880	586680	in which the great gods Anu and Enlil decree that for the crimes of slaying both the bull
586680	594440	and Humbaba, Enkidu must die. Struck down by the gods, Enkidu curses the hunter and the
594440	600040	prostitute who civilised him from his deathbed, only to be rebuked by Shamash, who reminds him
600760	604200	of all the good he has experienced in life because of the two.
605480	610760	After Enkidu's death, so great is Gilgamesh's grief that he refuses to leave his side for
610760	616360	six days and seven nights, only permitting his friend's body to be buried after a maggot dropped
616360	622280	from its nose. In his mourning for his lost brother, Gilgamesh tears out his hair and
622280	628040	clothes himself in the skins of wild animals, then erects a grand statue in tribute to Enkidu.
628440	634040	Now fearful of his own death, Gilgamesh sets out to find his ancestor, Utnapishtim, and his wife,
634040	640840	who we are told were granted immortality by the gods. Traveling to the Twin Peaks of Mount Mashu
640840	646360	at the ends of the earth, he finds a tunnel that no mortal has entered, guarded by a scorpion man
646360	652440	and his wife. Ignoring the man's warnings, he proceeds through the darkness of the tunnel,
652440	656200	eventually emerging in a fertile land known as the Garden of the Gods.
658440	663320	After killing a group of lions and dressing himself in their skins, he recounts his tale to
663320	670040	an alewife, who directs him to Utnapishtim's boatman, Urshibani. After Gilgamesh has first
670040	675000	destroyed the enigmatic stone ones that allowed Urshibani to travel across the waters of death
675000	681640	to Utnapishtim, the boatman instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and to fashion them into poles.
683240	687080	Crossing the waters, they arrive at a place known as the mouth of the rivers,
687160	693160	where Utnapishtim and his wife live. After observing Utnapishtim and finding him much
693160	697800	the same as himself, Gilgamesh asks him how he came to receive immortality,
697800	702360	and Utnapishtim tells him of the great flood sent by the gods to drown mankind.
704760	709960	As a survivor of this flood, Utnapishtim was granted immortality by the king of the gods,
709960	712680	Enlil, who placed him to live at the mouth of the rivers.
713240	720040	Utnapishtim then offers Gilgamesh his own chance at immortality, if only he can stay awake for
720040	726440	seven days and nights. Despite his best efforts, Gilgamesh soon falls asleep,
726440	731720	waking to discover that seven days have passed, as shown by the bread rations that Utnapishtim's
731720	738760	wife has left by his side. Despite Gilgamesh's failure, Utnapishtim gives him another test,
738840	744120	sending Gilgamesh in search of a special plant from the ocean floor that will rejuvenate anyone
744120	750760	who consumes it. Gilgamesh succeeds in retrieving the plant, only for it to be stolen by a serpent
750760	757480	whilst he bathes. Disheartened by his failure, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, where the main body
757480	762120	of the epic ends, with him marveling to a shabbani at the great city wall he has built.
762520	767800	Then in a final, somewhat tacked-on tablet, Gilgamesh sends an inexplicably alive Enkidu to
767800	773560	retrieve a toy from the Neverworld, only for him to be captured by the dead. With the help of
773560	778920	the god Shamash, Gilgamesh then raises Enkidu's shade to the land above, which then informs him
778920	784360	of the grim conditions of the underworld, and of Gilgamesh's future role as the judge of the dead.
786520	789880	So we now have a general idea of the epic's content.
790760	795240	But if we are to understand the context of the events that it depicts, along with the timeline of
795240	799400	its wider development, we will also need to familiarise ourselves with its setting,
799400	805880	the Mesopotamian world of the third millennium BC. For it is in this period that not only is the
805880	811640	epic itself set, but that we can also be reasonably sure that any historical Gilgamesh would also
811640	817560	have reigned. And in examining this world, we will gain an understanding not only of its society
817800	823880	and wider geography, but we will also see the underlying motivations of its characters.
825720	829960	Let us begin then. Towards the end of the previous millennium,
829960	833640	this region had seen the emergence of the world's first known cities throughout the
833640	840280	plains of southern and central Mesopotamia. Of these by far the largest was the mega site of Uruk,
840280	844760	which appears to have exerted a strong cultural influence over the other growing centres of the
844840	849800	Alluvial plain, along with major economic influence throughout much of the ancient Middle East.
851000	855480	As with the other settlements of the region, life in Uruk revolved around the hierarchies
855480	860920	of its monumental temple districts, each of which were dedicated to the cult of a major deity.
861960	866280	In addition to their role in the religious life of these settlements, these districts appeared
866280	870520	to have acted as distribution centres for a portion of the city's populace, with their
870520	877320	dedicated work being rewarded with fixed amounts of rations. It is also in the context of this system
877320	882200	that the world's earliest known written script, Protokinaeiform, appears to have emerged.
883400	886520	This early writing consisted of a complex system of signs,
886520	891240	impressed onto clay tablets with a reed stylus, that were used at Uruk and other sites throughout
891240	897080	the Middle East to administrate their complex temple hierarchies. By far the majority of these
897080	902200	tablets were used to record the receipt of goods by the temple, such as grain, dairy products,
902200	908040	and textiles, along with their distribution to its attendant workforce. The remaining tablets
908040	912840	consist of long lists of objects, places, and animals, and there is no evidence at this early
912840	919080	date for writing menus in anything other than an administrative context. This Uruk-inferenced
919080	925480	trade system continued until around the years 3200-3100 BC, when it appears to have faltered.
925480	931320	The exact cause of its collapse is still uncertain, although it is possible that it coincided with
931320	936280	a change in the local climate that saw much of the Middle East become both drier and colder than
936280	942520	in the previous millennium. Whatever its cause, the result was that Mesopotamian influence became
942520	949240	restricted to the alluvial plain. In places such as Syria, the Levant, and the Iranian Poteau,
949240	954280	we see the abandonment of Protokinaeiform writing and a resurgence of local pottery styles.
955720	960760	Mesopotamia itself entered the period known as the Gemdet Nasser, characterised by a change from
960760	965800	the manufacture of more plain styles of pottery to that of painted pottery with a distinctive purple
965800	971720	colouring. Other than this pottery, however, the Gemdet Nasser appears to have gladly continued
971720	977880	the practices of the preceding Uruk period. Protokinaeiform writing also continued to be
977880	982360	developed throughout this time, and we know from lists of city names dating to this period
982360	987160	that the individual settlements of the Mesopotamian plain were already engaged in complex political
987160	992360	and economic relationships with one another. A common religious system may also have been
992360	998200	in place throughout the region, with its focus being the city of Uruk. This is demonstrated by
998200	1002920	tablets and clay ceilings that have been interpreted as offerings, presented from other settlements
1002920	1006920	to its goddess Inanna, also known under her later name Abishtar.
1018360	1023320	Compared to the Uruk period before it, the Gemdet Nasser appears to have been short-lived,
1023320	1026840	to the point where there is still some debate as to whether it should be considered a separate
1026840	1033960	archaeological period at all. By comparison, its successor, the early dynastic period,
1033960	1038360	would last for much of the third millennium BC, and saw the rise of one of the world's most
1038360	1049240	iconic early civilisations, the Sumerians. Throughout the early part of this period,
1049240	1053880	we begin to see increasing growth of individual settlements into major urban centres throughout
1053880	1060840	both southern and central Mesopotamia. While Uruk remained a key player in the politics of the region,
1060840	1066840	it now had to compete with other prominent city-states such as Ur, Lagash, Uma and Kish,
1066840	1072360	each of which controlled varying degrees of territory. Generally speaking, the influence
1072360	1076200	of each of these cities was limited to its surrounding agricultural land, which would
1076200	1080920	have stretched in a narrow band along either the river Euphrates or the Tigris for an average of
1080920	1087560	10 to 15 kilometres in either direction. Between them lay a patchwork mosaic of alluvial deserts,
1087560	1092760	resource-rich swamps and marshland, and patches of less-inhabited steppe that were often used
1092760	1098600	for seasonal grazing. Each city also seems to have become recognised as a dwelling place of a
1098600	1103720	number of gods and goddesses that were joined into a more unified pantheon, and at an unclear
1103720	1108600	point the centre of Mesopotamian religion transferred from the cult of Inanna to Uruk,
1108680	1115240	to the cult of Enlil at Nipur. Inside the cities themselves, the temple authorities that dominated
1115240	1120200	vertical and economic life throughout the Uruk period also remained, though increasingly their
1120200	1125560	power was counterbalanced by a new group of figures under the titles of Em, Ensi and Lugal.
1126840	1131640	Commonly referred to as kings by modern archaeologists, how exactly these figures emerged
1131640	1136280	is still a source of contention, but it seems that from an early date, these figures combined
1136280	1140360	military power with important political and religious roles within the city.
1141720	1146120	Alongside the emergence of these figures, this period is also characterised by increased
1146120	1150520	military activity between these states, as shown by the appearance of widespread city
1150520	1157240	fortifications throughout the first half of the early dynastic period. Alongside these changes,
1157240	1162200	many of the basic blueprints of Mesopotamian society established in the preceding Uruk period
1162200	1165320	continued to be refined upon throughout the third millennium BC.
1166760	1171480	Agriculture continued to depend on the careful management of water supplied by the Euphrates
1171480	1175960	and the Tigris, and crop irrigation seems to become ever more important as the climate
1175960	1182280	in the region slowly dried out. Administration and trade was still performed using cylinder seals,
1182280	1187800	small round objects carved with inlaid scenes that could be impressed onto wet clay as an identifier.
1188040	1192120	Later, these objects would also take on an important role in the correspondence between
1192120	1196760	different city-states and rulers, whose relationships grew more complex and formalised.
1198040	1202760	Kinéaform writing also evolved to take on similar roles, slowly losing many of its
1202760	1207000	pictographic qualities in favour of both syllabic and phonetic elements,
1207000	1212760	along with a more developed system of grammar. The result is that unlike the earlier Proto-Kinéaform
1213720	1218600	tablets, to which we are largely unable to assign a language, this later script is clearly
1218600	1224200	recognisable as Sumerian, a language spoken by people of Southern Mesopotamia during this period.
1225240	1229960	And from around the middle of the early dynastic period, we also see the increasing use of royal
1229960	1234920	inscriptions throughout the region, the names of kings being inscribed on objects such as stone
1235000	1247240	vessels, stelae and votive offerings. So now that we have some understanding of the society
1247240	1253720	in which the epic is set, let us ask our first question. Is there any evidence for a historical
1253720	1258360	monarch that dates from this period behind the later literary figure of Gilgamesh?
1259640	1263960	Understandably, this question draws a mixed response from archaeologists and scholars of the
1263960	1270040	period. To paraphrase Professor Piotr Mikhailovsky, for some the search for a historical Gilgamesh
1270040	1274600	is a serious enterprise, whilst for others, it is equivalent to the quest to discover the
1274600	1281080	real King Arthur, the Powered in Roland or the Abominable Snowman. A few scholars such as Max
1281080	1286040	Malawan, Barry Powell and Stephanie Daly have been willing to entertain the idea that a monarch
1286040	1292040	carrying this name could have reigned at Uruk somewhere between 2800 and 2600 BC,
1292120	1295880	with these arguments being based on later literary accounts and a small number of
1295880	1301640	contemporary inscriptions. On the whole, however, most archaeologists agree that there is no way
1301640	1306280	to prove the existence of such a king using the evidence that we have at our disposal,
1306280	1309560	and that as such he is best treated as a purely mythical figure.
1310920	1315400	And looking at the excavations that have been carried out at Uruk, it is easy to see why many
1315400	1321240	have drawn that conclusion. In the collection of stories in which he features, Gilgamesh is
1321240	1326440	intimately associated with the central ritual districts of Uruk, the Ayanna and the Kulab,
1326440	1332360	both of which have been extensively excavated. If such a figure did exist, then it is in these
1332360	1337640	districts that we may expect to find some evidence for his existence, especially as a possible dating
1337640	1342520	to around the 27th century BC, roughly overlapped with the appearance of the earliest known royal
1342520	1349000	inscriptions in southern Mesopotamia. Unfortunately for us, however, no evidence of any writing or
1349000	1354680	inscriptions have been found at the city dating from this period. Indeed, there is also little
1354680	1360840	evidence for monumental building at the center of Uruk during this time. The one exception to this
1360840	1365560	can be found in the Ayanna district, where the third millennium BC is marked by the development
1365560	1369800	of a number of enigmatic structures that culminated in its final centuries in a large
1369800	1376280	cigarette dedicated to the goddess in Ayanna. Outside of these structures, two possible explanations
1376360	1380840	have been proposed, the lack of evidence for monumental building here in the early dynastic
1380840	1386840	period. The first is that extensive parts of the complex may well have been destroyed or damaged
1386840	1392520	by a later invasion that we know took place somewhere between the 24th and the 23rd century BC.
1393960	1398440	The second and better attested theory is that many old structures in this era could have been
1398440	1403720	destroyed during its remodeling by a later king named Ur-Namu, whose name can be found
1403720	1409400	inscribed on the Ziggurat's bricks. Either way, what is clear is that there is no evidence of
1409400	1415400	Gilgamesh to be found in the central districts of Uruk itself. But there is another monumental
1415400	1420600	feature at Uruk that is famously associated with Gilgamesh and whose first construction
1420600	1426360	would be credited to him in the earliest literary texts in which he features, the Great Wall of
1426360	1432680	Uruk. Constructed in a period when Uruk was nearing its peak size, this vast fortification
1432680	1439960	stretches for over 9 kilometers and encircles an area of over 500 hectares. Built from fired mud
1439960	1445480	bricks, the wall itself averages 9 meters thick in most areas and its surrounding complex measures
1445480	1452280	some 40 meters in width. Embedded inside it are a vast system of buttresses, towers and entrance
1452280	1458920	ways, along with inlets and outlets for the city's canals. This wall is certainly impressive
1458920	1463160	and its construction does correlate with a period when the city was known to be both large
1463160	1469480	and powerful. But unfortunately, only limited excavations of its sections have been carried out
1469480	1474360	and what work has been done has found no evidence at all to connect its construction to Gilgamesh.
1475640	1479880	Whilst later kings are known to have placed votive objects inscribed with their names within the
1479880	1484920	foundations of their major building projects, no such objects have been found beneath the excavated
1484920	1490200	parts of Uruk's wall, leaving us unable to connect its construction to any historical figure.
1491480	1496680	The exact dating of the wall is also uncertain, though most archaeologists place its construction
1496680	1501400	at the beginning of the early dynastic period, which may well be too early for most estimates
1501400	1508600	of historical Gilgamesh's reign. So if there was a historical Gilgamesh, there is no evidence of
1508600	1513640	him to be found at his namesake city, nor at any other centre throughout Mesopotamia during the
1513640	1519640	first half of the early dynastic period. Instead, if we wish to find his earliest attestations,
1519640	1525880	we have to skip forward by a couple of centuries. It is here, as we enter the later part of the
1525880	1531160	early dynastic period, that Gilgamesh's name is first found under its Sumerian spelling of
1531160	1535640	Bilgamesh, nearly a half a millennium for his first known literary appearance.
1537880	1543160	Here he appears not as a king, but as part of a list of gods unearthed at the site of Shoropak
1543160	1549960	that dates from roughly the 26th to the 25th century BC. Whilst he receives no special treatment on
1549960	1554920	this list, his placing already seems to show an association with Arukh, as the entry above his
1554920	1560680	reads Suladu Kulab, or Road Facing Kulab, referring to one of the city's central districts.
1561880	1566360	Beyond this god's list, we also find more information regarding Gilgamesh appearing
1566360	1571480	in a small number of inscriptions dedicated to him that date from around the 24th century BC.
1571720	1576840	One such inscription is preserved on a ceremonial stone mace head of unknown providence that were
1576840	1582440	frequently made as votive offerings to a particular god or goddess. To quote its text,
1602280	1609000	From this inscription, we can conclude a few details to complement the limited information
1609000	1614840	given in the gods list. For a start, whilst we know that Gilgamesh was clearly regarded as a god
1614840	1619720	during this period, and even the recipient of votive offerings, we also see him named here as
1619720	1624840	a king of men, an inclusion that may reflect his dual nature and his later literary appearances.
1626200	1630680	Secondly, we see the first mention of his divine parentage, specific with that he is the son of
1630760	1634840	the goddess Ninsu Moon, later known under her familiar name of Ninsun.
1636280	1641160	Finally, from his earliest attestations, we see that Gilgamesh is already being associated with
1641160	1646520	idealized epithets of Mesopotamian kingship, with his title of the strong one being frequently
1646520	1654200	adopted by kings in the late 3rd millennium BC. These two texts raise an interesting possibility.
1654840	1659480	As Gilgamesh's earliest attestations in this period are as a god rather than a king,
1659480	1664200	are we to assume that he began his existence as a deity, only later being given a historical
1664200	1670200	background as a king of Uruk? This is certainly a possibility, but we should also note that the
1670200	1676680	Macehead inscription does directly refer to him as a king of men. An additional factor that we can
1676680	1681000	conclude from these early inscriptions is that whilst some of Gilgamesh's later attributes are
1681000	1685560	already present, there is little evidence of him being associated with many of the deeds we will
1685560	1691400	see in the later epic. This is also reflected in the small group of literary texts that have
1691400	1697320	come down to us from the early dynastic period. These texts are largely limited to those that
1697320	1702360	have been excavated from the city of Abu Salabik in central Mesopotamia along with those found
1702360	1709160	at both Mari and Ebla in modern Syria. The archaic and often fragmentary nature of these texts makes
1709160	1714120	them difficult to comprehend and understanding is often reliant on the existence of a later copy
1714200	1719880	of the same text in a more readable script. Examples of this include a wisdom text,
1719880	1723960	known as the instructions of Shuropak, later versions of which are addressed from the city's
1723960	1729880	eponymous king, to his son, Ziosudra, along with a number of hymns and other mythological texts.
1731240	1735480	By far the most significant of these texts for our purposes, however, is a fragment of a
1735480	1741080	mythological tale of the love-making between the mortal hero Lugalbanda and the goddess Ninsun,
1741080	1744600	which some scholars have attempted to relate to the birth of Gilgamesh.
1745880	1750760	However, according to a seriologist, Andrew R. George, at no point does this name appear in the
1750760	1755560	tale, and indeed the state of the fragment is such that even the idea of it referring to a birth
1755560	1761240	remains unproven. As we will soon see, there are also good reasons to doubt that Lugalbanda
1761240	1767640	was considered Gilgamesh's father at this early date. In addition to this text, two others from
1767640	1772360	Abu Salabik have also been claimed to mention Gilgamesh himself, although the validity of
1772360	1778600	these claims remains controversial. Moving beyond what written evidence we have available,
1778600	1783800	it is also often noted that figures resembling both Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu frequently
1783800	1790360	appear in Mesopotamian artwork dating to the early dynastic period. Indeed, we frequently see heroic
1790360	1795320	figures portrayed on cylinder seals and carvings from this period, often being depicted in forms
1795320	1801960	of heroic nudity and wrestling with animals such as lions and bulls. This latter motif,
1801960	1806600	known as the master of animals, is a common one throughout the region and is known to date back
1806600	1812760	to at least the 7th millennium BC. It is certainly possible that these figures represent events from
1812760	1817720	the later epic, particularly Gilgamesh's contention with either the bull of heaven or his later
1817720	1822840	encounter with a group of lions whose skin he clothes himself in during his search for immortality.
1823160	1828120	Unfortunately for us, however, we have no examples of direct inscriptions naming either Gilgamesh
1828120	1832840	or Enkidu alongside these works, and it is entirely possible that they depict other
1832840	1837800	heroic figures from the period, or that they simply represent more generic heroic archetypes.
1842840	1847720	So from what we've covered here, we can conclude that to the people of early dynastic Mesopotamia,
1848680	1854600	Gilgamesh was known as a god worthy of dedications, as a king of men, and that his name was associated
1854600	1861160	with at least one of the epithets given to later rulers. But outside of this, we have no clear
1861160	1865800	evidence that he was ever a historical king of Uruk, or that he was a fixture in the literature of
1865800	1872600	this time. At this point, we could easily abandon our search for a historical Gilgamesh and assign
1872680	1878760	him purely to the realm of mythology. However, in doing so, we would be ignoring a small amount
1878760	1883800	of indirect evidence, as a number of scholars have pointed to as at least leaving his existence
1883800	1890840	an open question. And to observe this evidence, we must leave the world of early dynastic Sumer behind
1890840	1895320	and examine social and political developments within central and southern Mesopotamia,
1895320	1901480	right at the end of the third millennium BC. Unlike the largely fragmented city-states that
1901560	1906280	characterised the region for much of the previous millennium, the centuries ahead would see periodic
1906280	1912920	unifications of the region under a single ruler. Prior to the rise of its first lasting empire,
1912920	1917480	there had been a number of erstwhile conquerors of Mesopotamia, but none of them appears to have
1917480	1923240	succeeded in subduing land far beyond the south, or in passing their conquests on to a successor.
1924280	1929240	It would take until the 24th century BC before a king would establish a lasting empire,
1929240	1935400	encompassing most of Mesopotamia. And when it happened, its founder would not be a Sumerian,
1936120	1937080	but an Akkadian.
1942120	1947160	The Akkadians were a group of peoples from central Mesopotamia, a region that itself came to be
1947160	1953160	referred to as Akkad. Unlike their Sumerian neighbours, they spoke a Semitic language,
1953160	1958120	known as Akkadia, but otherwise they shared many cultural similarities and worshipped a similar
1958120	1965240	pantheon of gods under differing names. As with the Sumerians, their exact origin point is uncertain,
1965240	1969000	but we do know that they were present in the region from at least the beginning of the third
1969000	1974600	millennium BC, as shown by the appearance of Akkadian names in the earliest Cuneiform texts.
1975880	1981560	And in the 24th century BC, it was a man from this region who would build what has been described
1981560	1987880	as the world's first empire. Known as Sargon, later literary descriptions would cast him as
1987880	1992680	a cup-bearer, the king of Kish, or even a simple labourer in the palace gardens.
1994120	1998520	At an unknown point, he appears to have risen to power in central Mesopotamia,
1998520	2002360	after which he invaded the south and subdued the Sumerian city-sates.
2003320	2008680	In doing so, he deposed another aspiring conqueror, a king by the name of Lugauzergezi,
2008680	2013560	who had recently subdued much of Sumer and led him in a neck-stock to the temple at Nipper.
2014120	2018920	With the two regions now under his control, he established his capital at the city of Akkad,
2018920	2023000	also known as Agade, which he either founded or greatly expanded.
2024360	2028280	Finally, he succeeded in doing something that no previous ruler had done,
2028280	2031400	and passed on this empire intact to his successors.
2032840	2038280	This Akkadian empire would persist for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak in the 23rd
2038360	2043000	century BC, under Sargon's grandson, Narum Sin.
2044200	2048840	If we are to believe inscriptions from his long reign, then Narum Sin succeeded in expanding
2048840	2053560	the empire to the state of Elam and the peoples of the Zagros Mountains to the east,
2053560	2056680	and as far west as the states of the eastern Mediterranean.
2058040	2062440	Exactly how much of this westward conquest was rooted in propaganda is uncertain,
2063000	2066760	for all we know it may simply have been a successful raiding party to the region.
2066760	2072600	Either way, this success led Narum Sin to take on unprecedented titles,
2072600	2075880	including King of the Four Quarters and King of the Universe.
2076920	2080680	Eventually, he was no longer content to simply rule as a mortal,
2080680	2083560	and in a famous victory stele dating from his reign,
2083560	2088520	he is depicted standing above his men as a giant, crowned with the horned helmet of a god.
2089080	2098360	Narum Sin's reign would bring the Akkadian empire to its greatest extent,
2098360	2100680	but it also proved to be its high watermark.
2101800	2105960	Exactly how intact the empire was towards the end of his reign is uncertain,
2105960	2110280	but after his death, it quickly collapsed, with possible causes being the combined
2110280	2114120	stress of a major drought known as the 4.2-kilow year event,
2114120	2118120	and a series of invasions of a group of peoples from the Zagros Mountains to the east.
2119400	2125080	What follows was an archaeologically obscure period that lasted for most of the 22nd century BC,
2125080	2127960	during which these invaders, known as the Gutians,
2127960	2132200	appeared to have exercised a loose hegemony over the other cities of the Alluvial Plain.
2133480	2136760	Then, at the end of this period, we are told from inscriptional evidence
2136760	2141880	that the invaders were ejected from Sumer by a confederation of cities led by Utu Hengal,
2141880	2147320	the King of Uruk. Utu Hengal would not survive his victory for long, however,
2147320	2150760	and in the ensuing power vacuum, it would be his relative Ur-Namu,
2150760	2156200	the governor of Ur, who would succeed in establishing the second major unified state of Mesopotamia.
2157480	2161240	Known as the Third Dynasty of Ur, or the Neo-Sumerian Empire,
2161240	2166520	this state would resurrect the status of Uruk as a major centre for the worship of the Goddess in Ana,
2166520	2170920	and embark on an ambitious cigarette building programme throughout southern Mesopotamia.
2172440	2175320	Initially restricted to the regions of Sumer and Akkad,
2175320	2179480	this empire would expand eastwards, beginning with the reign of Ur-Namu successor,
2179480	2184280	Shulgi, coming to dominate the neighbouring region of Elan, and what is now southwest in Iran.
2185320	2189080	Whilst the resulting state was less far-reaching than the Akkadian Empire,
2189080	2192680	it appears to have been more internally centralised, consisting of a carefully
2192680	2197080	administered core in Mesopotamia, which maintained a system of diplomatic contacts
2197080	2202280	with the periphery beyond. Shulgi and his successors would go on to adopt the divine
2202280	2207480	kingship of Narap Sin, with Shulgi himself demonstrating a special reverence for Gilgamesh,
2207480	2213160	who he frequently named in his hymns. Finally, the royal court of Ur also appears to have
2213160	2217640	established a uniform writing system within its borders, establishing and sponsoring new
2217640	2223400	scribal schools in the process. It is in these scribal schools that we see a new period of
2223400	2228680	creativity in Sumerian literature, along with the appearance of the first documents to shed light
2228680	2232200	on what the peoples of southern Mesopotamia considered their history.
2233160	2237480	And it is also through the lens of these documents that we see what some have argued
2237480	2239640	is evidence for Gilgamesh's existence.
2245640	2250440	By far the most famous of these documents is known to us as the Sumerian Kinglist,
2250440	2254840	a collection of manuscripts outlining the supposed history of the kings of Sumer,
2254840	2258280	the earliest version of which dates back to the Ur III period.
2259320	2264760	Later versions of this document detail the descent of the divine kingship of Sumer from the heavens,
2264760	2269160	through an unbroken line of rulers, first to the city of Eridu in the south,
2269160	2273080	then to the city of Kish after a great flood had swept across the land.
2274360	2279960	After 23 kings had reigned in Kish, the city was defeated by Uruk and the kingship taken to the
2279960	2287000	Iana district. In this list Gilgamesh is presented as a member of the first dynasty of Uruk,
2287000	2290120	with his name being followed by the epithet Lord of the Kulab.
2291160	2297080	Interestingly his father is listed here not as Lugalbanda, but instead as a phantom or a demon,
2297080	2301560	and his immediate predecessor is given as the god of shepherds and fertility to Muzed.
2303240	2308120	For some time after its discovery many scholars considered this list to have a degree of usefulness
2308120	2312440	as a source of information on Mesopotamian history, as least in the abstract.
2313720	2318200	Over time however a greater awareness of its flaws has developed and it is clear that the
2318200	2323480	kings list existed less as an accurate chronicle of Mesopotamian rulers and more as a form of
2323480	2330120	propaganda designed to legitimize the rule of later dynasties. For a start it presents Sumer as
2330120	2335400	having been ruled over by an unbroken line of kings, of only one city possessing the kingship
2335400	2341320	at a time. Many of its earlier rulers are also assigned reigns of an extraordinary length.
2342280	2348360	Gilgamesh himself is credited a reign of some 126 years and this length is dwarfed by that of the
2348360	2353240	pre-Fudd rulers, one of whom has assigned a rule of some 36,000 years.
2355080	2359960	Excavations at centres throughout southern Mesopotamia have also found ample evidence of kings who
2359960	2365080	exerted a wide degree of power throughout the region, yet whose names are not included on the list.
2365640	2370600	Finally this document also seems to have been periodically revised to take into account disputes
2370600	2376920	between competing city-states and dynasties. For example in its earliest versions the first
2376920	2382120	dynasty to receive the kingship is that of the city of Kish and a smaller number of dynasties
2382120	2388120	are listed between it and Akkad. In later copies however Kish has been demoted to the second
2388120	2392680	dynasty on the list, with the kingship originally dwelling at the site of Eridu for which there
2393320	2397320	is no evidence of a dynasty possessing hegemony over the other cities of the region.
2402360	2407240	Despite all these caveats there are two early rulers on this list for whom some limited
2407240	2411800	inscriptional evidence has been found, both of whom are named in later literary texts as
2411800	2418520	contemporaries of Gilgamesh. They consist of the final two rulers of the first dynasty of Kish
2418520	2422360	and appear to date from a period when the city was indeed large and prosperous.
2423480	2428120	The first is a king by the name of Mibarakisi, later known as N Mibarakisi,
2428120	2433640	but whom a small number of inscriptions have been found. In one such inscription found on a
2433640	2439640	fragment of an alabaster vessel of uncertain providence Mibarakisi is named as the king of Kish,
2439640	2444600	making him the earliest known Mesopotamian king whose name is verified by contemporary evidence.
2445560	2450120	Based on the archaic rendering of the symbol for Kish, this inscription is fought to date from
2450120	2454760	the first half of the early dynastic period and matches well with the hypothetical date
2454760	2461560	for a historical Gilgamesh. The second ruler on the king list associated with Gilgamesh in later
2461560	2467880	literary accounts is the figure of Akka or Aga, son of N Mibarakisi and the final ruler of the
2467960	2475640	first dynasty of Kish. Unlike N Mibarakisi we have no contemporary inscription naming Akka as a king
2475640	2482360	of Kish. Instead a figure who may be Akka is attested to on a single stone stele that likely
2482360	2488440	originated from the city of Uma in southern Mesopotamia. This stele, known as the stele of
2488440	2493480	Ushumgao, also dates from the first part of the early dynastic period and is fought to relate to
2493480	2498600	a land transaction between the priest Ushumgao and an unknown woman who is possibly his daughter.
2500040	2504440	Most interestingly for our purpose this stele also features a carving of a man
2504440	2511960	next to which is the following inscription, Akka of the Great Assembly. Whether or not this figure
2511960	2517960	is the Akka of the king's list and later literary texts is uncertain. If so then it would indicate
2517960	2523000	that Kish's hegemony during the first part of the early dynastic period ran at least as far south
2523080	2529640	as Uma, which is certainly a possibility. Indeed we do have an inscribed gem of unknown provenance
2529640	2535720	that directly names Aga as a king of Uma, although whether or not he was a king of Kish remains uncertain.
2536920	2541880	We also know from inscriptions as a historical king who claimed to rule Kish known as Meselim
2541880	2546920	held a degree of power in neighbouring Lagash and according to later traditions he may well have
2546920	2552840	mediated a land dispute between it and Uma. It has also been argued by Dr. Gebhardt's
2552840	2557480	selves that the personal name Akka was fairly rare in the early dynastic period,
2557480	2559800	which may lessen the chance of it being a coincidence.
2561640	2567160	In our final piece of indirect evidence Gilgamesh is also named alongside a list of later kings,
2567160	2570520	likely dating from just after the end of the Ur Free dynasty.
2571800	2575720	Known as the Tumal inscription this text outlines a series of rulers who are
2575720	2580280	credited with the building and rebuilding of various temples at the holy city of Nipur.
2581400	2586440	In this list Gilgamesh is credited with building the Dunon-Mun-Bura, a shrine that is known there
2586440	2591720	from archaeological evidence, though these excavations found no sign of any associations with this figure.
2593160	2596680	What is perhaps a significant however, is that in addition to the historical
2596680	2601960	personage of Enmi Baragisi and the possibly historical Akka, Gilgamesh is mentioned alongside
2601960	2608280	at least two other known kings of the southern city of Ur, Misani Pada and his son Meski Agnuna.
2609880	2614520	In addition to appearing on the Sumerian king list, Misani Pada is also known as a king,
2614520	2619320	from objects bearing his inscriptions at what may be his tomb at the royal cemetery of Ur,
2619320	2623240	along with an inscribed bead found at the city of Mari far to the northwest.
2624440	2628840	Whilst less well attested than his father, Meski Agnuna is known from a small number
2628920	2634680	of bull inscriptions made in his honor by his wife, in which he is named as the Lugau or king of Ur.
2635880	2640120	However it should also be noted that nowhere in this inscription are either of these kings named
2640120	2645480	as contemporaries of Gilgamesh, merely that they also dedicated various temple structures in Nipur.
2652440	2655080	So what can we conclude from these various inscriptions?
2655880	2660520	Well it seems likely that some of the figures later associated with Gilgamesh were historical
2660520	2665560	kings, though how much their actual deeds and lives resemble those of the later literary tales
2665560	2671800	is impossible to say. As such some scholars have argued that their existence at least opens the
2671800	2678680	possibility of Gilgamesh himself being a historical figure. Despite this we still have no definitive
2678680	2684440	evidence of the existence of Gilgamesh himself, and in the absence of such evidence we must consign
2684440	2691000	him for now to the world of myth. But as we end the hunt for a historical Gilgamesh we now begin
2691000	2697560	to see the literary figure emerge in earnest. For it is during the period of the Ur-free dynasty
2697560	2701960	that we see the first appearance of the exploits of Gilgamesh as a figure of myth,
2701960	2706280	along with the character that he is most commonly associated with, Enkidu.
2707160	2716440	The Neosumerian Gilgamesh corpus exists in a largely fragmentary fashion today.
2717880	2723240	It consists of five poems written in Sumerian, one of which has been found in two separate versions,
2723240	2728680	along with a small number of dedicatory hymns. Whilst we can be reasonably confident from their
2728680	2733960	language that they originated in the Ur-free period, only one has been found in fragmentary form
2733960	2739000	dating from this time, and most of these texts exist only in copies written by scribes a few
2739000	2745160	centuries later. Even in these later forms, two of the texts remain only partially complete.
2746280	2750680	What we have, however, is enough to recognise episodes of the later Babylonian Epic.
2752520	2757800	In the tale of Gilgamesh and Huwawa, we see a story higher resembling that of the Cedar Forest
2757800	2761640	incident, though with both a different inciting reason and location.
2763640	2768600	In this story, the eponymous king proposes an expedition to the Cedar Forests of the Zagros
2768600	2775400	Mountains in order to achieve lasting fame for himself after his death. After amassing a company
2775400	2780520	of young men to aid them, Gilgamesh and Enkidu cross seven-fold mountain ranges before finally
2780520	2786840	finding a tree that matches their requirements. After cutting the tree into logs, they anger the
2786840	2791960	forest's protector, a monstrous figure known as Huwawa, who knocks both Gilgamesh and Enkidu
2791960	2798680	unconscious with one of his auras. Eventually, Enkidu awakens and manages to rouse Gilgamesh,
2798680	2804920	who swears revenge on his assailant. Together, the two trick Huwawa into forming a marriage alliance
2804920	2810040	with two of Gilgamesh's sisters, and in the process of exchanging marital gifts, they rob him of
2810040	2816760	his auras, now conceptualised as great Cedar trees. After the Guardian has been rendered helpless,
2817080	2821800	Gilgamesh considers letting him live, but Enkidu cuts his throat after warning the two
2821800	2828440	would never see home again if he was allowed to live. With this done, Gilgamesh and his men
2828440	2835160	cut his auras into logs and return home. There they offer Huwawa's head to the great god Enlil,
2835160	2840120	who angrily berates them for their actions, before distributing his auras throughout the land.
2840280	2847400	In the second Gilgamesh tale, we soon we see a precursor to one of Gilgamesh's other famed
2847400	2854200	adventures, his contention with the ball of heaven. In this story, Gilgamesh is instructed by his mother
2854200	2860120	Ninsun to carry out his duties and sit in judgement, only for him to be detained by the goddess of
2860120	2867000	love, Inanna. Here she proposes that Gilgamesh become lord to her lady, but he rejects her
2867000	2872760	in some versions due to his mother forbidding the union. After a missing section of text,
2872760	2878200	Inanna is found weeping by her father, the sky god Anu, who she asks to give her the celestial
2878200	2885000	ball of heaven with which to kill Gilgamesh. Anu refuses as the ball of heaven would find no food
2885000	2891160	on earth, only for Inanna to emit an infernal scream that forces her father to give in. She
2891160	2895960	then leads the ball down to Uruk, where it destroys the date palms and consumes the river.
2897800	2902280	Gilgamesh is informed of the creature's arrival by his menstrual, and after quenching his first
2902280	2908840	reveal, he vows to dismember the ball. Together he and Enkidu dispatch the ball by finding its
2908840	2915800	weak point, after which Enkidu hurls its horn at Inanna. Finally Gilgamesh fulfills his promise
2915800	2920440	and distributes the ball's meat amongst the poor, though he dedicates the horns to Inanna.
2921160	2927720	In both of these poems, we see clear parallels to later episodes of the epic, though in each case
2927720	2933640	these accounts are similar, only in their outlines. In addition to this, elements of these stories
2933640	2938360	are also fought by some scholars to give insight into Mesopotamian society of the time.
2939560	2945240	For example, Gilgamesh's expedition to the cedar forest is seen by Uruk scholars Margaret Van S
2945240	2949800	and Reyn Theonif as reflecting the actual needs of monumental building projects
2949800	2955720	conducted by Mesopotamian kings during this period, as the palm, poplar, and tamarisk wood of the
2955720	2961960	alluvial plain is either too soft or grows too short to be of much use in monumental construction.
2963720	2968520	By comparison, cedar wood is an ideal building material, though wood indeed had been found in
2968520	2973800	the Sagros Mountains to the east, and we know that Mesopotamian kings from this period would go to
2973800	2979640	great lengths to secure this precious material. In the later epic, this event would also be
2979640	2984360	relocated westwards to what is now modern Lebanon, a change that coincides with the
2984360	2988280	increasing importance of western states during the second millennium BC.
2989720	2994920	Similarly, Gilgamesh's refusal of marriage to the goddess Inanna is also fought to parallel
2994920	3001240	literary descriptions of the sacred marriage ceremony between Mesopotamian kings and the city's goddess,
3001320	3005080	though whether these ceremonies actually occurred or not is a topic of some debate.
3007720	3012040	When we move beyond these two works, however, what is perhaps surprising is that the remaining
3012040	3017880	Sumerian poems contain no clear parallels at all to the later epic, and indeed one of them contains
3017880	3023560	no mythical or supernatural elements at all. Where they do appear to have played an important
3023560	3028920	role, however, is in informing the later themes of the Babylonian epic, particularly that of human
3028920	3036200	mortality and Gilgamesh's struggle to escape death. In the first of these tales, known as Gilgamesh
3036200	3041240	and the Neverworld, we see Gilgamesh's increasing association with the Mesopotamian afterlife.
3043480	3047400	After a prologue describing how the gods divided the universe between them,
3047400	3051000	a great storm blows down a willow tree on the banks of the Euphrates.
3052760	3055960	Soon after, the goddess Inanna happens across the tree,
3055960	3062200	which she takes back to Uruk and plants at the Ianna district. To her dismay, this tree then
3062200	3067640	becomes infested by evil creatures, and after failing to gain the help of the sun god Utu,
3067640	3074280	Inanna turns to Gilgamesh for help. Taking up his weapons, Gilgamesh rides the tree of its
3074280	3081560	inhabitants and carves it into wood for Inanna's furniture. From what remains, he carves two toys,
3081560	3085160	most likely a ball and a mallet, and the next day he plays with these,
3085160	3091800	wearing out his subjects in the process. The day after, as Gilgamesh is about to resume his play,
3091800	3097480	the women of the city complain, and somehow the toys fall into the Neverworld. Gilgamesh
3097480	3102440	then dispatches his servant Enkidu to retrieve them, only for him to be taken captive after he
3102440	3109000	fails to show the shades of the dead the proper respect. Horrified at what has happened, Gilgamesh
3109000	3115000	petitions the gods for help. In the end only Enki, the Sumerian god of water and mischief,
3115000	3119960	will listen, and with the help of Utu, they raise Enkidu from the Neverworld as a shade.
3121240	3126040	In a lengthy series of questions, Gilgamesh asks Enkidu of the condition of the dead,
3126040	3131080	and learns how the first they suffer can be relieved by offerings of fresh water by their descendants.
3132920	3137640	This examination of death and the afterlife continues in the second of these tales,
3137640	3144280	known as the Death of Gilgamesh. As the poem begins, we learn that Gilgamesh has been seized
3144280	3151320	by Namta, the emissary of death, and now lies dying. In his guise as the Lord of Creation,
3151320	3156120	the god Enki shows Gilgamesh a vision of the gods judging his exploits in the cedar forest,
3156120	3162360	and a previously unmentioned journey to the end of the world. Here we are told he learned wisdom
3162360	3167400	from a man named Zisudra, the only survivor of an event known as the Deluge, an exploit for which
3167400	3174440	the gods granted him immortality. Gilgamesh is then told that immortality has not been decreed for him,
3174440	3179080	but after his descent to the underworld he will be given a special place as the Judge of the Dead.
3180280	3185720	As consolation for this fate, he is told he will be reunited there with Enkidu and his family,
3185720	3191800	and that he will be revered as a deity. After awaking from this dream, Gilgamesh appears to
3191800	3196760	seek counsel, and after a gap in the text, he is advised that he should not be sad at his fate.
3197960	3202920	The poem then concludes with the people of Uruk building Gilgamesh's tomb at Enki's instruction.
3204280	3209080	After diverting the river Euphrates, they build a stone tomb on the dry riverbed,
3209080	3214760	into which Gilgamesh, his wives and his retinue are sealed. The river is then returned to its
3214760	3219240	normal course in order to conceal the tomb, and the people of Uruk mourn their king.
3220520	3225400	According to Andrew R. George, the poem then concludes either by praising Gilgamesh as the
3225400	3230280	greatest of kings, or by explaining that the dead survive in the memories of the living.
3231960	3235480	Between these four poems, we can see many of the themes that would appear
3235480	3241080	in the more developed epic of the second millennium BC. In both Gilgamesh and Huawa,
3241080	3245640	and Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, we see the king's fear of death, and of the great deeds
3245640	3251240	that he undertakes in order to grant his name lasting fame. In the confrontations between
3251240	3257160	Gilgamesh and Huawa, and later the Ball of Heaven, we see the first signs of his great physical prowess,
3257160	3262200	whilst in Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, we see early signs of his tyranny over the people of Uruk.
3263480	3268280	In the death of Gilgamesh, we also see his first association with the immortal survivor of the
3268280	3275160	flood, a significant step for the development of the later epic. In Gilgamesh and the Neverworld,
3275160	3279000	we also have an important source for the Mesopotamian concept of the Underworld.
3279960	3285000	Here they believe the dead carried out a shadowy existence, where they either roamed naked or
3285000	3290840	clothed in birds' feathers, with only dust to sate their first. With the exception of figures
3290840	3296360	such as Gilgamesh, who received an exalted position near enough to actual life, the only respite from
3296360	3301160	this existence was fought to be through the offerings of libations given to the dead by the living.
3302360	3307000	It is for this reason that people in Mesopotamia considered having many descendants to be of
3307000	3312280	the utmost importance, as those who died without descendants were consigned to the worst form of
3312280	3318280	existence imaginable. Finally, the descriptions of Gilgamesh being buried alongside his royal
3318280	3323720	entourage and harem has drawn comparisons to what may have been actual burial practices from the time.
3325000	3329960	The most famous example of this has been found at what has been dubbed the Royal Cemetery of Ur,
3329960	3334040	where a mass grave known as the Great Death Pit was unearthed in the 1920s
3334040	3340200	by a team led by British archaeologist Leonard Woolley. Inside this pit, the remains of up to
3340200	3345640	seventy-four men and women were found, who appear to have been musicians, attendants, and bodyguards
3345640	3352120	of the tomb's occupant. Each of these people was killed by being struck over the head with an axe,
3352120	3356680	after which their bodies were embalmed, dressed, and laid out neatly as if in life.
3357960	3363640	It is uncertain how willing any of these deaths were, or if the burial was truly royal in nature,
3363640	3367800	but its existence indicates that mass internments of otherwise healthy followers,
3367800	3372600	alongside significant figures, were not unknown in ancient Mesopotamian society.
3377640	3383240	We come now to the final Sumerian Gilgamesh poem. Here we find a story that seems to have no
3383240	3388200	connection at all to the later epic, and it is completely devoid of mythical or supernatural
3388200	3394200	elements. Known as Gilgamesh and Acha, it concerns the contention between the cities of Kish and
3394200	3401000	Uruk for the hegemony of Sumer. In this story, the king of Kish, Acha, sends emissaries to Uruk,
3401000	3406680	demanding its submission. In response, Gilgamesh seeks the council of the city's elders,
3406680	3413080	who caution him to submit rather than going to war. Ignoring their advice, Gilgamesh instead
3413080	3418360	secures agreement from the young men of the city, who laud his prowess and predict his victory.
3419720	3425880	Soon after this, Acha arrives and lays siege to Uruk. Gilgamesh asks for a volunteer to
3425880	3433080	challenge Acha to single combat, and his guard Burhirtura volunteers. On leaving the city however,
3433080	3439240	Burhirtura is immediately captured, beaten, and then brought before Acha. The steward of Uruk
3439240	3445640	then appears on its walls, and Acha asks the hapless guard if this is Gilgamesh. Burhirtura
3445640	3451480	answers it is not, and if it were, Acha would soon be vanquished, a reply that earns him yet another
3451480	3457720	beating. Gilgamesh then appears on the wall, and when Acha asks Burhirtura the same question,
3457720	3463720	he answers in the affirmative. Acha is then swiftly captured by Gilgamesh, who pays an old
3463720	3470200	debt to him by freeing him and allowing him to return to Kish. Whilst the events of the Envoy
3470200	3475400	of Acha are all but disconnected from the later epic, it does give us some sense of how the Sumerians
3475400	3480760	viewed the idea of kinship, and like the contemporary king list, it provides us with some information
3480760	3486280	on how these people saw their own history. A number of scholars have also hypothesized that
3486280	3491640	elements of this story reflect some aspects of Sumerian society that go undocumented elsewhere.
3492600	3497480	For example, Gilgamesh's consultation with both the elders and the young men of the city
3497480	3501880	has been taken as evidence of an early form of democracy, where the head of a Sumerian
3501880	3506520	city-state would consult with distinguished men of the city prior to making major decisions.
3507960	3513560	Similarly, the appointment of a champion to fight Acha on Gilgamesh's behalf points to the idea
3513560	3518440	that early warfare in southern Mesopotamia may have often had a more ceremonial element than
3518440	3524200	the fully-pitched battles that we often envision. These hypotheses are certainly interesting,
3524200	3530040	though for the moment they remain just that. Another interesting aspect of these Sumerian
3530040	3536120	poems is the elements that they lack compared to the later epic. Perhaps the most striking of these
3536120	3541080	is that whilst they mark the first clear appearance of Enkidu, his role is clearly less developed.
3541960	3546120	Not only does he lack his later wild man attributes, but in the text he is usually
3546120	3552440	described as a servant to Gilgamesh, rather than an equal partner. In the past, scholars such as
3552440	3557000	Geoffrey Teague have used this difference in status to argue that the friendship between the two
3557000	3561560	is an invention entirely of later authors, whilst Andrew R. George has argued that some
3561560	3566760	elements of the deeper friendship can be seen in Gilgamesh's emotional reaction to Enkidu's death
3566760	3572920	in Gilgamesh and the Neverworld. The differences in Enkidu's presentation have also led some past
3572920	3577880	scholars to hypothesise that Enkidu was himself the subject of a separate body of literature
3577880	3583240	that was later integrated into the Gilgamesh epic. However, no evidence whatsoever has been
3583240	3588280	found to support this idea, and it is now known that there are other potential sources of Enkidu's
3588280	3595800	wild attributes. So how did these poems come to be written? Up until now, the only evidence we
3595800	3601000	have of Gilgamesh are a few scattered inscriptions and some possible depictions in artwork that date
3601080	3606680	to the early dynastic period. One argument is that these stories may have previously existed
3606680	3612840	within wider Mesopotamian society as oral traditions. Indeed, there is some evidence that
3612840	3618360	these works were recited aloud during the Ur-3 period, shown by the inclusion of hymnic elements
3618360	3623880	in the introduction of the poem Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven. If this is true, then these
3623880	3627960	poems may well have been read as a form of courtly entertainment for the Ur-3 kings,
3627960	3631720	much as Gilgamesh is entertained by his court musician Lugal Gabagal.
3632840	3636680	However, if these tales were originally oral compositions, there is little evidence of
3636680	3641080	this to be found within the texts themselves, which lack many of the features associated
3641080	3646840	with oral storytelling. Another argument against this possibility is that as we have previously
3646840	3651640	covered, we do have some early examples of Mesopotamian literature dating back to the
3651640	3657400	early dynastic period, and amongst those, there is no undisputed evidence of tales related to
3657400	3663320	Gilgamesh. We also have no evidence for Gilgamesh in literature dating from the immediately preceding
3663320	3667960	periods, though the picture here is complicated by the fact that the Akkadian capital is still
3667960	3674360	yet to be located, and that the Gutian period is poorly attested archaeologically. On the whole,
3674360	3679400	however, it seems more likely that these works were original compositions created by scribes at
3679400	3684120	the academies of the Ur-3 kings that flesh out previous traditions and deeds that have been
3684120	3689880	associated with Gilgamesh in prior centuries. Indeed, we know from the hymns of the time that
3689880	3695240	the second Ur-3 ruler, Shulgi, held Gilgamesh in a particular high regard, and it would not
3695240	3699880	be surprising if the poems were composed at his instruction to honour a ruler with whom he felt
3699880	3705960	a special kinship. So strong was this feeling, in fact, that Shulgi would even declare Gilgamesh
3705960	3710840	his adoptive brother, as shown in the sections of a surviving hymn. Quote,
3711720	3718680	Shulgi, the righteous shepherd of Samir, praises his brother and friend, the Lord Gilgamesh,
3718680	3725400	in his might, addresses him in his heroism, mighty one in battle, a devastating flood who
3725400	3732440	smites the enemy in the heat of the combat, a catapult of the holy wall, skilled in hurling
3732440	3739160	the sling stone, against the house of Kish you brought forth your weapons, its seven heroes you
3739160	3746760	captured dead, the king of Kish, Emma Baragizzi, you trampled on his head as if he were a snake,
3746760	3753880	you brought over the kinship from Kish to Uruk. Another thread that scholar Geoffrey Teague has
3753880	3758680	noted is the resemblance between many of the physical feats attributed to Shulgi and his hymns,
3758680	3763400	such as his skill at wrestling and athletics, and those of Gilgamesh in the later epic.
3763800	3769000	Alternatively, these kingly attributes may reflect those attributed to the Akkadian kings,
3769000	3775160	particularly the god-like stature claimed by Narum's sin. Ultimately, though, we have no way
3775160	3780120	of knowing if either of these figures influence Gilgamesh's depictions, and it is just as likely
3780120	3786040	that his athletic prowess is influenced by common attributes, claimed by Mesopotamian kings throughout
3786040	3791080	history. So, to come to the end of this video,
3791800	3798040	so to conclude our discussions of the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, let us quickly discuss another
3798040	3804040	question that divided scholars after their initial discovery, whether they belong to a unified Sumerian
3804040	3810360	epic. It was initially taken for granted that these works were indeed part of a large narrative,
3810360	3815160	and it was not until the work of Samuel Cramer in the 1940s that the idea was disputed.
3816200	3820520	Over time, however, scholars have concluded that there is no evidence at all that these
3820520	3825880	tales were considered part of a unified epic. Not only is there no evidence of these poems
3825880	3830440	being grouped together during ancient times, but as we have explored earlier, these poems
3830440	3834600	like many of the central plot points are fully developed themes of the later epic.
3835800	3840680	There is also no clear evidence of textual passages linking the individual poems together.
3841720	3846360	The one small piece of evidence to the contrary is the existence of a copy of Gilgamesh in the
3846360	3852360	Neverworld found at the archaeological site of Mi-Taran. Here a passage exists that appears to
3852360	3857320	bridge the end of this poem to the beginning of Gilgamesh and Huwawa, with the hero turning
3857320	3861800	from his grief at Enkidu's death to the living one's mountain of the later poem.
3862760	3867720	Now, over this copy dates from a later period, and also contains an inherent contradiction,
3867720	3872200	as Enkidu is consigned to the underworld in the first tale, yet is somehow alive and by
3872200	3878280	Gilgamesh's side again in the second tale. As such we can conclude that there is no convincing
3878280	3884200	evidence of the unified epic in this period, and its genesis most likely belongs to the centuries ahead.
3888840	3894520	The time has come to move on. If we are to find the earliest known appearance of the
3894520	3900120	unified epic of Gilgamesh, we must move forward by a number of centuries into the early second
3900120	3907320	millennium BC. This period coincides with major changes in both Mesopotamian culture and politics.
3908600	3913240	After controlling the region for more than a century, the Earth-free dynasty came to an abrupt
3913240	3918760	end around the late 21st century BC, with the reasons for this collapse still being unclear.
3919880	3924680	One argument is that this collapse was due to the increasing migration of a group of peoples
3924680	3930680	known as the Amorites into Mesopotamia. These people likely originated to the west,
3930680	3936840	as shown by their Arcadian name Amuru, or Westerners, and seem to have lived a pastoralist lifestyle
3936840	3940680	that saw them alternate between sedentary living and seasonal nomadism.
3941880	3945640	People with Amorized Names have been mentioned in documents from at least the middle of the
3945640	3951240	third millennium BC, but from around the turn of the second millennium BC, we see a vast increase
3951320	3956600	in the number of Amorized Names appearing in documents. In the centuries ahead,
3956600	3961240	a number of rulers with Amorized Names would also succeed in establishing their own dynasties
3961240	3966520	throughout Mesopotamia, where they quickly assimilated both local customs and belief structures.
3967640	3971560	Whether or not these people played any role in the collapse of the Earth-free state, however,
3971560	3976680	is a controversial topic amongst archaeologists, and this appearance may simply be a coincidence.
3977640	3982760	What we do know is that early in the reign of the final Earth-free ruler Ibn-Sin, many of the
3982760	3987160	other cities within the Empire seized paying taxes to Earth, and the whole system by which
3987160	3993320	the state maintained itself quickly collapsed. Unlike the collapse of the Arcadian Empire before
3993320	3998200	it, the end of the Earth-free dynasty appears to have been relatively orderly, with no sign of
3998200	4003560	disruption throughout southern and central Mesopotamia. The exception to this seems to have
4003560	4009000	been at Ur itself, where later copies of messages have been uncovered, addressed from Ibn-Sin to
4009000	4014120	an official named Ishbi-era, urging him to buy grain at whatever price it was available from
4014120	4020200	the cities of Isin and Kazalu. It has been argued on the basis of these letters that the region
4020200	4025800	around Earth-free itself was undergoing a famine during this period. However, their authenticity
4025800	4030440	has been disputed, and it has also been proposed that the need for grain was due to a loss of
4030440	4037000	expected tax revenue from the wider Empire. Later, Ishbi-era would break away and form
4037000	4042440	his own state at the city of Isin near Nipur, which he also seized control of soon after.
4043640	4048280	Ibn-Sin would continue to reign at Ur for another two decades, when an invasion by the
4048280	4052760	Yulomites and the King of Shimaski, a state in the region of the Zagros Mountains,
4052760	4058840	seized both him and the city. Ishbi-era would fare better and succeeded in driving out this
4058840	4065560	invasion in his 27th year of rule. He and his successors would later claim hegemony over Sumer
4065560	4071640	and Akkad as heirs to the Ur-free dynasty, but in reality their state was much smaller in scale,
4071640	4077240	with their power being limited to most of southern Mesopotamia. Elsewhere in central and
4077240	4082840	northern Mesopotamia, new rulers would emerge to forge their own states, each of which would attempt
4082840	4093240	to dominate the region in the centuries ahead. The political history of Mesopotamia in the
4093240	4098760	2nd millennium BC is highly complex and a full discussion of its events is beyond the scope
4098760	4105400	of this video. Let us suffice then with a quick summary. The first four centuries after the
4105400	4109960	collapse of the Ur-free dynasty, running from the beginning of the 20th century BC,
4109960	4114760	at the end of the 17th century BC, a collective we know as the Old Babylonian Period.
4115960	4121480	In its first two centuries, southern Mesopotamia was dominated by two major players, the dynasty
4121480	4127240	of Issin founded by Ishbi-era and a rival state led by the city of Lhasa, along with a number of
4127240	4134040	smaller states. In central Mesopotamia, a previously unimportant town by the name of Babylon, grew
4134040	4139880	into a major city ruled by an Amorite dynasty. Whilst to the east, the city of Eshnuna became
4139880	4146040	the heart of a powerful state. To the north, the cities of Assur and Ninev became wealthy through
4146040	4150840	their role as trade intermediaries between the developing city-states of Anatolia and those
4150840	4157160	of southern Mesopotamia. Whilst to the west lay the Amorite kingdoms of Mari, Yamkad and Katna.
4158440	4163320	These first two centuries are characterized by a period of almost continual warfare between these
4163320	4169320	states. In the end, however, it was the newcomer of Babylon that would succeed in uniting much
4169320	4178600	of Mesopotamia beneath its rule. Around 1766 BC, a coalition of Elam, Babylon, Mari and possibly
4178600	4186120	Lhasa sacked Eshnuna, ending its bid for hegemony. Two years later, Babylon's king Hammurabi would
4186120	4191560	turn on his former ally and defeat Elam with the help of Eshnuna's new rulers, only to turn on
4191560	4198120	this ally again and sack the city once more. Soon afterwards, he would have due both Mari and Lhasa
4198120	4203800	too, incorporating them into a new state that ran from Mari in the northwest to the shores of the
4203800	4210840	Persian Gulf in the south. Soon Hammurabi took on the titles of the Akkadian and Urfri kings before
4210840	4218120	him, dubbing himself king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the Four Quarters. Once again, Sumer and Akkad
4218120	4225080	were united and in the centuries ahead, this region would be known under a new name, Babylonia.
4229560	4234520	Throughout this period of feuding city-states, the literature and written language of Mesopotamia
4234520	4240040	continued to evolve. Perhaps the most important development from the perspective of the Gilgamesh
4240040	4245880	mythos was a change in the way that the literature was being recorded. Up until the end of the Third
4245880	4250680	Dynasty of Ur, Sumerian had been the dominant written language of both central and southern
4250680	4256440	Mesopotamia. From at least the beginning of the Second Millennium BC, however, its use would be
4256440	4261480	eclipsed by that of Akkadian, which went on to become the diplomatic language of both the Middle
4261480	4267640	East and much of the Eastern Mediterranean. Soon Sumerian was no longer being spoken,
4267640	4272120	and slowly it was limited to the role of an academic language used mostly by scribes.
4272120	4278280	Despite this, works of Sumerian literature continued to be recorded, and this period also
4278280	4282680	saw a major flowering of Akkadian literature throughout the scribal schools of the region.
4283960	4290040	Alongside accounts of the exploits of the kings of Uruk, Lugarbanda and Enmakar, now both firmly
4290040	4295160	established as Gilgamesh's father and grandfather respectively, we see for the first time accounts
4295160	4302600	such as Atana and the Eagle and of the Akkadian hero Atrahasis. And most importantly for us,
4302600	4307560	it is during this period that we see the first evidence for what is likely a unified epic of
4307560	4324520	Gilgamesh. The old Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh exists today mostly in fragments that have been
4324520	4331240	found at southern centres such as Nipur, Ur and Lisin. From what we can tell, many of these
4331240	4335640	tablets appear to have been composed during the training of new scribes who were likely copied
4335640	4342440	them down as part of their schooling. Only two tablets are largely complete, the first outlining
4342440	4347240	the taming of Enkidu and his confrontation with Gilgamesh, and the second covering the beginning
4347240	4353800	of the journey to the Cedar Forest. Beyond that, the remaining fragments include portions of Gilgamesh
4353800	4359400	and Enkidu slaying of the Forest Guardian Humbaba, along with a section of Gilgamesh's later journey
4359400	4364120	to meet with the survivor of the flood, now for the first time named as Utnapishtim,
4364120	4370680	a simple translation of the name Zisudra into Akkadian. For obvious reasons, the amount of
4370680	4375480	information regarding the development of the epic that can be garnered from this material is limited.
4376440	4380680	It is generally agreed among scholars that the fragments we do have available constitute a
4380680	4387800	unified epic, though due to several factors this is not 100% certain. For a start, the beginning
4387800	4392280	and ending of the two major tablets have not survived in the available copies, meaning that
4392280	4397960	we lack the exact bridging text between the two. It also remains uncertain whether this version of
4397960	4403640	the epic contained all of its later episodes. For example, the Old Babylonian episode of
4403640	4408760	the Bull of Heaven has yet to be found, and so it cannot be ruled out that this episode was added
4408760	4414920	in later. Some missing plot points are however implied by the presence of the later episodes.
4415640	4420120	For example, we can be reasonably certain that the first tablet would have detailed Gilgamesh's
4420120	4424760	tourney over the people of Uruk, as otherwise there is no reason for Enkidu to be created in
4424760	4430600	the second tablet. Similarly, Gilgamesh's description of Enkidu's death in the surviving
4430600	4436200	fragment of tablet 10 indicates that this episode was likely also part of the epic at this time,
4436200	4439320	although the exact events that lead to it remain uncertain.
4440600	4444760	Finally, we see the presence of the more unified themes of the exercise of power
4444760	4449960	and kingship, along with Gilgamesh's search for immortality and his love for Enkidu,
4449960	4453400	the loss of whom spurs him on to find a way to thwart death.
4458360	4463880	So how was this new Akkadian epic composed? Well, it's unlikely that we'll ever be sure.
4464840	4469800	It could well be the work of a single author, or the culmination of the work of many different
4469800	4475640	scribes throughout the period. In support of the former theory, it has been argued that the old
4475640	4480760	Babylonian epic is written in a more simple, poetic style than the later standard epic,
4480760	4485000	and scholars such as Andruar George have used this to argue that it could well be the work
4485000	4490680	of a single poet of genius. In support of the latter argument, it must be said that this
4490760	4495320	poetic style does not exclude the possibility that this version of the epic was the result of
4495320	4499880	the cumulative work of more than one author, and that its language is merely the result of a later
4499880	4506200	editor who formalized the text. We also know that scribes would continue to revise the text of the
4506200	4511080	epic in the centuries ahead, and it is possible that a similar process of revision led to the
4511080	4516520	creation of the old Babylonian version. So putting aside the question of a single
4516520	4520200	author for the moment, what sources may have inspired its composition?
4521400	4525480	The most obvious suggestion is that the old Babylonian epic would have been composed using
4525480	4531000	the earlier Sumerian poems, with a combination of Akkadian translations and new material being
4531000	4536040	used to establish a unifying plot and themes, as well as to expand on events only mentioned
4536040	4541480	briefly in its forerunners. In the process some less relevant material would naturally have been
4541480	4548120	excised, such as the content of the poem Gilgamesh and Akkad. Support for this idea comes from the
4548120	4553400	fact that we know the Sumerian poems were still being copied down by scribes during this period,
4553400	4557720	and it is likely that the author or authors of the unified epic were familiar with them
4557720	4565080	in some fashion. There are some problems with this theory however. As many Gilgamesh scholars
4565080	4570280	have pointed out, outside of the overall plot points, the text of the epic bears only a slight
4570280	4576040	resemblance to those of the poems of corresponding episodes, and any direct translation of Sumerian
4576040	4582200	into Akkadian could be largely ruled out. One possible explanation for this is that the writers
4582200	4587560	of the Akkadian epic were only loosely familiar with these earlier poems, or as Geoffrey Teague
4587560	4592040	has suggested, that they were working from an Akkadian intermediary that only paraphrased their
4592040	4598200	contents. Andrew R George has gone further than this, suggesting that the epic of this era may
4598200	4603560	have been based not on the existing poems, but on Akkadian oral traditions within old Babylonian
4603560	4609880	society. Indeed, from the hymnic refrains seen in later versions of the epic, we can surmise that
4609880	4616760	the epic may well have been sung within Babylonian society, much as the poems before it. After all,
4616760	4621240	if the epic were a familiar form of entertainment during this period, it would in turn make sense
4621240	4626520	for scribes to copy it down as part of their training, or to formally transcribe a record of it.
4627480	4631560	And whilst it is almost impossible to track oral traditions in a dead language,
4631560	4635480	this may also explain the sheer volume of new material seen in this version.
4636760	4641320	The best example of this is the vast expansion in Enkidu's description and backstory.
4642600	4646360	Whilst it has been claimed that there are already some hints of a deeper friendship
4646360	4651480	between Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the Sumerian poems, it is in the old Babylonian epic that
4651560	4656280	we see Enkidu's role transformed. No longer a simple servant,
4656280	4661000	he has become a wild man, crafted by the gods as Gilgamesh's physical equal.
4662120	4667080	Describes extremely hairy, he begins his life ignorant of the ways of civilisation,
4667080	4669640	living and grazing amongst the herd animals of the steppe.
4670840	4674280	After being civilised through intercourse with the prostitute Shamhat,
4674280	4677720	he travels to Uruk, where he comes into conflict with Gilgamesh.
4678680	4683000	After wrestling with him, Enkidu instead becomes the hero's closest companion,
4683000	4686520	and Gilgamesh frequently describes him as the axe by his side.
4688040	4692760	Elsewhere Gilgamesh is explicitly described as loving him as he would a wife,
4692760	4696920	and it is the loss of Enkidu that directly inspires his quest for immortality.
4698200	4701720	The level of originality of each of these plot points differs,
4701720	4705080	but in particular Enkidu's newfound status as a wild man,
4705080	4708440	seems without any clear precursors in Mesopotamian literature.
4709720	4713320	In the past, a number of scholars have argued that these newfound attributes
4713320	4717160	are inspired by earlier Sumerian stereotypes of the Amorites,
4717160	4722680	who they considered an uncivilised people. A commonly cited example of these stereotypes
4722680	4726120	is found in a passage from a composition known as The Marriage of Matu,
4726120	4730920	which dates from the 3rd millennium BC. To quote its text,
4735480	4740120	Dwelling in the mountain, the one who digs up mushrooms at the foot of the mountain,
4740680	4744760	who does not know how to bend the knee, who eats uncooked meat,
4744760	4749960	who in his lifetime does not have a house, who on the day of his death will not be buried.
4752680	4757800	Whilst these stereotypes very much reinforce the Sumerian view of the Amorites as uncivilised,
4757800	4761640	it should be noted that they display little overlap with Enkidu's description.
4762520	4765800	For example, the Amorites are mentioned as eating uncooked meat,
4765800	4771080	whilst Enkidu grazes on the grass of the plains, and the Amorites do not share Enkidu's hairiness,
4771080	4776760	nor his kinship with wild beasts. It is also clear that by the time the earliest
4776760	4780920	version of the Epic of Gilgamesh appeared, many of the major ruling dynasties of the
4780920	4785720	regio could trace their beginnings to Amorite ancestors, and this ancestry would no longer
4785720	4794840	have been considered in a negative light. There is, however, another document that is
4794840	4799160	according to Geoffrey Teague may have at least indirectly influenced the Epic's depiction
4799160	4806280	of Enkidu. Known as a debate between sheep and grain, it also dates from the 3rd millennium BC,
4806280	4809560	and details another version of the Sumerian creation myth.
4810840	4814680	Whilst it is unlikely to have served as a direct textual source for Enkidu's
4814680	4818680	wild man attributes, it does include a description of Primordial Man,
4818680	4820760	with whom he shares some similarities.
4823320	4823640	Quote,
4825160	4830760	Mankind of that time knew not the eating of bread, knew not the wearing of garments.
4830760	4836680	The people went around with skins on their bodies. They ate grass with their mouths like sheep,
4836680	4838440	drank water from ditches.
4838600	4846280	This text then goes on to explain the civilization of mankind by the gods, who mediate to them,
4846280	4851800	the meds. This elusive concept is mentioned frequently throughout Sumerian literature,
4851800	4857160	and is roughly thought to mean the norms of civilized society, including sexual intercourse,
4857160	4863720	agriculture, crafts, priesthood, and kingship. This process shows clear parallels to the
4863720	4869080	civilizing of Enkidu, who is first elevated from the beasts by intercourse with a human woman,
4869080	4872200	then taught the ways of humanity by the shepherds of the steppe.
4873560	4878440	So in the old Babylonian period, we see much formalization of the epic's content,
4878440	4883160	and indeed its major additions from this time would remain largely the same in later versions.
4884520	4888920	However, at this stage, much of its content is still missing, and if we wish to see the
4888920	4894280	epic in its familiar form, we must again move forward, and examine changes in Mesopotamian
4894280	4897400	politics around the end of the old Babylonian period.
4902840	4906760	Whilst Hammurabi was able to pass on his unified empire to his son,
4906760	4910120	Samsuiluna, he himself would not be so lucky.
4912360	4917800	After an initial period of stability, Samsuiluna faced two rebellions in the south from the rulers
4917800	4923160	of Lhasa and Uruk, along with an invasion from a new group of peoples from the Zagros mountains to
4923160	4929560	the east. Known as the Cassites, this group of people would go on to play major roles in Mesopotamian
4929560	4934600	politics, and are perhaps best known for their association with the use of horse-drawn chariots
4934600	4941640	in warfare. Samsuiluna was successful in thwarting this invasion and in pacifying the south,
4941640	4946520	claiming in one of his year names to have destroyed the wars above Uruk and Lhasa as punishment.
4947800	4953320	But this success wouldn't last. Soon after the defeat of the Southern Rebellion,
4953320	4956040	Babylon seemed to have largely withdrawn from the area.
4957640	4962520	Alongside this retreat also came a shifting of the centre of Mesopotamian religious life.
4963800	4968120	Until now, the central god of the southern and central plains had been Enlil,
4968120	4974120	whose cult was based in the southern city of Nipur. After the Babylonian withdrawal, however,
4974120	4979160	his cult moved northwards to Babylon itself, a move that coincided with the slow elevation
4979160	4983080	of its local god Marduk to the head of the Babylonian Pantheon.
4984600	4988840	And most importantly for us, this withdrawal had an unintentional side effect.
4990040	4994600	By forcing many of the scribes of the south to leave their cities, this act unintentionally
4994600	4999880	preserved many of the period's manuscripts within their abandoned households, including the only
4999880	5006600	surviving copies of the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems. Exactly why this retreat occurred is uncertain,
5006600	5010280	and it seems to have been accompanied by major movements of peoples from the south
5010280	5016120	to cities such as Kish and Babylon. Whatever the cause, the result of this withdrawal was that
5016120	5020520	much of the region came under the control of a shadowy group of rulers known as the First
5020520	5026760	Sea Land dynasty, for whom we have little inscriptional evidence. To the north and the east,
5026760	5031560	both Assyria and Elam appear to have thrown off Babylonian hegemony around this time,
5031560	5035720	and Samsua Luna's rule became largely limited to central Mesopotamia.
5037160	5042920	By the end of the 18th century BC, the Empire of Hammurabi was already a distant memory.
5051480	5055400	The final century of the old Babylonian period is poorly documented.
5056120	5060360	We know that Samsua Luna's successors remain secure in northern Babylonia,
5060360	5063400	and indeed this region seems to have prospered during this time.
5064600	5069400	By the reigns of its final rulers, however, it is clear that Babylon was increasingly in conflict
5069400	5075160	with a number of tribal groupings, who a syriologist Paul Alain Bulu has associated with the Cassites.
5076440	5080440	Despite this, when the destruction of the first dynasty of Babylon came,
5080440	5082920	it was not at the hands of a Mesopotamian power.
5085640	5092600	Instead, the end came in the form of an attack by the Hittite king Mesilli I,
5092600	5095720	who sacked Babylon around the beginning of the 16th century.
5096920	5101640	Formed in the late 18th century BC, the Hittites' heartlands lay to the northwest,
5101640	5104360	around the city of Hattusa, in central Anatolia.
5105640	5110440	By the time of the sack of Babylon, their control had expanded to include much of this region,
5110440	5114120	along with parts of northern Syria previously controlled by Yamcad.
5115080	5120520	Exactly why Mesilli chose to attack a region so far from the Hittite heartlands is unclear,
5120520	5124840	and indeed this military venture appears to have been more of a ray to seize Plunder,
5124840	5126760	rather than any attempt at conquest.
5128120	5132040	Whatever the cause, according to later Babylonian and Hittite documents,
5132040	5138200	Mesilli sacked the city around 1595 BC and carried off the cult statue of Marduk.
5139160	5144360	In the resulting power vacuum, the city s Amorite dynasty would be replaced by a Kassite one,
5144360	5148920	although much like their predecessors, these rulers soon took on the trappings of Mesopotamian
5148920	5150120	culture and language.
5151480	5157160	After this, Babylonia descended into something of a dark age, the rest of the 16th century BC,
5157160	5159960	and sources for the early Kassite period are scarce.
5161000	5165160	What we do know is that at some point in the early 15th century BC,
5165320	5171800	the Kassite king Ulam Biryash succeeded in subjugating the seal and dynasty to the south,
5171800	5174920	reuniting Babylonia into a single political unit.
5176120	5181480	By the middle of the 14th century BC, the influence of this unified state was felt as far
5181480	5185720	north as as Syria, and as far south as the states of the Persian Gulf,
5185720	5188040	making it one of the great powers of its day.
5189320	5194280	This growth in power coincided with large-scale sponsorship of public building by the Kassite
5194280	5200040	rulers, including a vast new capital city at Durkuri-Galzoo, the central ziggurat of which
5200040	5202760	still stands some 57 meters tall today.
5204040	5209000	And most importantly for us, the Kassite period is marked by a new period of creativity in
5209000	5213720	Babylonian literature, along with the development of a literary dialect that would remain standard
5213720	5215880	throughout the region for nearly a millennium.
5216360	5227240	In the middle centuries of the Kassite period, we see some small evidence for a version of the
5227240	5233560	epic that is still in flux. Today this version is known by scholars as the middle Babylonian
5233560	5239480	epic of Gilgamesh, although really all we have are a scattering of fragments from Nippur and Ur in
5239480	5245400	the south, from the western cities of Ima, Megiddo and Ugarit, and at the Hittite capital of Hattusa
5245400	5251800	in central Anatolia. Most of these fragments date from around the 14th century BC and are so
5251800	5257000	disparate that few comparisons can be made either between them or with the text of the old Babylonian
5257000	5262440	version. Perhaps their most important contribution is that they include excerpts from episodes of
5262440	5268440	the epic previously unseen in the old Babylonian version. These include the tale of Gilgamesh's
5268440	5273400	creation and his tourney over the people of Uruk, the remaining parts of the Cedar Forest
5273400	5278120	expedition, the defeat of the Boar of Heba, and parts of Enkidu's deathbed speech.
5279640	5283720	We can also see that the text of the epic continued to evolve during this period,
5283720	5288520	and that its copying out appears to remain the staple of scribal instruction throughout Babylonia.
5289960	5294520	Finally it appears during the only ancient period in which versions of the epic appear to have been
5294520	5300040	written in languages other than Akkadian. This includes a largely unintelligible version of the
5300040	5305560	epic written in Hurian, the language of a group of people who ruled various states in Syria and
5305560	5312120	northern Mesopotamia, the most notable of which was the state of Mitanni. In the west this state
5312120	5317000	would prove a powerful foe for both the Hittites and the new Kingdom of Egypt throughout the 16th
5317000	5322360	and 15th centuries BC and would temporarily succeed in subjugating Assyria to the east
5322360	5328840	for its power collapsed in the 14th century BC. To this we can also add a fragmentary
5328840	5333720	paraphrase of the epic written in Hittite, the exact source of which is difficult to tell.
5335080	5339400	Interestingly parts of the Boar of Heaven episode are included amongst these fragments,
5339400	5345240	may indicate that such an episode was present in the Old Babylonian epic, if this version was derived
5345240	5351480	from it. So moving on from the limited remains of the Middle Babylonian epic, it is during the
5351480	5355960	later centuries of the Kassite period that we finally see the emergence of the Twelve Tablet
5355960	5362840	Epic with which most people are familiar today. Known as the Standard or Late Epic is surviving
5362840	5367000	tablets date from the first millennium BC and were originally found in the libraries of the
5367000	5373960	neo-Asyrian kings Ashurbanipal and his grandfather Sennacherib. However according to scholars such
5373960	5378840	as Andrew George and Mark Van Damirup, it is likely that this work was originally composed
5378840	5384440	during the late second millennium BC, either at the end of the Kassite period or shortly thereafter.
5384440	5391080	The giveaway for this is the highly ornate nature of its text, a style known as Standard Babylonian
5391080	5395080	that first appeared in the Kassite period and that would remain the main literary dialect
5395080	5401080	of the region until the extinction of Akkadian as a major language. Indeed many of the later copies
5401080	5406280	of these texts were attributed to earlier authors by scribes in the first millennium BC,
5406280	5410680	who themselves broadly grouped into families that claimed descent from one of these illustrious
5410680	5417240	ancestors, many of whom bore Kassite names. The epic itself is no exception to this,
5417240	5422920	and by the neo-Babylonian period it had become recognised as a creation of an especially illustrious
5422920	5427640	ancestor. To quote a list of texts and authors dating from this period.
5433560	5438280	Exactly who Sin Lake Iunini was is a contentious question amongst Gilgamesh scholars,
5438360	5444200	such as the scarcity of information that we have on his life that any number of arguments have been
5444200	5450680	made both for and against his existence. Even if he did exist, his exact relationship to the text
5450680	5456920	is uncertain. As we've discussed before, serious arguments have been made that the elegant text
5456920	5462440	of the old Babylonian epic was composed by a single author who may well have been Sin Lake Iunini.
5463400	5467800	Alternatively if he lived in the Kassite period then he may simply have been a late editor of
5467800	5473080	the text, who collated the 12 tablet version that remained standard from that point onwards.
5474200	5478680	He may even have been some influential editor of a middle Babylonian version of the epic,
5478680	5482680	that provided the blueprints for the standard epic of the late 2nd millennium BC.
5484120	5488440	In the absence of any other evidence about his life however, there is no real way for us to
5488440	5494040	know which, if any of these possibilities is true. About the most we can say is that by the
5494040	5499000	first millennium BC, the Babylonians already considered him an ancestor figure of both great
5499000	5504360	antiquity and prestige, as seen by his inclusion in a later version of the Sumerian Kingless,
5504360	5508120	that presents him as the chief scholar during the times of Gilgamesh himself.
5509400	5514200	In reality this listing has little bearing on fact, and is likely an attempt by these later
5514200	5519080	authors to enhance both their own prestige and that of the text by inflating its antiquity.
5519560	5526200	So what is there to say about the standard epic compared to its predecessors? Well besides
5526200	5530840	its more ornate literary style, we mostly see a restructuring of existing plot points,
5530840	5536520	rather than wholesale insertions or changes. As we have outlined throughout this video,
5536520	5541000	the newer content found within the epic at this time also reflects ideas and events
5541000	5545960	hinted at in earlier versions of the story, as well as in the Sumerian poems that preceded it.
5545960	5552040	For all we know, this new material may already have been part of the epic by the old Babylonian
5552040	5556520	period, but regardless of when it was inserted, we must acknowledge that the drafting of these
5556520	5561800	new sections would still have required a great amount of creativity and skill, as the writer
5561800	5565480	or writers of the epic would have had to take what were only briefly defined episodes of
5565480	5570760	Gilgamesh's life and expand them into a narrative that combined the overarching themes of the epic.
5571720	5576680	Alongside this, however, we must acknowledge that not all parts of the epic were so successfully
5576680	5583080	integrated. The worst offender in this regard is the final part of the epic, Tablet 12.
5584120	5589160	Widely regarded by scholars as a late appendage to the epic, it consists of a direct Akkadian
5589160	5594040	translation of the second part of the Sumerian poem, Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, beginning
5594040	5599720	immediately after Gilgamesh's toys fall into the underworld. With the exception of some slight
5599880	5604840	expansion of the text, this piece displays little to no integration with the earlier epic,
5604840	5608280	being crudely tacked on without even a bridging sentence in between.
5609240	5613960	The result is that at the beginning of this section, Enkidu is now miraculously alive again
5613960	5618360	before his descent into the underworld, and its events proceed largely in a vacuum,
5618360	5624440	disconnected from the previous epic. Exactly when or why this tablet was added into the narrative
5624440	5629960	is uncertain. One theory, voiced by Geoffrey Teague, is that this section was included in
5629960	5634760	order to instruct Gilgamesh on the conditions of the underworld, as he might better understand
5634760	5638120	the role that he would play after his demise as Judge of the Dead.
5643000	5647640	Back to the main text of the epic, what is also interesting is how the Mesopotamian society it
5647640	5653080	depicts remains closer to that of the 3rd and the early 2nd millennium BC than that of the
5653080	5659160	Kassite period. For example, in the standard epic, Enlil remains king of the gods, despite him
5659160	5665160	having long been supplanted as the head of the Babylonian pantheon by Marduk. Indeed, by the
5665160	5670920	Kassite period, Enlil had been so demoted that he barely appears in the late Babylonian creation myth,
5670920	5675800	the Anuma Elish, in which Marduk takes on the central role as the lord of creation.
5677080	5681880	As a result, it seems clear that by this point, the larger elements of the epic have become fixed
5681880	5687160	within Babylonian scribal traditions, with the plot points of its ancient storyline being respected
5687160	5690040	rather than being altered to reflect more contemporary developments.
5692440	5696920	Putting all these comparatively minor points aside, the standard epic stands out from its
5696920	5702440	prior versions by its inclusion for the first time of what has become the epic's most famous element.
5703640	5707880	We have seen hints of its existence earlier when discussing the Sumerian poem,
5707880	5713560	The Death of Gilgamesh, and the opening of the Sumerian King List. Indeed, it was the inclusion
5713560	5718200	of this element that led to renewed interest in the epic following its initial rediscovery,
5718200	5721560	and that would soon raise its profile to worldwide attention.
5722840	5726920	It is this event that would influence works far beyond its original epic,
5726920	5732040	and shape the canon of both other mythologies and of religion still practiced throughout the world today.
5738520	5740040	The Flood
5740040	5769000	In 1872, a momentous discovery was made by a 32-year-old man in the employee of the British Museum.
5770280	5774280	He held no formal degree, no great scholarship or position,
5774280	5778520	being a mere assistant to the more renowned Assyriologist, Sir Henry Rawinson.
5780200	5784840	His name was George Smith. He came from a humble background,
5784840	5788200	being born to working-class parents in a cramped London tenement.
5789400	5794280	To put it bluntly, people with his background were not wanted in the academic world of the 19th
5794280	5797880	century, and his parents had been under no illusions as to his chances.
5798040	5804040	His formal education ended when he was only 14, and instead of attending high school,
5804040	5806440	he was soon apprenticed as a banknote engraver.
5807720	5812520	During this apprenticeship, however, the young Smith became obsessed with biblical studies,
5812520	5815320	along with the emerging field of Assyriology.
5816680	5822440	Named for its initial focus on excavations into Syrian cities such as Ninev in northern Mesopotamia,
5822440	5825160	at the time this field was still largely unformalized.
5825160	5829880	Indeed, many of its earliest excavations have been conducted by amateurs
5829880	5833080	interested in determining the truth of the biblical account of history.
5834360	5838920	Kinneathorn itself had only been painstakingly deciphered over the course of the last three
5838920	5844040	decades, and Henry Rawinson's first volume on the Kinneathorn Inscriptions of Western Asia
5844040	5848680	had only recently been published when Smith arrived at the museum in 1861.
5849880	5853080	As David Damrosch notes in his work, The Buried Book,
5853080	5857400	the disorganized nature of the field offered Smith a rare gap in the armor of the British
5857400	5862360	establishment, where his lack of formal schooling would be considered less of a barrier to entry.
5863800	5868920	Somehow or another, the young man managed to insert himself into the disorganized department,
5868920	5873240	hurrying to the museum during his lunch break on the three days that the museum was open to the
5873240	5879960	public. At first, he drew no attention, going ignored by the department's two members of permanent
5879960	5885240	staff. Eventually, however, they realized to their surprise that this young man could read
5885240	5890200	Kinneathorn better than any of themselves, and soon Rawinson would convince the museum
5890200	5896360	to hire him on as an assistant curator. By all accounts, the pay was unimpressive,
5896360	5901160	but it did not dampen Smith's enthusiasm for the job. Soon, he was working long hours,
5901160	5906840	piecing together Kinneathorn tablets for transcription. In 1866, he published his
5906840	5911720	first article, and the next year Rawinson had the museum hire him on as his assistant for
5911720	5918040	the future volumes of Kinneathorn inscriptions. As Smith himself would describe it, this hiring
5918040	5924200	marked his official entry into public life. But despite this progress, his great ambition of
5924200	5929640	excavating in Mesopotamia himself went unrealized, and he was unable to convince the university
5929640	5935880	trustees to finance such an expedition. Indeed, by this point, many of them felt that the museum
5935880	5940280	already had enough of what they dubbed primitive Babylonian and Assyrian artifacts.
5941880	5947720	Then in November of 1872, whilst working on volume four of Rawinson's series, Smith was
5947720	5952760	sorting through a group of tablets that had laid untranscribed in the museum archives for the last
5952760	5959480	quarter century. They had been discovered at Nineveh in the 1840s by the pioneering archaeologists
5959480	5965080	Hormads Rassam and Austen Henry Liyad, comprising of a trove of some 22,000 tablets
5965080	5971000	known as the Library of the Neo-Assyrian King Ashabanapal. As Smith later recollected,
5972280	5977240	I'll note references to the creation in a tablet numbered K63 in the museum collection,
5977240	5982120	and allusions in other tablets to similar legends. I therefore set about searching through the
5982120	5987560	collection. Commencing a steady search among these fragments, I soon found half of a curious
5987560	5992840	tablet which had evidently contained originally six columns of text. Two of these were still
5992840	5997800	nearly perfect, two others were imperfect, about half remaining, while the other remaining columns
5997800	6003480	were entirely lost. On looking down the third column, I caught the statement that the ship rested
6003480	6007800	on the mountains of Nazir, followed by the account of the send and forth of the dove,
6007800	6013320	and it's finding no rest in place and returning. I saw it once that I had here discovered a portion,
6013320	6020360	at least at the Chaldean account of the deluge. According to later accounts by his contemporaries,
6020360	6025640	so excited by this discovery was Smith that he leapt up and began to strip off his clothing,
6025640	6029000	although he made no mention of such an event in his own account.
6030280	6033640	Whether it happened or not, word of his discovery spread quickly.
6034680	6039240	As we mentioned before, the society of his time was one that was growing increasingly skeptical
6039320	6044840	about the literal truth of the Bible. It had only been 13 years since the publication of
6044840	6049160	Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and by the time of Smith's discovery the
6049160	6053240	theory of evolution had been largely accepted by the wider scientific community.
6054440	6059240	Advances in the understanding of geology were also similarly undercutting many of the foundational
6059240	6064360	stories of the biblical creation, and textual critics had begun to cast doubt on the Bible's
6064360	6069720	presentation of history. As such Smith's presentation of his findings to a meeting of
6069720	6074360	the Biblical Archaeology Society on the 3rd of December, which included amongst its audience
6074360	6079640	the then Prime Minister William Gladstone, led to a immediate attention from the worldwide press.
6081000	6085960	Soon after, newspapers on either side of the Atlantic were trumpeting Smith's discovery,
6085960	6089800	and what they saw as its clear connections with the biblical story of Noah.
6090760	6092280	To quote the New York Times
6093800	6098760	Noah's log of the deluge is said to have turned up among some ancient Chaldean inscriptions,
6098760	6103400	and an account of it which has been given by Mr George Smith of the British Museum
6103400	6108440	has caused a good deal of excitement, especially one passage in which the gods of the period are
6108440	6113480	described as feeling very bad and sitting like dogs with their tails between their legs.
6114440	6119000	This irreverent remark occurs in a narrative of the deluge, which purports to have been given
6119000	6124120	by one of the survivors to a Chaldean monarch named Isdoubar. The original composition of
6124120	6128840	the narrative is placed at the latest in the 17th century before the Christian era,
6128840	6135080	and it might be much earlier. At the same time, however, the paper sounded a cautionary note.
6136280	6140360	For the present, the Orthodox people are in great delight and are very much
6140360	6145560	pre-possessed by the corroboration which Cicit affords to Biblical history. It is possible,
6145560	6149960	however, as has been pointed out, that the Chaldean inscription, if genuine,
6149960	6153960	may be regarded as a confirmation of the statement that there are various traditions
6153960	6158760	of the deluge apart from the Biblical one, which are perhaps legendary like the rest.
6160920	6165160	The discovery of the flood portion of the Gilgamesh epic launched Smith to immediate
6165160	6170520	preeminence as an Assyriologist, and gave him the opportunity to realise his dream of excavating in
6170520	6176200	the field. Over the next four years, Smith would conduct free expeditions to Minerv,
6176200	6180520	publishing his findings in volumes that were as much travel logs as they were reports.
6181880	6186360	In 1876, he published his translation of the Gilgamesh epic under the title
6186360	6190520	The Chaldean Account of Genesis, placing its flood myth full on centre.
6191720	6195960	By the time of his unexpected death, he had eclipsed his contemporaries in fame,
6195960	6199320	and appeared to be on the precipice of a long and distinguished career.
6200520	6204600	Unfortunately for him, his young family, and the field of Assyriology,
6204600	6207240	his third expedition to Minerv would be his last.
6208520	6212440	On the return journey, he stopped in a small village outside of Aleppo,
6212440	6218040	where he came down with dysentery. His companions managed to rush him to the city in search of
6218040	6224040	medical aid, but nothing could be done, and he died there on August 19th, 1876.
6225240	6227160	He was just 36 years old.
6231480	6238760	The flood myth contained in the Gilgamesh epic received worldwide attention from the moment of
6238760	6243320	its discovery, and remains one of the primary sources of interest in the story to this day.
6244840	6249320	Whilst much of the focus placed upon it is due to its connections with the later biblical flood
6249320	6254120	story, it should be emphasised that to the Mesopotamians themselves, the flood was a seminal
6254120	6260360	event in history. Before it came an age when gods and primordial forces stalked the land.
6260680	6265720	When humanity, animals, and the first cities were created, and when the kingship itself
6265720	6271480	first descended from the heavens. In these anti-Diluvian times, they believed that kings
6271480	6277160	reigned for thousands of years, and the population of the world far outweighed that of later Mesopotamian
6277160	6284040	society. In Tablet 11 of the epic of Gilgamesh, we have only a paraphrase of the flood's events,
6284040	6286760	but even this lays bare the scale of its destruction.
6287720	6292600	In this Tablet, the survivor of the flood, Utsnapishtim, relates the story of its events
6292600	6298840	to Gilgamesh in order to explain his immortality. We learn that in a previous age, the city of
6298840	6304680	Shoropak, located on the Euphrates to the south of Nippur, was home to the gods Anu, Enlil,
6304680	6309880	Ninurta, Enugge, and Ea, the Babylonian name for the Sumerian god Enki.
6311000	6316040	So great had mankind multiplied in those days, that it was said the whole world bellowed like
6316040	6322680	a ball, and this noise roused the anger of the king of the gods, Enlil. He decreed that humanity
6322680	6327720	should be exterminated, and that all life should perish beneath the waters of a giant flood.
6328680	6334360	In doing so, he also made the other gods swear an oath of secrecy, but after the decision was made,
6334360	6340920	Ea crept out of the council. By pretending to speak to the wall of a reed hut, he warned the mortal
6341000	6348040	man Utnapishtim of the coming flood. Following Ea's advice, Utnapishtim tore down his house
6348040	6352840	and built a boat with seven decks that measured 120 cubits on all sides.
6354040	6359160	After seven days labour, the boat was complete, and Utnapishtim loaded onto it all of his gold
6359160	6365800	and family, along with his craftsmen, and beasts both wild and tame. That evening as predicted,
6365800	6371160	the storm god Adad flooded the land with a torrential downpour, lasting for six days and nights.
6372360	6376920	Terrified by the storm that they have unleashed, the gods cowered like dogs,
6376920	6382840	whilst Ishtar bemoans the drowning of mankind. Utnapishtim's boat survives, however,
6382840	6387480	and on the seventh day of the flood, he throws open a portal only to reveal water stretching
6387480	6393640	as far as the eye can see. Finally, land appears in the form of the peak of Mount Nisir,
6393640	6400040	on which Utnapishtim's boat runs aground. After seven more days, he sends out first a dove
6400040	6406920	and a swallow, both of whom return after finding no place to land. Finally, he sends out a raven,
6406920	6409880	who finds that the waters have receded and does not return.
6412600	6417960	Utnapishtim then performs a great sacrifice on the mountain, the fragrance of which draws the gods
6417960	6425080	one by one. Ishtar soon arrives and she bemoans Enlil's folly in calling for humanity's destruction.
6426440	6431320	Eventually, Enlil himself arrives, angry at humanity's survival, only to be shamed by
6431320	6438760	both Ishtar and Enki. Finally, Enlil then blesses both Utnapishtim and his wife with immortality
6438760	6441880	and sets them at the mouth of the rivers to dwell for all time.
6442840	6449800	Since its initial discovery, comparisons have rightly been drawn between this story and the
6449800	6454520	account of the flood given in the Book of Genesis, where the role of Utnapishtim is taken by the
6454520	6461720	patriarch Noah and his family. Indeed, when placed side by side, the two stories are almost
6461720	6467000	identical, with only minor changes being inserted into the Genesis narrative to fit with the wider
6467000	6474360	biblical canon. For example, in the Genesis flood story, the many gods of the Mesopotamian Pantheon
6474360	6479080	are replaced by the single god of the Bible, who now has to perform both the role of summoning the
6479080	6484440	flood to destroy humanity and of warning the last righteous man and his family to build the ark.
6485640	6490600	Conversely, the Genesis story retains even small details of the Gilgamesh flood myth,
6490600	6494280	down to the god of the Bible being pleased by the scent of Noah's sacrifice,
6494280	6500360	much as were his Mesopotamian predecessors. As such, it is now widely agreed by scholars
6500360	6505080	that the events of the Genesis flood narrative are taken almost wholesale from Gilgamesh,
6505080	6509560	and that other Mesopotamian myths such as the Anuma Elish also appear to have influenced
6509560	6515240	the wider biblical account of creation. And going beyond the biblical account,
6515240	6519480	other mythologies also show flood stories with clear influences from Gilgamesh.
6519480	6525080	In Greek mythology, a similar flood myth concerns the adventures of the Greek hero
6525080	6531720	Dukallion. In this account, Zeus has grown angry at the actions of the bronze race of men,
6531720	6535960	and decides to eliminate them by flooding most of Greece with an abundance of rain.
6537080	6543160	On the advice of his father, Prometheus, Dukallion survives this downpour by building a great chest,
6543160	6548520	into which he places himself and his wife, Pyrrha, along with enough provisions to last out the flood.
6549640	6554440	After nine days and nights, Dukallion comes to rest on the shores of Mount Parnassus,
6554440	6561080	where Zeus rewards him with whatever his heart desires. Dukallion then uses this wish to repopulate
6561080	6565080	Greece, turning the stones he and his wife through into men and women.
6567080	6571080	So the Gilgamesh flood myth was clearly a major influence on the later mythologies
6571080	6575080	of the Eastern Mediterranean. But where exactly did it originate?
6576040	6579640	Going only by the material we have discussed so far in this video,
6579640	6583560	it may seem like this story is an entirely new addition to the standard epic.
6584680	6588680	Whilst we know that the survivor of the flood was associated in some way with Gilgamesh,
6588680	6593400	as far back as one of the Sumerian poems, we have no evidence at all of the flood story
6593400	6599720	in any earlier version of the epic. In itself, this may simply be an accident of survival,
6599720	6603000	as only portions of the old and middle Babylonian epic remain.
6604200	6607640	But if we instead look to the wider literature of Mesopotamia,
6607640	6611880	it becomes clear that there are at least two older flood myths that appear in both Akkadian
6611880	6618120	and Sumerian texts. The first and better attested of these two is the Akkadian creation myth,
6618120	6622440	the Atrahasis, the oldest versions of which date to the old Babylonian period.
6623720	6627880	Whilst the story itself claims to be concerned with the flooding of the world by the gods,
6627880	6630680	it actually begins by outlining the human creation myth.
6631640	6636040	According to its texts, after the Anunnaki gods have divided the world between them,
6636040	6639880	they force the younger gods, known as Igigi, to labor on their behalf.
6641240	6647160	After laboring for 3,600 years, the Igigi gods grow tired and rebel against the Anunnaki.
6648040	6651720	To solve this problem, the Anunnaki then slaughter the god Illawella,
6651720	6656200	then have Aya and the crater goddess Mammy craft humanity by mixing his blood with clay.
6657880	6664040	After 600 years pass, humanity multiplies so much that their noise angers the great god Enlil,
6664040	6668120	and from here an almost exact equivalent of the Gilgamesh flood epic plays out.
6668120	6672440	Although in this story the hero's name is Atrahasis, who much like Utnapishtim,
6672440	6674600	also dwells within the city of Shoropak.
6676440	6679640	The second Mesopotamian flood story is somewhat briefer,
6679640	6684120	and is tested today only in the form of a single fragmentary tablet written in Sumerian.
6687880	6691400	Known by the titles of the Eridu Genesis, or simply the Deluge,
6691400	6697720	this story dates from around 1600 BC, and outlines yet another variant of the Mesopotamian creation myth.
6698840	6702440	In this story we again see the creation of mankind by the Anunnaki,
6702440	6707000	which in this tale comprises of the gods An, Enlil, Enki and Ninosag.
6708120	6713480	After a missing portion of the text, we hear that An and Enlil have decided to destroy humanity,
6713480	6715880	and they force each god to swear not to interfere.
6716840	6720520	To get around this, Enki tells the plan of the gods to a wall,
6720520	6723240	behind which is hidden the hero of the tale, Zeosudra.
6724520	6729400	After another missing passage, which presumably detailed the construction of a vessel by Zeosudra,
6729400	6734040	we hear that after the flood has raged for seven days and nights, the waters fall quiet.
6735320	6740920	Nusmerian sun god Utu then appears, and Zeosudra dutifully makes a sacrifice in his honor.
6741880	6747080	After a final missing section, we find the hero prostrating himself before Anu and Enlil,
6747080	6752200	who grant him eternal life, and place him to the south of Mesopotamia in the land of Dilman.
6753800	6759000	Upon its translation in 1912, it was initially presumed that the Sumerian story of the Deluge
6759000	6763960	was a predecessor to the flood story of Gilgamesh, much as the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems may have
6763960	6769640	preceded the Old Babylonian Epic. Over time, however, it has become clear that the account
6769640	6774760	of the flood given in Gilgamesh is more likely to be a paraphrased version of the Atrahasis,
6774760	6779640	and according to Stephanie Daly, the Sumerian story itself may well be derived from the Akkadian
6779640	6786200	account. As proof of this, Jeffrey T. Gay has offered several pieces of evidence. Firstly,
6786200	6790680	not only are the plot points of the two almost identical, but some lines in the epic are copied
6790680	6796360	almost word for word from the Atrahasis. For example, in Tablet XI of the epic, the list
6796360	6801240	of gods present at the meeting to decide humanity's fate is copied over exactly from the opening of
6801240	6806600	the Atrahasis, even though in the Gilgamesh version some of these gods play no role whatsoever in its
6806600	6813080	events, and figures that do such as Ishtar are absent. Secondly, the flood of the Atrahasis is
6813080	6819640	already present in its Old Babylonian version, where it plays a key role in the story. By comparison,
6819640	6825000	the Gilgamesh flood story appears only later in the Standard Epic, and there plays no clear part
6825000	6832120	in its central quest. Finally, there also exists something of a smoking gun in line 187 of the
6832120	6839240	Tablet, where the author accidentally names up Tnapishtim as Atrahasis. So it seems likely that
6839240	6843960	whilst the version of the flood myth presented in Tablet XI was first introduced into the Epic of
6843960	6849880	Gilgamesh in the late 2nd millennium BC, developed versions of the myth date back at least as far
6849880	6856200	as the Old Babylonian period. Before that all we have are scattered references in documents dating
6856200	6861240	from the end of the 3rd millennium BC, leaving us uncertain as to what significance its legend would
6861240	6867160	have held during these earlier periods. We are aware of at least three earliest Sumerian creation
6867160	6872600	myths that may well date to the early dynastic period, known as the Barton Cylinder, the debate
6872600	6878120	between winter and summer, and the previously mentioned debate between sheep and grain. However,
6878120	6882760	none of these creation myths mention flood, also indicating that it is not yet taken on its
6882760	6888600	significance within the beliefs of the region. So now that we have gone back as far as the
6888600	6893640	available literary works allow us, let us conclude our examination of the Mesopotamian flood myth
6893640	6898760	by asking a question occupied many early archaeologists during the excavations of Mesopotamian
6898760	6905640	centres in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Is there any evidence that the Mesopotamian flood
6905640	6910680	myth was inspired by a real-life flood event that took place either in Mesopotamia itself
6910680	6915960	or throughout the wider Middle East? Indeed, this question would feature prominently in many of
6915960	6923240	the early reports of finds from this region during the 1920s and 30s. What also complicates matters
6923240	6928120	is that since the late 90s a new hypothesis has emerged that attempts to explain the origin of
6928120	6933960	this myth from outside of Mesopotamia, a claim which has in turn been fed by copious press attention.
6934920	6940200	So before we move on to examine any potential evidence for a flood within Mesopotamia itself,
6940200	6942440	let us briefly discuss this hypothesis.
6948040	6953400	In 1997, what has become known as the Black Sea Deluge Hypothesis was first suggested by
6953400	6959320	geologists William Ryan and Walter Pitt. According to this hypothesis, which has since
6959400	6964920	been somewhat revised, around the end of the 6th millennium BC there was a catastrophic inundation
6964920	6971240	of saltwater from the Mediterranean into what is now the Black Sea. These authors have argued that
6971240	6975800	this sudden rise in sea level would have had a catastrophic effect on the Neolithic communities
6975800	6980040	in the surrounding region, and it is the memory of this catastrophe that would have inspired the
6980040	6986840	later Mesopotamian flood myth. Later, an alternative to this hypothesis was also suggested by AL
6986840	6993000	Chapaliga that this inundation actually took place somewhere between the 15th and 11th millennium BC,
6993000	6996360	with the source of flooding instead being the Caspian Sea to the east.
6997880	7002600	Now bear in mind that I am far from a geologist, and as such I am unqualified to judge whether
7002600	7007800	either of these events actually occurred. But looking at it from the outside, these hypotheses
7007800	7013080	seem to be heavily contested, with many geologists debating the extent and timing of each of these
7013080	7019000	hypothetical inundations. Moreover, the available archaeological evidence shows no great sign of
7019000	7023080	population movements throughout the period of these inundations that can be directly tied
7023080	7029480	to such a catastrophic flooding. We do know that from the second half of the 7th millennium BC,
7029480	7034760	there is evidence of sizable movements of people out of Turkey, both to the west into Greece and
7034760	7041160	further on into Europe, and to the east going as far as Egypt. However, it is still uncertain
7041160	7045160	whether these movements could have been caused by such a major inundation event,
7045160	7049320	and indeed there are other environmental reasons, such as an ongoing climate event
7049320	7053320	known as the 8.2-kill year event that may explain these movements.
7054920	7059400	But even if we assume that all of these events did in fact happen, the idea of them having
7059400	7064840	inspired the Mesopotamian flood myth relies on an unprecedented period of oral storytelling,
7064840	7069480	viewing the youngest date for a Black Sea inundation being separated from the first mentions of the
7069480	7075800	flood by nearly three millennia. It also fails to explain why no evidence of such an event was
7075800	7080680	preserved in other cultures closer to the centre of the event, such as the Old Hittite Kingdom,
7080680	7086520	which was a contemporary of the Old Babylonian Atrahasis. Finally, there is also no reason to
7086520	7090920	think that the ancient Mesopotamians would have had to rely on such a distant event to inspire
7090920	7095640	their own flood narratives, as seasonal flooding would have been more the norm than the exception
7095640	7101560	on the Alluvial Plain. As we discussed in the early parts of this video, agriculture in Southern
7101560	7106680	Mesopotamia during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC would have relied on careful systems of water
7106680	7111160	management to be successful, and too much river water could easily have damaged cropland.
7112440	7117000	A particularly devastating flood could even wash away immature plants in the middle of the growing
7117000	7123880	season, resulting in a poor harvest and starvation. Major floods could even swamp and destroy the
7123880	7129800	mudbrick homes of those who lived nearby. In cities such as Uruk, this would have posed a
7129800	7134440	particular danger, as evidence indicates that the ancient course of the Euphrates River flowed
7134440	7143000	through the centre of the city itself. The result of all of this is that there is far more reason
7143000	7147720	to think that the ancient Mesopotamians would be more inspired by their own living conditions,
7147720	7150920	rather than a hypothetical event that took place millennia before.
7155800	7159960	So putting aside the idea of a Black Sea Hypothesis, is there any evidence from
7159960	7165160	all localised flood in Mesopotamia itself, the catastrophic effects of which may have provided
7165160	7172840	the core for the later myths? The answer is complex. Evidence for major flood strata has
7172840	7177160	indeed been unearthed at a number of ancient cities throughout southern Mesopotamia.
7178280	7183800	The most substantial of these have been found at free sites, at Kish to the north, at the site of
7183800	7188280	the later flood myths, Shuropak, and near what would have then been the southern coastline
7188280	7194440	at the city of Ur. Luckily for us, an account of the discovery of the flood layer at the last
7194440	7198600	of these was penned by the site's principal excavator, Sir Leonard Woolley.
7199400	7209080	It took place during the course of the 1928 to 1929 digging season. After excavating his most
7209080	7214840	famous find, the Royal Cemetery of Ur, Woolley ordered a small test shaft dug into the soil beneath.
7216200	7220760	After progressing through the occupation layers, he soon reached 8 feet of empty mud.
7221800	7225960	However under this, he discovered a surprise yet more occupation debris,
7225960	7231240	dating from the 4th millennium BC. Of this puzzling interruption in sequence,
7231240	7234920	he quickly formed an interpretation, though he hesitated to share it.
7236360	7241640	In the end it was his wife, fellow archaeologist Catherine Woolley, who gave voice to his suspicions.
7242760	7244120	To quote his later writings,
7256120	7259400	after pointing out the facts, asked for their explanation.
7260200	7265560	They did not know what to say. My wife came along and looked and was asked the same question,
7265560	7268040	and she turned away, remarking casually.
7272520	7275800	In the season prior to Woolley's discovery of the flood stratorettor,
7275800	7279960	two archaeologists named Stephen Langdon and Louis Waterlin were directing a series
7279960	7283960	of excavations at the city of Kish, which had begun in the early 1920s.
7283960	7289320	During the course of their investigations, they came across what they described as a thick layer
7289320	7293640	of sand deposited by a flood, beneath which they found a series of brick tombs.
7294600	7299240	Despite discovering this layer earlier than Woolley, they were slower to publish their findings,
7299240	7302760	and in one of those twists the academics around the world will be familiar with,
7302760	7306200	Woolley received both the credit and the lion's share of publicity.
7307720	7312760	Later excavations conducted at the city of Sheropak, similarly uncovered a flood stratum,
7312760	7316520	a finding that was given particular significance, given its status as the home
7316520	7319160	of the survivors of each of the Mesopotamian flood meves.
7325560	7330440	So are these scattered flood strator evidence of a large-scale flood throughout Mesopotamia,
7330440	7333720	the distant memory of which led to the flood story of the Atrahasis,
7333720	7338040	of Gilgamesh, and of the story of Dukalion and the biblical flood in turn?
7338280	7341640	The answer is almost certainly no.
7343160	7346440	Whilst these findings were received with great enthusiasm at the time,
7346440	7351080	the idea that they represented a single region-wide flood quickly ran into difficulties.
7352200	7356760	For a start, no evidence of flood strator on this scale had been found during excavations
7356760	7360520	at any of the other southern Mesopotamian sites dating from this period.
7361720	7365880	This comes despite the fact that many of these centres were located close to sites with flood
7365880	7368760	strator and were indeed fed by the same river system.
7370120	7372920	And when it comes to the three centres with evidence of flooding,
7372920	7376440	even a cursory examination of the evidence throws up further problems.
7377640	7381480	As laid out by David MacDonald in a 1988 article on the subject,
7381480	7385480	it is immediately obvious that the timing of these layers do not always overlap,
7385480	7387400	and each one varied in their intensity.
7388680	7392920	At her, we see evidence for a single large flood event dating from around the middle of
7392920	7399560	the 4th millennium BC. By comparison at Kirch, we see evidence of three separate floods,
7399560	7403880	two of them dating to the beginning of the early dynastic period, and a third dating from around
7403880	7410440	2600 BC. What also complicates this picture is that these assigned dates precede more modern
7410440	7414680	developments in radiocarbon dating, casting some doubt on their accuracy.
7416120	7420040	And even if we are to accept the idea that these floods did in some way influence the
7420040	7424040	later accounts of the flood found in Sumerian and Akkadian literature,
7424040	7427720	we would still have to explain the many centuries between them and the first known
7427720	7433160	description of the Deluge. As with the old Babylonian version of the Epic of Gilgamesh,
7433160	7437880	we could argue that such accounts may have been passed down in oral tradition during this time,
7437880	7443160	but ultimately there is no way of proving this theory. As such we must conclude that there is
7443160	7448040	no strong evidence that these floods had anything to do with the later Mesopotamian story,
7448040	7452120	and at the most all we can say is that these legends may well have been inspired by the
7452120	7455720	frequent flooding that came as part of life on the alluvial plain.
7464200	7468280	So what became of the Epic of Gilgamesh after the appearance of the standard version?
7469560	7474520	Well as we previously discussed, this work seems to remain popular as a tool of scribal
7474520	7480600	instruction well into the 1st millennium BC. In addition to its appearance as part of the
7480600	7485480	libraries of the Neo-Assyrian kings, we know of more than 70 copies that have been unearthed
7485480	7491400	throughout the Middle East. By the 1st millennium BC, it already appears to have been considered a
7491400	7496280	work possessing great antiquity and wisdom, which may explain how much of its text remained
7496280	7502040	fossilized compared to other epics of the period. Exactly how popular it was within
7502040	7509080	wider society however, we cannot say. As noted by Andrew R George, its popularity as a teaching
7509080	7513720	tool may indicate that the stories of Gilgamesh were still familiar to the average person,
7513720	7518280	as transcribing a well-known story would have been an ideal starting point for teaching the
7518280	7524120	cuneiform writing system. Unfortunately we have no clear way of knowing if this is true.
7525160	7529720	It is entirely possible that by this time knowledge of Gilgamesh had become unlimited
7529720	7534520	only to courtly scribes, along with rulers interested in his ideal of kingship.
7535800	7540280	What we can say is that despite its continued importance throughout the early and mid 1st
7540280	7545800	millennium BC, the slow waning of the Akkadian language from the 6th century BC onwards in
7545800	7552920	favour of Aramaic also seems to have resulted in a decline in the epics copying. Even then,
7552920	7557080	parts of its story would continue to influence other works throughout the Middle East and the
7557480	7564040	Mediterranean. In the archaic Greece of the early 1st millennium BC, the Gilgamesh story
7564040	7568600	likely had a significant influence on the development of both the Iliad and the Odyssey.
7569720	7575080	In the latter work, the exploits of Odysseus parallel many of those accomplished by Gilgamesh,
7575080	7579080	such as his contention with the giant Polyphemus, his visit to the Neverworld,
7579080	7583000	and his refusal of immortality through his spurning of the nymph Coipso.
7583960	7587800	On top of these, Gilgamesh is also thought to have influenced the characteristics
7587800	7594440	of the most famous Greek hero, Heracles. Much like Gilgamesh, this figure displays
7594440	7599160	supernatural strength and stature, his mortal and yet of divine parentage,
7599160	7604600	and garbs himself in the skin of a lion. These attributes may similarly have influenced the
7604600	7609560	description of the biblical judge, Samson, who was possessed of a men's strength until his long
7609640	7615800	hair was cut. And in addition to the incorporation of the Mesopotamian flood myth into both the
7615800	7621160	Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament, Gilgamesh and Humbaba are also thought to appear
7621160	7626360	in the apocryphal book of giants, where their names are assigned to a pair of giants unrelated
7626360	7632120	to the events of the epic. Gilgamesh also seems to have survived as a popular figure
7632120	7638040	into the Roman period. In the second century, the author Alien includes an account of
7638040	7643000	Gilgamesh's miraculous birth and usurpation of the throne of Uruk from his grandfather,
7643000	7647400	a story that has clear parallels to those surrounding the birth of the Akkadian Emperor,
7647400	7653320	Sargon the Great. Finally, scholar Stephanie Daly has suggested that the later story of
7653320	7658520	Buluqia in the Arabian Nights bears some similarity to Gilgamesh's quest to meet the
7658520	7663080	immortal survivor of the flood, though this interpretation has been disputed.
7663560	7668360	Despite its clear influences on these later works, by the end of the first millennium BC,
7668360	7673960	the epic itself appeared to have lost much of its importance. According to Geoffrey Teege,
7673960	7678440	its last known copy dates from either the second or the first century BC, and the last
7678440	7683560	cuneiform documents to contain any mention of Gilgamesh date from around the second century.
7684840	7689960	As with most Babylonian literature, the decline and eventual extinction of cuneiform writing
7690280	7696200	saw the end of the epic's relevance, and from this point onwards, it was lost for more than
7696200	7702440	2,000 years. Its most well-known copies were lost even earlier, remaining sealed in the
7702440	7708200	Burnt Library of Ashurbanipal after the fall of Ninef to a combined force of Medes, Babylonians,
7708200	7715960	and Scythians in the year 612 BC. Ironically, it is this baking process that may well have
7715960	7721240	served to preserve the tablets, and allowed their fragments to survive until their rediscovery by
7721240	7728840	Hormwood's Rassam in the early 1850s. Even then, however, Gilgamesh himself remained an obscure
7728840	7733880	figure, and the publicity surrounding George's initial translation of the epic was almost entirely
7733880	7739800	focused on the flood narrative contained within Tablet 11. What didn't help matters was that the
7739800	7743720	highly fragmentary state of the available materials at the time meant that the initial
7743720	7748200	translations of the epic of Gilgamesh, or Isdubar as he was mistakenly known,
7748200	7751000	bore little resemblance to the epic that we know today.
7752600	7756280	Over time, however, more and more fragments of the epic were unearthed,
7756280	7760680	resulting in a series of increasingly accurate translations in the early 20th century
7760680	7766120	by scholars such as Peter Jensen, Alexander Heidel, Ephraim Spaser, and Noah Cramer.
7767400	7771880	After the end of World War II, awareness of the Gilgamesh epic also began to grow
7771880	7779080	beyond the realms of academia. In the UK, Douglas Jeffrey Bridson's 1953 radio play,
7779080	7784760	The Quest of Gilgamesh, helped to popularize an adapted version of the epic to the general public.
7784760	7789800	Whilst in post-war Germany, the ruined cities, huge death toll, and population movements of the
7789800	7795320	post-war period drew comparisons to the epic by a series of celebrated poets and novelists.
7796680	7801160	Around this time, authors also began to take note of the homoerotic elements in Gilgamesh
7801160	7806200	and Enkidu's relationship, and a long literary trend began depicting the two as lovers.
7807480	7812120	From the 1960s, Gilgamesh would continue to reach a yet larger audience,
7812120	7816600	and in the 60 years since, he has appeared in almost every artistic medium possible.
7818120	7822440	Obviously, a full discussion of all of Gilgamesh's appearances in popular culture
7822440	7827240	is more than this video can hope to achieve. But perhaps the best summary of Gilgamesh's
7827240	7832040	modern role is given by Theodor Zyorkowski in his work, Gilgamesh Among Us.
7833400	7837000	Here he wrote that Gilgamesh has achieved something few other mythic figures have
7837000	7842360	accomplished, by establishing himself simply as a name or character, often independent from the
7842360	7848360	epic itself. The result is that there are few people in western culture to whom he is entirely
7848360	7855800	unfamiliar, even if the epic itself is unknown to them. So as we end here today, we can say with
7855800	7860520	confidence that whether or not an actual Gilgamesh ever existed, his name and exploits have managed
7860520	7865800	to live on in popular culture, long after those of Mesopotamia's greatest monarchs have been all
7865800	7871960	but forgotten. And looking back now, millennia after the society that composed his epic has
7871960	7878600	vanished from the face of the earth, it seems that his quest to overcome death may not have been so futile, after all.
