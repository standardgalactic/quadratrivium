1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,880
By the middle of the 7th century BC, northern Mesopotamia had become the heartland of the

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,440
largest state the world had ever seen. Known today as the Neo-Assyrian Empire, its control

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,720
stretched throughout Mesopotamia, Syria, the Levant, and even as far north as Anatolia.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,400
In the west, its territory ran as far as Egypt, whilst in the east its rule held sway over

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,160
Sousa and parts of the Zagros Mountains. At its peak, it was ruled by a king named Ashubanipal

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,320
who would tout his military prowess and conquests in inscriptions scattered throughout his realm.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,760
In the centre of his palace, he built a great library that eventually grew to include some

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,800
30,000 clay tablets and that attracted scribes from the four corners of the known world.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,680
In modern times, this library is often seen by scholars as Ashubanipal's crowning achievement

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,320
and its remains provide a vivid snapshot into the world that he and his dynasty inhabited.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Yet as grand and ancient as Ashubanipal and his empire might seem to us now,

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,640
contained amongst the tablets of his library was the story of another king who had already

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,960
been famous throughout Mesopotamia for millennia. In the epic that bore his name, he ruled over

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,320
the great metropolis of Uruk, the son of a goddess and a mortal man possessed of strength and stature

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,240
beyond all others. His exploits took him the length and breadth of Mesopotamia and saw him

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,120
contend with monsters, gods, and his own mortality alike. So great was his quest to thwart death

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,360
that it even took him beyond the lands of mortal men to meet the immortal survivor

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,920
of a worldwide flood and event that still echoes in modern religions to this day.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,120
Since the very dawn of writing, he'd provided an ideal of kingship that surpassed all others

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,120
and achieved a fame beyond almost any of his successors. Ashubanipal would prove no exception.

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,000
By the end of that same century, his dynasty would be extinct, his library buried and forgotten.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,440
The great tablets that held this story remain sealed within its ruins for another two millennia,

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,560
waiting patiently for the day when they would be rediscovered. From that day,

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,440
the exploits of this legendary king would draw the attention of a worldwide audience

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,040
and once again one of the world's oldest known stories would be told.

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,840
The Epic of Gilgamesh

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,840
The Epic of Gilgamesh

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Since its rediscovery at the tail end of the 19th century,

29
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,920
the Epic of Gilgamesh has inspired excitement among scholars and the general public alike.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,720
Originally unearthed amongst the ruins of the library of Ashubanipal,

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,360
the discovery of its tablets came amidst a period of newfound interest in both archaeology

32
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,600
and early human history. Its deciphering would inspire headlines in newspapers on both sides

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,760
of the Atlantic, with this publicity being overwhelmingly centred on the flood story

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,960
contained within one of its tablets. In succeeding decades, knowledge of the

35
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,120
Epic itself grew amongst the wider public. Soon it became recognised that in the exploits of

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Gilgamesh lay the blueprints of those of many later mythical figures, including those of Heracles

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,640
and the heroes of the Homeric poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Much like these later heroes, Gilgamesh's restless spirit would take into what were then

39
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,760
the very edges of the known world, to the cedar forest in what is now modern Lebanon

40
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,360
and Syria, throughout the land of Babylonia and south to the land of Dilman in the Persian Gulf.

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,200
Throughout these travels, he was joined by his faithful companion, Enkidu,

42
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,760
who he loved as he would a wife, and whose death at the hands of the eternal gods would

43
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,560
drive his own quest to fort death. Today these central themes of companionship, love,

44
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,440
and the human struggle against mortality continue to resonate, and Gilgamesh himself

45
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,720
has taken on a life outside of the Epic, often appearing as a character far removed from his

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,360
earliest roots. Even then, to many he remains inseparable from the Babylonian Epic that bears

47
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,320
his name, which this day holds the status of a foundational work in world literature.

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,760
But what is perhaps less known, is that this work is far from Gilgamesh's first appearance

49
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,000
in Mesopotamian myth. In fact, by the time the most famous version of his Epic was composed

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,360
in the late 2nd millennium BC, knowledge of his name and exploits was already more than a thousand

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,520
years old. Long before Babylon was even a city, there is evidence that Gilgamesh's name was

52
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,800
being sung at the courts of the later Sumerian kings, where a rich body of hymns and poems

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,320
were composed to celebrate his feats and virtues. And before even these works were created, we know

54
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,760
that objects were being dedicated in Gilgamesh's honour right back to the precipice of prehistory,

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,800
and as heroic figures performing deeds resembling his own appear in some of the earliest artwork

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,000
of the 3rd millennium BC. And it is here in the hazy world of the earliest kings of Mesopotamia

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,480
that some scholars have even argued that a historical figure may have existed,

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,760
whose life and deeds formed a core ideal of kingship around which the literary Epic was crafted.

59
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,680
So who was Gilgamesh? How did the Epic that bears his name come to be? Was there a historical

60
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,520
king of Uruk who bore his name, whose reputation later offers built upon to craft a more familiar

61
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Epic? And outside of Gilgamesh himself, how did the famous flood myth become part of the Epic?

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,720
In this video, we'll explore these questions by examining more than 2,000 years of history.

63
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,320
We'll start by familiarising ourselves with the setting of Gilgamesh's exploits,

64
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,040
the Mesopotamian society at the 3rd millennium BC. We'll take a look at what evidence exists for

65
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,240
a historical king bearing his name, along with his earliest appearances in the inscriptions of the

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,480
period. From here, we'll track the development of the Epic from its earliest origins among some of

67
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,240
the world's first empires, through to the standardised text of the late 2nd millennium BC.

68
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,400
Along the way, we'll also examine how Mesopotamia itself changed during the millennia of its existence,

69
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,280
and examine what parallels can be drawn between it and the society in which it originated.

70
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,440
Finally, we'll examine the origins of an event with which the Epic is inexorably tied,

71
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:25,400
the Mesopotamian flood myth, the discovery of which brought the Epic to worldwide attention.

72
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,160
But before we do any of this, let us begin with the story itself.

73
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,320
For those unfamiliar with Gilgamesh and his appearances in Mesopotamian myth,

74
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,880
here's a quick summary of the Epic for which he is known.

75
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,480
In its story, Gilgamesh is the ruler of Uruk, the son of a mortal king named Lugar Banda,

76
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,240
and of the goddess Ninsun. Possessed of superhuman size and strength, Gilgamesh

77
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,440
reigns as a tyrant over the city, exhausting its men and taking its women into his bed.

78
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,280
As punishment for abusing his subjects, the gods craft an opponent who is his equal,

79
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,760
the wild man Enkidu. After initially residing in the steppe, where he grazes alongside wild

80
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,080
animals, Enkidu is discovered by a hunter, then civilised through intercourse with the

81
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,480
temple prostitute, Shamhat. After adopting human dress and manners, he travels to Uruk

82
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,600
in order to confront Gilgamesh, where the two wrestle in the streets until the very houses of

83
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,320
the city shake. Eventually, however, the two cease their battle, and Enkidu instead becomes

84
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,680
Gilgamesh's dearest friend, who he loves as he would a wife and who he frequently refers to

85
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,880
as the axe by his side. After this, a restless Gilgamesh then proposes a journey to the cedar

86
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,080
forest in honour of the sun god Shamash, where he intends to slay its monstrous guardian,

87
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Humbaba. With Shamash's help, the two journey to the forest and overcome Humbaba,

88
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,120
then construct a raft from the cedar trees to return to Uruk. On arriving back in the city,

89
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,640
Gilgamesh then draws the eye of the goddess of love, Ishtar, who rejects her offer of marriage

90
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,120
due to her mistreatment of her former suitors. Angered by Gilgamesh's refusal, Ishtar then

91
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,720
forces her father Anu to unleash the mighty bull of heaven, which devastates Uruk and its people.

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,520
Together, Gilgamesh and Enkidu overcome this bull, whose horns Gilgamesh dedicates to his

93
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,360
father, Lugalbanda, whilst Enkidu tears off the bull's right haunch and hurls it in Ishtar's face.

94
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,880
As peace seems to have been restored to Uruk, Enkidu has a dream of a gathering of the gods,

95
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,680
in which the great gods Anu and Enlil decree that for the crimes of slaying both the bull

96
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,440
and Humbaba, Enkidu must die. Struck down by the gods, Enkidu curses the hunter and the

97
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,040
prostitute who civilised him from his deathbed, only to be rebuked by Shamash, who reminds him

98
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,200
of all the good he has experienced in life because of the two.

99
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,760
After Enkidu's death, so great is Gilgamesh's grief that he refuses to leave his side for

100
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,360
six days and seven nights, only permitting his friend's body to be buried after a maggot dropped

101
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,280
from its nose. In his mourning for his lost brother, Gilgamesh tears out his hair and

102
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,040
clothes himself in the skins of wild animals, then erects a grand statue in tribute to Enkidu.

103
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Now fearful of his own death, Gilgamesh sets out to find his ancestor, Utnapishtim, and his wife,

104
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,840
who we are told were granted immortality by the gods. Traveling to the Twin Peaks of Mount Mashu

105
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,360
at the ends of the earth, he finds a tunnel that no mortal has entered, guarded by a scorpion man

106
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,440
and his wife. Ignoring the man's warnings, he proceeds through the darkness of the tunnel,

107
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,200
eventually emerging in a fertile land known as the Garden of the Gods.

108
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,320
After killing a group of lions and dressing himself in their skins, he recounts his tale to

109
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,040
an alewife, who directs him to Utnapishtim's boatman, Urshibani. After Gilgamesh has first

110
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,000
destroyed the enigmatic stone ones that allowed Urshibani to travel across the waters of death

111
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,640
to Utnapishtim, the boatman instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and to fashion them into poles.

112
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,080
Crossing the waters, they arrive at a place known as the mouth of the rivers,

113
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,160
where Utnapishtim and his wife live. After observing Utnapishtim and finding him much

114
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,800
the same as himself, Gilgamesh asks him how he came to receive immortality,

115
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,360
and Utnapishtim tells him of the great flood sent by the gods to drown mankind.

116
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,960
As a survivor of this flood, Utnapishtim was granted immortality by the king of the gods,

117
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,680
Enlil, who placed him to live at the mouth of the rivers.

118
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Utnapishtim then offers Gilgamesh his own chance at immortality, if only he can stay awake for

119
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,440
seven days and nights. Despite his best efforts, Gilgamesh soon falls asleep,

120
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,720
waking to discover that seven days have passed, as shown by the bread rations that Utnapishtim's

121
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,760
wife has left by his side. Despite Gilgamesh's failure, Utnapishtim gives him another test,

122
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,120
sending Gilgamesh in search of a special plant from the ocean floor that will rejuvenate anyone

123
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,760
who consumes it. Gilgamesh succeeds in retrieving the plant, only for it to be stolen by a serpent

124
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,480
whilst he bathes. Disheartened by his failure, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, where the main body

125
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,120
of the epic ends, with him marveling to a shabbani at the great city wall he has built.

126
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,800
Then in a final, somewhat tacked-on tablet, Gilgamesh sends an inexplicably alive Enkidu to

127
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,560
retrieve a toy from the Neverworld, only for him to be captured by the dead. With the help of

128
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,920
the god Shamash, Gilgamesh then raises Enkidu's shade to the land above, which then informs him

129
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,360
of the grim conditions of the underworld, and of Gilgamesh's future role as the judge of the dead.

130
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,880
So we now have a general idea of the epic's content.

131
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,240
But if we are to understand the context of the events that it depicts, along with the timeline of

132
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,400
its wider development, we will also need to familiarise ourselves with its setting,

133
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,880
the Mesopotamian world of the third millennium BC. For it is in this period that not only is the

134
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,640
epic itself set, but that we can also be reasonably sure that any historical Gilgamesh would also

135
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,560
have reigned. And in examining this world, we will gain an understanding not only of its society

136
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,880
and wider geography, but we will also see the underlying motivations of its characters.

137
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,960
Let us begin then. Towards the end of the previous millennium,

138
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,640
this region had seen the emergence of the world's first known cities throughout the

139
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,280
plains of southern and central Mesopotamia. Of these by far the largest was the mega site of Uruk,

140
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,760
which appears to have exerted a strong cultural influence over the other growing centres of the

141
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,800
Alluvial plain, along with major economic influence throughout much of the ancient Middle East.

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,480
As with the other settlements of the region, life in Uruk revolved around the hierarchies

143
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,920
of its monumental temple districts, each of which were dedicated to the cult of a major deity.

144
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,280
In addition to their role in the religious life of these settlements, these districts appeared

145
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,520
to have acted as distribution centres for a portion of the city's populace, with their

146
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,320
dedicated work being rewarded with fixed amounts of rations. It is also in the context of this system

147
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,200
that the world's earliest known written script, Protokinaeiform, appears to have emerged.

148
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,520
This early writing consisted of a complex system of signs,

149
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,240
impressed onto clay tablets with a reed stylus, that were used at Uruk and other sites throughout

150
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,080
the Middle East to administrate their complex temple hierarchies. By far the majority of these

151
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,200
tablets were used to record the receipt of goods by the temple, such as grain, dairy products,

152
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,040
and textiles, along with their distribution to its attendant workforce. The remaining tablets

153
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,840
consist of long lists of objects, places, and animals, and there is no evidence at this early

154
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,080
date for writing menus in anything other than an administrative context. This Uruk-inferenced

155
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:25,480
trade system continued until around the years 3200-3100 BC, when it appears to have faltered.

156
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,320
The exact cause of its collapse is still uncertain, although it is possible that it coincided with

157
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,280
a change in the local climate that saw much of the Middle East become both drier and colder than

158
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,520
in the previous millennium. Whatever its cause, the result was that Mesopotamian influence became

159
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,240
restricted to the alluvial plain. In places such as Syria, the Levant, and the Iranian Poteau,

160
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,280
we see the abandonment of Protokinaeiform writing and a resurgence of local pottery styles.

161
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,760
Mesopotamia itself entered the period known as the Gemdet Nasser, characterised by a change from

162
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,800
the manufacture of more plain styles of pottery to that of painted pottery with a distinctive purple

163
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,720
colouring. Other than this pottery, however, the Gemdet Nasser appears to have gladly continued

164
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,880
the practices of the preceding Uruk period. Protokinaeiform writing also continued to be

165
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,360
developed throughout this time, and we know from lists of city names dating to this period

166
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,160
that the individual settlements of the Mesopotamian plain were already engaged in complex political

167
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,360
and economic relationships with one another. A common religious system may also have been

168
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,200
in place throughout the region, with its focus being the city of Uruk. This is demonstrated by

169
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,920
tablets and clay ceilings that have been interpreted as offerings, presented from other settlements

170
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,920
to its goddess Inanna, also known under her later name Abishtar.

171
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,320
Compared to the Uruk period before it, the Gemdet Nasser appears to have been short-lived,

172
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,840
to the point where there is still some debate as to whether it should be considered a separate

173
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,960
archaeological period at all. By comparison, its successor, the early dynastic period,

174
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,360
would last for much of the third millennium BC, and saw the rise of one of the world's most

175
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:29,240
iconic early civilisations, the Sumerians. Throughout the early part of this period,

176
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,880
we begin to see increasing growth of individual settlements into major urban centres throughout

177
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,840
both southern and central Mesopotamia. While Uruk remained a key player in the politics of the region,

178
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,840
it now had to compete with other prominent city-states such as Ur, Lagash, Uma and Kish,

179
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,360
each of which controlled varying degrees of territory. Generally speaking, the influence

180
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,200
of each of these cities was limited to its surrounding agricultural land, which would

181
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,920
have stretched in a narrow band along either the river Euphrates or the Tigris for an average of

182
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,560
10 to 15 kilometres in either direction. Between them lay a patchwork mosaic of alluvial deserts,

183
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,760
resource-rich swamps and marshland, and patches of less-inhabited steppe that were often used

184
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,600
for seasonal grazing. Each city also seems to have become recognised as a dwelling place of a

185
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,720
number of gods and goddesses that were joined into a more unified pantheon, and at an unclear

186
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,600
point the centre of Mesopotamian religion transferred from the cult of Inanna to Uruk,

187
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:35,240
to the cult of Enlil at Nipur. Inside the cities themselves, the temple authorities that dominated

188
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,200
vertical and economic life throughout the Uruk period also remained, though increasingly their

189
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,560
power was counterbalanced by a new group of figures under the titles of Em, Ensi and Lugal.

190
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,640
Commonly referred to as kings by modern archaeologists, how exactly these figures emerged

191
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,280
is still a source of contention, but it seems that from an early date, these figures combined

192
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,360
military power with important political and religious roles within the city.

193
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,120
Alongside the emergence of these figures, this period is also characterised by increased

194
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,520
military activity between these states, as shown by the appearance of widespread city

195
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,240
fortifications throughout the first half of the early dynastic period. Alongside these changes,

196
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,200
many of the basic blueprints of Mesopotamian society established in the preceding Uruk period

197
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,320
continued to be refined upon throughout the third millennium BC.

198
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,480
Agriculture continued to depend on the careful management of water supplied by the Euphrates

199
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,960
and the Tigris, and crop irrigation seems to become ever more important as the climate

200
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,280
in the region slowly dried out. Administration and trade was still performed using cylinder seals,

201
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,800
small round objects carved with inlaid scenes that could be impressed onto wet clay as an identifier.

202
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,120
Later, these objects would also take on an important role in the correspondence between

203
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,760
different city-states and rulers, whose relationships grew more complex and formalised.

204
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,760
Kinéaform writing also evolved to take on similar roles, slowly losing many of its

205
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,000
pictographic qualities in favour of both syllabic and phonetic elements,

206
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,760
along with a more developed system of grammar. The result is that unlike the earlier Proto-Kinéaform

207
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,600
tablets, to which we are largely unable to assign a language, this later script is clearly

208
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,200
recognisable as Sumerian, a language spoken by people of Southern Mesopotamia during this period.

209
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,960
And from around the middle of the early dynastic period, we also see the increasing use of royal

210
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,920
inscriptions throughout the region, the names of kings being inscribed on objects such as stone

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:47,240
vessels, stelae and votive offerings. So now that we have some understanding of the society

212
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,720
in which the epic is set, let us ask our first question. Is there any evidence for a historical

213
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,360
monarch that dates from this period behind the later literary figure of Gilgamesh?

214
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Understandably, this question draws a mixed response from archaeologists and scholars of the

215
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,040
period. To paraphrase Professor Piotr Mikhailovsky, for some the search for a historical Gilgamesh

216
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,600
is a serious enterprise, whilst for others, it is equivalent to the quest to discover the

217
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,080
real King Arthur, the Powered in Roland or the Abominable Snowman. A few scholars such as Max

218
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,040
Malawan, Barry Powell and Stephanie Daly have been willing to entertain the idea that a monarch

219
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,040
carrying this name could have reigned at Uruk somewhere between 2800 and 2600 BC,

220
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,880
with these arguments being based on later literary accounts and a small number of

221
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,640
contemporary inscriptions. On the whole, however, most archaeologists agree that there is no way

222
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,280
to prove the existence of such a king using the evidence that we have at our disposal,

223
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,560
and that as such he is best treated as a purely mythical figure.

224
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,400
And looking at the excavations that have been carried out at Uruk, it is easy to see why many

225
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,240
have drawn that conclusion. In the collection of stories in which he features, Gilgamesh is

226
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,440
intimately associated with the central ritual districts of Uruk, the Ayanna and the Kulab,

227
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,360
both of which have been extensively excavated. If such a figure did exist, then it is in these

228
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,640
districts that we may expect to find some evidence for his existence, especially as a possible dating

229
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,520
to around the 27th century BC, roughly overlapped with the appearance of the earliest known royal

230
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,000
inscriptions in southern Mesopotamia. Unfortunately for us, however, no evidence of any writing or

231
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,680
inscriptions have been found at the city dating from this period. Indeed, there is also little

232
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,840
evidence for monumental building at the center of Uruk during this time. The one exception to this

233
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,560
can be found in the Ayanna district, where the third millennium BC is marked by the development

234
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,800
of a number of enigmatic structures that culminated in its final centuries in a large

235
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,280
cigarette dedicated to the goddess in Ayanna. Outside of these structures, two possible explanations

236
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,840
have been proposed, the lack of evidence for monumental building here in the early dynastic

237
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,840
period. The first is that extensive parts of the complex may well have been destroyed or damaged

238
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,520
by a later invasion that we know took place somewhere between the 24th and the 23rd century BC.

239
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,440
The second and better attested theory is that many old structures in this era could have been

240
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,720
destroyed during its remodeling by a later king named Ur-Namu, whose name can be found

241
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,400
inscribed on the Ziggurat's bricks. Either way, what is clear is that there is no evidence of

242
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Gilgamesh to be found in the central districts of Uruk itself. But there is another monumental

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,600
feature at Uruk that is famously associated with Gilgamesh and whose first construction

244
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,360
would be credited to him in the earliest literary texts in which he features, the Great Wall of

245
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,680
Uruk. Constructed in a period when Uruk was nearing its peak size, this vast fortification

246
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:59,960
stretches for over 9 kilometers and encircles an area of over 500 hectares. Built from fired mud

247
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,480
bricks, the wall itself averages 9 meters thick in most areas and its surrounding complex measures

248
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,280
some 40 meters in width. Embedded inside it are a vast system of buttresses, towers and entrance

249
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,920
ways, along with inlets and outlets for the city's canals. This wall is certainly impressive

250
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,160
and its construction does correlate with a period when the city was known to be both large

251
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,480
and powerful. But unfortunately, only limited excavations of its sections have been carried out

252
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,360
and what work has been done has found no evidence at all to connect its construction to Gilgamesh.

253
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,880
Whilst later kings are known to have placed votive objects inscribed with their names within the

254
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,920
foundations of their major building projects, no such objects have been found beneath the excavated

255
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,200
parts of Uruk's wall, leaving us unable to connect its construction to any historical figure.

256
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,680
The exact dating of the wall is also uncertain, though most archaeologists place its construction

257
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,400
at the beginning of the early dynastic period, which may well be too early for most estimates

258
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,600
of historical Gilgamesh's reign. So if there was a historical Gilgamesh, there is no evidence of

259
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,640
him to be found at his namesake city, nor at any other centre throughout Mesopotamia during the

260
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,640
first half of the early dynastic period. Instead, if we wish to find his earliest attestations,

261
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,880
we have to skip forward by a couple of centuries. It is here, as we enter the later part of the

262
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,160
early dynastic period, that Gilgamesh's name is first found under its Sumerian spelling of

263
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,640
Bilgamesh, nearly a half a millennium for his first known literary appearance.

264
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,160
Here he appears not as a king, but as part of a list of gods unearthed at the site of Shoropak

265
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,960
that dates from roughly the 26th to the 25th century BC. Whilst he receives no special treatment on

266
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,920
this list, his placing already seems to show an association with Arukh, as the entry above his

267
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,680
reads Suladu Kulab, or Road Facing Kulab, referring to one of the city's central districts.

268
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,360
Beyond this god's list, we also find more information regarding Gilgamesh appearing

269
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,480
in a small number of inscriptions dedicated to him that date from around the 24th century BC.

270
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,840
One such inscription is preserved on a ceremonial stone mace head of unknown providence that were

271
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,440
frequently made as votive offerings to a particular god or goddess. To quote its text,

272
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:49,000
From this inscription, we can conclude a few details to complement the limited information

273
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,840
given in the gods list. For a start, whilst we know that Gilgamesh was clearly regarded as a god

274
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,720
during this period, and even the recipient of votive offerings, we also see him named here as

275
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,840
a king of men, an inclusion that may reflect his dual nature and his later literary appearances.

276
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,680
Secondly, we see the first mention of his divine parentage, specific with that he is the son of

277
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,840
the goddess Ninsu Moon, later known under her familiar name of Ninsun.

278
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,160
Finally, from his earliest attestations, we see that Gilgamesh is already being associated with

279
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,520
idealized epithets of Mesopotamian kingship, with his title of the strong one being frequently

280
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,200
adopted by kings in the late 3rd millennium BC. These two texts raise an interesting possibility.

281
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,480
As Gilgamesh's earliest attestations in this period are as a god rather than a king,

282
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,200
are we to assume that he began his existence as a deity, only later being given a historical

283
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,200
background as a king of Uruk? This is certainly a possibility, but we should also note that the

284
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,680
Macehead inscription does directly refer to him as a king of men. An additional factor that we can

285
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,000
conclude from these early inscriptions is that whilst some of Gilgamesh's later attributes are

286
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,560
already present, there is little evidence of him being associated with many of the deeds we will

287
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,400
see in the later epic. This is also reflected in the small group of literary texts that have

288
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,320
come down to us from the early dynastic period. These texts are largely limited to those that

289
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,360
have been excavated from the city of Abu Salabik in central Mesopotamia along with those found

290
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,160
at both Mari and Ebla in modern Syria. The archaic and often fragmentary nature of these texts makes

291
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,120
them difficult to comprehend and understanding is often reliant on the existence of a later copy

292
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,880
of the same text in a more readable script. Examples of this include a wisdom text,

293
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,960
known as the instructions of Shuropak, later versions of which are addressed from the city's

294
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,880
eponymous king, to his son, Ziosudra, along with a number of hymns and other mythological texts.

295
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,480
By far the most significant of these texts for our purposes, however, is a fragment of a

296
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,080
mythological tale of the love-making between the mortal hero Lugalbanda and the goddess Ninsun,

297
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,600
which some scholars have attempted to relate to the birth of Gilgamesh.

298
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,760
However, according to a seriologist, Andrew R. George, at no point does this name appear in the

299
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,560
tale, and indeed the state of the fragment is such that even the idea of it referring to a birth

300
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,240
remains unproven. As we will soon see, there are also good reasons to doubt that Lugalbanda

301
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,640
was considered Gilgamesh's father at this early date. In addition to this text, two others from

302
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,360
Abu Salabik have also been claimed to mention Gilgamesh himself, although the validity of

303
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,600
these claims remains controversial. Moving beyond what written evidence we have available,

304
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,800
it is also often noted that figures resembling both Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu frequently

305
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,360
appear in Mesopotamian artwork dating to the early dynastic period. Indeed, we frequently see heroic

306
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,320
figures portrayed on cylinder seals and carvings from this period, often being depicted in forms

307
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,960
of heroic nudity and wrestling with animals such as lions and bulls. This latter motif,

308
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,600
known as the master of animals, is a common one throughout the region and is known to date back

309
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,760
to at least the 7th millennium BC. It is certainly possible that these figures represent events from

310
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,720
the later epic, particularly Gilgamesh's contention with either the bull of heaven or his later

311
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,840
encounter with a group of lions whose skin he clothes himself in during his search for immortality.

312
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,120
Unfortunately for us, however, we have no examples of direct inscriptions naming either Gilgamesh

313
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,840
or Enkidu alongside these works, and it is entirely possible that they depict other

314
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,800
heroic figures from the period, or that they simply represent more generic heroic archetypes.

315
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,720
So from what we've covered here, we can conclude that to the people of early dynastic Mesopotamia,

316
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,600
Gilgamesh was known as a god worthy of dedications, as a king of men, and that his name was associated

317
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,160
with at least one of the epithets given to later rulers. But outside of this, we have no clear

318
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,800
evidence that he was ever a historical king of Uruk, or that he was a fixture in the literature of

319
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,600
this time. At this point, we could easily abandon our search for a historical Gilgamesh and assign

320
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,760
him purely to the realm of mythology. However, in doing so, we would be ignoring a small amount

321
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,800
of indirect evidence, as a number of scholars have pointed to as at least leaving his existence

322
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,840
an open question. And to observe this evidence, we must leave the world of early dynastic Sumer behind

323
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,320
and examine social and political developments within central and southern Mesopotamia,

324
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,480
right at the end of the third millennium BC. Unlike the largely fragmented city-states that

325
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,280
characterised the region for much of the previous millennium, the centuries ahead would see periodic

326
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,920
unifications of the region under a single ruler. Prior to the rise of its first lasting empire,

327
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,480
there had been a number of erstwhile conquerors of Mesopotamia, but none of them appears to have

328
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,240
succeeded in subduing land far beyond the south, or in passing their conquests on to a successor.

329
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,240
It would take until the 24th century BC before a king would establish a lasting empire,

330
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,400
encompassing most of Mesopotamia. And when it happened, its founder would not be a Sumerian,

331
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,080
but an Akkadian.

332
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,160
The Akkadians were a group of peoples from central Mesopotamia, a region that itself came to be

333
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,160
referred to as Akkad. Unlike their Sumerian neighbours, they spoke a Semitic language,

334
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,120
known as Akkadia, but otherwise they shared many cultural similarities and worshipped a similar

335
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:45,240
pantheon of gods under differing names. As with the Sumerians, their exact origin point is uncertain,

336
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,000
but we do know that they were present in the region from at least the beginning of the third

337
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,600
millennium BC, as shown by the appearance of Akkadian names in the earliest Cuneiform texts.

338
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,560
And in the 24th century BC, it was a man from this region who would build what has been described

339
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,880
as the world's first empire. Known as Sargon, later literary descriptions would cast him as

340
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,680
a cup-bearer, the king of Kish, or even a simple labourer in the palace gardens.

341
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,520
At an unknown point, he appears to have risen to power in central Mesopotamia,

342
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,360
after which he invaded the south and subdued the Sumerian city-sates.

343
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,680
In doing so, he deposed another aspiring conqueror, a king by the name of Lugauzergezi,

344
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,560
who had recently subdued much of Sumer and led him in a neck-stock to the temple at Nipper.

345
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,920
With the two regions now under his control, he established his capital at the city of Akkad,

346
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,000
also known as Agade, which he either founded or greatly expanded.

347
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,280
Finally, he succeeded in doing something that no previous ruler had done,

348
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,400
and passed on this empire intact to his successors.

349
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,280
This Akkadian empire would persist for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak in the 23rd

350
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,000
century BC, under Sargon's grandson, Narum Sin.

351
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,840
If we are to believe inscriptions from his long reign, then Narum Sin succeeded in expanding

352
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,560
the empire to the state of Elam and the peoples of the Zagros Mountains to the east,

353
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
and as far west as the states of the eastern Mediterranean.

354
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,440
Exactly how much of this westward conquest was rooted in propaganda is uncertain,

355
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,760
for all we know it may simply have been a successful raiding party to the region.

356
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,600
Either way, this success led Narum Sin to take on unprecedented titles,

357
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,880
including King of the Four Quarters and King of the Universe.

358
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,680
Eventually, he was no longer content to simply rule as a mortal,

359
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,560
and in a famous victory stele dating from his reign,

360
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,520
he is depicted standing above his men as a giant, crowned with the horned helmet of a god.

361
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:58,360
Narum Sin's reign would bring the Akkadian empire to its greatest extent,

362
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,680
but it also proved to be its high watermark.

363
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,960
Exactly how intact the empire was towards the end of his reign is uncertain,

364
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,280
but after his death, it quickly collapsed, with possible causes being the combined

365
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,120
stress of a major drought known as the 4.2-kilow year event,

366
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,120
and a series of invasions of a group of peoples from the Zagros Mountains to the east.

367
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,080
What follows was an archaeologically obscure period that lasted for most of the 22nd century BC,

368
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,960
during which these invaders, known as the Gutians,

369
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,200
appeared to have exercised a loose hegemony over the other cities of the Alluvial Plain.

370
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,760
Then, at the end of this period, we are told from inscriptional evidence

371
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,880
that the invaders were ejected from Sumer by a confederation of cities led by Utu Hengal,

372
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,320
the King of Uruk. Utu Hengal would not survive his victory for long, however,

373
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,760
and in the ensuing power vacuum, it would be his relative Ur-Namu,

374
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,200
the governor of Ur, who would succeed in establishing the second major unified state of Mesopotamia.

375
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,240
Known as the Third Dynasty of Ur, or the Neo-Sumerian Empire,

376
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,520
this state would resurrect the status of Uruk as a major centre for the worship of the Goddess in Ana,

377
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,920
and embark on an ambitious cigarette building programme throughout southern Mesopotamia.

378
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,320
Initially restricted to the regions of Sumer and Akkad,

379
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,480
this empire would expand eastwards, beginning with the reign of Ur-Namu successor,

380
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,280
Shulgi, coming to dominate the neighbouring region of Elan, and what is now southwest in Iran.

381
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,080
Whilst the resulting state was less far-reaching than the Akkadian Empire,

382
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,680
it appears to have been more internally centralised, consisting of a carefully

383
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,080
administered core in Mesopotamia, which maintained a system of diplomatic contacts

384
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,280
with the periphery beyond. Shulgi and his successors would go on to adopt the divine

385
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,480
kingship of Narap Sin, with Shulgi himself demonstrating a special reverence for Gilgamesh,

386
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,160
who he frequently named in his hymns. Finally, the royal court of Ur also appears to have

387
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,640
established a uniform writing system within its borders, establishing and sponsoring new

388
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,400
scribal schools in the process. It is in these scribal schools that we see a new period of

389
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,680
creativity in Sumerian literature, along with the appearance of the first documents to shed light

390
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,200
on what the peoples of southern Mesopotamia considered their history.

391
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,480
And it is also through the lens of these documents that we see what some have argued

392
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,640
is evidence for Gilgamesh's existence.

393
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,440
By far the most famous of these documents is known to us as the Sumerian Kinglist,

394
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,840
a collection of manuscripts outlining the supposed history of the kings of Sumer,

395
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,280
the earliest version of which dates back to the Ur III period.

396
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,760
Later versions of this document detail the descent of the divine kingship of Sumer from the heavens,

397
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,160
through an unbroken line of rulers, first to the city of Eridu in the south,

398
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,080
then to the city of Kish after a great flood had swept across the land.

399
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,960
After 23 kings had reigned in Kish, the city was defeated by Uruk and the kingship taken to the

400
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:07,000
Iana district. In this list Gilgamesh is presented as a member of the first dynasty of Uruk,

401
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,120
with his name being followed by the epithet Lord of the Kulab.

402
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,080
Interestingly his father is listed here not as Lugalbanda, but instead as a phantom or a demon,

403
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,560
and his immediate predecessor is given as the god of shepherds and fertility to Muzed.

404
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,120
For some time after its discovery many scholars considered this list to have a degree of usefulness

405
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,440
as a source of information on Mesopotamian history, as least in the abstract.

406
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,200
Over time however a greater awareness of its flaws has developed and it is clear that the

407
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,480
kings list existed less as an accurate chronicle of Mesopotamian rulers and more as a form of

408
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,120
propaganda designed to legitimize the rule of later dynasties. For a start it presents Sumer as

409
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,400
having been ruled over by an unbroken line of kings, of only one city possessing the kingship

410
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,320
at a time. Many of its earlier rulers are also assigned reigns of an extraordinary length.

411
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,360
Gilgamesh himself is credited a reign of some 126 years and this length is dwarfed by that of the

412
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,240
pre-Fudd rulers, one of whom has assigned a rule of some 36,000 years.

413
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,960
Excavations at centres throughout southern Mesopotamia have also found ample evidence of kings who

414
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,080
exerted a wide degree of power throughout the region, yet whose names are not included on the list.

415
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,600
Finally this document also seems to have been periodically revised to take into account disputes

416
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,920
between competing city-states and dynasties. For example in its earliest versions the first

417
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,120
dynasty to receive the kingship is that of the city of Kish and a smaller number of dynasties

418
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:48,120
are listed between it and Akkad. In later copies however Kish has been demoted to the second

419
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,680
dynasty on the list, with the kingship originally dwelling at the site of Eridu for which there

420
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,320
is no evidence of a dynasty possessing hegemony over the other cities of the region.

421
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,240
Despite all these caveats there are two early rulers on this list for whom some limited

422
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,800
inscriptional evidence has been found, both of whom are named in later literary texts as

423
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:18,520
contemporaries of Gilgamesh. They consist of the final two rulers of the first dynasty of Kish

424
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,360
and appear to date from a period when the city was indeed large and prosperous.

425
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,120
The first is a king by the name of Mibarakisi, later known as N Mibarakisi,

426
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,640
but whom a small number of inscriptions have been found. In one such inscription found on a

427
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:39,640
fragment of an alabaster vessel of uncertain providence Mibarakisi is named as the king of Kish,

428
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,600
making him the earliest known Mesopotamian king whose name is verified by contemporary evidence.

429
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,120
Based on the archaic rendering of the symbol for Kish, this inscription is fought to date from

430
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,760
the first half of the early dynastic period and matches well with the hypothetical date

431
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:01,560
for a historical Gilgamesh. The second ruler on the king list associated with Gilgamesh in later

432
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,880
literary accounts is the figure of Akka or Aga, son of N Mibarakisi and the final ruler of the

433
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,640
first dynasty of Kish. Unlike N Mibarakisi we have no contemporary inscription naming Akka as a king

434
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,360
of Kish. Instead a figure who may be Akka is attested to on a single stone stele that likely

435
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,440
originated from the city of Uma in southern Mesopotamia. This stele, known as the stele of

436
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,480
Ushumgao, also dates from the first part of the early dynastic period and is fought to relate to

437
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,600
a land transaction between the priest Ushumgao and an unknown woman who is possibly his daughter.

438
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,440
Most interestingly for our purpose this stele also features a carving of a man

439
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,960
next to which is the following inscription, Akka of the Great Assembly. Whether or not this figure

440
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,960
is the Akka of the king's list and later literary texts is uncertain. If so then it would indicate

441
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,000
that Kish's hegemony during the first part of the early dynastic period ran at least as far south

442
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,640
as Uma, which is certainly a possibility. Indeed we do have an inscribed gem of unknown provenance

443
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,720
that directly names Aga as a king of Uma, although whether or not he was a king of Kish remains uncertain.

444
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,880
We also know from inscriptions as a historical king who claimed to rule Kish known as Meselim

445
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,920
held a degree of power in neighbouring Lagash and according to later traditions he may well have

446
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,840
mediated a land dispute between it and Uma. It has also been argued by Dr. Gebhardt's

447
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,480
selves that the personal name Akka was fairly rare in the early dynastic period,

448
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,800
which may lessen the chance of it being a coincidence.

449
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,160
In our final piece of indirect evidence Gilgamesh is also named alongside a list of later kings,

450
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,520
likely dating from just after the end of the Ur Free dynasty.

451
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,720
Known as the Tumal inscription this text outlines a series of rulers who are

452
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,280
credited with the building and rebuilding of various temples at the holy city of Nipur.

453
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,440
In this list Gilgamesh is credited with building the Dunon-Mun-Bura, a shrine that is known there

454
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,720
from archaeological evidence, though these excavations found no sign of any associations with this figure.

455
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,680
What is perhaps a significant however, is that in addition to the historical

456
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,960
personage of Enmi Baragisi and the possibly historical Akka, Gilgamesh is mentioned alongside

457
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,280
at least two other known kings of the southern city of Ur, Misani Pada and his son Meski Agnuna.

458
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,520
In addition to appearing on the Sumerian king list, Misani Pada is also known as a king,

459
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,320
from objects bearing his inscriptions at what may be his tomb at the royal cemetery of Ur,

460
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,240
along with an inscribed bead found at the city of Mari far to the northwest.

461
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,840
Whilst less well attested than his father, Meski Agnuna is known from a small number

462
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,680
of bull inscriptions made in his honor by his wife, in which he is named as the Lugau or king of Ur.

463
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,120
However it should also be noted that nowhere in this inscription are either of these kings named

464
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,480
as contemporaries of Gilgamesh, merely that they also dedicated various temple structures in Nipur.

465
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,080
So what can we conclude from these various inscriptions?

466
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,520
Well it seems likely that some of the figures later associated with Gilgamesh were historical

467
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,560
kings, though how much their actual deeds and lives resemble those of the later literary tales

468
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,800
is impossible to say. As such some scholars have argued that their existence at least opens the

469
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,680
possibility of Gilgamesh himself being a historical figure. Despite this we still have no definitive

470
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,440
evidence of the existence of Gilgamesh himself, and in the absence of such evidence we must consign

471
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,000
him for now to the world of myth. But as we end the hunt for a historical Gilgamesh we now begin

472
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,560
to see the literary figure emerge in earnest. For it is during the period of the Ur-free dynasty

473
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,960
that we see the first appearance of the exploits of Gilgamesh as a figure of myth,

474
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,280
along with the character that he is most commonly associated with, Enkidu.

475
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:16,440
The Neosumerian Gilgamesh corpus exists in a largely fragmentary fashion today.

476
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,240
It consists of five poems written in Sumerian, one of which has been found in two separate versions,

477
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,680
along with a small number of dedicatory hymns. Whilst we can be reasonably confident from their

478
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,960
language that they originated in the Ur-free period, only one has been found in fragmentary form

479
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,000
dating from this time, and most of these texts exist only in copies written by scribes a few

480
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,160
centuries later. Even in these later forms, two of the texts remain only partially complete.

481
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,680
What we have, however, is enough to recognise episodes of the later Babylonian Epic.

482
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,800
In the tale of Gilgamesh and Huwawa, we see a story higher resembling that of the Cedar Forest

483
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,640
incident, though with both a different inciting reason and location.

484
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,600
In this story, the eponymous king proposes an expedition to the Cedar Forests of the Zagros

485
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:15,400
Mountains in order to achieve lasting fame for himself after his death. After amassing a company

486
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,520
of young men to aid them, Gilgamesh and Enkidu cross seven-fold mountain ranges before finally

487
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,840
finding a tree that matches their requirements. After cutting the tree into logs, they anger the

488
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,960
forest's protector, a monstrous figure known as Huwawa, who knocks both Gilgamesh and Enkidu

489
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,680
unconscious with one of his auras. Eventually, Enkidu awakens and manages to rouse Gilgamesh,

490
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,920
who swears revenge on his assailant. Together, the two trick Huwawa into forming a marriage alliance

491
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,040
with two of Gilgamesh's sisters, and in the process of exchanging marital gifts, they rob him of

492
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,760
his auras, now conceptualised as great Cedar trees. After the Guardian has been rendered helpless,

493
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,800
Gilgamesh considers letting him live, but Enkidu cuts his throat after warning the two

494
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,440
would never see home again if he was allowed to live. With this done, Gilgamesh and his men

495
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:15,160
cut his auras into logs and return home. There they offer Huwawa's head to the great god Enlil,

496
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,120
who angrily berates them for their actions, before distributing his auras throughout the land.

497
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,400
In the second Gilgamesh tale, we soon we see a precursor to one of Gilgamesh's other famed

498
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:34,200
adventures, his contention with the ball of heaven. In this story, Gilgamesh is instructed by his mother

499
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,120
Ninsun to carry out his duties and sit in judgement, only for him to be detained by the goddess of

500
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:47,000
love, Inanna. Here she proposes that Gilgamesh become lord to her lady, but he rejects her

501
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,760
in some versions due to his mother forbidding the union. After a missing section of text,

502
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,200
Inanna is found weeping by her father, the sky god Anu, who she asks to give her the celestial

503
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:05,000
ball of heaven with which to kill Gilgamesh. Anu refuses as the ball of heaven would find no food

504
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,160
on earth, only for Inanna to emit an infernal scream that forces her father to give in. She

505
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,960
then leads the ball down to Uruk, where it destroys the date palms and consumes the river.

506
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,280
Gilgamesh is informed of the creature's arrival by his menstrual, and after quenching his first

507
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,840
reveal, he vows to dismember the ball. Together he and Enkidu dispatch the ball by finding its

508
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:35,800
weak point, after which Enkidu hurls its horn at Inanna. Finally Gilgamesh fulfills his promise

509
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,440
and distributes the ball's meat amongst the poor, though he dedicates the horns to Inanna.

510
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,720
In both of these poems, we see clear parallels to later episodes of the epic, though in each case

511
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:53,640
these accounts are similar, only in their outlines. In addition to this, elements of these stories

512
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,360
are also fought by some scholars to give insight into Mesopotamian society of the time.

513
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,240
For example, Gilgamesh's expedition to the cedar forest is seen by Uruk scholars Margaret Van S

514
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,800
and Reyn Theonif as reflecting the actual needs of monumental building projects

515
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,720
conducted by Mesopotamian kings during this period, as the palm, poplar, and tamarisk wood of the

516
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,960
alluvial plain is either too soft or grows too short to be of much use in monumental construction.

517
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,520
By comparison, cedar wood is an ideal building material, though wood indeed had been found in

518
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,800
the Sagros Mountains to the east, and we know that Mesopotamian kings from this period would go to

519
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:39,640
great lengths to secure this precious material. In the later epic, this event would also be

520
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,360
relocated westwards to what is now modern Lebanon, a change that coincides with the

521
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,280
increasing importance of western states during the second millennium BC.

522
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,920
Similarly, Gilgamesh's refusal of marriage to the goddess Inanna is also fought to parallel

523
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,240
literary descriptions of the sacred marriage ceremony between Mesopotamian kings and the city's goddess,

524
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,080
though whether these ceremonies actually occurred or not is a topic of some debate.

525
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,040
When we move beyond these two works, however, what is perhaps surprising is that the remaining

526
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,880
Sumerian poems contain no clear parallels at all to the later epic, and indeed one of them contains

527
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,560
no mythical or supernatural elements at all. Where they do appear to have played an important

528
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,920
role, however, is in informing the later themes of the Babylonian epic, particularly that of human

529
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:36,200
mortality and Gilgamesh's struggle to escape death. In the first of these tales, known as Gilgamesh

530
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,240
and the Neverworld, we see Gilgamesh's increasing association with the Mesopotamian afterlife.

531
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,400
After a prologue describing how the gods divided the universe between them,

532
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,000
a great storm blows down a willow tree on the banks of the Euphrates.

533
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,960
Soon after, the goddess Inanna happens across the tree,

534
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:02,200
which she takes back to Uruk and plants at the Ianna district. To her dismay, this tree then

535
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,640
becomes infested by evil creatures, and after failing to gain the help of the sun god Utu,

536
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:14,280
Inanna turns to Gilgamesh for help. Taking up his weapons, Gilgamesh rides the tree of its

537
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,560
inhabitants and carves it into wood for Inanna's furniture. From what remains, he carves two toys,

538
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,160
most likely a ball and a mallet, and the next day he plays with these,

539
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,800
wearing out his subjects in the process. The day after, as Gilgamesh is about to resume his play,

540
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,480
the women of the city complain, and somehow the toys fall into the Neverworld. Gilgamesh

541
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,440
then dispatches his servant Enkidu to retrieve them, only for him to be taken captive after he

542
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:49,000
fails to show the shades of the dead the proper respect. Horrified at what has happened, Gilgamesh

543
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
petitions the gods for help. In the end only Enki, the Sumerian god of water and mischief,

544
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,960
will listen, and with the help of Utu, they raise Enkidu from the Neverworld as a shade.

545
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,040
In a lengthy series of questions, Gilgamesh asks Enkidu of the condition of the dead,

546
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,080
and learns how the first they suffer can be relieved by offerings of fresh water by their descendants.

547
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,640
This examination of death and the afterlife continues in the second of these tales,

548
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:24,280
known as the Death of Gilgamesh. As the poem begins, we learn that Gilgamesh has been seized

549
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:31,320
by Namta, the emissary of death, and now lies dying. In his guise as the Lord of Creation,

550
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,120
the god Enki shows Gilgamesh a vision of the gods judging his exploits in the cedar forest,

551
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:42,360
and a previously unmentioned journey to the end of the world. Here we are told he learned wisdom

552
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,400
from a man named Zisudra, the only survivor of an event known as the Deluge, an exploit for which

553
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:54,440
the gods granted him immortality. Gilgamesh is then told that immortality has not been decreed for him,

554
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,080
but after his descent to the underworld he will be given a special place as the Judge of the Dead.

555
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,720
As consolation for this fate, he is told he will be reunited there with Enkidu and his family,

556
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,800
and that he will be revered as a deity. After awaking from this dream, Gilgamesh appears to

557
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,760
seek counsel, and after a gap in the text, he is advised that he should not be sad at his fate.

558
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,920
The poem then concludes with the people of Uruk building Gilgamesh's tomb at Enki's instruction.

559
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,080
After diverting the river Euphrates, they build a stone tomb on the dry riverbed,

560
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,760
into which Gilgamesh, his wives and his retinue are sealed. The river is then returned to its

561
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,240
normal course in order to conceal the tomb, and the people of Uruk mourn their king.

562
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,400
According to Andrew R. George, the poem then concludes either by praising Gilgamesh as the

563
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,280
greatest of kings, or by explaining that the dead survive in the memories of the living.

564
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,480
Between these four poems, we can see many of the themes that would appear

565
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,080
in the more developed epic of the second millennium BC. In both Gilgamesh and Huawa,

566
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,640
and Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, we see the king's fear of death, and of the great deeds

567
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,240
that he undertakes in order to grant his name lasting fame. In the confrontations between

568
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,160
Gilgamesh and Huawa, and later the Ball of Heaven, we see the first signs of his great physical prowess,

569
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,200
whilst in Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, we see early signs of his tyranny over the people of Uruk.

570
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,280
In the death of Gilgamesh, we also see his first association with the immortal survivor of the

571
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:35,160
flood, a significant step for the development of the later epic. In Gilgamesh and the Neverworld,

572
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,000
we also have an important source for the Mesopotamian concept of the Underworld.

573
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,000
Here they believe the dead carried out a shadowy existence, where they either roamed naked or

574
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,840
clothed in birds' feathers, with only dust to sate their first. With the exception of figures

575
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,360
such as Gilgamesh, who received an exalted position near enough to actual life, the only respite from

576
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,160
this existence was fought to be through the offerings of libations given to the dead by the living.

577
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,000
It is for this reason that people in Mesopotamia considered having many descendants to be of

578
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,280
the utmost importance, as those who died without descendants were consigned to the worst form of

579
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,280
existence imaginable. Finally, the descriptions of Gilgamesh being buried alongside his royal

580
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:23,720
entourage and harem has drawn comparisons to what may have been actual burial practices from the time.

581
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,960
The most famous example of this has been found at what has been dubbed the Royal Cemetery of Ur,

582
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,040
where a mass grave known as the Great Death Pit was unearthed in the 1920s

583
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:40,200
by a team led by British archaeologist Leonard Woolley. Inside this pit, the remains of up to

584
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,640
seventy-four men and women were found, who appear to have been musicians, attendants, and bodyguards

585
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:52,120
of the tomb's occupant. Each of these people was killed by being struck over the head with an axe,

586
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,680
after which their bodies were embalmed, dressed, and laid out neatly as if in life.

587
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,640
It is uncertain how willing any of these deaths were, or if the burial was truly royal in nature,

588
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,800
but its existence indicates that mass internments of otherwise healthy followers,

589
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,600
alongside significant figures, were not unknown in ancient Mesopotamian society.

590
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,240
We come now to the final Sumerian Gilgamesh poem. Here we find a story that seems to have no

591
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,200
connection at all to the later epic, and it is completely devoid of mythical or supernatural

592
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:34,200
elements. Known as Gilgamesh and Acha, it concerns the contention between the cities of Kish and

593
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:41,000
Uruk for the hegemony of Sumer. In this story, the king of Kish, Acha, sends emissaries to Uruk,

594
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,680
demanding its submission. In response, Gilgamesh seeks the council of the city's elders,

595
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:53,080
who caution him to submit rather than going to war. Ignoring their advice, Gilgamesh instead

596
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,360
secures agreement from the young men of the city, who laud his prowess and predict his victory.

597
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,880
Soon after this, Acha arrives and lays siege to Uruk. Gilgamesh asks for a volunteer to

598
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:13,080
challenge Acha to single combat, and his guard Burhirtura volunteers. On leaving the city however,

599
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:19,240
Burhirtura is immediately captured, beaten, and then brought before Acha. The steward of Uruk

600
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:25,640
then appears on its walls, and Acha asks the hapless guard if this is Gilgamesh. Burhirtura

601
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:31,480
answers it is not, and if it were, Acha would soon be vanquished, a reply that earns him yet another

602
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,720
beating. Gilgamesh then appears on the wall, and when Acha asks Burhirtura the same question,

603
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,720
he answers in the affirmative. Acha is then swiftly captured by Gilgamesh, who pays an old

604
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:50,200
debt to him by freeing him and allowing him to return to Kish. Whilst the events of the Envoy

605
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,400
of Acha are all but disconnected from the later epic, it does give us some sense of how the Sumerians

606
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,760
viewed the idea of kinship, and like the contemporary king list, it provides us with some information

607
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,280
on how these people saw their own history. A number of scholars have also hypothesized that

608
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,640
elements of this story reflect some aspects of Sumerian society that go undocumented elsewhere.

609
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,480
For example, Gilgamesh's consultation with both the elders and the young men of the city

610
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,880
has been taken as evidence of an early form of democracy, where the head of a Sumerian

611
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,520
city-state would consult with distinguished men of the city prior to making major decisions.

612
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,560
Similarly, the appointment of a champion to fight Acha on Gilgamesh's behalf points to the idea

613
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:38,440
that early warfare in southern Mesopotamia may have often had a more ceremonial element than

614
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,200
the fully-pitched battles that we often envision. These hypotheses are certainly interesting,

615
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,040
though for the moment they remain just that. Another interesting aspect of these Sumerian

616
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,120
poems is the elements that they lack compared to the later epic. Perhaps the most striking of these

617
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,080
is that whilst they mark the first clear appearance of Enkidu, his role is clearly less developed.

618
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,120
Not only does he lack his later wild man attributes, but in the text he is usually

619
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:12,440
described as a servant to Gilgamesh, rather than an equal partner. In the past, scholars such as

620
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,000
Geoffrey Teague have used this difference in status to argue that the friendship between the two

621
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,560
is an invention entirely of later authors, whilst Andrew R. George has argued that some

622
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,760
elements of the deeper friendship can be seen in Gilgamesh's emotional reaction to Enkidu's death

623
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:32,920
in Gilgamesh and the Neverworld. The differences in Enkidu's presentation have also led some past

624
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,880
scholars to hypothesise that Enkidu was himself the subject of a separate body of literature

625
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,240
that was later integrated into the Gilgamesh epic. However, no evidence whatsoever has been

626
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,280
found to support this idea, and it is now known that there are other potential sources of Enkidu's

627
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:55,800
wild attributes. So how did these poems come to be written? Up until now, the only evidence we

628
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:01,000
have of Gilgamesh are a few scattered inscriptions and some possible depictions in artwork that date

629
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,680
to the early dynastic period. One argument is that these stories may have previously existed

630
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:12,840
within wider Mesopotamian society as oral traditions. Indeed, there is some evidence that

631
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:18,360
these works were recited aloud during the Ur-3 period, shown by the inclusion of hymnic elements

632
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,880
in the introduction of the poem Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven. If this is true, then these

633
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,960
poems may well have been read as a form of courtly entertainment for the Ur-3 kings,

634
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,720
much as Gilgamesh is entertained by his court musician Lugal Gabagal.

635
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,680
However, if these tales were originally oral compositions, there is little evidence of

636
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,080
this to be found within the texts themselves, which lack many of the features associated

637
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,840
with oral storytelling. Another argument against this possibility is that as we have previously

638
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,640
covered, we do have some early examples of Mesopotamian literature dating back to the

639
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,400
early dynastic period, and amongst those, there is no undisputed evidence of tales related to

640
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:03,320
Gilgamesh. We also have no evidence for Gilgamesh in literature dating from the immediately preceding

641
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,960
periods, though the picture here is complicated by the fact that the Akkadian capital is still

642
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,360
yet to be located, and that the Gutian period is poorly attested archaeologically. On the whole,

643
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:19,400
however, it seems more likely that these works were original compositions created by scribes at

644
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,120
the academies of the Ur-3 kings that flesh out previous traditions and deeds that have been

645
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:29,880
associated with Gilgamesh in prior centuries. Indeed, we know from the hymns of the time that

646
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,240
the second Ur-3 ruler, Shulgi, held Gilgamesh in a particular high regard, and it would not

647
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,880
be surprising if the poems were composed at his instruction to honour a ruler with whom he felt

648
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,960
a special kinship. So strong was this feeling, in fact, that Shulgi would even declare Gilgamesh

649
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,840
his adoptive brother, as shown in the sections of a surviving hymn. Quote,

650
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:58,680
Shulgi, the righteous shepherd of Samir, praises his brother and friend, the Lord Gilgamesh,

651
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:05,400
in his might, addresses him in his heroism, mighty one in battle, a devastating flood who

652
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:12,440
smites the enemy in the heat of the combat, a catapult of the holy wall, skilled in hurling

653
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:19,160
the sling stone, against the house of Kish you brought forth your weapons, its seven heroes you

654
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,760
captured dead, the king of Kish, Emma Baragizzi, you trampled on his head as if he were a snake,

655
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:33,880
you brought over the kinship from Kish to Uruk. Another thread that scholar Geoffrey Teague has

656
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,680
noted is the resemblance between many of the physical feats attributed to Shulgi and his hymns,

657
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,400
such as his skill at wrestling and athletics, and those of Gilgamesh in the later epic.

658
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:49,000
Alternatively, these kingly attributes may reflect those attributed to the Akkadian kings,

659
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,160
particularly the god-like stature claimed by Narum's sin. Ultimately, though, we have no way

660
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:00,120
of knowing if either of these figures influence Gilgamesh's depictions, and it is just as likely

661
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:06,040
that his athletic prowess is influenced by common attributes, claimed by Mesopotamian kings throughout

662
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:11,080
history. So, to come to the end of this video,

663
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:18,040
so to conclude our discussions of the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, let us quickly discuss another

664
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:24,040
question that divided scholars after their initial discovery, whether they belong to a unified Sumerian

665
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:30,360
epic. It was initially taken for granted that these works were indeed part of a large narrative,

666
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,160
and it was not until the work of Samuel Cramer in the 1940s that the idea was disputed.

667
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,520
Over time, however, scholars have concluded that there is no evidence at all that these

668
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,880
tales were considered part of a unified epic. Not only is there no evidence of these poems

669
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,440
being grouped together during ancient times, but as we have explored earlier, these poems

670
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,600
like many of the central plot points are fully developed themes of the later epic.

671
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,680
There is also no clear evidence of textual passages linking the individual poems together.

672
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,360
The one small piece of evidence to the contrary is the existence of a copy of Gilgamesh in the

673
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:12,360
Neverworld found at the archaeological site of Mi-Taran. Here a passage exists that appears to

674
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,320
bridge the end of this poem to the beginning of Gilgamesh and Huwawa, with the hero turning

675
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,800
from his grief at Enkidu's death to the living one's mountain of the later poem.

676
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,720
Now, over this copy dates from a later period, and also contains an inherent contradiction,

677
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:32,200
as Enkidu is consigned to the underworld in the first tale, yet is somehow alive and by

678
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:38,280
Gilgamesh's side again in the second tale. As such we can conclude that there is no convincing

679
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:44,200
evidence of the unified epic in this period, and its genesis most likely belongs to the centuries ahead.

680
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:54,520
The time has come to move on. If we are to find the earliest known appearance of the

681
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:00,120
unified epic of Gilgamesh, we must move forward by a number of centuries into the early second

682
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:07,320
millennium BC. This period coincides with major changes in both Mesopotamian culture and politics.

683
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,240
After controlling the region for more than a century, the Earth-free dynasty came to an abrupt

684
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,760
end around the late 21st century BC, with the reasons for this collapse still being unclear.

685
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:24,680
One argument is that this collapse was due to the increasing migration of a group of peoples

686
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:30,680
known as the Amorites into Mesopotamia. These people likely originated to the west,

687
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:36,840
as shown by their Arcadian name Amuru, or Westerners, and seem to have lived a pastoralist lifestyle

688
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,680
that saw them alternate between sedentary living and seasonal nomadism.

689
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,640
People with Amorized Names have been mentioned in documents from at least the middle of the

690
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:51,240
third millennium BC, but from around the turn of the second millennium BC, we see a vast increase

691
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:56,600
in the number of Amorized Names appearing in documents. In the centuries ahead,

692
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:01,240
a number of rulers with Amorized Names would also succeed in establishing their own dynasties

693
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,520
throughout Mesopotamia, where they quickly assimilated both local customs and belief structures.

694
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,560
Whether or not these people played any role in the collapse of the Earth-free state, however,

695
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,680
is a controversial topic amongst archaeologists, and this appearance may simply be a coincidence.

696
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,760
What we do know is that early in the reign of the final Earth-free ruler Ibn-Sin, many of the

697
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:27,160
other cities within the Empire seized paying taxes to Earth, and the whole system by which

698
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:33,320
the state maintained itself quickly collapsed. Unlike the collapse of the Arcadian Empire before

699
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:38,200
it, the end of the Earth-free dynasty appears to have been relatively orderly, with no sign of

700
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,560
disruption throughout southern and central Mesopotamia. The exception to this seems to have

701
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:49,000
been at Ur itself, where later copies of messages have been uncovered, addressed from Ibn-Sin to

702
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,120
an official named Ishbi-era, urging him to buy grain at whatever price it was available from

703
01:06:54,120 --> 01:07:00,200
the cities of Isin and Kazalu. It has been argued on the basis of these letters that the region

704
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,800
around Earth-free itself was undergoing a famine during this period. However, their authenticity

705
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,440
has been disputed, and it has also been proposed that the need for grain was due to a loss of

706
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:17,000
expected tax revenue from the wider Empire. Later, Ishbi-era would break away and form

707
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,440
his own state at the city of Isin near Nipur, which he also seized control of soon after.

708
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,280
Ibn-Sin would continue to reign at Ur for another two decades, when an invasion by the

709
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,760
Yulomites and the King of Shimaski, a state in the region of the Zagros Mountains,

710
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,840
seized both him and the city. Ishbi-era would fare better and succeeded in driving out this

711
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:45,560
invasion in his 27th year of rule. He and his successors would later claim hegemony over Sumer

712
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:51,640
and Akkad as heirs to the Ur-free dynasty, but in reality their state was much smaller in scale,

713
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:57,240
with their power being limited to most of southern Mesopotamia. Elsewhere in central and

714
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,840
northern Mesopotamia, new rulers would emerge to forge their own states, each of which would attempt

715
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:13,240
to dominate the region in the centuries ahead. The political history of Mesopotamia in the

716
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,760
2nd millennium BC is highly complex and a full discussion of its events is beyond the scope

717
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:25,400
of this video. Let us suffice then with a quick summary. The first four centuries after the

718
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,960
collapse of the Ur-free dynasty, running from the beginning of the 20th century BC,

719
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,760
at the end of the 17th century BC, a collective we know as the Old Babylonian Period.

720
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,480
In its first two centuries, southern Mesopotamia was dominated by two major players, the dynasty

721
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:47,240
of Issin founded by Ishbi-era and a rival state led by the city of Lhasa, along with a number of

722
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:54,040
smaller states. In central Mesopotamia, a previously unimportant town by the name of Babylon, grew

723
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,880
into a major city ruled by an Amorite dynasty. Whilst to the east, the city of Eshnuna became

724
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:06,040
the heart of a powerful state. To the north, the cities of Assur and Ninev became wealthy through

725
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,840
their role as trade intermediaries between the developing city-states of Anatolia and those

726
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:17,160
of southern Mesopotamia. Whilst to the west lay the Amorite kingdoms of Mari, Yamkad and Katna.

727
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:23,320
These first two centuries are characterized by a period of almost continual warfare between these

728
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:29,320
states. In the end, however, it was the newcomer of Babylon that would succeed in uniting much

729
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:38,600
of Mesopotamia beneath its rule. Around 1766 BC, a coalition of Elam, Babylon, Mari and possibly

730
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:46,120
Lhasa sacked Eshnuna, ending its bid for hegemony. Two years later, Babylon's king Hammurabi would

731
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,560
turn on his former ally and defeat Elam with the help of Eshnuna's new rulers, only to turn on

732
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:58,120
this ally again and sack the city once more. Soon afterwards, he would have due both Mari and Lhasa

733
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,800
too, incorporating them into a new state that ran from Mari in the northwest to the shores of the

734
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:10,840
Persian Gulf in the south. Soon Hammurabi took on the titles of the Akkadian and Urfri kings before

735
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:18,120
him, dubbing himself king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the Four Quarters. Once again, Sumer and Akkad

736
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:25,080
were united and in the centuries ahead, this region would be known under a new name, Babylonia.

737
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,520
Throughout this period of feuding city-states, the literature and written language of Mesopotamia

738
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,040
continued to evolve. Perhaps the most important development from the perspective of the Gilgamesh

739
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,880
mythos was a change in the way that the literature was being recorded. Up until the end of the Third

740
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:50,680
Dynasty of Ur, Sumerian had been the dominant written language of both central and southern

741
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:56,440
Mesopotamia. From at least the beginning of the Second Millennium BC, however, its use would be

742
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,480
eclipsed by that of Akkadian, which went on to become the diplomatic language of both the Middle

743
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:07,640
East and much of the Eastern Mediterranean. Soon Sumerian was no longer being spoken,

744
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:12,120
and slowly it was limited to the role of an academic language used mostly by scribes.

745
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,280
Despite this, works of Sumerian literature continued to be recorded, and this period also

746
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,680
saw a major flowering of Akkadian literature throughout the scribal schools of the region.

747
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:30,040
Alongside accounts of the exploits of the kings of Uruk, Lugarbanda and Enmakar, now both firmly

748
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:35,160
established as Gilgamesh's father and grandfather respectively, we see for the first time accounts

749
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:42,600
such as Atana and the Eagle and of the Akkadian hero Atrahasis. And most importantly for us,

750
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,560
it is during this period that we see the first evidence for what is likely a unified epic of

751
01:11:47,560 --> 01:12:04,520
Gilgamesh. The old Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh exists today mostly in fragments that have been

752
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:11,240
found at southern centres such as Nipur, Ur and Lisin. From what we can tell, many of these

753
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,640
tablets appear to have been composed during the training of new scribes who were likely copied

754
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:22,440
them down as part of their schooling. Only two tablets are largely complete, the first outlining

755
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,240
the taming of Enkidu and his confrontation with Gilgamesh, and the second covering the beginning

756
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:33,800
of the journey to the Cedar Forest. Beyond that, the remaining fragments include portions of Gilgamesh

757
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,400
and Enkidu slaying of the Forest Guardian Humbaba, along with a section of Gilgamesh's later journey

758
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,120
to meet with the survivor of the flood, now for the first time named as Utnapishtim,

759
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:50,680
a simple translation of the name Zisudra into Akkadian. For obvious reasons, the amount of

760
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,480
information regarding the development of the epic that can be garnered from this material is limited.

761
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,680
It is generally agreed among scholars that the fragments we do have available constitute a

762
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:07,800
unified epic, though due to several factors this is not 100% certain. For a start, the beginning

763
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:12,280
and ending of the two major tablets have not survived in the available copies, meaning that

764
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,960
we lack the exact bridging text between the two. It also remains uncertain whether this version of

765
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,640
the epic contained all of its later episodes. For example, the Old Babylonian episode of

766
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:28,760
the Bull of Heaven has yet to be found, and so it cannot be ruled out that this episode was added

767
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,920
in later. Some missing plot points are however implied by the presence of the later episodes.

768
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,120
For example, we can be reasonably certain that the first tablet would have detailed Gilgamesh's

769
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,760
tourney over the people of Uruk, as otherwise there is no reason for Enkidu to be created in

770
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:50,600
the second tablet. Similarly, Gilgamesh's description of Enkidu's death in the surviving

771
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:56,200
fragment of tablet 10 indicates that this episode was likely also part of the epic at this time,

772
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,320
although the exact events that lead to it remain uncertain.

773
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,760
Finally, we see the presence of the more unified themes of the exercise of power

774
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,960
and kingship, along with Gilgamesh's search for immortality and his love for Enkidu,

775
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,400
the loss of whom spurs him on to find a way to thwart death.

776
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:23,880
So how was this new Akkadian epic composed? Well, it's unlikely that we'll ever be sure.

777
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,800
It could well be the work of a single author, or the culmination of the work of many different

778
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,640
scribes throughout the period. In support of the former theory, it has been argued that the old

779
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:40,760
Babylonian epic is written in a more simple, poetic style than the later standard epic,

780
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,000
and scholars such as Andruar George have used this to argue that it could well be the work

781
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,680
of a single poet of genius. In support of the latter argument, it must be said that this

782
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,320
poetic style does not exclude the possibility that this version of the epic was the result of

783
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:59,880
the cumulative work of more than one author, and that its language is merely the result of a later

784
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:06,200
editor who formalized the text. We also know that scribes would continue to revise the text of the

785
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:11,080
epic in the centuries ahead, and it is possible that a similar process of revision led to the

786
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:16,520
creation of the old Babylonian version. So putting aside the question of a single

787
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,200
author for the moment, what sources may have inspired its composition?

788
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,480
The most obvious suggestion is that the old Babylonian epic would have been composed using

789
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:31,000
the earlier Sumerian poems, with a combination of Akkadian translations and new material being

790
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,040
used to establish a unifying plot and themes, as well as to expand on events only mentioned

791
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:41,480
briefly in its forerunners. In the process some less relevant material would naturally have been

792
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:48,120
excised, such as the content of the poem Gilgamesh and Akkad. Support for this idea comes from the

793
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:53,400
fact that we know the Sumerian poems were still being copied down by scribes during this period,

794
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,720
and it is likely that the author or authors of the unified epic were familiar with them

795
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:05,080
in some fashion. There are some problems with this theory however. As many Gilgamesh scholars

796
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:10,280
have pointed out, outside of the overall plot points, the text of the epic bears only a slight

797
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:16,040
resemblance to those of the poems of corresponding episodes, and any direct translation of Sumerian

798
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:22,200
into Akkadian could be largely ruled out. One possible explanation for this is that the writers

799
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:27,560
of the Akkadian epic were only loosely familiar with these earlier poems, or as Geoffrey Teague

800
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,040
has suggested, that they were working from an Akkadian intermediary that only paraphrased their

801
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:38,200
contents. Andrew R George has gone further than this, suggesting that the epic of this era may

802
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:43,560
have been based not on the existing poems, but on Akkadian oral traditions within old Babylonian

803
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,880
society. Indeed, from the hymnic refrains seen in later versions of the epic, we can surmise that

804
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:56,760
the epic may well have been sung within Babylonian society, much as the poems before it. After all,

805
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,240
if the epic were a familiar form of entertainment during this period, it would in turn make sense

806
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:06,520
for scribes to copy it down as part of their training, or to formally transcribe a record of it.

807
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,560
And whilst it is almost impossible to track oral traditions in a dead language,

808
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:15,480
this may also explain the sheer volume of new material seen in this version.

809
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,320
The best example of this is the vast expansion in Enkidu's description and backstory.

810
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:26,360
Whilst it has been claimed that there are already some hints of a deeper friendship

811
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,480
between Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the Sumerian poems, it is in the old Babylonian epic that

812
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,280
we see Enkidu's role transformed. No longer a simple servant,

813
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:41,000
he has become a wild man, crafted by the gods as Gilgamesh's physical equal.

814
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,080
Describes extremely hairy, he begins his life ignorant of the ways of civilisation,

815
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,640
living and grazing amongst the herd animals of the steppe.

816
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,280
After being civilised through intercourse with the prostitute Shamhat,

817
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,720
he travels to Uruk, where he comes into conflict with Gilgamesh.

818
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:03,000
After wrestling with him, Enkidu instead becomes the hero's closest companion,

819
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,520
and Gilgamesh frequently describes him as the axe by his side.

820
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,760
Elsewhere Gilgamesh is explicitly described as loving him as he would a wife,

821
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:16,920
and it is the loss of Enkidu that directly inspires his quest for immortality.

822
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,720
The level of originality of each of these plot points differs,

823
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,080
but in particular Enkidu's newfound status as a wild man,

824
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,440
seems without any clear precursors in Mesopotamian literature.

825
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,320
In the past, a number of scholars have argued that these newfound attributes

826
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,160
are inspired by earlier Sumerian stereotypes of the Amorites,

827
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,680
who they considered an uncivilised people. A commonly cited example of these stereotypes

828
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,120
is found in a passage from a composition known as The Marriage of Matu,

829
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,920
which dates from the 3rd millennium BC. To quote its text,

830
01:18:55,480 --> 01:19:00,120
Dwelling in the mountain, the one who digs up mushrooms at the foot of the mountain,

831
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,760
who does not know how to bend the knee, who eats uncooked meat,

832
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,960
who in his lifetime does not have a house, who on the day of his death will not be buried.

833
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,800
Whilst these stereotypes very much reinforce the Sumerian view of the Amorites as uncivilised,

834
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,640
it should be noted that they display little overlap with Enkidu's description.

835
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,800
For example, the Amorites are mentioned as eating uncooked meat,

836
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,080
whilst Enkidu grazes on the grass of the plains, and the Amorites do not share Enkidu's hairiness,

837
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:36,760
nor his kinship with wild beasts. It is also clear that by the time the earliest

838
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:40,920
version of the Epic of Gilgamesh appeared, many of the major ruling dynasties of the

839
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,720
regio could trace their beginnings to Amorite ancestors, and this ancestry would no longer

840
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:54,840
have been considered in a negative light. There is, however, another document that is

841
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,160
according to Geoffrey Teague may have at least indirectly influenced the Epic's depiction

842
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:06,280
of Enkidu. Known as a debate between sheep and grain, it also dates from the 3rd millennium BC,

843
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,560
and details another version of the Sumerian creation myth.

844
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,680
Whilst it is unlikely to have served as a direct textual source for Enkidu's

845
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:18,680
wild man attributes, it does include a description of Primordial Man,

846
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,760
with whom he shares some similarities.

847
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,640
Quote,

848
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:30,760
Mankind of that time knew not the eating of bread, knew not the wearing of garments.

849
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,680
The people went around with skins on their bodies. They ate grass with their mouths like sheep,

850
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,440
drank water from ditches.

851
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:46,280
This text then goes on to explain the civilization of mankind by the gods, who mediate to them,

852
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:51,800
the meds. This elusive concept is mentioned frequently throughout Sumerian literature,

853
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:57,160
and is roughly thought to mean the norms of civilized society, including sexual intercourse,

854
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:03,720
agriculture, crafts, priesthood, and kingship. This process shows clear parallels to the

855
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:09,080
civilizing of Enkidu, who is first elevated from the beasts by intercourse with a human woman,

856
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,200
then taught the ways of humanity by the shepherds of the steppe.

857
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,440
So in the old Babylonian period, we see much formalization of the epic's content,

858
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:23,160
and indeed its major additions from this time would remain largely the same in later versions.

859
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,920
However, at this stage, much of its content is still missing, and if we wish to see the

860
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:34,280
epic in its familiar form, we must again move forward, and examine changes in Mesopotamian

861
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,400
politics around the end of the old Babylonian period.

862
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,760
Whilst Hammurabi was able to pass on his unified empire to his son,

863
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,120
Samsuiluna, he himself would not be so lucky.

864
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:57,800
After an initial period of stability, Samsuiluna faced two rebellions in the south from the rulers

865
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:03,160
of Lhasa and Uruk, along with an invasion from a new group of peoples from the Zagros mountains to

866
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:09,560
the east. Known as the Cassites, this group of people would go on to play major roles in Mesopotamian

867
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:14,600
politics, and are perhaps best known for their association with the use of horse-drawn chariots

868
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:21,640
in warfare. Samsuiluna was successful in thwarting this invasion and in pacifying the south,

869
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:26,520
claiming in one of his year names to have destroyed the wars above Uruk and Lhasa as punishment.

870
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:33,320
But this success wouldn't last. Soon after the defeat of the Southern Rebellion,

871
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,040
Babylon seemed to have largely withdrawn from the area.

872
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:42,520
Alongside this retreat also came a shifting of the centre of Mesopotamian religious life.

873
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,120
Until now, the central god of the southern and central plains had been Enlil,

874
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:54,120
whose cult was based in the southern city of Nipur. After the Babylonian withdrawal, however,

875
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:59,160
his cult moved northwards to Babylon itself, a move that coincided with the slow elevation

876
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,080
of its local god Marduk to the head of the Babylonian Pantheon.

877
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,840
And most importantly for us, this withdrawal had an unintentional side effect.

878
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,600
By forcing many of the scribes of the south to leave their cities, this act unintentionally

879
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,880
preserved many of the period's manuscripts within their abandoned households, including the only

880
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:26,600
surviving copies of the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems. Exactly why this retreat occurred is uncertain,

881
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,280
and it seems to have been accompanied by major movements of peoples from the south

882
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:36,120
to cities such as Kish and Babylon. Whatever the cause, the result of this withdrawal was that

883
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:40,520
much of the region came under the control of a shadowy group of rulers known as the First

884
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,760
Sea Land dynasty, for whom we have little inscriptional evidence. To the north and the east,

885
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:51,560
both Assyria and Elam appear to have thrown off Babylonian hegemony around this time,

886
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,720
and Samsua Luna's rule became largely limited to central Mesopotamia.

887
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:02,920
By the end of the 18th century BC, the Empire of Hammurabi was already a distant memory.

888
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,400
The final century of the old Babylonian period is poorly documented.

889
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:20,360
We know that Samsua Luna's successors remain secure in northern Babylonia,

890
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,400
and indeed this region seems to have prospered during this time.

891
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,400
By the reigns of its final rulers, however, it is clear that Babylon was increasingly in conflict

892
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:35,160
with a number of tribal groupings, who a syriologist Paul Alain Bulu has associated with the Cassites.

893
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Despite this, when the destruction of the first dynasty of Babylon came,

894
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,920
it was not at the hands of a Mesopotamian power.

895
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:52,600
Instead, the end came in the form of an attack by the Hittite king Mesilli I,

896
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,720
who sacked Babylon around the beginning of the 16th century.

897
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:01,640
Formed in the late 18th century BC, the Hittites' heartlands lay to the northwest,

898
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,360
around the city of Hattusa, in central Anatolia.

899
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:10,440
By the time of the sack of Babylon, their control had expanded to include much of this region,

900
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,120
along with parts of northern Syria previously controlled by Yamcad.

901
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:20,520
Exactly why Mesilli chose to attack a region so far from the Hittite heartlands is unclear,

902
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:24,840
and indeed this military venture appears to have been more of a ray to seize Plunder,

903
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,760
rather than any attempt at conquest.

904
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:32,040
Whatever the cause, according to later Babylonian and Hittite documents,

905
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:38,200
Mesilli sacked the city around 1595 BC and carried off the cult statue of Marduk.

906
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:44,360
In the resulting power vacuum, the city s Amorite dynasty would be replaced by a Kassite one,

907
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,920
although much like their predecessors, these rulers soon took on the trappings of Mesopotamian

908
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,120
culture and language.

909
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:57,160
After this, Babylonia descended into something of a dark age, the rest of the 16th century BC,

910
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,960
and sources for the early Kassite period are scarce.

911
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,160
What we do know is that at some point in the early 15th century BC,

912
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:11,800
the Kassite king Ulam Biryash succeeded in subjugating the seal and dynasty to the south,

913
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,920
reuniting Babylonia into a single political unit.

914
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:21,480
By the middle of the 14th century BC, the influence of this unified state was felt as far

915
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,720
north as as Syria, and as far south as the states of the Persian Gulf,

916
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,040
making it one of the great powers of its day.

917
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,280
This growth in power coincided with large-scale sponsorship of public building by the Kassite

918
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:40,040
rulers, including a vast new capital city at Durkuri-Galzoo, the central ziggurat of which

919
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,760
still stands some 57 meters tall today.

920
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:49,000
And most importantly for us, the Kassite period is marked by a new period of creativity in

921
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,720
Babylonian literature, along with the development of a literary dialect that would remain standard

922
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,880
throughout the region for nearly a millennium.

923
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:07,240
In the middle centuries of the Kassite period, we see some small evidence for a version of the

924
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:13,560
epic that is still in flux. Today this version is known by scholars as the middle Babylonian

925
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:19,480
epic of Gilgamesh, although really all we have are a scattering of fragments from Nippur and Ur in

926
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:25,400
the south, from the western cities of Ima, Megiddo and Ugarit, and at the Hittite capital of Hattusa

927
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:31,800
in central Anatolia. Most of these fragments date from around the 14th century BC and are so

928
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,000
disparate that few comparisons can be made either between them or with the text of the old Babylonian

929
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,440
version. Perhaps their most important contribution is that they include excerpts from episodes of

930
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:48,440
the epic previously unseen in the old Babylonian version. These include the tale of Gilgamesh's

931
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:53,400
creation and his tourney over the people of Uruk, the remaining parts of the Cedar Forest

932
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,120
expedition, the defeat of the Boar of Heba, and parts of Enkidu's deathbed speech.

933
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,720
We can also see that the text of the epic continued to evolve during this period,

934
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:08,520
and that its copying out appears to remain the staple of scribal instruction throughout Babylonia.

935
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:14,520
Finally it appears during the only ancient period in which versions of the epic appear to have been

936
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:20,040
written in languages other than Akkadian. This includes a largely unintelligible version of the

937
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:25,560
epic written in Hurian, the language of a group of people who ruled various states in Syria and

938
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:32,120
northern Mesopotamia, the most notable of which was the state of Mitanni. In the west this state

939
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,000
would prove a powerful foe for both the Hittites and the new Kingdom of Egypt throughout the 16th

940
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,360
and 15th centuries BC and would temporarily succeed in subjugating Assyria to the east

941
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:48,840
for its power collapsed in the 14th century BC. To this we can also add a fragmentary

942
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,720
paraphrase of the epic written in Hittite, the exact source of which is difficult to tell.

943
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:59,400
Interestingly parts of the Boar of Heaven episode are included amongst these fragments,

944
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:05,240
may indicate that such an episode was present in the Old Babylonian epic, if this version was derived

945
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:11,480
from it. So moving on from the limited remains of the Middle Babylonian epic, it is during the

946
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,960
later centuries of the Kassite period that we finally see the emergence of the Twelve Tablet

947
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:22,840
Epic with which most people are familiar today. Known as the Standard or Late Epic is surviving

948
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,000
tablets date from the first millennium BC and were originally found in the libraries of the

949
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:33,960
neo-Asyrian kings Ashurbanipal and his grandfather Sennacherib. However according to scholars such

950
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,840
as Andrew George and Mark Van Damirup, it is likely that this work was originally composed

951
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:44,440
during the late second millennium BC, either at the end of the Kassite period or shortly thereafter.

952
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:51,080
The giveaway for this is the highly ornate nature of its text, a style known as Standard Babylonian

953
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,080
that first appeared in the Kassite period and that would remain the main literary dialect

954
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:01,080
of the region until the extinction of Akkadian as a major language. Indeed many of the later copies

955
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:06,280
of these texts were attributed to earlier authors by scribes in the first millennium BC,

956
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,680
who themselves broadly grouped into families that claimed descent from one of these illustrious

957
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:17,240
ancestors, many of whom bore Kassite names. The epic itself is no exception to this,

958
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:22,920
and by the neo-Babylonian period it had become recognised as a creation of an especially illustrious

959
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,640
ancestor. To quote a list of texts and authors dating from this period.

960
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,280
Exactly who Sin Lake Iunini was is a contentious question amongst Gilgamesh scholars,

961
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:44,200
such as the scarcity of information that we have on his life that any number of arguments have been

962
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:50,680
made both for and against his existence. Even if he did exist, his exact relationship to the text

963
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:56,920
is uncertain. As we've discussed before, serious arguments have been made that the elegant text

964
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:02,440
of the old Babylonian epic was composed by a single author who may well have been Sin Lake Iunini.

965
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:07,800
Alternatively if he lived in the Kassite period then he may simply have been a late editor of

966
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,080
the text, who collated the 12 tablet version that remained standard from that point onwards.

967
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,680
He may even have been some influential editor of a middle Babylonian version of the epic,

968
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,680
that provided the blueprints for the standard epic of the late 2nd millennium BC.

969
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:28,440
In the absence of any other evidence about his life however, there is no real way for us to

970
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:34,040
know which, if any of these possibilities is true. About the most we can say is that by the

971
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:39,000
first millennium BC, the Babylonians already considered him an ancestor figure of both great

972
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,360
antiquity and prestige, as seen by his inclusion in a later version of the Sumerian Kingless,

973
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,120
that presents him as the chief scholar during the times of Gilgamesh himself.

974
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,200
In reality this listing has little bearing on fact, and is likely an attempt by these later

975
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:59,080
authors to enhance both their own prestige and that of the text by inflating its antiquity.

976
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:06,200
So what is there to say about the standard epic compared to its predecessors? Well besides

977
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:10,840
its more ornate literary style, we mostly see a restructuring of existing plot points,

978
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:16,520
rather than wholesale insertions or changes. As we have outlined throughout this video,

979
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:21,000
the newer content found within the epic at this time also reflects ideas and events

980
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,960
hinted at in earlier versions of the story, as well as in the Sumerian poems that preceded it.

981
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:32,040
For all we know, this new material may already have been part of the epic by the old Babylonian

982
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,520
period, but regardless of when it was inserted, we must acknowledge that the drafting of these

983
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:41,800
new sections would still have required a great amount of creativity and skill, as the writer

984
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,480
or writers of the epic would have had to take what were only briefly defined episodes of

985
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,760
Gilgamesh's life and expand them into a narrative that combined the overarching themes of the epic.

986
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:56,680
Alongside this, however, we must acknowledge that not all parts of the epic were so successfully

987
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:03,080
integrated. The worst offender in this regard is the final part of the epic, Tablet 12.

988
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,160
Widely regarded by scholars as a late appendage to the epic, it consists of a direct Akkadian

989
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:14,040
translation of the second part of the Sumerian poem, Gilgamesh and the Neverworld, beginning

990
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:19,720
immediately after Gilgamesh's toys fall into the underworld. With the exception of some slight

991
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,840
expansion of the text, this piece displays little to no integration with the earlier epic,

992
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:28,280
being crudely tacked on without even a bridging sentence in between.

993
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:33,960
The result is that at the beginning of this section, Enkidu is now miraculously alive again

994
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,360
before his descent into the underworld, and its events proceed largely in a vacuum,

995
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:44,440
disconnected from the previous epic. Exactly when or why this tablet was added into the narrative

996
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:49,960
is uncertain. One theory, voiced by Geoffrey Teague, is that this section was included in

997
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,760
order to instruct Gilgamesh on the conditions of the underworld, as he might better understand

998
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:58,120
the role that he would play after his demise as Judge of the Dead.

999
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,640
Back to the main text of the epic, what is also interesting is how the Mesopotamian society it

1000
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:13,080
depicts remains closer to that of the 3rd and the early 2nd millennium BC than that of the

1001
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:19,160
Kassite period. For example, in the standard epic, Enlil remains king of the gods, despite him

1002
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:25,160
having long been supplanted as the head of the Babylonian pantheon by Marduk. Indeed, by the

1003
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:30,920
Kassite period, Enlil had been so demoted that he barely appears in the late Babylonian creation myth,

1004
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:35,800
the Anuma Elish, in which Marduk takes on the central role as the lord of creation.

1005
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:41,880
As a result, it seems clear that by this point, the larger elements of the epic have become fixed

1006
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,160
within Babylonian scribal traditions, with the plot points of its ancient storyline being respected

1007
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,040
rather than being altered to reflect more contemporary developments.

1008
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,920
Putting all these comparatively minor points aside, the standard epic stands out from its

1009
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:02,440
prior versions by its inclusion for the first time of what has become the epic's most famous element.

1010
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:07,880
We have seen hints of its existence earlier when discussing the Sumerian poem,

1011
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:13,560
The Death of Gilgamesh, and the opening of the Sumerian King List. Indeed, it was the inclusion

1012
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:18,200
of this element that led to renewed interest in the epic following its initial rediscovery,

1013
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,560
and that would soon raise its profile to worldwide attention.

1014
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,920
It is this event that would influence works far beyond its original epic,

1015
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,040
and shape the canon of both other mythologies and of religion still practiced throughout the world today.

1016
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,040
The Flood

1017
01:35:40,040 --> 01:36:09,000
In 1872, a momentous discovery was made by a 32-year-old man in the employee of the British Museum.

1018
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,280
He held no formal degree, no great scholarship or position,

1019
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:18,520
being a mere assistant to the more renowned Assyriologist, Sir Henry Rawinson.

1020
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,840
His name was George Smith. He came from a humble background,

1021
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,200
being born to working-class parents in a cramped London tenement.

1022
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:34,280
To put it bluntly, people with his background were not wanted in the academic world of the 19th

1023
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,880
century, and his parents had been under no illusions as to his chances.

1024
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:44,040
His formal education ended when he was only 14, and instead of attending high school,

1025
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,440
he was soon apprenticed as a banknote engraver.

1026
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:52,520
During this apprenticeship, however, the young Smith became obsessed with biblical studies,

1027
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,320
along with the emerging field of Assyriology.

1028
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:02,440
Named for its initial focus on excavations into Syrian cities such as Ninev in northern Mesopotamia,

1029
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,160
at the time this field was still largely unformalized.

1030
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:09,880
Indeed, many of its earliest excavations have been conducted by amateurs

1031
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,080
interested in determining the truth of the biblical account of history.

1032
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:18,920
Kinneathorn itself had only been painstakingly deciphered over the course of the last three

1033
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,040
decades, and Henry Rawinson's first volume on the Kinneathorn Inscriptions of Western Asia

1034
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,680
had only recently been published when Smith arrived at the museum in 1861.

1035
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,080
As David Damrosch notes in his work, The Buried Book,

1036
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,400
the disorganized nature of the field offered Smith a rare gap in the armor of the British

1037
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:42,360
establishment, where his lack of formal schooling would be considered less of a barrier to entry.

1038
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,920
Somehow or another, the young man managed to insert himself into the disorganized department,

1039
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:53,240
hurrying to the museum during his lunch break on the three days that the museum was open to the

1040
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:59,960
public. At first, he drew no attention, going ignored by the department's two members of permanent

1041
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:05,240
staff. Eventually, however, they realized to their surprise that this young man could read

1042
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:10,200
Kinneathorn better than any of themselves, and soon Rawinson would convince the museum

1043
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:16,360
to hire him on as an assistant curator. By all accounts, the pay was unimpressive,

1044
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:21,160
but it did not dampen Smith's enthusiasm for the job. Soon, he was working long hours,

1045
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:26,840
piecing together Kinneathorn tablets for transcription. In 1866, he published his

1046
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,720
first article, and the next year Rawinson had the museum hire him on as his assistant for

1047
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:38,040
the future volumes of Kinneathorn inscriptions. As Smith himself would describe it, this hiring

1048
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:44,200
marked his official entry into public life. But despite this progress, his great ambition of

1049
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:49,640
excavating in Mesopotamia himself went unrealized, and he was unable to convince the university

1050
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:55,880
trustees to finance such an expedition. Indeed, by this point, many of them felt that the museum

1051
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:00,280
already had enough of what they dubbed primitive Babylonian and Assyrian artifacts.

1052
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,720
Then in November of 1872, whilst working on volume four of Rawinson's series, Smith was

1053
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:12,760
sorting through a group of tablets that had laid untranscribed in the museum archives for the last

1054
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:19,480
quarter century. They had been discovered at Nineveh in the 1840s by the pioneering archaeologists

1055
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:25,080
Hormads Rassam and Austen Henry Liyad, comprising of a trove of some 22,000 tablets

1056
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:31,000
known as the Library of the Neo-Assyrian King Ashabanapal. As Smith later recollected,

1057
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:37,240
I'll note references to the creation in a tablet numbered K63 in the museum collection,

1058
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:42,120
and allusions in other tablets to similar legends. I therefore set about searching through the

1059
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:47,560
collection. Commencing a steady search among these fragments, I soon found half of a curious

1060
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:52,840
tablet which had evidently contained originally six columns of text. Two of these were still

1061
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,800
nearly perfect, two others were imperfect, about half remaining, while the other remaining columns

1062
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:03,480
were entirely lost. On looking down the third column, I caught the statement that the ship rested

1063
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,800
on the mountains of Nazir, followed by the account of the send and forth of the dove,

1064
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:13,320
and it's finding no rest in place and returning. I saw it once that I had here discovered a portion,

1065
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:20,360
at least at the Chaldean account of the deluge. According to later accounts by his contemporaries,

1066
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:25,640
so excited by this discovery was Smith that he leapt up and began to strip off his clothing,

1067
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:29,000
although he made no mention of such an event in his own account.

1068
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,640
Whether it happened or not, word of his discovery spread quickly.

1069
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:39,240
As we mentioned before, the society of his time was one that was growing increasingly skeptical

1070
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:44,840
about the literal truth of the Bible. It had only been 13 years since the publication of

1071
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:49,160
Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and by the time of Smith's discovery the

1072
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:53,240
theory of evolution had been largely accepted by the wider scientific community.

1073
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:59,240
Advances in the understanding of geology were also similarly undercutting many of the foundational

1074
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:04,360
stories of the biblical creation, and textual critics had begun to cast doubt on the Bible's

1075
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:09,720
presentation of history. As such Smith's presentation of his findings to a meeting of

1076
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,360
the Biblical Archaeology Society on the 3rd of December, which included amongst its audience

1077
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:19,640
the then Prime Minister William Gladstone, led to a immediate attention from the worldwide press.

1078
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,960
Soon after, newspapers on either side of the Atlantic were trumpeting Smith's discovery,

1079
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,800
and what they saw as its clear connections with the biblical story of Noah.

1080
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:32,280
To quote the New York Times

1081
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:38,760
Noah's log of the deluge is said to have turned up among some ancient Chaldean inscriptions,

1082
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:43,400
and an account of it which has been given by Mr George Smith of the British Museum

1083
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:48,440
has caused a good deal of excitement, especially one passage in which the gods of the period are

1084
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:53,480
described as feeling very bad and sitting like dogs with their tails between their legs.

1085
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:59,000
This irreverent remark occurs in a narrative of the deluge, which purports to have been given

1086
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,120
by one of the survivors to a Chaldean monarch named Isdoubar. The original composition of

1087
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:08,840
the narrative is placed at the latest in the 17th century before the Christian era,

1088
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:15,080
and it might be much earlier. At the same time, however, the paper sounded a cautionary note.

1089
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,360
For the present, the Orthodox people are in great delight and are very much

1090
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:25,560
pre-possessed by the corroboration which Cicit affords to Biblical history. It is possible,

1091
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,960
however, as has been pointed out, that the Chaldean inscription, if genuine,

1092
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,960
may be regarded as a confirmation of the statement that there are various traditions

1093
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:38,760
of the deluge apart from the Biblical one, which are perhaps legendary like the rest.

1094
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:45,160
The discovery of the flood portion of the Gilgamesh epic launched Smith to immediate

1095
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,520
preeminence as an Assyriologist, and gave him the opportunity to realise his dream of excavating in

1096
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:56,200
the field. Over the next four years, Smith would conduct free expeditions to Minerv,

1097
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,520
publishing his findings in volumes that were as much travel logs as they were reports.

1098
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:06,360
In 1876, he published his translation of the Gilgamesh epic under the title

1099
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:10,520
The Chaldean Account of Genesis, placing its flood myth full on centre.

1100
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,960
By the time of his unexpected death, he had eclipsed his contemporaries in fame,

1101
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,320
and appeared to be on the precipice of a long and distinguished career.

1102
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,600
Unfortunately for him, his young family, and the field of Assyriology,

1103
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,240
his third expedition to Minerv would be his last.

1104
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,440
On the return journey, he stopped in a small village outside of Aleppo,

1105
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:38,040
where he came down with dysentery. His companions managed to rush him to the city in search of

1106
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:44,040
medical aid, but nothing could be done, and he died there on August 19th, 1876.

1107
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,160
He was just 36 years old.

1108
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:58,760
The flood myth contained in the Gilgamesh epic received worldwide attention from the moment of

1109
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:03,320
its discovery, and remains one of the primary sources of interest in the story to this day.

1110
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:09,320
Whilst much of the focus placed upon it is due to its connections with the later biblical flood

1111
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:14,120
story, it should be emphasised that to the Mesopotamians themselves, the flood was a seminal

1112
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:20,360
event in history. Before it came an age when gods and primordial forces stalked the land.

1113
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,720
When humanity, animals, and the first cities were created, and when the kingship itself

1114
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:31,480
first descended from the heavens. In these anti-Diluvian times, they believed that kings

1115
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:37,160
reigned for thousands of years, and the population of the world far outweighed that of later Mesopotamian

1116
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:44,040
society. In Tablet 11 of the epic of Gilgamesh, we have only a paraphrase of the flood's events,

1117
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,760
but even this lays bare the scale of its destruction.

1118
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:52,600
In this Tablet, the survivor of the flood, Utsnapishtim, relates the story of its events

1119
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:58,840
to Gilgamesh in order to explain his immortality. We learn that in a previous age, the city of

1120
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:04,680
Shoropak, located on the Euphrates to the south of Nippur, was home to the gods Anu, Enlil,

1121
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:09,880
Ninurta, Enugge, and Ea, the Babylonian name for the Sumerian god Enki.

1122
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,040
So great had mankind multiplied in those days, that it was said the whole world bellowed like

1123
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:22,680
a ball, and this noise roused the anger of the king of the gods, Enlil. He decreed that humanity

1124
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:27,720
should be exterminated, and that all life should perish beneath the waters of a giant flood.

1125
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:34,360
In doing so, he also made the other gods swear an oath of secrecy, but after the decision was made,

1126
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:40,920
Ea crept out of the council. By pretending to speak to the wall of a reed hut, he warned the mortal

1127
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,040
man Utnapishtim of the coming flood. Following Ea's advice, Utnapishtim tore down his house

1128
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:52,840
and built a boat with seven decks that measured 120 cubits on all sides.

1129
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:59,160
After seven days labour, the boat was complete, and Utnapishtim loaded onto it all of his gold

1130
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:05,800
and family, along with his craftsmen, and beasts both wild and tame. That evening as predicted,

1131
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:11,160
the storm god Adad flooded the land with a torrential downpour, lasting for six days and nights.

1132
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:16,920
Terrified by the storm that they have unleashed, the gods cowered like dogs,

1133
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:22,840
whilst Ishtar bemoans the drowning of mankind. Utnapishtim's boat survives, however,

1134
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:27,480
and on the seventh day of the flood, he throws open a portal only to reveal water stretching

1135
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:33,640
as far as the eye can see. Finally, land appears in the form of the peak of Mount Nisir,

1136
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:40,040
on which Utnapishtim's boat runs aground. After seven more days, he sends out first a dove

1137
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:46,920
and a swallow, both of whom return after finding no place to land. Finally, he sends out a raven,

1138
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,880
who finds that the waters have receded and does not return.

1139
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:57,960
Utnapishtim then performs a great sacrifice on the mountain, the fragrance of which draws the gods

1140
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:05,080
one by one. Ishtar soon arrives and she bemoans Enlil's folly in calling for humanity's destruction.

1141
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:11,320
Eventually, Enlil himself arrives, angry at humanity's survival, only to be shamed by

1142
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:18,760
both Ishtar and Enki. Finally, Enlil then blesses both Utnapishtim and his wife with immortality

1143
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:21,880
and sets them at the mouth of the rivers to dwell for all time.

1144
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:29,800
Since its initial discovery, comparisons have rightly been drawn between this story and the

1145
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:34,520
account of the flood given in the Book of Genesis, where the role of Utnapishtim is taken by the

1146
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:41,720
patriarch Noah and his family. Indeed, when placed side by side, the two stories are almost

1147
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:47,000
identical, with only minor changes being inserted into the Genesis narrative to fit with the wider

1148
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:54,360
biblical canon. For example, in the Genesis flood story, the many gods of the Mesopotamian Pantheon

1149
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,080
are replaced by the single god of the Bible, who now has to perform both the role of summoning the

1150
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:04,440
flood to destroy humanity and of warning the last righteous man and his family to build the ark.

1151
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,600
Conversely, the Genesis story retains even small details of the Gilgamesh flood myth,

1152
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:14,280
down to the god of the Bible being pleased by the scent of Noah's sacrifice,

1153
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:20,360
much as were his Mesopotamian predecessors. As such, it is now widely agreed by scholars

1154
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:25,080
that the events of the Genesis flood narrative are taken almost wholesale from Gilgamesh,

1155
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:29,560
and that other Mesopotamian myths such as the Anuma Elish also appear to have influenced

1156
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:35,240
the wider biblical account of creation. And going beyond the biblical account,

1157
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:39,480
other mythologies also show flood stories with clear influences from Gilgamesh.

1158
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:45,080
In Greek mythology, a similar flood myth concerns the adventures of the Greek hero

1159
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:51,720
Dukallion. In this account, Zeus has grown angry at the actions of the bronze race of men,

1160
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,960
and decides to eliminate them by flooding most of Greece with an abundance of rain.

1161
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:03,160
On the advice of his father, Prometheus, Dukallion survives this downpour by building a great chest,

1162
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:08,520
into which he places himself and his wife, Pyrrha, along with enough provisions to last out the flood.

1163
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,440
After nine days and nights, Dukallion comes to rest on the shores of Mount Parnassus,

1164
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:21,080
where Zeus rewards him with whatever his heart desires. Dukallion then uses this wish to repopulate

1165
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:25,080
Greece, turning the stones he and his wife through into men and women.

1166
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:31,080
So the Gilgamesh flood myth was clearly a major influence on the later mythologies

1167
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:35,080
of the Eastern Mediterranean. But where exactly did it originate?

1168
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,640
Going only by the material we have discussed so far in this video,

1169
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:43,560
it may seem like this story is an entirely new addition to the standard epic.

1170
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,680
Whilst we know that the survivor of the flood was associated in some way with Gilgamesh,

1171
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:53,400
as far back as one of the Sumerian poems, we have no evidence at all of the flood story

1172
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:59,720
in any earlier version of the epic. In itself, this may simply be an accident of survival,

1173
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:03,000
as only portions of the old and middle Babylonian epic remain.

1174
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:07,640
But if we instead look to the wider literature of Mesopotamia,

1175
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:11,880
it becomes clear that there are at least two older flood myths that appear in both Akkadian

1176
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:18,120
and Sumerian texts. The first and better attested of these two is the Akkadian creation myth,

1177
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:22,440
the Atrahasis, the oldest versions of which date to the old Babylonian period.

1178
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:27,880
Whilst the story itself claims to be concerned with the flooding of the world by the gods,

1179
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,680
it actually begins by outlining the human creation myth.

1180
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:36,040
According to its texts, after the Anunnaki gods have divided the world between them,

1181
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:39,880
they force the younger gods, known as Igigi, to labor on their behalf.

1182
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:47,160
After laboring for 3,600 years, the Igigi gods grow tired and rebel against the Anunnaki.

1183
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,720
To solve this problem, the Anunnaki then slaughter the god Illawella,

1184
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:56,200
then have Aya and the crater goddess Mammy craft humanity by mixing his blood with clay.

1185
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:04,040
After 600 years pass, humanity multiplies so much that their noise angers the great god Enlil,

1186
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:08,120
and from here an almost exact equivalent of the Gilgamesh flood epic plays out.

1187
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:12,440
Although in this story the hero's name is Atrahasis, who much like Utnapishtim,

1188
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,600
also dwells within the city of Shoropak.

1189
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:19,640
The second Mesopotamian flood story is somewhat briefer,

1190
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:24,120
and is tested today only in the form of a single fragmentary tablet written in Sumerian.

1191
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:31,400
Known by the titles of the Eridu Genesis, or simply the Deluge,

1192
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:37,720
this story dates from around 1600 BC, and outlines yet another variant of the Mesopotamian creation myth.

1193
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,440
In this story we again see the creation of mankind by the Anunnaki,

1194
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:47,000
which in this tale comprises of the gods An, Enlil, Enki and Ninosag.

1195
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:53,480
After a missing portion of the text, we hear that An and Enlil have decided to destroy humanity,

1196
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:55,880
and they force each god to swear not to interfere.

1197
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:00,520
To get around this, Enki tells the plan of the gods to a wall,

1198
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,240
behind which is hidden the hero of the tale, Zeosudra.

1199
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:09,400
After another missing passage, which presumably detailed the construction of a vessel by Zeosudra,

1200
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:14,040
we hear that after the flood has raged for seven days and nights, the waters fall quiet.

1201
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:20,920
Nusmerian sun god Utu then appears, and Zeosudra dutifully makes a sacrifice in his honor.

1202
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:27,080
After a final missing section, we find the hero prostrating himself before Anu and Enlil,

1203
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:32,200
who grant him eternal life, and place him to the south of Mesopotamia in the land of Dilman.

1204
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:39,000
Upon its translation in 1912, it was initially presumed that the Sumerian story of the Deluge

1205
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,960
was a predecessor to the flood story of Gilgamesh, much as the Sumerian Gilgamesh poems may have

1206
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:49,640
preceded the Old Babylonian Epic. Over time, however, it has become clear that the account

1207
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,760
of the flood given in Gilgamesh is more likely to be a paraphrased version of the Atrahasis,

1208
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:59,640
and according to Stephanie Daly, the Sumerian story itself may well be derived from the Akkadian

1209
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:06,200
account. As proof of this, Jeffrey T. Gay has offered several pieces of evidence. Firstly,

1210
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:10,680
not only are the plot points of the two almost identical, but some lines in the epic are copied

1211
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:16,360
almost word for word from the Atrahasis. For example, in Tablet XI of the epic, the list

1212
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:21,240
of gods present at the meeting to decide humanity's fate is copied over exactly from the opening of

1213
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:26,600
the Atrahasis, even though in the Gilgamesh version some of these gods play no role whatsoever in its

1214
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:33,080
events, and figures that do such as Ishtar are absent. Secondly, the flood of the Atrahasis is

1215
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:39,640
already present in its Old Babylonian version, where it plays a key role in the story. By comparison,

1216
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:45,000
the Gilgamesh flood story appears only later in the Standard Epic, and there plays no clear part

1217
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:52,120
in its central quest. Finally, there also exists something of a smoking gun in line 187 of the

1218
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:59,240
Tablet, where the author accidentally names up Tnapishtim as Atrahasis. So it seems likely that

1219
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:03,960
whilst the version of the flood myth presented in Tablet XI was first introduced into the Epic of

1220
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,880
Gilgamesh in the late 2nd millennium BC, developed versions of the myth date back at least as far

1221
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:16,200
as the Old Babylonian period. Before that all we have are scattered references in documents dating

1222
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:21,240
from the end of the 3rd millennium BC, leaving us uncertain as to what significance its legend would

1223
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:27,160
have held during these earlier periods. We are aware of at least three earliest Sumerian creation

1224
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:32,600
myths that may well date to the early dynastic period, known as the Barton Cylinder, the debate

1225
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:38,120
between winter and summer, and the previously mentioned debate between sheep and grain. However,

1226
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:42,760
none of these creation myths mention flood, also indicating that it is not yet taken on its

1227
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:48,600
significance within the beliefs of the region. So now that we have gone back as far as the

1228
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:53,640
available literary works allow us, let us conclude our examination of the Mesopotamian flood myth

1229
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:58,760
by asking a question occupied many early archaeologists during the excavations of Mesopotamian

1230
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:05,640
centres in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Is there any evidence that the Mesopotamian flood

1231
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,680
myth was inspired by a real-life flood event that took place either in Mesopotamia itself

1232
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:15,960
or throughout the wider Middle East? Indeed, this question would feature prominently in many of

1233
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:23,240
the early reports of finds from this region during the 1920s and 30s. What also complicates matters

1234
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:28,120
is that since the late 90s a new hypothesis has emerged that attempts to explain the origin of

1235
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:33,960
this myth from outside of Mesopotamia, a claim which has in turn been fed by copious press attention.

1236
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:40,200
So before we move on to examine any potential evidence for a flood within Mesopotamia itself,

1237
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,440
let us briefly discuss this hypothesis.

1238
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:53,400
In 1997, what has become known as the Black Sea Deluge Hypothesis was first suggested by

1239
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:59,320
geologists William Ryan and Walter Pitt. According to this hypothesis, which has since

1240
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:04,920
been somewhat revised, around the end of the 6th millennium BC there was a catastrophic inundation

1241
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:11,240
of saltwater from the Mediterranean into what is now the Black Sea. These authors have argued that

1242
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:15,800
this sudden rise in sea level would have had a catastrophic effect on the Neolithic communities

1243
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:20,040
in the surrounding region, and it is the memory of this catastrophe that would have inspired the

1244
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:26,840
later Mesopotamian flood myth. Later, an alternative to this hypothesis was also suggested by AL

1245
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:33,000
Chapaliga that this inundation actually took place somewhere between the 15th and 11th millennium BC,

1246
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,360
with the source of flooding instead being the Caspian Sea to the east.

1247
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:42,600
Now bear in mind that I am far from a geologist, and as such I am unqualified to judge whether

1248
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:47,800
either of these events actually occurred. But looking at it from the outside, these hypotheses

1249
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:53,080
seem to be heavily contested, with many geologists debating the extent and timing of each of these

1250
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:59,000
hypothetical inundations. Moreover, the available archaeological evidence shows no great sign of

1251
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,080
population movements throughout the period of these inundations that can be directly tied

1252
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:09,480
to such a catastrophic flooding. We do know that from the second half of the 7th millennium BC,

1253
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:14,760
there is evidence of sizable movements of people out of Turkey, both to the west into Greece and

1254
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:21,160
further on into Europe, and to the east going as far as Egypt. However, it is still uncertain

1255
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:25,160
whether these movements could have been caused by such a major inundation event,

1256
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:29,320
and indeed there are other environmental reasons, such as an ongoing climate event

1257
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:33,320
known as the 8.2-kill year event that may explain these movements.

1258
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,400
But even if we assume that all of these events did in fact happen, the idea of them having

1259
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:44,840
inspired the Mesopotamian flood myth relies on an unprecedented period of oral storytelling,

1260
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,480
viewing the youngest date for a Black Sea inundation being separated from the first mentions of the

1261
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:55,800
flood by nearly three millennia. It also fails to explain why no evidence of such an event was

1262
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:00,680
preserved in other cultures closer to the centre of the event, such as the Old Hittite Kingdom,

1263
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:06,520
which was a contemporary of the Old Babylonian Atrahasis. Finally, there is also no reason to

1264
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:10,920
think that the ancient Mesopotamians would have had to rely on such a distant event to inspire

1265
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:15,640
their own flood narratives, as seasonal flooding would have been more the norm than the exception

1266
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:21,560
on the Alluvial Plain. As we discussed in the early parts of this video, agriculture in Southern

1267
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:26,680
Mesopotamia during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC would have relied on careful systems of water

1268
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:31,160
management to be successful, and too much river water could easily have damaged cropland.

1269
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,000
A particularly devastating flood could even wash away immature plants in the middle of the growing

1270
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,880
season, resulting in a poor harvest and starvation. Major floods could even swamp and destroy the

1271
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:49,800
mudbrick homes of those who lived nearby. In cities such as Uruk, this would have posed a

1272
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:54,440
particular danger, as evidence indicates that the ancient course of the Euphrates River flowed

1273
01:58:54,440 --> 01:59:03,000
through the centre of the city itself. The result of all of this is that there is far more reason

1274
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,720
to think that the ancient Mesopotamians would be more inspired by their own living conditions,

1275
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,920
rather than a hypothetical event that took place millennia before.

1276
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,960
So putting aside the idea of a Black Sea Hypothesis, is there any evidence from

1277
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:25,160
all localised flood in Mesopotamia itself, the catastrophic effects of which may have provided

1278
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:32,840
the core for the later myths? The answer is complex. Evidence for major flood strata has

1279
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:37,160
indeed been unearthed at a number of ancient cities throughout southern Mesopotamia.

1280
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:43,800
The most substantial of these have been found at free sites, at Kish to the north, at the site of

1281
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:48,280
the later flood myths, Shuropak, and near what would have then been the southern coastline

1282
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:54,440
at the city of Ur. Luckily for us, an account of the discovery of the flood layer at the last

1283
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:58,600
of these was penned by the site's principal excavator, Sir Leonard Woolley.

1284
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:09,080
It took place during the course of the 1928 to 1929 digging season. After excavating his most

1285
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:14,840
famous find, the Royal Cemetery of Ur, Woolley ordered a small test shaft dug into the soil beneath.

1286
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:20,760
After progressing through the occupation layers, he soon reached 8 feet of empty mud.

1287
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:25,960
However under this, he discovered a surprise yet more occupation debris,

1288
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:31,240
dating from the 4th millennium BC. Of this puzzling interruption in sequence,

1289
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,920
he quickly formed an interpretation, though he hesitated to share it.

1290
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:41,640
In the end it was his wife, fellow archaeologist Catherine Woolley, who gave voice to his suspicions.

1291
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,120
To quote his later writings,

1292
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:59,400
after pointing out the facts, asked for their explanation.

1293
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:05,560
They did not know what to say. My wife came along and looked and was asked the same question,

1294
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,040
and she turned away, remarking casually.

1295
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:15,800
In the season prior to Woolley's discovery of the flood stratorettor,

1296
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:19,960
two archaeologists named Stephen Langdon and Louis Waterlin were directing a series

1297
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:23,960
of excavations at the city of Kish, which had begun in the early 1920s.

1298
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:29,320
During the course of their investigations, they came across what they described as a thick layer

1299
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:33,640
of sand deposited by a flood, beneath which they found a series of brick tombs.

1300
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:39,240
Despite discovering this layer earlier than Woolley, they were slower to publish their findings,

1301
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,760
and in one of those twists the academics around the world will be familiar with,

1302
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:46,200
Woolley received both the credit and the lion's share of publicity.

1303
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:52,760
Later excavations conducted at the city of Sheropak, similarly uncovered a flood stratum,

1304
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:56,520
a finding that was given particular significance, given its status as the home

1305
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,160
of the survivors of each of the Mesopotamian flood meves.

1306
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:10,440
So are these scattered flood strator evidence of a large-scale flood throughout Mesopotamia,

1307
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,720
the distant memory of which led to the flood story of the Atrahasis,

1308
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:18,040
of Gilgamesh, and of the story of Dukalion and the biblical flood in turn?

1309
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:21,640
The answer is almost certainly no.

1310
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:26,440
Whilst these findings were received with great enthusiasm at the time,

1311
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:31,080
the idea that they represented a single region-wide flood quickly ran into difficulties.

1312
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,760
For a start, no evidence of flood strator on this scale had been found during excavations

1313
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:40,520
at any of the other southern Mesopotamian sites dating from this period.

1314
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:45,880
This comes despite the fact that many of these centres were located close to sites with flood

1315
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:48,760
strator and were indeed fed by the same river system.

1316
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,920
And when it comes to the three centres with evidence of flooding,

1317
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:56,440
even a cursory examination of the evidence throws up further problems.

1318
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:01,480
As laid out by David MacDonald in a 1988 article on the subject,

1319
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:05,480
it is immediately obvious that the timing of these layers do not always overlap,

1320
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,400
and each one varied in their intensity.

1321
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:12,920
At her, we see evidence for a single large flood event dating from around the middle of

1322
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:19,560
the 4th millennium BC. By comparison at Kirch, we see evidence of three separate floods,

1323
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:23,880
two of them dating to the beginning of the early dynastic period, and a third dating from around

1324
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:30,440
2600 BC. What also complicates this picture is that these assigned dates precede more modern

1325
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:34,680
developments in radiocarbon dating, casting some doubt on their accuracy.

1326
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:40,040
And even if we are to accept the idea that these floods did in some way influence the

1327
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:44,040
later accounts of the flood found in Sumerian and Akkadian literature,

1328
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:47,720
we would still have to explain the many centuries between them and the first known

1329
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:53,160
description of the Deluge. As with the old Babylonian version of the Epic of Gilgamesh,

1330
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:57,880
we could argue that such accounts may have been passed down in oral tradition during this time,

1331
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:03,160
but ultimately there is no way of proving this theory. As such we must conclude that there is

1332
02:04:03,160 --> 02:04:08,040
no strong evidence that these floods had anything to do with the later Mesopotamian story,

1333
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:12,120
and at the most all we can say is that these legends may well have been inspired by the

1334
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:15,720
frequent flooding that came as part of life on the alluvial plain.

1335
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:28,280
So what became of the Epic of Gilgamesh after the appearance of the standard version?

1336
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:34,520
Well as we previously discussed, this work seems to remain popular as a tool of scribal

1337
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:40,600
instruction well into the 1st millennium BC. In addition to its appearance as part of the

1338
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:45,480
libraries of the Neo-Assyrian kings, we know of more than 70 copies that have been unearthed

1339
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:51,400
throughout the Middle East. By the 1st millennium BC, it already appears to have been considered a

1340
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:56,280
work possessing great antiquity and wisdom, which may explain how much of its text remained

1341
02:04:56,280 --> 02:05:02,040
fossilized compared to other epics of the period. Exactly how popular it was within

1342
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:09,080
wider society however, we cannot say. As noted by Andrew R George, its popularity as a teaching

1343
02:05:09,080 --> 02:05:13,720
tool may indicate that the stories of Gilgamesh were still familiar to the average person,

1344
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:18,280
as transcribing a well-known story would have been an ideal starting point for teaching the

1345
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:24,120
cuneiform writing system. Unfortunately we have no clear way of knowing if this is true.

1346
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:29,720
It is entirely possible that by this time knowledge of Gilgamesh had become unlimited

1347
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:34,520
only to courtly scribes, along with rulers interested in his ideal of kingship.

1348
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:40,280
What we can say is that despite its continued importance throughout the early and mid 1st

1349
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:45,800
millennium BC, the slow waning of the Akkadian language from the 6th century BC onwards in

1350
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:52,920
favour of Aramaic also seems to have resulted in a decline in the epics copying. Even then,

1351
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:57,080
parts of its story would continue to influence other works throughout the Middle East and the

1352
02:05:57,480 --> 02:06:04,040
Mediterranean. In the archaic Greece of the early 1st millennium BC, the Gilgamesh story

1353
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:08,600
likely had a significant influence on the development of both the Iliad and the Odyssey.

1354
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:15,080
In the latter work, the exploits of Odysseus parallel many of those accomplished by Gilgamesh,

1355
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:19,080
such as his contention with the giant Polyphemus, his visit to the Neverworld,

1356
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:23,000
and his refusal of immortality through his spurning of the nymph Coipso.

1357
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:27,800
On top of these, Gilgamesh is also thought to have influenced the characteristics

1358
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:34,440
of the most famous Greek hero, Heracles. Much like Gilgamesh, this figure displays

1359
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:39,160
supernatural strength and stature, his mortal and yet of divine parentage,

1360
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:44,600
and garbs himself in the skin of a lion. These attributes may similarly have influenced the

1361
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:49,560
description of the biblical judge, Samson, who was possessed of a men's strength until his long

1362
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:55,800
hair was cut. And in addition to the incorporation of the Mesopotamian flood myth into both the

1363
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:01,160
Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament, Gilgamesh and Humbaba are also thought to appear

1364
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:06,360
in the apocryphal book of giants, where their names are assigned to a pair of giants unrelated

1365
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:12,120
to the events of the epic. Gilgamesh also seems to have survived as a popular figure

1366
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:18,040
into the Roman period. In the second century, the author Alien includes an account of

1367
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:23,000
Gilgamesh's miraculous birth and usurpation of the throne of Uruk from his grandfather,

1368
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,400
a story that has clear parallels to those surrounding the birth of the Akkadian Emperor,

1369
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:33,320
Sargon the Great. Finally, scholar Stephanie Daly has suggested that the later story of

1370
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:38,520
Buluqia in the Arabian Nights bears some similarity to Gilgamesh's quest to meet the

1371
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:43,080
immortal survivor of the flood, though this interpretation has been disputed.

1372
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:48,360
Despite its clear influences on these later works, by the end of the first millennium BC,

1373
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:53,960
the epic itself appeared to have lost much of its importance. According to Geoffrey Teege,

1374
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:58,440
its last known copy dates from either the second or the first century BC, and the last

1375
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:03,560
cuneiform documents to contain any mention of Gilgamesh date from around the second century.

1376
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:09,960
As with most Babylonian literature, the decline and eventual extinction of cuneiform writing

1377
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:16,200
saw the end of the epic's relevance, and from this point onwards, it was lost for more than

1378
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:22,440
2,000 years. Its most well-known copies were lost even earlier, remaining sealed in the

1379
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:28,200
Burnt Library of Ashurbanipal after the fall of Ninef to a combined force of Medes, Babylonians,

1380
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:35,960
and Scythians in the year 612 BC. Ironically, it is this baking process that may well have

1381
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:41,240
served to preserve the tablets, and allowed their fragments to survive until their rediscovery by

1382
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:48,840
Hormwood's Rassam in the early 1850s. Even then, however, Gilgamesh himself remained an obscure

1383
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:53,880
figure, and the publicity surrounding George's initial translation of the epic was almost entirely

1384
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:59,800
focused on the flood narrative contained within Tablet 11. What didn't help matters was that the

1385
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:03,720
highly fragmentary state of the available materials at the time meant that the initial

1386
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:08,200
translations of the epic of Gilgamesh, or Isdubar as he was mistakenly known,

1387
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:11,000
bore little resemblance to the epic that we know today.

1388
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:16,280
Over time, however, more and more fragments of the epic were unearthed,

1389
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:20,680
resulting in a series of increasingly accurate translations in the early 20th century

1390
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:26,120
by scholars such as Peter Jensen, Alexander Heidel, Ephraim Spaser, and Noah Cramer.

1391
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:31,880
After the end of World War II, awareness of the Gilgamesh epic also began to grow

1392
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:39,080
beyond the realms of academia. In the UK, Douglas Jeffrey Bridson's 1953 radio play,

1393
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:44,760
The Quest of Gilgamesh, helped to popularize an adapted version of the epic to the general public.

1394
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:49,800
Whilst in post-war Germany, the ruined cities, huge death toll, and population movements of the

1395
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:55,320
post-war period drew comparisons to the epic by a series of celebrated poets and novelists.

1396
02:09:56,680 --> 02:10:01,160
Around this time, authors also began to take note of the homoerotic elements in Gilgamesh

1397
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:06,200
and Enkidu's relationship, and a long literary trend began depicting the two as lovers.

1398
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:12,120
From the 1960s, Gilgamesh would continue to reach a yet larger audience,

1399
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:16,600
and in the 60 years since, he has appeared in almost every artistic medium possible.

1400
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:22,440
Obviously, a full discussion of all of Gilgamesh's appearances in popular culture

1401
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:27,240
is more than this video can hope to achieve. But perhaps the best summary of Gilgamesh's

1402
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:32,040
modern role is given by Theodor Zyorkowski in his work, Gilgamesh Among Us.

1403
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:37,000
Here he wrote that Gilgamesh has achieved something few other mythic figures have

1404
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,360
accomplished, by establishing himself simply as a name or character, often independent from the

1405
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:48,360
epic itself. The result is that there are few people in western culture to whom he is entirely

1406
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:55,800
unfamiliar, even if the epic itself is unknown to them. So as we end here today, we can say with

1407
02:10:55,800 --> 02:11:00,520
confidence that whether or not an actual Gilgamesh ever existed, his name and exploits have managed

1408
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:05,800
to live on in popular culture, long after those of Mesopotamia's greatest monarchs have been all

1409
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:11,960
but forgotten. And looking back now, millennia after the society that composed his epic has

1410
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:18,600
vanished from the face of the earth, it seems that his quest to overcome death may not have been so futile, after all.

1411
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:37,320
Hello everybody, it's Charles here. Thank you for watching the video all the way through.

This one's certainly been quite a long time coming, so I hope you enjoyed it.

1413
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:46,840
Before we end here today, I just want to say a quick thank you to the archaeologist Dr. Jeff
