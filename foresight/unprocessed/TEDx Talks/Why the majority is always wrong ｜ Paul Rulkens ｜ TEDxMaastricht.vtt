00:00.000 --> 00:15.240
In 1942, Albert Einstein was teaching at Oxford University and one day he just gave an exam

00:15.240 --> 00:20.240
of physics to his senior class of physics students and he was walking on the campus with his

00:20.240 --> 00:25.240
assistant and all of a sudden the assistant looked at Albert Einstein and said, Dr. Einstein,

00:25.240 --> 00:32.200
this exam which you just gave to the senior class of physics students, isn't that exactly the

00:32.200 --> 00:39.200
same exam you gave to exactly the same class one year ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:39.200 --> 00:44.680
said Albert Einstein, it's exactly the same. But Dr. Einstein, how could you possibly do

00:44.680 --> 00:57.400
that? The assistant said, well, said Einstein, the answers have changed. The answers have

00:57.400 --> 01:02.880
changed. In other words, what is true for 1942 is even more true for today. We live in a world

01:02.880 --> 01:07.240
where the questions might be the same, but the answers have changed. In other words,

01:07.240 --> 01:13.000
what has got you here will no longer get you there. And if you want to have results that

01:13.000 --> 01:16.920
you've never had before, well, you need to start doing things you've never done before.

01:16.920 --> 01:24.000
Now, the key question for today is, of course, is there a method to the madness? Is there a way

01:24.000 --> 01:31.560
that each of us can do impossible things to truly create dramatic results? And good news is that

01:31.560 --> 01:37.680
the answer to that question is yes, because what I'm going to explain today is when it comes to

01:37.760 --> 01:44.760
high performance, why the majority is always wrong and how you can use that to get everything

01:44.760 --> 01:52.320
you can out of everything you've got. But let me first introduce you to something interesting,

01:52.320 --> 01:57.000
an interesting observation. When people, teams and organizations, whenever they hit a wall,

01:57.000 --> 02:04.720
they tend to do one of two things. They either do more of the same things or they do less of the

02:04.760 --> 02:11.640
same things. But what you very seldom see is that they start to do different things instead. And

02:11.640 --> 02:16.280
it's interesting if you look at the data, approximately 3% of people are inclined to even

02:16.280 --> 02:24.440
do different things. And the remaining 97% continues to smash into the wall, like some kind of crazy

02:24.440 --> 02:32.160
energy bunny on steroids. And why is that? Why is that? And to understand what is going on here,

02:32.440 --> 02:36.120
we need to ask ourselves another question. And the question we need to ask ourselves is what is

02:36.120 --> 02:42.520
the purpose of thinking? What is the purpose of thinking? Now, if you ask that question to a

02:42.520 --> 02:47.680
brain scientist, the brain scientist will say, well, the purpose of thinking is to stop thinking.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.640
The purpose of thinking is to stop thinking. Now, what does she mean by that? Well, here's the thing.

02:53.640 --> 02:59.120
Thinking is a high energy activity. It takes a lot of energy to think. So whenever we think,

02:59.360 --> 03:08.040
we try to think as short as possible. And then we return to automatic pilot. Over 95% of our

03:08.040 --> 03:14.680
life, we run on automatic pilot. For example, if you ever driven a car and then you realize, whoa,

03:14.680 --> 03:21.760
what did I do in the past half an hour? That's your brain on automatic pilot. Another example,

03:22.000 --> 03:30.400
many of you right now are listening to me on automatic pilot. And I know who you are.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.040
Now, here's the thing. If your brain is an automatic pilot, this leads to what a scientist

03:39.040 --> 03:47.120
called mental myopia, also known as tunnel vision. And if you have tunnel vision, that's a bit of a

03:47.120 --> 03:52.480
problem because it confuses people about our own performance. And this is the reason that many

03:52.480 --> 03:59.040
people go through life acting like a mediocre race car driver who sits in his car, looks in his

03:59.040 --> 04:04.320
rearview mirror, sees his competition and is so far behind that they think they are first.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.880
In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we tend to think inside the box. And the box is a very

04:14.880 --> 04:22.800
good metaphor here. So let me draw a box. And if you take a close look at the box,

04:22.800 --> 04:28.960
you see that the boundaries of this box are very well defined. So we think inside defined

04:28.960 --> 04:35.200
boundaries. I'll give you an example. One boundary is a legal boundary. And we think within the

04:35.200 --> 04:42.560
legal framework. I'll give you an example where very few of you would think of stealing the wallet

04:42.560 --> 04:50.400
of the person next to you in order to fund your next cool startup. At least that's what I hope.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.320
So we think in legal boundaries, but there are other boundaries as well. We think in technological

04:56.320 --> 05:01.680
boundaries, we think in physical boundaries, but we also think in moral boundaries. And this is why

05:01.680 --> 05:09.840
we think inside the box. At least that's what we think. Because the reality is that the box in

05:09.840 --> 05:20.080
which we think looks more like this. Now, for those of you in the back who cannot see it,

05:20.080 --> 05:28.960
the reason is this is a very small box. And let me illustrate how small this box can be. For

05:28.960 --> 05:33.440
example, if I would say tonight, let's have something to eat, have dinner tonight, what would

05:33.440 --> 05:38.960
be options to do that? And probably you can come up with, hey, let's buy some pizza, go to restaurant,

05:38.960 --> 05:45.680
cook at home, all kinds of cool ideas. But I believe that very few of you would raise their

05:45.680 --> 05:51.200
hand and say, hey, let's go to the highway close by, see if we can pick up some dead animals on

05:51.200 --> 06:00.240
the side of the road and prepare ourselves a crispy dinner. That's a disturbing thought.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.000
But here's the funny thing, for many people in the world, this would be a perfectly normal

06:06.000 --> 06:11.040
response. Nothing wrong with that. So what it shows is that the box in which we think

06:11.040 --> 06:17.280
is actually very, very small. And if you take a look, if you take a closer look at your industry

06:17.280 --> 06:24.560
or professional field, you also think inside a very small box. And the boundaries of this box,

06:24.560 --> 06:31.920
they are called industry standards or industry norms. For example, if you are in the restaurant

06:31.920 --> 06:37.600
business, then the industry standard is that people come to your establishment, they eat,

06:37.600 --> 06:43.120
and then they pay. That's the standard. That's how everyone is doing it. Another example,

06:43.120 --> 06:48.160
if you're in the banking business, this norm is that people give you money, you say, thank you

06:48.160 --> 06:56.720
very much, and you give the money to someone else. I mean, that's banking. So those are standards,

06:56.720 --> 07:00.320
those are norms in the industry or professional field. But this is what you need to know,

07:00.320 --> 07:07.520
the word norm is an abbreviation for normal. In other words, if you do what everyone else is

07:07.520 --> 07:12.000
doing, you get results that everyone else is getting, and those are normal results.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.400
And the thing is, what we are after today are extraordinary results. So the key question

07:20.400 --> 07:25.360
is, of course, how can you kick yourself out of the box, out of this very small box of your

07:25.360 --> 07:32.080
industry and professional field, and move to the happy place where cool innovation happens?

07:32.720 --> 07:38.320
Now, how can you do that? Now, let me introduce you to the curious case of the London taxi drivers.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.720
If you want to become a taxi driver in London, you need to know the entire city by heart.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.520
And this is called the knowledge. And you can imagine it takes years to get the knowledge

07:49.520 --> 07:54.480
in your head. And that's a bit of a problem if you want to rapidly expand your taxi business.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.080
So they ask themselves a question. How can we rapidly expand our taxi business,

08:00.080 --> 08:06.240
while at the same time employing taxi drivers who do not know anything about the city of London?

08:08.240 --> 08:11.760
And then they came up with a very ingenious solution. What they said, well, actually,

08:11.760 --> 08:17.600
then we make two kinds of taxis. One is a normal taxi. And the other taxi has a big sign on it,

08:17.600 --> 08:22.080
which says the driver of this vehicle does not know anything

08:25.040 --> 08:29.200
about the city of London, but loves to get directions from you.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.760
And that's a brilliant solution because this attracted those people who lived in London,

08:35.760 --> 08:41.520
knew the city very well, and finally, finally, finally, could pay boss in a taxi.

08:41.760 --> 08:49.600
Yeah, brilliant. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this sounds like a very cute story,

08:50.560 --> 08:56.400
but there's much more than meets the eye. Because what we have found is that breakthrough

08:56.400 --> 09:02.320
innovation, extraordinary results happen when people decide to finally break the standards

09:02.320 --> 09:09.040
or the norms in their industry or professional field. And you see this over and over again.

09:09.040 --> 09:14.240
For example, if you would have a furniture business and one day you would decide to no

09:14.240 --> 09:19.520
longer assemble furniture for your customers, probably you would end up with a company called

09:20.480 --> 09:27.200
IKEA. Another example, if you own a computer business and one day you would decide to no

09:27.200 --> 09:34.160
longer sell your computer using a physical store, probably you would end up with a company called

09:34.160 --> 09:41.840
Dell Computers. Yeah. So ladies and gentlemen, what it tells us there is a method to the madness.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.680
And by understanding that the majority is always wrong when it comes to high performance,

09:47.680 --> 09:55.920
finally you have the opportunity to quit fixing things and move to massive innovation instead.

09:56.240 --> 10:05.520
Ladies and gentlemen, the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, once said that the object of life

10:06.640 --> 10:13.760
is not to side with the majority. But the object of life is to escape finding oneself

10:13.760 --> 10:20.720
joining the ranks of the clinically insane. If you do what everyone else is doing,

10:21.360 --> 10:26.720
you're not distinguishing yourself and you're probably stuck. And this is why when it comes

10:26.720 --> 10:34.400
to high performance, the majority is always wrong. This is what we know. We know that three percent

10:34.400 --> 10:42.000
of people are able to achieve extraordinary results. And each of you can become part of those three

10:42.000 --> 10:47.680
percent by deciding as of today to break your industry standards and to break your industry norms.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.920
The alternative, of course, is that you become part of the ninety seven percent who in the end

10:53.920 --> 11:07.920
works for those three percent. And as of today, that choice is completely yours. Thank you very much.
