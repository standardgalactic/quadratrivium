1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
My name is Cliff Lampy and I'm here to convince you over the next 13 minutes that social media

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,880
is good for you.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,280
Now the natural question you want to ask yourself right now is why did they get an old gray-haired

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,200
Sasquatch up here to tell people that social, especially a group of young people that social

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,960
media is good for them.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,800
And one of the first things I want to convince you of is that there's actually a science

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,200
of social media.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,720
So all of my adult academic life I've been studying social media.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,960
We used to not call it that, but it was still online interaction.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,800
And now the world has moved with me.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,400
So there is hundreds, if not thousands of scholars across the world who are studying

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,080
the effects of social media, not just on people, but on society as a whole.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,120
Facebook itself is hiring hundreds of PhDs out of top universities to study the social

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
effects of social media.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,120
And all social media companies and all universities across the world are really taking this on

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,360
as an endeavor.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,280
And social media is good for us, however, is that the root of so many of those questions.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,720
And in spite of or because of some of this, there's a very common narrative that social

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,400
media is actually very bad for us, right?

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,120
So Prince Ea really gave a nice, I think, introduction to this, sorry.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,520
Where he talks, you've all seen this video, where the title of the video is Can We Auto-Correct

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Humanity?

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,680
Where he gives a really nice spoken word introduction to the idea that technology is driving us

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,080
further apart.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,320
What instead of enhancing intimate relationships, what technology does is drive us away from

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,760
intimate relationships.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,240
And I love this Atlantic monthly article or cover for that exact same idea, right?

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,000
So the idea that even when we're physically present with one another, that we're somehow

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,480
separated, that you're looking at the phone, I'm sure we've all been annoyed by somebody

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,320
when we're talking to them who can't but help look down at their phone, right?

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,840
It happens.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,520
Sherry Turkle at MIT has called this alone together.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,320
That when sometimes we're in social groups and when we're with one another, that we can

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,760
ruin that experience by coming into the mediated environment, that a text will pop up.

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,160
And these devices are cleverly designed, a small buzz.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,840
How many of you just salivate when you feel that little buzz of your iPhone across the

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
table, right?

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Ooh, I might have another trivia crack opportunity here.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,040
The other thing that people worry about is that what we're replacing these close intimate

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,720
relationships with are unreal relationships, right?

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
This replacement theory says that it's not just that these are bad relationships, they're

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
not authentic.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,360
They don't help us at all.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,200
And when I see these fake friends, I think, wow, they're having a much better life than

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I am.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
If I'm scrolling through Twitter or Facebook and I see these very carefully crafted identities

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
that they're making, I might think to myself, you know, my kids aren't as good looking as

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
their kids, you know?

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,680
My students just are not as smart as their students.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
They go on much better vacations than I do.

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
They eat better.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Well, that's probably true.

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,160
But, you know, it creates basically a sadness in us that these things are happening.

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,160
And sometimes I want to say that the social media experience really is quite awful, right?

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,560
So this idea is, is it actually bad or is it just our perception that it's bad?

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,720
So, you know, is this anxiety real, basically?

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,480
You'll be maybe happy to know that this anxiety has existed for as long as we've had technology

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
technologies.

59
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,520
In the early 20th century, somebody said that jazz would replace thinking with just baseless

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,560
inspiration from pundits and jazz.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,960
The telephone was criticized because it would lead to a rude, in-civil society because people

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,120
would just interrupt you over your phone at dinner.

63
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Famously, Plato said in Phaedrus, he quoted Socrates as saying that the invention of writing

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,620
itself, one of our first forms of information technology, would lead to the degradation

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,400
of humanity because it was a dead way of communicating.

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,880
It couldn't respond.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,000
And sometimes these things really are bad.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,480
You know, if you look at things like cyberbullying and you look at what's going on with Gamergate,

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
these things really did cause us to have huge negative reactions.

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,680
People have been really hurt, have had trauma, have in some cases killed themselves because

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,800
of the bullying incidences that they face through these social media channels.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,480
And the, especially harassment of women and people who are disadvantaged in these channels

73
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,800
is something we need to solve as a society.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,960
But I do think that there are instances when, in growing scientific evidence, that social

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,200
media really can be good for you.

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,160
So for the past 10 years, my colleague, Nicole Ellison, and I also at the School of Information,

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,600
have been studying the relationship between social network sites and a concept called social

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
capital.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Most of you have probably heard that term.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,200
It's basically the idea of resources or things you can get from your social connections.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Basically, what can be in a social network provide you as another type of resource.

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
So having social capital means, for instance, in a neighborhood, means that your neighbors

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,120
might help you dig out of the snow, which was very useful for us in Michigan this year.

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,840
But it can also mean that they provide you emotional support, or it can mean that they

85
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
give you physical resources like money or help moving.

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,080
But sometimes it's just that they provide you with a new worldview, new insights into

87
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,120
what it's like to be a person not like you.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,240
The idea behind the relationship between social media and social capital is that communication

89
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,440
of all forms helps us to build relationships.

90
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,080
We actually know from a long history in sociology that to build a relationship and to build

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,360
energy into a friendship means investing time and actual effort into that relationship.

92
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,480
Now, where social media plays a role in all of this is we tend to think about the effects

93
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,040
of these technologies only on our very close relationships.

94
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,840
We have lots of ways of talking to our close relationships.

95
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,520
When I talk to my best friend or I speak with my spouse, hopefully we're not just communicating

96
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
over Facebook.

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,080
Hopefully we do communicate over Facebook, but hopefully we also meet face-to-face and

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,480
the variety of other ways that we have.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,200
What social media makes different is this group of weak ties.

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Weak ties are colleagues or casual acquaintances, people who are not like us.

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,240
And these casual acquaintances provide us with a lot of benefits.

102
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,520
The people around you are a lot like you.

103
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,100
That's the effect of homophily.

104
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,260
You surround yourself pretty much with people who are like you and that's okay.

105
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,460
But what weak ties provide you is different information.

106
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,820
Maybe it's a conservative viewpoint.

107
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,780
Maybe it's somebody who's lived in a different city.

108
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,060
These weak ties can provide you with novel information and resources and be hugely powerful

109
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,460
for the types of benefits that you get out of these sites.

110
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,900
Even really ephemeral relationships can be incredibly powerful.

111
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,980
So here's a great example from just a couple of months ago here on University of Michigan's

112
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
campus.

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,660
Yik Yak, which if you don't know it, is geolocation-based and incredibly anonymous and incredibly ephemeral.

114
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,340
Here's a person who states a fairly specific, what would be worrisome to me, suicide plan

115
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
in Yik Yak.

116
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,260
And people responded in really great ways to this person.

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,700
I don't know what happened to this person.

118
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,420
It is an anonymous platform.

119
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,340
But what the community did surrounding that, even in a context of anonymity, which we usually

120
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,060
think of as worst case scenario, really does speak to the power of these tools to allow

121
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,420
people to interact.

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,620
In this case, Yik Yak's anonymity probably allowed this person to state a feeling they

123
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,700
could not have said to their close friends.

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,540
Or they were trying out maybe a really negative emotion or something they were struggling

125
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,140
with in an anonymous community and that played a role.

126
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,660
We also have seen the power of social media to facilitate organizing.

127
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,740
Not even the most rabid social media guy is going to say that social media caused the

128
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,020
Arab Spring.

129
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,500
But we do know from both Arab Spring, we do know from other social movements, that social

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,380
media basically makes it easier to communicate and to collaborate.

131
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,140
It reduces the cost of doing business if what you want to do is to collect a whole bunch

132
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,260
of other people.

133
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,620
It raises the voice of people who previously were powerless.

134
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,540
It helps people who previously did not have control of the media to be their own media.

135
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,740
And that is powerful across a variety of social media platforms.

136
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,740
We have seen the ability of things like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube to be a change

137
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,100
agent in all matter of social movements over the past three years.

138
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,820
And it's not just the Arab Spring, but it's also Occupy, it's also Ferguson.

139
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,820
It's also here with Being Black at the University of Michigan.

140
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,020
And what that enabled our students to do for their own power and capacity here.

141
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,580
So how does social media foster these things?

142
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,500
What is it about social media that's important?

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,980
One thing is this idea that don't think of social media as a tool, right?

144
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,140
Especially it's not, social media is not one thing.

145
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,620
Even a site like Facebook is not one thing.

146
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,180
Facebook is three dozen applications that have been all tied together as a variety of

147
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
ways to communicate.

148
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,660
And I'm sure you've all seen this.

149
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,140
Your Aunt Mary may only send you Farmville invitations, right?

150
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,420
You may have another friend, you probably only use Facebook to communicate through direct

151
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,300
messages or to check on things.

152
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,220
Each of these applications have a variety of tools that afford, as we would say, different

153
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,060
types of interactions.

154
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,740
Just as a normal fork, not our cool chain fork here, affords the action of picking up

155
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,140
food, tools like sharing a photo or tagging or voting, all afford certain types of social

156
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,900
processes that we really need to think about and consider.

157
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,340
So I like you, I'm sure, I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift, right?

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,700
They have asked me to stop sending fan mail, but that's okay.

159
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,620
And when you look at things like her retweets, she posts a picture of her cat and you see

160
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,140
she gets thousands of retweets and shares and favorites and everything like this.

161
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,300
That is a signal of a community forming around this particular artist.

162
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,900
This is a way for people to basically take control and to curate their own presence.

163
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:37,100
And when you have 54 million followers, you can really shake it off, as it were.

164
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,060
So some of the things that these tools allow you, the visibility of these applications,

165
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,420
the fact that I can send out a post on Twitter and X number of people are going to see it,

166
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,380
especially if it gets retweeted, it just enhances the virality, the opportunity for

167
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,500
people to see content, persistence, the fact that it's available, the fact that once you

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,220
send it out there, it's powerfully available for people in a week or in a day or whenever.

169
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,140
The editability, the fact that you can curate content, the fact that you can create a presence

170
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,860
online for either yourself or for your organization.

171
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,060
One of the important aspects that that all leads to is this idea of social grooming.

172
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,060
One of the consistent findings that we have is that one of the important parts of social

173
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,100
media is this social grooming effect.

174
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,660
So in primate social grooming, it's like I'm picking fleas off of you and eating them.

175
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,060
In humans, it's much more like, hey, I'm going to spend some of my very precious attention

176
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,220
on you.

177
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,980
And that very little bit of attention that I have is going to be dependent on how much

178
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,640
of a relationship we have.

179
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,340
So my spouse demands a decent amount of my attention.

180
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,580
My kid also.

181
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,940
However, a distant friend on Facebook, not so much.

182
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,460
So you see great instances of social grooming on Facebook with things like the birthday

183
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
message.

184
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,660
Now, is getting a Facebook birthday message as good as getting a cake?

185
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,100
And I love me some cake.

186
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
It's not.

187
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,300
But I'm going to tell you what, it's either for most of my Facebook list, it's either

188
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,620
that birthday message or nothing.

189
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,420
I'm not going to send them a cake.

190
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,500
And I don't think I would want 500 cakes to arrive at my door for birthdays.

191
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,460
There are certain types of relationships, those weak ties, where these very lightweight

192
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,340
social grooming things, the likes, the votes, the shares, the comments, things that we often

193
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,820
consider banal are hugely powerful.

194
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,780
What do we need to do to increase our chances to benefit from social media?

195
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I think there's a couple of things.

196
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,340
So how, I think social media can be good, but it takes work, right?

197
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,380
It's not just that we're on social media.

198
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,900
There are two main things I think we need to do.

199
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,880
One is we need to become more literate in social media.

200
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,860
We just assume, especially for a younger generation, that they're born knowing how to use the

201
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,580
Twitter and the Facebook, and we throw up our hands and we call it good.

202
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,060
How many of you had social media banned in your high schools, right?

203
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,820
That's where we should be teaching social media, not waiting for you to figure it out

204
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,700
and to get into trouble.

205
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,000
We also need to be really thinking about the design of these things.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,860
This is LO, which really has expanded our opportunity to see new forms of social network

207
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,100
sites and is a reaction to Facebook.

208
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,100
How we use social media and how we decide to use social media is the key secret sauce

209
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
here, right?

210
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,020
Social media is a blank canvas and it's us who's painting.

211
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,820
If you don't like what's on social media, I challenge you to change what you put on

212
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,980
social media because you're the ones who are filling in that content.

213
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,580
Thank you very much.
