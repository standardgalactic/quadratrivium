1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,880
Social media is a drug, and I, like so many people today, am totally addicted.

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm addicted to scrolling.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm addicted to making every account on every social media site look perfect.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm addicted to liking, to commenting, to seeing photos of random celebrities, to seeing

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,880
drama of random celebrities, and to refreshing the same page over and over again.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,760
And with every drug comes a high, a moment when one feels like they're on top of the

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,720
world and nothing can stop them, until everything just comes crashing down again.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,520
For me, even if the picture I've posted looks nothing like me or isn't real at all, when

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,160
the likes in the comments start pouring in, that's the high.

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,880
I feel people must like me, my self-esteem goes up, and I feel this temporary happiness

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,840
and this temporary joy, until a couple hours pass by, and the likes in the comments slow

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,080
down, and me and my self-esteem just kind of go crashing down again.

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Social media can slash down your confidence, and in a fraction of a second make you feel

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,240
like the loneliest person in the world.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,080
And this is a problem that persists now within our modern society.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,160
With a couple of taps on a smartphone, anyone can make any account on almost any social

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,120
media site and make up a whole life that they don't even have.

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,080
And as our technology gets better every single day, it becomes easier and easier for people

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,240
to post a picture where they look 20 pounds skinnier, to photoshop themselves into a party

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,960
they never went to, or in more extreme cases do things like this, where they put a toilet

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,480
seat up against a window, so it looks like they're going on an exotic vacation, even

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,840
if they're actually not.

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,960
This phenomenon is particularly prominent in what is now known as influencers on social

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,000
media.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Influencers look like they live the amazing life.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,080
They're usually on any social media platform, but specifically Instagram and YouTube and

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,120
have millions of followers or subscribers.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,400
As I said before, their life looks perfect and even companies use them to promote products

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,480
for easy advertising.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Looking at a social media influencer can make the average person feel pretty insecure at

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
times.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,840
An example of one of these influencers is James Charles, a 19 year old makeup artist

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,840
with over 15 million followers a minute.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,440
He doesn't look bad in any single photo on his Instagram.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,720
His makeup is always flawless and he never shows you the time or the money it takes to

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,240
put all that on, so it looks quick and easy and like he did it in a minute.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,440
Another one, Hailey Baldwin Bieber.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,760
She has over 18.3 million followers and she posts pictures of herself under the most beautiful

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,640
beaches in the world.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,520
Spoiler alert, nobody wakes up and looks like that.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,400
It takes time, energy, money, and so many different resources.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,560
And I'm not a fancy influencer, but I'll admit I do it myself.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,080
I mean, I know this talk is probably going to be shared somewhere on the internet, so

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,600
I dressed up better than I normally do.

45
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,000
In real life, my hair is large and curly, I wear glasses and I prefer to wear big sweatshirts

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
over anything else.

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,200
But on every single photo on my Instagram, my hair has been straightened, I have my contacts

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,960
in, my makeup's done, and I'm dressed up far better than I do regularly.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,360
Me, influencers, and so many other people now, only put on Instagram what we want other

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
people to see.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
When you're scrolling through Instagram, you only see what the Instagrammer has specifically

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,200
designed, specific moments in their time where they're looking happy and they're dressed

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,920
up and nobody has to see any other part of their life.

54
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,840
According to sociologist Julie Albright from University of Southern California, people's

55
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,880
persona online may be much more fabulous, much more exciting than the everyday life that

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
they're leading.

57
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,160
And this isn't a problem just for teenagers anymore.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,440
I mean, my grandparents have Facebook.

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,600
I was born in 2001 on this weird generation Z millennial cusp, and I'll find that I spend

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,560
hours on Instagram and Snapchat and just end up feeling sorry for myself.

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,360
I wonder why people who I haven't even spoken to in years look like they have their entire

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
life together, and I don't.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,840
I wonder why it looks like everyone's having the best time ever.

64
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
And with these photos quite literally in my face all the time, it's so easy to wonder

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,400
why am I not that pretty, why am I not that skinny, or why am I not that popular or cool.

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,040
I had a conversation with a teacher of mine as well, a millennial who says one of the

67
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
worst parts about social media.

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,920
It's going out to Facebook and seeing people she used to go to school with now raising

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,400
their own families.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
This makes her wonder, is she raising her family right?

71
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,160
And how can she make her son just as good or even better than every single other kid

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,920
she sees on Facebook?

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,360
And I've seen it in my little sister too, Generation Z.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,320
I've seen her swiping through Snapchat wondering how it looks like every other middle schooler

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,680
in the world is the most secure person in the world.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
We all know that's probably not true.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Although social media can make us feel so lonely.

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,680
It's so easy to feel alone when it looks like every other person has it together and you

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
feel like you don't.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,480
So it shouldn't take any big scientific discovery to promote the claim that social media has

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,200
detrimental effects on our mental health.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,800
But scientists have done the study and it's proven true.

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,960
Melissa G. Hunt from University of Pennsylvania stated that using less social media than you

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,200
normally do would lead to significant decreases in both oppression and loneliness.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,560
And George Albrecht from University of Amsterdam stated passive social media use co-occurred

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,840
with a loss of interest, concentration problems, fatigue and loneliness.

87
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
So what do we do?

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
We can't just avoid social media.

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
It's everywhere.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
It's on our news.

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
It's in our schools.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
It's in our homes.

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
It's in our workplaces.

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,480
It's impossible to just forget about it.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,560
But it has given us a huge advantage in some ways.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,840
We have the ability to communicate more than ever before.

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,640
And that's amazing.

98
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm about to go to college and I've talked to people from all around the world that

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,280
I'll be going to school with next year and I've talked with my roommate so many times.

100
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,440
When my parents went to college, they had no idea who they'd be living with for the

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,080
next year.

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,800
And my TED Talks from the past few years have been put on YouTube and my message about mental

103
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,240
health has spread to people who I will never know.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,320
So in the words of Stanley and his favorite comic book, Spider-Man, with great power comes

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,080
great responsibility.

106
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Social media has given us an amazing advantage to communicate, to share ideas, to bring people

107
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
from all around the world together.

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,880
But it's also made it easier for people to fake their lives, fake a personality and for

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,880
us to become more insecure.

110
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,960
And going back to the Instagram influencers, it's hard sometimes to just remind ourselves

111
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,600
that not everyone is going to look like the favorite celebrity.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,240
Jamila Jamil, an actress known for the NBC show The Good Place, has now started a campaign

113
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,640
called I-Way.

114
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,800
The purpose of her campaign is to call out and show celebrities and point out to regular

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,880
people that celebrities and influencers have amazing resources to some of the best food,

116
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,680
the best personal trainers, the best gyms, and the best magazine editors in the world.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,080
So no wonder they look better than the average person.

118
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,560
Jamil has also called out celebrities who are now using their fans' weight insecurities

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,920
to sell diet pills so everyone can look just as good as they do.

120
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,520
Jamila has become the beginning of an amazing campaign to make us feel better in our bodies

121
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,800
and not to compare ourselves with every single person we see on the internet.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,760
And sometimes when you're just at your worst, it's better just to delete the apps off your

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,000
phone.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Sometimes as I said, when I'm feeling my worst, I just delete the apps off my phone.

125
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,480
I don't delete the accounts necessarily, but without the apps physically there, there's

126
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,960
nothing for me to be just checking throughout the day.

127
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,320
And usually I can go for weeks out of time until I feel comfortable enough that I can

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,560
redownload it and it won't affect my mental health so much.

129
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,760
So I know a week's hard, but I ask all of you, take one day, just delete the apps off

130
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,920
your phone, whatever it is, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, MySpace, whatever

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,240
it is, delete it for one day, and I promise that it'll be like a huge weight taking off

132
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
your chest.

133
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,400
You may find that you have more time to do things you like, like making music, dancing

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,120
or volunteering with kids.

135
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,920
So if there's one message that you take from this talk, it's I hope that you know you are

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,600
not defined by the amount of likes and comments on your post on social media.

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,880
Social media is not real, and no way can a single account on a social media website encapsulate

138
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,760
the entire brilliant personality of a single human being.

139
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Thank you.

140
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Thank you.
