00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
My name is Cliff Lampy and I'm here to convince you over the next 13 minutes that social media

00:09.360 --> 00:10.880
is good for you.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.280
Now the natural question you want to ask yourself right now is why did they get an old gray-haired

00:14.280 --> 00:19.200
Sasquatch up here to tell people that social, especially a group of young people that social

00:19.200 --> 00:20.960
media is good for them.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.800
And one of the first things I want to convince you of is that there's actually a science

00:23.800 --> 00:25.200
of social media.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.720
So all of my adult academic life I've been studying social media.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.960
We used to not call it that, but it was still online interaction.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.800
And now the world has moved with me.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.400
So there is hundreds, if not thousands of scholars across the world who are studying

00:38.400 --> 00:43.080
the effects of social media, not just on people, but on society as a whole.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.120
Facebook itself is hiring hundreds of PhDs out of top universities to study the social

00:48.120 --> 00:49.680
effects of social media.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.120
And all social media companies and all universities across the world are really taking this on

00:54.120 --> 00:55.360
as an endeavor.

00:55.360 --> 01:00.280
And social media is good for us, however, is that the root of so many of those questions.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.720
And in spite of or because of some of this, there's a very common narrative that social

01:03.720 --> 01:06.400
media is actually very bad for us, right?

01:06.400 --> 01:11.120
So Prince Ea really gave a nice, I think, introduction to this, sorry.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.520
Where he talks, you've all seen this video, where the title of the video is Can We Auto-Correct

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
Humanity?

01:16.520 --> 01:20.680
Where he gives a really nice spoken word introduction to the idea that technology is driving us

01:20.680 --> 01:22.080
further apart.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.320
What instead of enhancing intimate relationships, what technology does is drive us away from

01:26.320 --> 01:27.760
intimate relationships.

01:27.760 --> 01:33.240
And I love this Atlantic monthly article or cover for that exact same idea, right?

01:33.240 --> 01:37.000
So the idea that even when we're physically present with one another, that we're somehow

01:37.000 --> 01:41.480
separated, that you're looking at the phone, I'm sure we've all been annoyed by somebody

01:41.480 --> 01:45.320
when we're talking to them who can't but help look down at their phone, right?

01:45.320 --> 01:47.840
It happens.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.520
Sherry Turkle at MIT has called this alone together.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.320
That when sometimes we're in social groups and when we're with one another, that we can

01:55.320 --> 02:00.760
ruin that experience by coming into the mediated environment, that a text will pop up.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.160
And these devices are cleverly designed, a small buzz.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.840
How many of you just salivate when you feel that little buzz of your iPhone across the

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
table, right?

02:08.840 --> 02:13.080
Ooh, I might have another trivia crack opportunity here.

02:13.080 --> 02:20.040
The other thing that people worry about is that what we're replacing these close intimate

02:20.040 --> 02:22.720
relationships with are unreal relationships, right?

02:22.720 --> 02:28.000
This replacement theory says that it's not just that these are bad relationships, they're

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
not authentic.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.360
They don't help us at all.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.200
And when I see these fake friends, I think, wow, they're having a much better life than

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
I am.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.200
If I'm scrolling through Twitter or Facebook and I see these very carefully crafted identities

02:39.200 --> 02:42.560
that they're making, I might think to myself, you know, my kids aren't as good looking as

02:42.560 --> 02:44.360
their kids, you know?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.680
My students just are not as smart as their students.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.720
They go on much better vacations than I do.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
They eat better.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
Well, that's probably true.

02:50.720 --> 02:57.160
But, you know, it creates basically a sadness in us that these things are happening.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.160
And sometimes I want to say that the social media experience really is quite awful, right?

03:01.160 --> 03:05.560
So this idea is, is it actually bad or is it just our perception that it's bad?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.720
So, you know, is this anxiety real, basically?

03:08.720 --> 03:12.480
You'll be maybe happy to know that this anxiety has existed for as long as we've had technology

03:12.480 --> 03:13.480
technologies.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.520
In the early 20th century, somebody said that jazz would replace thinking with just baseless

03:17.520 --> 03:22.560
inspiration from pundits and jazz.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.960
The telephone was criticized because it would lead to a rude, in-civil society because people

03:26.960 --> 03:30.120
would just interrupt you over your phone at dinner.

03:30.120 --> 03:35.520
Famously, Plato said in Phaedrus, he quoted Socrates as saying that the invention of writing

03:35.520 --> 03:39.620
itself, one of our first forms of information technology, would lead to the degradation

03:39.620 --> 03:42.400
of humanity because it was a dead way of communicating.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.880
It couldn't respond.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.000
And sometimes these things really are bad.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.480
You know, if you look at things like cyberbullying and you look at what's going on with Gamergate,

03:52.480 --> 03:56.720
these things really did cause us to have huge negative reactions.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.680
People have been really hurt, have had trauma, have in some cases killed themselves because

04:01.680 --> 04:05.800
of the bullying incidences that they face through these social media channels.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.480
And the, especially harassment of women and people who are disadvantaged in these channels

04:10.480 --> 04:14.800
is something we need to solve as a society.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.960
But I do think that there are instances when, in growing scientific evidence, that social

04:18.960 --> 04:22.200
media really can be good for you.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.160
So for the past 10 years, my colleague, Nicole Ellison, and I also at the School of Information,

04:26.160 --> 04:29.600
have been studying the relationship between social network sites and a concept called social

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
capital.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.000
Most of you have probably heard that term.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.200
It's basically the idea of resources or things you can get from your social connections.

04:37.480 --> 04:42.320
Basically, what can be in a social network provide you as another type of resource.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.520
So having social capital means, for instance, in a neighborhood, means that your neighbors

04:45.520 --> 04:50.120
might help you dig out of the snow, which was very useful for us in Michigan this year.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.840
But it can also mean that they provide you emotional support, or it can mean that they

04:53.840 --> 04:57.280
give you physical resources like money or help moving.

04:57.280 --> 05:01.080
But sometimes it's just that they provide you with a new worldview, new insights into

05:01.080 --> 05:04.120
what it's like to be a person not like you.

05:04.120 --> 05:09.240
The idea behind the relationship between social media and social capital is that communication

05:09.240 --> 05:12.440
of all forms helps us to build relationships.

05:12.440 --> 05:18.080
We actually know from a long history in sociology that to build a relationship and to build

05:18.080 --> 05:24.360
energy into a friendship means investing time and actual effort into that relationship.

05:24.360 --> 05:29.480
Now, where social media plays a role in all of this is we tend to think about the effects

05:29.480 --> 05:33.040
of these technologies only on our very close relationships.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.840
We have lots of ways of talking to our close relationships.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.520
When I talk to my best friend or I speak with my spouse, hopefully we're not just communicating

05:40.520 --> 05:41.520
over Facebook.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.080
Hopefully we do communicate over Facebook, but hopefully we also meet face-to-face and

05:45.080 --> 05:47.480
the variety of other ways that we have.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.200
What social media makes different is this group of weak ties.

05:51.200 --> 05:55.200
Weak ties are colleagues or casual acquaintances, people who are not like us.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.240
And these casual acquaintances provide us with a lot of benefits.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.520
The people around you are a lot like you.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.100
That's the effect of homophily.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.260
You surround yourself pretty much with people who are like you and that's okay.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.460
But what weak ties provide you is different information.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.820
Maybe it's a conservative viewpoint.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.780
Maybe it's somebody who's lived in a different city.

06:12.780 --> 06:18.060
These weak ties can provide you with novel information and resources and be hugely powerful

06:18.060 --> 06:22.460
for the types of benefits that you get out of these sites.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.900
Even really ephemeral relationships can be incredibly powerful.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.980
So here's a great example from just a couple of months ago here on University of Michigan's

06:28.980 --> 06:29.980
campus.

06:29.980 --> 06:35.660
Yik Yak, which if you don't know it, is geolocation-based and incredibly anonymous and incredibly ephemeral.

06:35.660 --> 06:40.340
Here's a person who states a fairly specific, what would be worrisome to me, suicide plan

06:40.340 --> 06:41.620
in Yik Yak.

06:41.620 --> 06:45.260
And people responded in really great ways to this person.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.700
I don't know what happened to this person.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.420
It is an anonymous platform.

06:48.420 --> 06:52.340
But what the community did surrounding that, even in a context of anonymity, which we usually

06:52.340 --> 06:58.060
think of as worst case scenario, really does speak to the power of these tools to allow

06:58.060 --> 06:59.420
people to interact.

06:59.420 --> 07:03.620
In this case, Yik Yak's anonymity probably allowed this person to state a feeling they

07:03.620 --> 07:06.700
could not have said to their close friends.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.540
Or they were trying out maybe a really negative emotion or something they were struggling

07:10.540 --> 07:15.140
with in an anonymous community and that played a role.

07:15.140 --> 07:18.660
We also have seen the power of social media to facilitate organizing.

07:18.660 --> 07:22.740
Not even the most rabid social media guy is going to say that social media caused the

07:22.740 --> 07:24.020
Arab Spring.

07:24.020 --> 07:28.500
But we do know from both Arab Spring, we do know from other social movements, that social

07:28.500 --> 07:32.380
media basically makes it easier to communicate and to collaborate.

07:32.380 --> 07:37.140
It reduces the cost of doing business if what you want to do is to collect a whole bunch

07:37.140 --> 07:38.260
of other people.

07:38.260 --> 07:41.620
It raises the voice of people who previously were powerless.

07:41.620 --> 07:46.540
It helps people who previously did not have control of the media to be their own media.

07:46.540 --> 07:50.740
And that is powerful across a variety of social media platforms.

07:50.740 --> 07:55.740
We have seen the ability of things like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube to be a change

07:55.740 --> 07:59.100
agent in all matter of social movements over the past three years.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.820
And it's not just the Arab Spring, but it's also Occupy, it's also Ferguson.

08:02.820 --> 08:05.820
It's also here with Being Black at the University of Michigan.

08:05.820 --> 08:12.020
And what that enabled our students to do for their own power and capacity here.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.580
So how does social media foster these things?

08:13.580 --> 08:16.500
What is it about social media that's important?

08:16.500 --> 08:19.980
One thing is this idea that don't think of social media as a tool, right?

08:19.980 --> 08:22.140
Especially it's not, social media is not one thing.

08:22.140 --> 08:24.620
Even a site like Facebook is not one thing.

08:24.620 --> 08:29.180
Facebook is three dozen applications that have been all tied together as a variety of

08:29.180 --> 08:30.180
ways to communicate.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.660
And I'm sure you've all seen this.

08:31.660 --> 08:36.140
Your Aunt Mary may only send you Farmville invitations, right?

08:36.140 --> 08:39.420
You may have another friend, you probably only use Facebook to communicate through direct

08:39.420 --> 08:41.300
messages or to check on things.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.220
Each of these applications have a variety of tools that afford, as we would say, different

08:46.220 --> 08:48.060
types of interactions.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.740
Just as a normal fork, not our cool chain fork here, affords the action of picking up

08:52.740 --> 08:59.140
food, tools like sharing a photo or tagging or voting, all afford certain types of social

08:59.140 --> 09:02.900
processes that we really need to think about and consider.

09:02.900 --> 09:08.340
So I like you, I'm sure, I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift, right?

09:08.340 --> 09:12.700
They have asked me to stop sending fan mail, but that's okay.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.620
And when you look at things like her retweets, she posts a picture of her cat and you see

09:16.620 --> 09:21.140
she gets thousands of retweets and shares and favorites and everything like this.

09:21.140 --> 09:25.300
That is a signal of a community forming around this particular artist.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.900
This is a way for people to basically take control and to curate their own presence.

09:29.900 --> 09:37.100
And when you have 54 million followers, you can really shake it off, as it were.

09:37.100 --> 09:43.060
So some of the things that these tools allow you, the visibility of these applications,

09:43.060 --> 09:47.420
the fact that I can send out a post on Twitter and X number of people are going to see it,

09:47.420 --> 09:51.380
especially if it gets retweeted, it just enhances the virality, the opportunity for

09:51.380 --> 09:55.500
people to see content, persistence, the fact that it's available, the fact that once you

09:55.500 --> 10:01.220
send it out there, it's powerfully available for people in a week or in a day or whenever.

10:01.220 --> 10:05.140
The editability, the fact that you can curate content, the fact that you can create a presence

10:05.140 --> 10:09.860
online for either yourself or for your organization.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.060
One of the important aspects that that all leads to is this idea of social grooming.

10:13.060 --> 10:17.060
One of the consistent findings that we have is that one of the important parts of social

10:17.060 --> 10:19.100
media is this social grooming effect.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.660
So in primate social grooming, it's like I'm picking fleas off of you and eating them.

10:22.660 --> 10:26.060
In humans, it's much more like, hey, I'm going to spend some of my very precious attention

10:26.060 --> 10:27.220
on you.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.980
And that very little bit of attention that I have is going to be dependent on how much

10:30.980 --> 10:32.640
of a relationship we have.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.340
So my spouse demands a decent amount of my attention.

10:35.340 --> 10:36.580
My kid also.

10:36.580 --> 10:39.940
However, a distant friend on Facebook, not so much.

10:39.940 --> 10:45.460
So you see great instances of social grooming on Facebook with things like the birthday

10:45.460 --> 10:46.460
message.

10:46.460 --> 10:49.660
Now, is getting a Facebook birthday message as good as getting a cake?

10:49.660 --> 10:52.100
And I love me some cake.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.100
It's not.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.300
But I'm going to tell you what, it's either for most of my Facebook list, it's either

10:56.300 --> 10:57.620
that birthday message or nothing.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.420
I'm not going to send them a cake.

10:59.420 --> 11:03.500
And I don't think I would want 500 cakes to arrive at my door for birthdays.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.460
There are certain types of relationships, those weak ties, where these very lightweight

11:07.460 --> 11:13.340
social grooming things, the likes, the votes, the shares, the comments, things that we often

11:13.340 --> 11:16.820
consider banal are hugely powerful.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.780
What do we need to do to increase our chances to benefit from social media?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.780
I think there's a couple of things.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.340
So how, I think social media can be good, but it takes work, right?

11:24.340 --> 11:26.380
It's not just that we're on social media.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.900
There are two main things I think we need to do.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.880
One is we need to become more literate in social media.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.860
We just assume, especially for a younger generation, that they're born knowing how to use the

11:35.860 --> 11:39.580
Twitter and the Facebook, and we throw up our hands and we call it good.

11:39.580 --> 11:43.060
How many of you had social media banned in your high schools, right?

11:43.060 --> 11:46.820
That's where we should be teaching social media, not waiting for you to figure it out

11:46.820 --> 11:48.700
and to get into trouble.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.000
We also need to be really thinking about the design of these things.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.860
This is LO, which really has expanded our opportunity to see new forms of social network

11:55.860 --> 11:59.100
sites and is a reaction to Facebook.

11:59.100 --> 12:03.100
How we use social media and how we decide to use social media is the key secret sauce

12:03.100 --> 12:04.100
here, right?

12:04.100 --> 12:07.020
Social media is a blank canvas and it's us who's painting.

12:07.020 --> 12:10.820
If you don't like what's on social media, I challenge you to change what you put on

12:10.820 --> 12:14.980
