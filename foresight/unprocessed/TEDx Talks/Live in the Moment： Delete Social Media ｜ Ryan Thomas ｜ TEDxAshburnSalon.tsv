0	12340	Hi, everyone.
12340	21160	I stand here with a simple offer, an offer that, if accepted, yields instantaneous results
21160	25120	and inevitable positive consequences.
25120	33780	My offer is this, the chance to purge yourself of social media and reclaim your personal identity.
33780	41120	I challenge everyone to try going one week without social media, and I guarantee it will
41120	43200	change your life.
43200	48760	I can attest to this because I personally have been without any social media for almost
48760	55920	a year, and it's completely changed the way I view the world.
55920	59840	I'm not saying that all social media is bad.
59840	65840	Social media can be used for marketing or to spread a positive message to the world.
65840	76320	However, apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat are taking over our lives.
76320	82280	They're taking us out of the present moment and causing us to exist only in a virtual
82280	87240	world, and nobody should live like that.
87240	91800	Social media has taken over astonishingly quickly.
91800	97040	If you think about it, when we meet a new person, the norm is no longer to ask them for
97040	98920	their phone number.
98920	106000	The norm is to friend them on Facebook or ask for their Snapchat or Twitter username.
106040	112000	In 2008, only 24% of the US population had a social media profile.
112000	115760	Now 81% has one.
115760	123080	This astronomical growth is because social media is seen as a do-it-all platform.
123080	128760	It's widely replaced texting and email in a lot of cases, and it's used as our main
128760	131280	source of news.
131280	139400	This leads to people spending hours a day with their noses just glued to their phones.
139400	145040	Psychologists at Trent Nottingham University found that we spend twice as much time on
145040	154280	our phones as we think we do, and that amount of time is five hours a day, nearly a third
154280	157880	of our entire waking lives.
157880	164680	I'm sure you're familiar with this site.
164680	166040	That used to be me.
166040	171440	In fact, I would wake up every morning and immediately reach for my phone.
171440	176800	The amount of notifications I had would determine how good my morning was.
176800	178300	Yay!
178300	180680	People want to talk to me!
180680	186360	I would spend one to two hours thoughtlessly scrolling through all my social media profiles
186680	188760	before even getting out of bed.
188760	195520	I would check Twitter, then Snapchat, then Instagram, then go back to Twitter to see
195520	200600	if anything new had been posted just in the last 30 minutes.
200600	207960	I was an addict wasting my time, and the time that I was wasting was being spent looking
207960	214200	at other people's posts and seeing how I thought other people lived.
214200	221240	This influenced me to shape my life in a similar way, and I took on the values of what
221240	224720	I saw online.
224720	229040	In hindsight, I wasn't living my life at all.
229040	232380	I was living society's life.
232380	236000	This is one of the biggest problems with social media.
236000	242360	It causes people to live their life based on some societal standard.
242360	245520	This has always had an instinct to fit in.
245520	250760	Collaboration and cooperation were necessary for our species to survive.
250760	257180	Because of this, a sense of belonging is one of the most sought after and rewarding feelings
257180	259880	anyone can experience.
259880	266400	Think of the feeling of your favorite sports team winning the big game, or finally finishing
266400	272120	a group project where each member of the group knew their role and carried it out perfectly.
273040	279360	Successful group interaction triggers a firing of the pleasure centers in the brain, and releases
279360	285000	amounts of dopamine synonymous with drug use.
285000	293400	A feeling of belonging is sought in humans like drug addicts seek their next fix.
293400	297280	And social media is designed to exploit this.
297280	303720	All the little features, like comments, likes, and being able to share posts, are just gimmicks
303720	307720	designed to get us hooked by causing dopamine to be released.
314200	320440	I was guiltier of just posting what I thought everyone wanted to see than anyone.
320440	327080	I knew that on social media, I was simply crafting an image of myself.
327080	329480	But I didn't care.
329480	338000	I loved attention, and I loved the ability to portray myself any way I wanted.
338000	339760	It wasn't me.
339760	345120	I was losing touch with my authentic self.
345120	352480	And this problem manifests mainly in my generation, as teenagers have grown up with the internet.
352480	357440	We've spent our whole lives interacting with our peers online.
357440	362960	We're more comfortable on our phones than in a face-to-face interaction.
362960	367760	And this has catastrophic consequences on our mental health.
367760	373160	Studies have shown that kids who spend more time on their phones have less developed frontal
373160	374880	cortexes.
374880	382320	And we need our frontal cortex to plan for the future, think rationally, and solve problems.
382320	394520	My generation is losing those abilities because we can't focus on anything besides our phones.
394520	399200	Combine that with the fact that social media is our main source of forming connections with
399200	401320	other people.
401320	410760	And it's easy to see why teen depression has skyrocketed 33 percent just since 2010.
410760	416680	And teen suicides have gone up 31 percent in the same period.
416680	421400	We are killing ourselves just to fit in.
421400	426360	Yet, everyone around me somehow thinks they're better than social media.
426360	429720	They tell me, oh, I only use it to look at memes.
429720	433760	Or, I just like to keep up with my friends that I can't see every day.
433760	440520	Yet, the conversation that I constantly hear is gossip and judgment.
440520	442680	Did you see my post?
442680	444360	Did you like it?
444360	446080	Did you see her post?
446080	448960	Why was she hanging out with him?
448960	450120	Why did he say that?
450120	451840	He's so creepy.
451840	454760	Why did she post that?
454760	458120	She has no self-respect.
458120	464160	The people around me are addicted to stalking other people.
465160	472440	Yet, maintain the assertion that they're somehow above it all.
472440	478320	And all the features that I talked about earlier, the gimmicks, they can't replace real life
478320	479320	interaction.
479320	485960	A like can't replace a smile or a compliment.
485960	489240	But we treat it as if it can.
489240	495440	We allow ourselves to become less social and lose touch with the face-to-face interactions
495440	498360	that really matter.
498360	504600	In a study by Pew Research Center, 55% of participants said they interact with their
504600	508040	friends online on a daily basis.
508040	514920	Only 33% said they interact with their friends face-to-face on a daily basis.
514920	516880	Think about this.
516880	523120	How many of you have ever pulled out your phone and stared at it just to avoid an awkward
523120	525640	social situation?
525640	529200	I know I see that every day in school.
529200	537680	How many of you have ever taken a long video at a sporting event or concert so you can
537680	544240	relive the moment later or share it with your friends instead of actually making sure that
544240	551280	you're living in the moment and enjoying life as it happens?
551280	555520	Last winter, I was at a crossroads in my life.
555520	561040	I've always been driven, but I really had no idea what I wanted to do.
561040	565640	Track has always been my main sport, but I didn't really think I wanted to run in college.
565640	571240	I've also always had dreams of attending a top-level academic school.
571240	574800	But schools like that required true excellence.
574800	582680	I had no motivating force and nothing that separated me from the people around me.
582680	589680	I cared more about creating the image that I wanted of myself online than working to
589680	593560	secure the future that I wanted.
593560	597120	Everybody has dreams of greatness when they're a kid.
597120	603960	Everybody wants to live an average and unfulfilling life, yet so few people are willing to put
603960	611400	in the work to developing themselves and unlocking their full potential.
611400	617800	I realized that if I devoted myself to improving on the track, I would have a way of standing
617800	622680	out from other applicants and maybe reaching one of my dream schools.
622680	627720	So I began dedicating myself to track more and attempting to spend less time on social
627720	628720	media.
628720	635720	However, about two weeks into this new routine, I realized that while I was training for track
635720	641960	more, I was spending about the same amount of time on social media.
641960	648640	I was simply shirking my academic duties and losing some sleep.
648640	656080	I had to decide if running track in college and my future was more important to me than
656080	659000	trying to fit in.
659000	661080	And it was.
661080	668240	Slowly but surely, I became disgusted with who I was and I wondered how I had let myself
668240	675040	become so addicted to something that had no value in the long run.
675040	678880	I decided to quit social media cold turkey.
678880	686120	Instantly it was as if a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders.
686120	689400	I began to see the beauty and the world around me.
689400	696800	I discovered my passion for life and I found a sense of individuality and contentment with
696800	700480	who I was.
700480	706440	And the week after I deleted social media, I changed more than I have at any other point
706440	707720	in my life.
707720	715200	I re-evaluated not only my actions, but my mindset, my goals, and my overall attitude
715200	717100	towards life.
717100	724000	I realized that at any given moment, I can be doing anything I want to in the world.
724000	729200	I simply have to choose to do what's best for myself.
729600	737000	Because of this, I'm on my own path now and I'm my own person.
737000	743240	I'm not standing up here proclaiming that I'm a perfect person, devoid of weakness just
743240	745880	because I deleted social media.
745880	753720	But I am claiming that I'm in control of my own happiness and satisfaction with life.
753720	759360	I'm also not claiming that by deleting social media, you will immediately become a better
759360	764280	person, find happiness, and reach your goals.
764280	769680	Deleting social media in itself doesn't bring anything of a direct value to your life.
769680	776160	It's simply an avenue towards individual thought and freedom.
776160	783320	Everybody spends their life searching for happiness and yearning for fulfillment, yet most people
783320	790760	spend so much of it looking at other people's lives online.
790760	796260	If you have the superpower to be present in the moment, and you aren't so preoccupied
796260	803000	with what everyone else is doing, you'll find that life is a little easier.
803000	805200	Happiness is always at hand.
805200	810920	It's easier to treat the people around you with kindness and have straightforward but
810920	813640	profound relationships.
813640	819440	I think the world would be a better place if everyone possessed this skill.
819440	820440	Thank you.
820440	820940	Thank you.
