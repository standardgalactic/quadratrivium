00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,660
When I left university, I would've probably laughed in your face, because let's be honest, it's quite ridiculous.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,380
How did I get here?

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,880
..It's a question II ask myself quite, quite often to be honest,

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,660
..but really I think if we wind back and look at where the beginning of my career started

11
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,880
..it was kind of a different planet.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,720
The side of my university career I was also working in fashion retail.

When our editors wanted us..

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,720
..to request a fashion week ticket for them, we had to use this thing called a fax machine?

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,720
We were on our phones all day but our mouth..

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,720
..was at the receiver and those phones were attached to the desk..

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
..there was no Pinterest, there was no Instagram.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
There wasn't even Twitter.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:30,840
The Devil Wears Prada is actually not a work of fiction at all. It's a pretty accurate representation of what work culture was like on magazines in the noughties.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Some of my editors were comically demanding.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Once, one of them came over to my desk and unrolled the pair of socks that she was wearing, handed them to me and asked me to hand wash them for her

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,840
in the criminal lose and then use a hairdryer to dry them.

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I will never know why.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
It was also pretty poorly paid and when I say pretty I mean extremely.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I worked as a fashion intern for £50 a week expenses for two years and that was nine to nine Monday to Friday for under £3k a year.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,840
It was a really tough gig when you came from a normal person background.

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Both my parents grew up in council houses and I'm the first person in my family to get A levels let alone go to university.

47
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
So there wasn't exactly a trust fund waiting in the wings to tide me through.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:38,840
When I started my first proper job, as in I was on staff, my first salary was £14,500 living in central London and working there too.

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:49,840
By the time I was in my mid 30s as a senior editor, on a national magazine, I was still earning well below the London fridge.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Now look, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of poorly paid jobs out there and most of them, let's be honest, are offering the community slightly more importance than mine.

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:14,840
But it's pretty rare you would be paid so little to do a job which projects such an image of glamour that expects you to be dressed head to toe in designer clothes every day with a perfect blow dry.

52
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:25,840
The disparity between the fantasy of what everyone thought my life was and the reality of how I was actually living in the end got too much for me.

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:41,840
My crunch moment came when I was 31. My husband had just left me and I was in terrible debt and I can remember even though I was working 60 hour weeks having to call my dad up to ask to borrow some money to get a tooth filling.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I just felt like such a failure and what made it all the much worse was that everyone I knew thought I was living this glamorous exciting job, you know, and that I was a success as a person.

55
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I decided to make the break, I quit my job and embarked on a quest to find a way to carry on working in an industry I loved while being able to support myself.

56
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Now, in the midst of all this, the landscape had been changing dramatically.

57
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:28,840
When I first started my final job on magazines, my editor told me to bin my blackberry and set up an Instagram account and pretty soon I'd attracted a few thousand followers who all got to see the fantasy side of my life.

58
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,840
They didn't get to see the divorce or the debt and they definitely never saw my bad hair days.

59
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I set up a small digital agency to help brands create content for their social channels and their online channels and started to really invest time in grabbing my own Instagram profile.

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Soon I became a small player in the social media economy.

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Apologies if you all know this, but for those of you who aren't big users of social media, this is how it works.

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Back in the day, a brand would have heard a certain amount of advertising and marketing budget which would have been divvied up across traditional channels of advertising like billboards, television and magazines, things that we all kind of understood.

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:36,840
These days, a good percentage of that budget goes to people like me and the reason is that as we've built our platforms, we have gained the trust of our followers and that trust has translated into influencing their purchasing decisions.

64
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
It is pretty effective.

65
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:47,840
In fact, what social media has done is turbo charged the power of word of mouth recommendation.

66
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Now don't get me wrong, you can lose the trust of those followers pretty quickly.

67
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:01,840
If tomorrow you log on to my Instagram account and I am suddenly advertising teeth whitening strips, I accept that maybe you'll be leaving the day after.

68
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:12,840
But at the beginning, what brands really wanted to do was to get to work with these influencers who had the highest proportion of followers.

69
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,840
It was all about the huge audiences and a total numbers game.

70
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:28,840
The thing is, those accounts, the ones that got the most followers, were generally all pretty much the same and they projected the same lifestyle.

71
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,840
A wealthy, glamorous world in which nothing had ever gone wrong.

72
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,840
It was a world that I was very, very ofe with, let's just say, coming from fashion magazines.

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,840
My account followed that pattern, that kind of template to a T.

74
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,840
But after about a year of making my money that way, I don't know what it was, but I started to feel a deep sense of unease.

75
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I couldn't put my finger on it.

76
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:08,840
My damasin moment happened, ironically, in Tulum, Mexico, potentially the most Instagrammable destination in the entire world.

77
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,840
I was sitting on my sun lounger, trying to deal with a really tricky email from, let's call it, a challenging client.

78
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,840
In the background, I could hear one of my girlfriends on the end of the phone to her factory dealing with a significant production issue.

79
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,840
To my left was yet another mate who was going through the most brutal breakup.

80
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,840
To my right, another friend who was dealing with some pretty serious family trauma.

81
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,840
All of us were dealing with something either on a professional or personal level.

82
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,840
And then I looked at the pictures we were all posting.

83
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I bet you can imagine what they looked like.

84
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Sunsets, cocktails, pictures of us all together living our best life in designer bikinis, and something inside me just burst.

85
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,840
I felt like I wanted to scream, this is not real life.

86
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,840
None of these girls are this goddamn happy the entire time.

87
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,840
On that trip, I decided that if I was going to carry on making my money this way,

88
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,840
I was also going to have to start talking about the other side of my life too.

89
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I was going to write about my divorce, I was going to write about my debt,

90
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,840
and my eating issues, and my fertility issues,

91
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:45,840
and I was going to ask every woman that I knew in both magazine and social media worlds to do the same too.

92
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,840
On the day that I set up workworkwork.co, I received about 50 emails.

93
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,840
The next day, there was another 50 in my inbox, and it continued for weeks.

94
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,840
And broadly, all of the messages said exactly the same thing.

95
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,840
And that was, thank God someone said something.

96
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,840
The relief was palpable.

97
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,840
And don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy.

98
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Telling everybody that you're quite poor after you've been creating this kind of image of glamorous globetrotter for 10 years,

99
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,840
let's be honest, it's a bit awkward, but it also felt so, to be honest.

100
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,840
As I was doing the interviews for the website, one theme kept cropping up time and time again,

101
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,840
and that was the psychological impact of viewing so many images of perfection all day every day.

102
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:52,840
And this was a universal situation, it didn't matter where these people came from, it didn't matter how much they had.

103
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Over my time on social media, it's made me feel many things.

104
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Unattractive, overweight, stupid and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.

105
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,840
It's made me feel lonely, it's made me feel really unpopular.

106
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,840
It's made me feel poor, but also that I should be spending money that I actually didn't have.

107
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Ultimately, it's fuelled my insecurities.

108
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:28,840
But this isn't a niche issue, and the more and more I spoke with other women, the more and more I understood that we all feel the same.

109
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,840
And that's why I decided it was really time to tackle this problem head on.

110
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Four months ago, I released my book, Why Social Media's Ruining a Life,

111
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,840
and you may say, biting the hand that feeds, I've heard it.

112
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:56,840
But equally, I managed to interview international influencers with a following of over 10 million academics, researchers, psychoanalysts, therapists, plastic surgeons,

113
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,840
and all the evidence in a highly abbreviated nutshell pointed into the same direction.

114
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:12,840
If we continue to use social media the way we have been, we will seriously jeopardise our future health and happiness.

115
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Now, don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic stories about social media as well.

116
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:25,840
And as humans, it's the way we use technology rather than technology being necessarily nefarious.

117
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,840
For myself, social media has enabled me to continue working while looking after my little boy.

118
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,840
It's meant that I have found this holy grail of working in fashion while being able to support myself.

119
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Importantly, it's meant that I will never wash another woman's pair of socks.

120
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:53,840
But if we do not change both our mindset and our behaviour, this obsessive comparison, soul-destroing envy,

121
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,840
passive social media use, you'll recognise it, the stalking, the creeping, the lurking.

122
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:09,840
We, and generations following us, will continue to be feeling these feelings of deep insecurity.

123
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,840
To underline the point, I went back through my social media feed and started reposting pictures where I'd looked happy as Larry,

124
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,840
but actually my world had been falling apart behind the scenes.

125
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I posted pictures of myself where I'd been in beautiful hotel rooms, but actually I'd just been dumped in that hotel room.

126
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,840
I posted pictures of myself where I was on these dreamy holidays that looked so fantastic,

127
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,840
but I'd actually spent the whole time in a pit of despair thinking about the state of my thighs.

128
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I posted pictures where I'd just had morning sickness off camera.

129
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I posted pictures where I'd just had a row with my boyfriend, and I told those true stories.

130
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Beside each picture, I used the hashtag, why social media is ruining your life.

131
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Soon, other women started posting similar images in solidarity.

132
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,840
A few days later, Sky News got in touch, and then the newspapers and magazines followed, and it went wild.

133
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:23,840
This time, when my inbox was inundated, it was a lot of parents saying that they'd used the campaign to show their kids the difference between the lived life and the online life.

134
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,840
But there were also lots of messages from people that I knew who said that they'd had literally no idea what I was going through,

135
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,840
and that I'd really made them look at social media in a different light.

136
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Now today, social media still pays my mortgage, but I now understand that I have the power to affect change

137
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
and not just send people to their next pair of shoes.

138
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Now don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that fantasy.

139
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,840
You know, magazines, they changed the entire trajectory of my future.

140
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,840
As a teenager looking at them, they were everything.

141
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:12,840
But we need to ground our expectation of reality, of what real life will be like, in the nitty-gritty of what real life is actually like.

142
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Otherwise, the Monday morning commute, the inevitable break-ups, the awful financial struggles that we all go through,

143
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,840
the emotional challenges which, let's be honest, are just part and parcel of a life, they start to feel unbearable.

144
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:40,840
We start to believe that we are the only ones who suffer while the rest of the world swings their Gucci handbag nonchalantly by as they go by on their busy, perfect lives.

145

Everyone has demons, no matter how many followers, no matter how much money you have.

146
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:57,840
And whether you communicate that online or not, they're still there, so you can't use social media to judge how anyone's getting through anything.

147
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Let me give a final example.

148
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Every time I post a picture of myself online, I'll probably have taken a hundred images.

149
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:16,840
I choose one picture to put up, normally the most flattering, and you get to see a 1% glimpse of one moment of my day.

150
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,840
You have no idea what's going on in my head or my heart.

151
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,840
I could have just been sick, I could have just been dumped, I could have just lost my job.

152
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:37,840
So don't let those 1% images affect the way you feel about your real life, the one that you're living beyond the squares and screens.

153
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Thank you so much.
