00:00.000 --> 00:13.120
Where ever you are, you're always using your senses to give you information about the world

00:13.120 --> 00:14.620
around you.

00:14.620 --> 00:21.200
And when you came into the auditorium today, you probably looked around, saw the stage setting,

00:21.200 --> 00:25.640
you might have heard the chatter of people excitedly taking their seats, the quietening

00:25.640 --> 00:28.760
hush, and then the voice of the speaker.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.680
But I wonder how many of you paid attention to the smell of the auditorium.

00:34.680 --> 00:41.080
And actually, we give smell very little attention of all the senses that are giving us information

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
about the world.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.360
It's the one we neglect and we sometimes devalue.

00:46.360 --> 00:52.320
Now that's probably because we think that we only smell when we're sniffing.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.080
It's only when we're sniffing that we actually get some smell.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.440
But that's not true.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.160
As J.J. Gibson, the psychologist, said, we smell because we breathe.

01:03.160 --> 01:08.560
We're actually always being bombarded with lots of volatile molecules.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.160
And off-action is always on.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.440
The processing is always going on.

01:12.440 --> 01:17.320
So the question is, why are we not more aware of it?

01:17.320 --> 01:24.000
Well, lots of people devalue the sense of smell, including rather famous philosophers.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.240
And it's a famous party game that people play.

01:26.240 --> 01:31.240
If I had to lose one of my senses, which would I willingly give up first?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
And it's often smell.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.320
So here's Immanuel Kant saying just that.

01:35.320 --> 01:40.400
Which organic sense is the most ungrateful and also seems the most dispensable, the

01:40.400 --> 01:42.040
sense of smell?

01:42.040 --> 01:47.480
It does not pay to cultivate it or to refine it at all in order to enjoy, for there are

01:47.480 --> 01:54.800
more disgusting objects than pleasant ones, especially in crowded places, like this.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.600
He says, even when we come across something fragrant, the pleasure coming from the sense

01:58.600 --> 02:02.320
of smell is fleeting and transient.

02:02.320 --> 02:08.040
Now that's why I think a lot of people believe that smell could be easily dispensed with.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.560
And a recent survey showed that many teenagers would rather lose their sense of smell than

02:12.560 --> 02:17.760
give up one of their social media accounts.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.000
That's how little we care about our sense of smell.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.640
But that's a mistake.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.720
It's a sense that we only recognize the value of when we lose it.

02:30.720 --> 02:36.680
And when people lose their sense of smell, often because of head injury, a virus, taking

02:36.680 --> 02:43.400
medication, respiratory infections, the sudden loss of a sense of smell comes with a change

02:43.400 --> 02:45.520
in their emotional world.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.800
People feel this less savor to life.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.520
They often develop depression.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.760
And in fact, people who lose their sense of smell are often depressed longer than those

02:54.760 --> 02:57.000
who lose their sight.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.640
It means that we no longer take for granted the familiar people in places around us.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.160
And it's often smell that's giving us that sense of familiarity.

03:07.160 --> 03:12.560
This is wonderful work done by these two sensory scientists in Dresden, Thomas Hummel and Ilona

03:12.560 --> 03:19.040
Croy, who've studied the effects on our quality of life and there's a huge reduction in quality

03:19.040 --> 03:21.400
of life when we lose our sense of smell.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.080
And as we get older, we'll all start to lose our sense of smell.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.280
Just like eyesight and hearing, it will diminish.

03:28.280 --> 03:32.840
The good news is that right now you can improve your sense of smell and I'll tell you a little

03:32.840 --> 03:35.120
bit about that later.

03:35.120 --> 03:41.280
But that way in which smell is part of the environment and makes us feel that we're somewhere

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
familiar.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.920
Again, we don't notice it until it's maybe going to be lost.

03:47.920 --> 03:54.240
And the problem here is that smell is very emotionally loaded.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.680
It's very emotionally loaded.

03:55.680 --> 04:02.600
Smell memories, odor memories, key into some of our oldest and our most emotional memories.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.640
The smell of your grandmother's kitchen, the smell of a place where you were on holiday.

04:06.640 --> 04:13.160
And some of those things come back when you just get the briefest whiff of the odor again.

04:13.160 --> 04:21.160
And the olfactory cortex here projects directly to centers of emotion and memory, the amygdala

04:21.160 --> 04:23.240
and the entorhinal cortex.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.080
Unlike the other senses, it's not gated by the thalamus.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.160
It doesn't go round the brain before it gets to those emotional centers.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.600
It's very direct.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.560
And that's why we get a big charge, emotional charge.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.800
And when people lose their sense of smell, their emotions are depressed.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.720
Their emotions are not getting fed with those regular signals.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.160
Here's a gallery I know very well.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.960
And I want to invite you to think about museums and galleries that you like to visit.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.480
They will have a characteristic smell.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.760
You probably, if you think about it, know how they smell.

04:55.760 --> 05:01.480
This is a Kelvin Grove art gallery and museum in Glasgow, my hometown.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.040
And it recently went through a major multi-million pound refit.

05:06.040 --> 05:12.000
And when it was going to be closed for four years to be refitted, the Glaswegians said,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.880
almost as one, don't change the smell.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.520
Don't change the smell.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
Why?

05:17.520 --> 05:21.680
Because they had been there as children, taken there by schools.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.280
They had gone back as adults and recognized it and perhaps taken their own children in

05:26.280 --> 05:27.280
turn.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.360
And it always had that familiar smell that they knew so well, something between stone

05:32.360 --> 05:36.920
and furniture polish, but was very distinctive and characteristic of this place.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.560
And people didn't want to lose it.

05:39.560 --> 05:45.040
And people often think that their sense of smell is probably not so important because,

05:45.040 --> 05:48.240
unlike other animals, maybe we're not good at smelling.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.240
Dogs are very good at smelling.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.760
Rats are good at smelling.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.840
But maybe we humans are not.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.440
But it's not that we are poor at smelling.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.440
In fact, we've got a superb sense of smell.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.520
We just don't trust our nose.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.240
And we don't use it because we're not on all fours.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.560
The fact that we're standing on two legs and we're looking and hearing, we use those to

06:07.560 --> 06:09.360
detect the environment.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.200
But nothing stops us from being able to be like a dog.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.960
And this is wonderful work by Noam Sobel and colleagues when he was in Berkeley, where

06:17.960 --> 06:24.680
he got his undergraduates to put on blindfolds and to follow an odor trail that was chocolate

06:24.680 --> 06:25.960
odor.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.360
And the chocolate odor was laid out on the grass.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.960
And it turns out that humans can get to the source of the chocolate.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.480
They're a little slower than dogs.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.760
They're not as direct.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.680
But they can do it.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.720
So we're underutilizing our sense of smell.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.920
It's there and it can be used.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.000
Then our sense of smell is important for signals that are social signals we give off to one

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
another.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.920
Our body odors actually convey information.

06:53.920 --> 06:59.520
And we give chemo signals that can affect our own emotions.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.600
Again lovely work by the Sobel group from the Weissmann Institute shows that there are

07:04.600 --> 07:10.760
chemical signals in emotional tears that reduce men's testosterone and affect their

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
libido.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.880
Who knew?

07:13.880 --> 07:18.200
Similarly, we can smell fear from other people.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.920
Lovely work by Bettina Pauls and Denise Chen showing that we can smell and be affected

07:22.920 --> 07:26.760
by the body odor of someone who's undergone fear.

07:26.760 --> 07:31.400
And how they do that is they take t-shirts of people who've been skydiving and then t-shirts

07:31.400 --> 07:36.480
of people who've been doing vigorous exercise and it's the skydiving t-shirts, the smell

07:36.480 --> 07:43.040
of fear that we can recognize as the fearful ones and also can affect us.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.320
So we're probably chemo signaling to one another.

07:46.320 --> 07:52.480
Right now your near neighbors are giving off scent and of course scent occupies the space

07:52.480 --> 07:53.920
between us.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.300
It's there for the taking but we often don't pay attention to it.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.600
We use it to recognize our nearest and dearest.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.880
Just by their clothes, by t-shirts you can recognize whether this is a relative of yours

08:06.880 --> 08:11.880
or not and I know you may have some relatives in mind and think I'd know him or her anywhere

08:12.320 --> 08:14.280
but in general we can do this.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.600
In general we can tell is this person related to me.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.400
And not only that, smell is also involved in sexual selection.

08:24.400 --> 08:30.520
So it turns out that you're more attracted to people whose body odor indicates that their

08:30.520 --> 08:37.600
immune system is further away from yours and that if they're sent and their body odor signals

08:37.600 --> 08:43.040
that they're too close to you, you wouldn't find them so attractive.

08:43.040 --> 08:48.600
Somebody's major histocompatibility complex in humans called the human leukocyte antigens

08:48.600 --> 08:52.780
are actually partly responsible for how they smell.

08:52.780 --> 08:58.580
So your smell is due to three things, is due to your immune system, what you eat and the

08:58.580 --> 09:00.600
bacteria on you.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.520
So when we smell people we can, as it were, be sensitive to their attractiveness because

09:07.520 --> 09:12.620
of the distance their immune system is from ours and that's going to help the chance of

09:12.620 --> 09:14.920
successful reproduction.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.400
So it's very interesting that somebody may be very attractive, very nice, you might have

09:19.400 --> 09:23.200
known them for a long time and think oh, they'll be a lovely companion but if they don't smell

09:23.200 --> 09:27.560
right there's nothing you can do.

09:27.560 --> 09:33.440
And equally, equally, you can sometimes find a stranger and you just suddenly think wow,

09:33.440 --> 09:39.360
they're really attractive and I was just so attracted to that person that it might be

09:39.360 --> 09:43.080
love it for smell, not love it for sight.

09:43.080 --> 09:49.840
So don't neglect it but are all the things I'm talking to you about things that go on

09:49.840 --> 09:50.840
unconsciously?

09:50.840 --> 09:55.800
Are these ways in which olfactory processing happens but it's not in consciousness?

09:56.320 --> 10:00.640
And might it be that it's only every now and then and occasionally things break through

10:00.640 --> 10:04.080
into consciousness that smells reach us?

10:04.080 --> 10:08.600
And that might happen because smells are a little overpowering, it might be that they're

10:08.600 --> 10:13.420
a little disgusting but it's not just disgusting odours that capture our attention, it can

10:13.420 --> 10:20.040
also be intoxicating odours, wow, that smells incredible, this smells delicious and of course

10:20.040 --> 10:25.600
we can direct our attention to bring smell into consciousness when we pay this sort of

10:25.600 --> 10:29.240
attention to people.

10:29.240 --> 10:34.000
And we all, we all go in for sniffing at times whether it's just to find out whether the

10:34.000 --> 10:39.480
milk in the fridge is fresh and whether we should continue putting it in our tea or coffee.

10:39.480 --> 10:44.400
Now of course, as I said earlier, smell can be trained unlike your eyesight and hearing,

10:44.400 --> 10:49.560
you can actually improve your sense of smell and that's what leads to perfumers and wine

10:49.560 --> 10:55.040
tasters and coffee tasters being better than the rest of us and in fact there are changes

10:55.040 --> 11:01.280
in the brain, perfumers have more grey matter in the entorhinal cortex and sommeliers have

11:01.280 --> 11:07.320
more dense grey matter in their orbital frontal cortex so there is really development you

11:07.320 --> 11:11.840
can do that will make a difference, a real difference to the kind of information you

11:11.840 --> 11:14.720
can extract and what you know.

11:14.720 --> 11:20.760
But of course we might wonder how good is our sense of smell, other individual differences

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
that matter?

11:22.480 --> 11:29.680
Well yes there are and on average women are better in their sense of smell than men on

11:29.680 --> 11:34.200
average which doesn't mean there won't be men with a very good sense of smell and women

11:34.200 --> 11:36.040
with a poor sense of smell.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.160
But how do we know what people's sense of smell is, well we can test it.

11:40.160 --> 11:46.560
We can use these sniffing sticks, a really good test devised by Thomas Hummel's group

11:46.560 --> 11:50.960
in Dresden where these are pens that you smell and some of them are not as good as

11:50.960 --> 11:57.960
other pens we might enjoy on occasion as teachers but these allow us to detect, these

11:57.960 --> 12:01.840
allow us to detect somebody's threshold, when is there a difference between no odor

12:01.840 --> 12:08.640
and an odor being noticeable, discrimination are two odors the same or different and finally

12:08.640 --> 12:15.240
identification is that rose or mint or leather or tar when you smell one of these pens and

12:15.240 --> 12:20.880
the funny thing is that lots of people who take this test will say to you oh I'm no good

12:20.920 --> 12:26.040
at smelling I really can't do this and in fact they're very very accurate they've got

12:26.040 --> 12:33.240
very high score and in the contrary sense there are people who continuously complain

12:33.240 --> 12:37.960
about their awareness of odors oh I'm very bothered by smells I can smell smells and

12:37.960 --> 12:42.240
I'm perturbed by them I've got very good sense of smell but when we test them they don't

12:42.240 --> 12:47.840
have a good sense of smell they're either average or poor so our awareness of how good

12:47.880 --> 12:52.840
our sense of smell is doesn't correlate with how accurate we are that might be a reason

12:52.840 --> 12:59.840
why we neglect smell but a place where we don't neglect it and where odor really makes a

13:00.760 --> 13:06.640
difference to our experience consciously is in eating but here smell doesn't get the

13:06.640 --> 13:13.640
recognition it's due most of what we call tasting is due to smell so when you think

13:13.760 --> 13:20.760
of what the tongue can provide it can provide salt sweet sour bitter umami savory that's

13:20.840 --> 13:27.840
about it and yet you can taste strawberry mango melon peach you don't have peach receptors

13:28.240 --> 13:33.920
on your tongue that's all coming from smell so people who lose their sense of smell will

13:33.920 --> 13:39.120
often go to a doctor and say I can't taste anything and a good medic will put some salt

13:39.120 --> 13:44.560
on their tongue or lemon juice or sugar and say can you taste that and they'll say yes

13:44.560 --> 13:50.360
but that's all I can taste and now they realize how much of tasting was due to smell but we

13:50.360 --> 13:55.560
confuse taste and smell a lot if I gave you vanilla pods to smell you would say smell

13:55.560 --> 14:01.560
sweet the sweet's a taste not a smell and if I clipped a little bit of the vanilla pod

14:01.560 --> 14:07.680
off and got you to chew it there's no sweetness in there at all it's quite bitter so what's

14:07.680 --> 14:13.520
happening what's happening is the brain is going from its usual association of combining

14:13.520 --> 14:20.520
vanilla aroma with things that have sucrose or sugar chocolate ice cream custard biscuits

14:22.560 --> 14:27.020
and it's saying whenever I get that aroma it's usually accompanied by something sweet

14:27.020 --> 14:32.640
and you transfer that quality of sweetness onto a smell even though it's not really there

14:32.760 --> 14:37.720
so we have confusions but smell is playing a huge part in food and not getting a look

14:37.720 --> 14:42.520
in but it's not smell as we usually think of it it's not inhaling molecules from the

14:42.520 --> 14:48.360
outside it's the second source of smell which is going from the mouth to the nose up the

14:48.360 --> 14:52.960
back of the nasopharynx and it's when you swallow or chew food that you pulse odors

14:52.960 --> 14:59.880
up to the nose and that's when you get a big flavor hit so smell along with touch and taste

14:59.960 --> 15:06.720
and temperature are all integrated into a single experience of flavor that we often call taste

15:06.720 --> 15:13.920
and our mistake is not crediting smell for playing the largest part in that experience

15:13.920 --> 15:18.760
but smell doesn't just combine with taste and touch it combines with other senses too

15:18.760 --> 15:23.640
did you know there are odors in shampoo that make your hair feel softer this is strange

15:23.640 --> 15:31.280
so smell interacts with touch interacts with taste now our sense of smell so keen when we're

15:31.280 --> 15:37.000
younger we'll start to diminish as we get older by the age of 70 about quarter of the

15:37.000 --> 15:41.800
population are functionally nosmic that means they don't have a sense of smell and their

15:41.800 --> 15:46.160
quality of life will suffer they'll be more subject to depression they won't take pleasure

15:46.160 --> 15:51.760
in their food they won't recognize the familiarity of people in places around them but we can

15:51.760 --> 15:59.560
do something about that because we know from recent research that smell training or factory

15:59.560 --> 16:05.240
training sniffing odors if you get four essential oils and you smell them first thing in the

16:05.240 --> 16:09.960
morning and last thing at night that will preserve your sense of smell longer as you

16:09.960 --> 16:17.520
age and it will also make you cognitively more alert so it turns out that smelling odors

16:17.520 --> 16:23.760
smell training is better for you than Sudoku do that and you'll have a much more active

16:23.760 --> 16:30.440
life now people who've never had a sense of smell often wonder what they're missing and

16:30.440 --> 16:34.440
they often say well if I go into they've they were born without a sense of smell what what

16:34.440 --> 16:38.780
is it I'm missing what's this invisible thing you talk about and a Spanish philosopher Marta

16:38.780 --> 16:44.720
Tafaya said maybe it's when I'm in a garden and I can see the beauty of the physical arrangement

16:44.720 --> 16:49.640
but I don't get the odors and aromas so I don't feel as immersed so maybe you feel immersed

16:49.640 --> 16:54.880
in a space when you're getting smells and notice that we don't notice smell because

16:54.880 --> 16:59.800
we stop paying attention to it when it's familiar we no longer notice the smell of our own home

16:59.800 --> 17:04.760
everybody else's home's got a smell isn't that odd but yours now well it's that you've

17:04.760 --> 17:10.880
stopped paying attention to it but of course it's good enough that if you go home you'll

17:10.880 --> 17:17.400
say something's changed did I leave the garbage out somebody been smoking so you would notice

17:17.400 --> 17:22.880
so I think all faction is not absent it doesn't get switched off in the gaps instead all faction

17:22.880 --> 17:28.520
is a constant background to our experience because it's always there we pay less attention

17:28.520 --> 17:34.480
to it but it modulates our moods it affects our attention and awareness and it's consolidating

17:34.480 --> 17:40.880
our memory of familiar things so many people named here have helped me in understanding

17:40.880 --> 17:46.320
the importance of all faction and all of them would want me to tell all of you that if you

17:46.320 --> 17:52.560
think you can live just as well without your sense of smell you need to think again thank you
