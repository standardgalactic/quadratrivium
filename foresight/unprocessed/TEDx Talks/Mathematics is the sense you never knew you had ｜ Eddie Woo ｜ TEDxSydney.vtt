00:00.000 --> 00:19.340
I love mathematics.

00:19.340 --> 00:23.880
Is exactly what to say at a party if you want to spend the next couple of hours sipping

00:23.880 --> 00:28.520
your drink alone in the least cool corner of the room.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.400
And that's because when it comes to this subject, all the numbers, formulas, symbols

00:33.400 --> 00:37.960
and calculations, the vast majority of us are outsiders.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.880
And that includes me.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.560
That's why today I want to share with you an outsider's perspective of mathematics.

00:44.560 --> 00:49.520
What I understand of it from someone who's always struggled with the subject, and what

00:49.520 --> 00:55.600
I've discovered as someone who went from being an outsider to making maths my career, is

00:55.600 --> 01:03.120
that surprisingly, we are all deep down born to be mathematicians.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.680
But back to being an outsider, I know what you're thinking, wait a second Eddie, what

01:08.680 --> 01:10.240
would you know?

01:10.240 --> 01:17.120
You're a maths teacher, you went to a selective school, you wear glasses and you're Asian.

01:17.120 --> 01:23.760
Now, firstly, that's racist.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.000
Secondly, that's wrong.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.120
When I was at school, my favourite subjects were English and history.

01:31.120 --> 01:35.920
And this caused a lot of angst for me as a teenager because my high school truly honoured

01:35.920 --> 01:36.920
mathematics.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.840
Your status in the school pretty much correlated with which mathematics class you ranked in.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.360
There were eight classes, so if you were in maths four, that made you just about average.

01:46.360 --> 01:50.920
If you were in maths one, you were like royalty.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.440
Each year, our school entered the prestigious Australian mathematics competition and would

01:55.440 --> 02:01.680
print out a list of everyone in the school in order of our scores.

02:01.680 --> 02:08.240
Students who received prizes and high distinctions were pinned up at the start of a long corridor,

02:08.240 --> 02:14.080
far, far away from the dark and shameful place where my name appeared.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.280
Maths was not really my thing.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.560
Stories, characters, narratives.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.360
This is where I was at home.

02:21.360 --> 02:27.280
And that's why I raised my sales and set course to become an English and history teacher.

02:27.280 --> 02:33.040
But, a chance encounter at senior university altered my life forever.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.440
I was in line to enrol at the Faculty of Education when I started a conversation with one of its

02:37.440 --> 02:38.920
professors.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.720
He noticed that while my academic life had been dominated by humanities, I had actually

02:43.720 --> 02:46.680
attempted some high level maths at school.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.840
What he saw was not that I had a problem with maths, but that I had persevered with maths.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.400
And he knew something I didn't, that there was a critical shortage of mathematics educators

02:58.400 --> 03:03.040
in Australian schools, a shortage that remains to this day.

03:03.040 --> 03:08.040
So he encouraged me to change my teaching area to mathematics.

03:08.040 --> 03:12.040
For me, becoming a teacher wasn't about my love for a particular subject.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.560
It was about having a personal impact on the lives of young people.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.320
I'd seen firsthand at school what a lasting and positive difference a great teacher can

03:21.320 --> 03:22.520
make.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.280
I wanted to do that for someone, and it didn't matter to me what subject I did it in.

03:27.280 --> 03:33.200
If there was an acute need in mathematics, then it made sense for me to go there.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.800
As I studied my degree though, I discovered that mathematics was a very different subject

03:37.800 --> 03:40.080
to what I'd originally thought.

03:40.080 --> 03:46.680
I'd made the same mistake about mathematics that I'd made earlier in my life about music.

03:46.680 --> 03:52.000
Like a good migrant child, I dutifully learned to play the piano when I was young.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.280
My weekends were filled with endlessly repeating scales and memorizing every note in the peace

03:57.280 --> 03:59.640
spring and winter.

03:59.640 --> 04:05.160
I lasted two years before my career was abruptly ended when my teacher told my parents his fingers

04:05.160 --> 04:06.160
are too short.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.800
I will not teach him any more.

04:10.800 --> 04:15.160
At seven years old, I thought of music like torture.

04:15.160 --> 04:21.640
It was a dry, solitary, joyless exercise that I only engaged with because someone else forced

04:21.640 --> 04:23.640
me to.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.920
It took me 11 years to emerge from that sad place.

04:26.920 --> 04:32.080
In year 12, I picked up a steel string acoustic guitar for the first time.

04:32.080 --> 04:38.360
I wanted to play it for church, and there was also a girl I was fairly keen on impressing.

04:38.360 --> 04:46.600
So I convinced my brother to teach me a few chords, and slowly, but surely, my mind changed.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.440
I was engaged in a creative process.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.760
I was making music, and I was hooked.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.040
I started playing in a band, and I felt the delight of rhythm pulsing through my body

04:57.040 --> 04:59.480
as we brought our sounds together.

04:59.480 --> 05:06.480
I had been surrounded by a musical ocean my entire life, and for the first time, I realized

05:06.480 --> 05:08.640
I could swim in it.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.360
I went through an almost identical experience when it came to mathematics.

05:12.360 --> 05:17.400
I used to believe that math was about rote learning in screwtable formulas to solve abstract

05:17.400 --> 05:20.600
problems that didn't mean anything to me.

05:20.600 --> 05:27.240
But at university, I began to see that mathematics is immensely practical and even beautiful.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.440
That it's not just about finding answers, but also about learning to ask the right questions.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.840
And that mathematics isn't about mindlessly crunching numbers, but rather about forming

05:38.840 --> 05:46.920
new ways to see problems so we can solve them by combining insight with imagination.

05:46.920 --> 05:53.200
It gradually dawned on me that mathematics is a sense.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.000
Mathematics is a sense just like sight and touch.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.600
It's a sense that allows us to perceive realities which would be otherwise intangible to us.

06:02.600 --> 06:08.320
You know, we talk about a sense of humor and a sense of rhythm.

06:08.320 --> 06:13.320
Mathematics is our sense for patterns, relationships, and logical connections.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.960
It's a whole new way to see the world.

06:15.960 --> 06:22.200
Now, I want to show you a mathematical reality that I guarantee you've seen before, but perhaps

06:22.200 --> 06:24.560
never really perceived.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.400
It's been hidden in plain sight your entire life.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.080
This is a river delta.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.720
It's a beautiful piece of geometry.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.760
When we hear the word geometry, most of us think of triangles and circles.

06:38.760 --> 06:44.760
But geometry is the mathematics of all shapes, and this meeting of land and sea has created

06:44.760 --> 06:48.000
shapes with an undeniable pattern.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.240
It has a mathematically recursive structure.

06:51.240 --> 06:56.720
Every part of the river delta, with its twists and turns, is a microversion of the greater

06:56.720 --> 06:57.720
whole.

06:57.720 --> 07:03.800
So, I want you to see the mathematics in this, but that's not all.

07:03.800 --> 07:10.360
I want you to compare this river delta with this amazing tree.

07:10.360 --> 07:17.440
It's a wonder in itself, but focus with me on the similarities between this and the river.

07:17.440 --> 07:23.240
What I want to know is why on earth should these shapes look so remarkably alike?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.920
Why should they have anything in common?

07:25.920 --> 07:29.600
Things get even more perplexing when you realize it's not just water systems and plants that

07:29.600 --> 07:30.600
do this.

07:30.600 --> 07:37.600
If you keep your eyes open, you'll see these same shapes are everywhere.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.160
Lightning bolts disappear so quickly that we seldom have the opportunity to ponder their

07:41.160 --> 07:47.200
geometry, but their shape is so unmistakable and so similar to what we've just seen that

07:47.200 --> 07:50.440
one can't help but be suspicious.

07:50.440 --> 07:57.440
And then there's the fact that every single person in this room is filled with these shapes,

07:57.440 --> 07:58.640
too.

07:58.640 --> 08:04.880
Every cubic centimeter of your body is packed with blood vessels that trace out this same

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
pattern.

08:05.880 --> 08:11.720
There's a mathematical reality woven into the fabric of the universe that you share with

08:11.720 --> 08:16.800
winding rivers, towering trees, and raging storms.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.600
These shapes are examples of what we call fractals as mathematicians.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.880
Fractals get their name from the same place as fractions and fractures.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.240
It's a reference to the broken and shattered shapes we find around us in nature.

08:30.240 --> 08:36.640
Now, once you have a sense for fractals, you really do start to see them everywhere, ahead

08:36.640 --> 08:43.760
of broccoli, the leaves of a fern, even clouds in the sky.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.600
Like the other senses, our mathematical sense can be refined with practice.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.040
It's just like developing perfect pitch or a taste for wines.

08:53.040 --> 08:58.800
You can learn to perceive the mathematics around you with time and the right guidance.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.400
Naturally, some people are born with sharper senses than the rest of us.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.880
Others are born with impairment.

09:05.880 --> 09:10.880
As you can see, I drew a short straw in the genetic lottery when it came to my eyesight.

09:10.880 --> 09:16.120
Without my glasses, everything is a blur.

09:16.120 --> 09:22.800
I've wrestled with this sense my entire life, but I would never dream of saying, well, seeing

09:22.800 --> 09:24.200
has always been a struggle for me.

09:24.200 --> 09:29.120
I guess I'm just not a seeing kind of person.

09:29.120 --> 09:38.160
Yet, I meet people every day who feel it quite natural to say exactly that about mathematics.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.000
I'm convinced we close ourselves off from a huge part of the human experience if we

09:43.000 --> 09:48.280
do this, because all human beings are wired to see patterns.

09:48.280 --> 09:52.240
We live in a patterned universe, a cosmos.

09:52.240 --> 10:00.120
That's what cosmos means, orderly and patterned, as opposed to chaos, which means disorderly

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
and random.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.280
It isn't just seeing patterns that humans are so good at.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.960
We love making patterns, too, and the people who do this well have a special name.

10:10.960 --> 10:18.760
We call them artists, musicians, sculptors, painters, cinematographers.

10:18.760 --> 10:22.080
They're all pattern creators.

10:22.080 --> 10:27.040
Music is once described as the joy that people feel when they are counting, but don't know

10:27.040 --> 10:28.800
it.

10:28.800 --> 10:35.000
Some of the most striking examples of mathematical patterns are in Islamic art and design, and

10:35.000 --> 10:40.480
a version to depicting humans and animals led to a rich history of intricate tile arrangements

10:40.480 --> 10:42.800
and geometric forms.

10:42.800 --> 10:48.640
The aesthetic side of mathematical patterns like these brings us back to nature itself.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.360
For instance, flowers are a universal symbol of beauty.

10:53.360 --> 10:59.280
Every culture around the planet and throughout history has regarded them as objects of wonder.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.880
One aspect of their beauty is that they exhibit a special kind of symmetry.

11:03.880 --> 11:09.880
Flowers grow organically from a center that expands outwards in the shape of a spiral,

11:09.880 --> 11:13.760
and this creates what we call rotational symmetry.

11:13.760 --> 11:20.160
You can spin a flower around and around, and it still looks basically the same.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.640
But not all spirals are created equal.

11:22.640 --> 11:27.800
It all depends on the angle of rotation that goes into creating the spiral.

11:27.800 --> 11:35.240
For instance, if we build a spiral from an angle of 90 degrees, we get a cross that is

11:35.240 --> 11:38.600
neither beautiful nor efficient.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.840
Huge parts of the flower's area are wasted and don't produce seeds.

11:43.840 --> 11:49.160
Using an angle of 62 degrees is better and produces a nice circular shape, like what

11:49.160 --> 11:53.320
we usually associate with flowers, but it's still not great.

11:53.320 --> 11:59.680
There are still large parts of the area that are a poise of resources for the flower.

11:59.680 --> 12:11.840
However, if we use 137.5 degrees, we get this beautiful pattern.

12:11.840 --> 12:18.840
It's astonishing, and it is exactly the kind of pattern used by that most majestic of flowers,

12:18.840 --> 12:20.440
the sunflower.

12:20.440 --> 12:27.760
Now, 137.5 degrees might seem pretty random, but it actually emerges out of a special number

12:27.760 --> 12:30.800
that we call the Golden Ratio.

12:30.800 --> 12:36.680
The Golden Ratio is a mathematical reality that, like fractals, you can find everywhere

12:36.680 --> 12:43.360
from the phalanges of your fingers to the pillars of the Parthenon, and that's why, even

12:43.360 --> 12:49.440
at a party of 5,000 people, I'm proud to declare I love mathematics.
