00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,520
Hi, I'm Armin and wait, hold on one second.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,920
Alright where was I?

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay so obviously I was scripted and I meant it in a lighthearted way because it can be

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,120
amusing when we recognize our own faults.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,480
What is not so funny is when our faults limit our real life interactions.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,880
We have all been the person to whip out our phone at the wrong time, but rarely are we

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
called out for it.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,880
Why is that?

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,520
We are the creators of social media, we have accustomed to this irrational idea that replacing

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,160
real conversations with online communication is okay.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,880
I'm here to prove to you that it is not.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,600
Social media has begun to encroach upon our humanity, to the point that it even takes

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,080
away our humaneness.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,160
Now you may be wondering what this really means.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,440
The dictionary says that it involves the nature of people.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,760
Technology and more specifically social media are quite evidently not in our nature.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,160
Not only does it change what we do, but it changes who we are.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,120
The instant you were born were you inclined to send a snap to your friend or to cry, looking

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,400
into your mom's eyes.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
The name social media also misses with our minds a little, making us think that what

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,680
we are doing is social.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,480
In reality, it is the polar opposite.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,160
In order to identify how social media brought us here, we need to examine our past.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,320
So let me give you a brief overview of how social media came to be.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,000
The first recognizable source of social media was Six Degrees, founded by Andrew Wynredt

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,840
in 1997, aiming to help friends communicate in a more convenient way, online.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,480
The first renowned source of social media, Facebook, was launched seven years later by

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,960
Mark Zuckerberg.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,120
It helps close friends keep in touch and distance friends stay in touch.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,320
But by communicating online, it becomes unnatural.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,680
This attitude we have is commonly misconceived as OK.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,680
As human-like and unnatural, the intentions have been lost.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,400
We are letting social media take us to places we never wanted to go and we are stuck.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,120
Stop and amaze full of crossed wires and do not know which way to turn.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Which path should we take?

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,400
Now, it is easy to get lost in thinking about these thick questions, as they are deep and

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
unanswerable.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,920
On the contrary, I feel that smaller and easier questions can help us see the issue from above.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,360
I asked many of you the Spring VA survey a couple of thin and answerable questions to

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,600
help us see from a broader scope.

41
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,080
Out of the 145 respondents, approximately 90% of people said that they used their phones

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,560
for two hours or more on each weekday, and another 40% used them for four hours plus.

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,640
On the weekends, over 60% used them for five hours or more each day, adding up to ten hours

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
in total.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,960
Now, when we find ourselves mindlessly wasting our time on these machines, how is it fair

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,680
to tell our parents we can't come to the table for a family dinner?

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
As my charts indicate, health and humanists are directly related.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,680
According to the majority of you guys, social media takes up too much of your time.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Due to the ongoing pressure here in the technology capital of the world, many of us are sleep

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,760
deprived.

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Social media almost always has a negative impact on the amount of sleep we get each night,

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,840
and less than 15% said that it never affected their sleep time.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,720
This data also shows that students feel that their grades would be better without social

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,080
media.

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,880
Although we can all agree it has a number of social benefits, only some of your real

56
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,160
self is shown online.

57
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,520
You can pick out your identity and change who you are.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,240
Online interactions have become junk food for our brains and have us hooked.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
How much more direct could I get than that?

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,640
I just supplied you with relevant and relatable statistics that you could be a part of.

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,120
Most of you feel that it takes away from your sleep, that it is dehumanizing.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Cal Newport, a professor at Georgetown University, states that there is a growing amount of research

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,800
telling us that if you spend your day in a state of fragmented detention to take a quick

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,760
glance or just check your phone, it can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration.

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,680
Quite ironically, this act of trying to be a well-rounded human by taking care of your

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,400
social profile is actually dehumanizing.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,760
All the attempts to say and touch distance you from being social.

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,400
Keeping in touch with our friends is good if used in a healthy way.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Communicating in real life is much more valuable than doing so online.

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Next time you open your phone to message a nearby friend about how their day was or

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,720
send a picture of your face with no context, I urge you to set up a time to meet and hang

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
out.

73
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,480
This shouldn't take more than 10 or so seconds and is a great first step in retaining your

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
humanness.

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,560
If this is too hard for you at the moment and you need time to adjust to this virtue of

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,760
spending less time online, try sending yourself a screen time if your parents haven't already.

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,240
If they have, maybe ask them to lower it a bit, to challenge yourself and strive for

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
a better you.

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:35,200
Whether it's social media or social life, TED Talks or TikToks, you need to make a choice.
