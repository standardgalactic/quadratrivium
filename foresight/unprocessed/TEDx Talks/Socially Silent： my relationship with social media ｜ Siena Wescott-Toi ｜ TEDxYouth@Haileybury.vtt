Can a life be changed in five weeks? Hello, I'm Sienna and I'm here to tell you about five weeks that changed my life forever.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
I'd like to start by asking you all a simple question. How many hours do you think you spend on social media a day?

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Social media has been vital in the past two years as what it truly does and intends to do is connect us.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
However, I believe social media is about balance. It can create a polarized society, a society addicted to perfection, a social pandemic.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
However, social media also has the power to unite and allow people to use their voice.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
It began as an exciting new concept, one where people from around the globe could share ideas, memories and moments.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
However, with the speed that it grew and the ages it attracted, issues have arisen.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Cyberbullying and societal pressures, just two issues that permeate society, but also all of our lives today.

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
Picture this. January mid lockdown 2021. I'm sure many of you can agree it was a lonely and difficult time.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Certainly one of the lowest times in my life. Let me tell you why.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I was purely relying on social media as a vessel of escapism.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
How you may ask? Well, when I was on my phone it was as if I didn't have to think of anything else.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
I was fixated on the screen and that was all I was fixated on.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
I could hear my mind and my body telling me it was damaging and I decided to listen to my mind and my body.

01:58.000 --> 02:07.000
It wasn't my parents or friends or family. It was me. I could see it hurting my self confidence, my motivation.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
So, I sat in front of a mirror and it came to me.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook on the one hand helped keep me socially active.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
However, consuming more than eight hours of my day, the time is still from my life and the pressure to constantly keep connected

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
are precisely the reasons why I chose to become socially silent.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
With a click of a finger and a tap on a screen, my social media had gone.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
I decided to close off all of my virtual relationships when physical ones didn't exist.

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
I was able to live carefree and truly experience the moment, the present, the now.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Liberating is the only way I can describe it. It's truly changed my life.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
I found that I was spending my time usefully consuming my life with things that only motivated me and kept me going.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
I read, I spent time with family, I painted in the garden, I cooked, the list goes on.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
I learnt about the world around me. I learnt about my home.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
But most importantly, I learnt about how peaceful the world could be without the distraction of social media.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
My quality of life had improved, but most importantly, I felt no pressure to conform.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I felt free.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Now, I'm not going to deny that it wasn't hard because it most definitely was at the start.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
One becomes so attached to their device. For me, my phone seemed like a safe place, like a haven.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
However, I soon realised how truly dangerous it was, like a trap or a prison.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
I was scared. I really was. What are people going to think?

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Am I weird? Are my attention-seeking? Will I lose friends?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
But soon, my fears subsided.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I wasn't weird. I didn't lose friends. If anything, I inspired people.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And that's why I'm standing here today.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm not here to purely criticise.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
After my social break, I realised the real and principal use of social media is communication.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And that's all I wanted back from it.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I wanted a vessel to communicate.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
And that's what social media has become to me.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
For ease, for making plans, for talking to loved ones, for talking to friends.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I didn't want endless feeds and superficial standards.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
I was ready to create my own relationship with social media, a balanced one that wouldn't overtake my life.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And I have.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
I wonder if you know the average hours a teenager spent on social media a day in 2020.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
For teenagers aged 13 to 19, it was an average of nine hours a day.

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
That's 3,285 hours a year, or on average, 173 full days.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
That's half a year.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Half a year.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
You know, sometimes I sit and wonder, when I'm in my 80s and 90s,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
whether I would have lived my life to its fullest potential, met countless people,

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
been to countless places, experienced countless experiences,

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
and dare I say it, going off social media for five weeks has taught me three main things.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
I've learnt how to use my time to take control because time is precious.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
I've learnt my ideal balance.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
But most importantly, I have learnt a lot about myself.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
So, I sit here today to ask you one favour for however long, in whichever way you would like,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
take some time of social media.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
Find your balance, find your freedom, find your ideal way to communicate.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
Because as soon as I stopped communicating with others, I learnt to communicate with myself.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And that's made me the person I am today.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I hope you can leave here thinking, reflecting and considering this approach

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
to learning about life, learning about the world through experience,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
but most vitally, learning about yourself.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Thank you.
