1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Artificial intelligence, how many times have we heard this?

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,520
We wake up in the morning, we drink our coffee, we read newspaper, and there is something

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,240
about it.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,080
We watch the television and we hear something talking about the latest technological progress.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,960
We drive in the car, we listen to the radio and there is someone talking about artificial

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,520
intelligence.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,120
How many times have we heard their robot will take over?

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,240
How can we trust a robot?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,640
A robot will take our job.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,200
You think I'm going to do another class on artificial intelligence today.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,600
Forget about it.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,240
Today we're going to talk about self-serve coffee machine.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,160
How many of you have taken one of this coffee?

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Everybody.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,520
Well, me too.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,240
How many of you can build a self-serve coffee machine from scratch?

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Nobody.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,960
Me neither.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,480
But we consume the coffee.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
We trust that machine.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,920
How we trust this machine?

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,160
For sure we are not going to open the machine or read the electrical scheme of the machine.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,200
We are not going to read the software code of the machine.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,440
We trust the machine because of the coffee we take, we consume.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,840
We drink our coffee and we like it.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
We trust the machine.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,000
You might wonder why I'm here in Annapolis listening to Luca talking about self-serve

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,240
coffee machine.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Because artificial intelligence today is exactly like this self-serve machine.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,520
We use all the time.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,800
We trust what it does for us.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,520
But we use all the time.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
We go in the airport.

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,320
We put our passport on the screen reader.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,640
The gate opens.

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,880
We go through.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
We play Rizzico.

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,320
We play Monopoly with our friends while we have dinner.

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,400
Alexa, play Bohemia Rhapsody of Queen.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,680
And it's our play.

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
We have a job interview.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,520
We don't know where to go.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,760
We put Google Maps.

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,520
Google Maps tell take this street, left, right.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,640
We arrive at destination.

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
We use every day artificial intelligence.

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,640
We don't know how it works, but we trust what it does for us.

48
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,360
But it's not always good as it seems.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
A few years ago, I had a friend.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
He wanted to buy a nice car.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,640
He was saving every month some money.

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:10,320
But he realized it would have taken many years to save the money to buy the car.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
He was a nerd.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,600
He was an engineer.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,040
He was always the first of the class.

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,240
He was a high-skilled individual.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
So he started building a software.

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,280
He started building a predictive model.

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,720
And he started investing in his own favorite cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,120
So he built this model.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
He started using this model.

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,920
This model was telling him, A, tomorrow open a position, Bitcoin is going up.

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,880
Or close this position, Bitcoin is going down.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,560
For a few months, he started making money.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,120
He trust his own model.

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,880
Everything was working perfectly.

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,200
But all of a sudden, on a rainy day, things start changing.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
And he started losing money.

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Bitcoin was dropping.

70
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,040
And he was not able to understand why.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,440
He built something.

72
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,560
He was a very skilled engineer.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:15,160
And he was not even able to understand his own artificial intelligence.

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,400
Imagine you are the owner of a bookstore.

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,560
And you have thousands of books on display.

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,880
You are the owner.

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,960
And you want to maximize revenue.

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,560
So you hired a consultant.

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,080
This consultant is an expert in machine learning, in computer vision specifically.

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,640
And he installed a lot of cameras on your shop.

81
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,960
Every camera pointing to a specific area of the bookstore.

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,520
And basically, he created a model that employs computer vision and performs facial recognition

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,200
of expression.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:02,240
So you recognize if a customer is happy, is engaged, is sad, is disengaged.

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,880
So the model can say, hey, in this area of the shop, all the people are engaged.

86
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
In this area of the shop, all the people are disengaged.

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,400
So the owner can have a suggestion on where to put books.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,920
But for a few months, again, he started making money.

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,040
He started selling books.

90
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,920
Everything was going okay.

91
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,600
But all of a sudden, the revenue started dropping.

92
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,520
He called the consultant, the consultant answered, hey, I have some problem here.

93
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
I keep taking the decision according to the model.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
But my revenue is going down.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,640
And the consultant says, hey, listen, I don't know.

96
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,400
This is the model that is telling me what to do.

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Everything is automatic.

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,960
I don't know.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
So imagine the frustration of the owner.

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,400
He's so frustrated that he says, I don't want to play with artificial intelligence anymore.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
I fire you.

102
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
A few years ago, I had a friend.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,640
One night, he started shaking.

104
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,120
And he lost control of half of his body.

105
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
He thought he had an ictus.

106
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,080
He was sleeping with the wife.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
And he started losing vision from one eyes.

108
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,320
He couldn't see any more from one eyes.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
He was very reactive.

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,560
And he called the wife and said, please bring me to the hospital.

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
Something is going on.

112
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,200
So they go straight to the hospital.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,160
The doctor understood something was wrong.

114
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,560
And he performed a scan of the brain.

115
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:48,160
And there was something as big as a grain, mice grain, that he was in his brain.

116
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
And the doctor said, hey, I'm sorry, but you have a tumor.

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
You have a malignant tumor.

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,160
You have just a few months of life.

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,200
What you can imagine, my friend, he was destroyed psychologically.

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
He didn't know what to do.

121
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
He didn't know how to react.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,480
He was destroyed.

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,200
But the doctor started giving him cortisone.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,200
And he was performing overtime these brain scans to see if something is happening.

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,600
And strangely, every day, something good was happening.

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,920
He started seeing again from the left eyes, he started getting control of his half part

127
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
of the body.

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Well, he was getting happy.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,120
But the doctor didn't know what's going on.

130
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,160
He was trusting the machine who took those pictures.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,440
He was interpreting, there is a tumor.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,160
And he still didn't know what to do, what to say.

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:55,080
So the doctor couldn't trust the machine, couldn't trust artificial intelligence anymore.

134
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,640
So what is the moral of this?

135
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,000
Should we really trust artificial intelligence?

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,520
We cannot stop technological progress.

137
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,040
It doesn't make sense.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,680
We cannot stop to build intelligence machines.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
It doesn't make sense.

140
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:20,280
But we can challenge the prediction, the assessment, the inference of these black box machines.

141
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,480
And above all, we have the right to understand how they work.

142
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:33,520
And we have the right to get explanation on the recommendation of the machine.

143
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,040
So what is the solution of these black box artificial intelligence?

144
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Nowadays, in artificial intelligence, there is a sub-discipline that is called explainable

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
artificial intelligence.

146
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,640
And this is getting at the forefront of artificial intelligence in our society, everywhere in

147
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
the world.

148
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,600
So remember my friends who wanted to get some money for his car.

149
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,960
Now let's assume that this black box model is saying, A, there's going to be an increment

150
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
in price of 5%.

151
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
But it doesn't know.

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Why?

153
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,520
Imagine now that there is artificial intelligence that tells, A, there is a 5% increase, add

154
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
something more.

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,280
For example, he had a statement like this.

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,800
The number of buying orders have significantly increased at current prices.

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,280
Therefore, investors are willing to enter the market now.

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,200
Or in the last months, Bitcoin has dropped by 20%.

159
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Every time it happens, it's strongly rebounded.

160
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,440
Therefore, we have high chances of a positive price increase.

161
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,160
Again, with current trading volumes, there are high chances of a big price move.

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,760
As you can see now, we have a prediction from the machine, which is plus 5%.

163
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,680
But we have a set of explanation.

164
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,720
This is in artificial intelligence are called propositional rules.

165
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,440
And you can understand that with this type of information, we can actually inform our

166
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
decision-making.

167
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:28,960
Now, let's go back to the bookstore.

168
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,440
You were losing money, but the model was saying, A, all the people in the shop are happy.

169
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,440
But still, you are making money.

170
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
You are losing money.

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Sorry.

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,240
Imagine you have something like this now.

173
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,480
You have a dashboard of visual analytics.

174
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,000
So now you know the number of people that enter your shop during the day.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,280
So we have in the morning, lunchtime, evening.

176
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,440
As you can see, most of the day, people were happy.

177
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,320
But during lunchtime, there were so many people in your bookstore that even if you put the

178
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,720
books in the right order and organize the book properly, there are so many people that

179
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,840
their experience is negative.

180
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:21,320
And now, with this visual analytics, we have a better understanding of why and what's going

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,600
on.

182
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:32,240
And again, with this type of information, we can better inform our decision-making.

183
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,640
Now let's go back to my friend.

184
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,120
He was diagnosed a tumor.

185
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,240
I don't know if I would have survived just with this information.

186
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:52,520
Now imagine the doctor beside this prediction, which is evidently wrongly, has some more

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,760
information.

188
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,400
We have two premises.

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:06,240
White pixel in the picture, in tissue, brain tissue, suggests abnormal cells that are present.

190
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
And when we have abnormal cells, and we know that they are actually growing after multiple

191
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,160
scan over time, therefore, we have high evidence of a tumor grade 3-4, which is a malignant

192
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,960
tumor.

193
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,920
This is another argument.

194
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,760
The patient reported the recurrent adiabics in the morning, followed by nausea.

195
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,440
And his vision was diminishing over time.

196
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:44,040
Therefore, there is further evidence that abnormal cells are actually tumor.

197
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,160
But then, we have something different now.

198
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,680
We have a third argument.

199
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,520
Neurological specialists demonstrate a very rare condition called multiple cavernomas.

200
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:07,400
Multiple cavernomas causes cluster of abnormal blood vessels to form in the brain, causing

201
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,520
headache and seizure.

202
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:18,360
Therefore, our previous argument, one and two, are no longer applicable.

203
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,160
So now you can imagine that if the doctor would have such information, he would think

204
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,680
twice to say you have a tumor.

205
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,880
In artificial intelligence, this is called the feasible argumentation.

206
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,720
We can express information as arguments, premises, and conclusion, and all of you understand

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,040
what's going on.

208
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:51,640
But also, we can add other arguments, and with this, we can retract the previous conclusion.

209
00:13:51,640 --> 00:14:00,880
As you can see, with this type of information, we can actually inform our decision-making.

210
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:10,240
So we need to focus on building an artificial intelligence system, not only focus on what,

211
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,360
but also focus on why.

212
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,640
We should build an intelligent machine, focus on what, and on why.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,040
This machine that can actually empower human, that can actually empower our decision-making,

214
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,840
can inform our decision-making.

215
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:35,240
And we should have the right to understand what's going on and interpret this machine

216
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,000
and interpret their inference.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Alan Turing, who's already 50 years ago, 60 years ago, is considered the father of artificial

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
intelligence, when everything started.

219
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,520
And yet, the very simple question, can machine think?

220
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,960
Probably some of you know how things have evolved.

221
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,720
And artificial intelligence now is spanning across sector in our life, in our society.

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,400
But we have built a very powerful, very accurate, very robust system, but they look like black

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
boxes.

224
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,440
We don't understand what's going on inside.

225
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,360
We get the input, we take the input, and we get the output.

226
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:30,040
Stephen Hawkins says, success in creating artificial intelligence will be the biggest

227
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,000
event in human history.

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:44,080
Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.

229
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,800
So it is time to take action.

230
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,960
It is time to build an intelligence machine that can actually inform our decision-making.

231
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,120
We need to take control of this system, intelligence system that we build.

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,320
And we need to use this system, artificial intelligence, to empower human intelligence.

233
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:18,160
We need to do a revolution, a revolution that democratizes artificial intelligence.

234
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,400
It is time to open black boxes.

235
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,600
Thank you.
