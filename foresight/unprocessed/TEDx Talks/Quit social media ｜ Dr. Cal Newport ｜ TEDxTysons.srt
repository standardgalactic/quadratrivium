1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Alright, so you probably don't realize that right now you're actually looking at something

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:24,160
quite rare because I am a millennial computer scientist book author standing on a TED stage

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,420
and yet I've never had a social media account.

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,740
While this happened was actually somewhat random, social media first came on to my radar when

5
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,420
I was at college, my sophomore year of college, this is when Facebook arrived at our campus

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,220
and at the time which was right after the first dot-com bust, I had had a dorm room

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,780
business, I had had to shut it down in the bust and then suddenly this other kid from

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,500
Harvard named Mark had this product called Facebook and people were getting excited about

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,820
it so it was sort of a fit of somewhat immature professional jealousy, I said I'm not going

10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
to use this thing, I'm not going to help this kid's business, what's I ever going to

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
mount to?

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,300
So as I go along my life I look up not long later and I see that everyone I know is really

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,180
hooked on this thing and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity,

14
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,300
some perspective on it I realized this seems a little bit dangerous so I never signed up,

15
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,340
I've never had a social media account since.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,140
So I'm here for two reasons, I want to deliver two messages, the first message I want to deliver

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,660
is that even though I've never had a social media account I'm okay, you don't have to

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,220
worry, it turns out I still have friends, I still know what's going on in the world,

19
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,660
there's a computer scientist, I still collaborate with people all around the world, I'm still

20
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:40,060
regularly exposed serendipitously to interesting ideas and I rarely describe myself as lacking

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
in entertainment options.

22
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,700
So I've been okay but I'd go even farther, I'd go even farther and say not only am I

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,140
okay without social media but I think I'm actually better off, I think I'm happier,

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,940
I think I find more sustainability in my life and I think I've been more successful professionally

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,100
because I don't use social media.

26
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,860
So my second goal here on stage is to try to convince more of you to believe the same

27
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,540
thing, to see if I could actually convince more of you that you too would be better off

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,660
if you quit social media.

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,340
So if the theme of this TEDx event is future tense, I guess in other words this would be

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,900
my vision of the future would be one in which fewer people actually use social media.

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,540
Okay, so that's a big claim, I think I need to back it up, so my thought what I would

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,900
do is take the three most common objections I hear when I suggest to people that they

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,140
quit social media and then for each of these objections I'll try to defuse the hype and

34
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,180
see if I can actually push in some more reality.

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,660
So this is the first most common objection I hear, that's not a hermit, that's actually

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,060
a hipstered web developer down from H Street, I'm not sure, hipster a hermit sometimes

37
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,540
is hard to tell.

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,260
So this first objection goes as follows, Cal social media is one of the fundamental

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,580
technologies of the 21st century to reject social media would be an act of extreme bloodism,

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,620
it would be like riding to work in a horse or using a rotary phone, I can't take such

41
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,260
a big stance in my life.

42
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,500
So my reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense.

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,060
Social media is not a fundamental technology, it leverages some fundamental technologies

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,980
but it's better understood as this, which is to say it's a source of entertainment,

45
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,860
it's entertainment product.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,980
The way the technologist Jaron Lanaire puts it is that these companies offer you shiny

47
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,180
treats in exchange for minutes of your attention and bites of your personal data which can

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,580
then be packaged up and sold.

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,340
So to say that you don't use social media should not be a large social stance, it's

50
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,060
just rejecting one form of entertainment for others, it should be no more controversial

51
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,420
than saying I don't like newspapers, I like to get my news from magazines or I prefer to

52
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,380
watch cable series as opposed to network television series, it's not a major political or social

53
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,100
stance to say you don't use this product.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,700
My use of the slot machine image up here also is not accidental because if you look a little

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,060
bit closer at these technologies it's not just that they're a source of entertainment

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,540
but they're actually a somewhat unsavory source of entertainment.

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,480
We now know that many of the major social media companies hire individuals called attention

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,980
engineers who borrow principles from Las Vegas Casino Gambling among other places to try

59
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,740
to make these products as addictive as possible.

60
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,220
That is the desired use case of these products is that you use it in an addictive fashion

61
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,040
because that maximizes the profit that can be extracted from your attention and data.

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
So it's not a fundamental technology, it's just a source of entertainment, one among

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,160
many and it's somewhat unsavory if you look a little bit closer.

64
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,240
So here's the second common objection I hear when I suggest that people quit social media,

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,360
the objection goes as follows, Cal, I can't quit social media because it is vital to my

66
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,240
success in the 21st century economy.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,280
If I do not have a well-cultivated social media brand people won't know who I am, people

68
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,800
won't be able to find me, opportunities won't come my way and I will effectively disappear

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
from the economy.

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,160
So again my reaction is once again this objection also is nonsense.

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,520
So I recently published this book that draws on multiple different strands of evidence

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,640
to make the point that in a competitive 21st century economy what the market values is

73
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,520
the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable.

74
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,000
You can produce something that's rare and is valuable, the market will value that.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,320
What the market dismisses for the most part are activities that are easy to replicate

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
and produce a small amount of value.

77
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,560
Well social media use is the epitome of an easy to replicate activity that does not directly

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,680
produce a lot of value, it's something that any 16 year old with a smartphone can do.

79
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,560
By definition the market is not going to give a lot of value to those behaviors.

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,400
It's instead going to reward the deep concentrated work required to build real skills and to

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,880
apply those skills to produce things like a craftsman that are rare and that are valuable.

82
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,720
To put it another way, if you can write an elegant algorithm, if you can write a legal

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
brief that can change a case, if you can write a thousand words of prose that's going to

84
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
fixate a reader right to the end.

85
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,200
If you can look at a sea of ambiguous data and apply statistics and pull out insights

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,400
that could transform a whole business strategy, if you can do these type of activities which

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:36,400
require deep work that produce outcomes that are rare and valuable, people will find you.

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
You will be able to write your own ticket, you will be able to build the foundation of

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,720
a very meaningful and successful professional life regardless of how many Instagram followers

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,360
you have.

91
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,720
So this is the third common objection I hear when I suggest to people that they quit social

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
media and in some sense I think it might be one of the most important.

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,560
So this objection goes as follows, Cal, maybe I agree with you, maybe you're right, it's

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,760
not a fundamental technology, maybe using social media is not at the core of my professional

95
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,160
success, but you know what, it's harmless.

96
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,000
I have some fun on it, weird Twitter is funny.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
I don't even really use it that much, I'm a first adopter, it's just kind of interesting

98
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,480
to try it out and maybe I might miss out on something if I don't use it.

99
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
What's the harm?

100
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,880
So again I look back and I say this objection also is nonsense.

101
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,600
In this case what it misses is what I think is a very important reality that we need to

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,320
talk about more frankly, which is that social media brings with it multiple well documented

103
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,160
significant harms.

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,080
And we actually have to confront these harms head on when trying to make decisions about

105
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,480
whether or not we embrace this technology and let it into our lives.

106
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,920
So one of these harms that we know this technology brings has to do with your professional success.

107
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,160
So I just argued before that the ability to focus intensely to produce things that are

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,440
rare and valuable, to hone skills that the marketplace values, that this is what's going

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,240
to matter in our economy, but right before that I argued that social media tools are

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,840
designed to be addictive.

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,120
The actual design, desired use case of these tools is that you fragment your attention

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
as much as possible throughout your waking hours.

113
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,800
That's how these tools are designed to use.

114
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,400
Well we have a growing amount of research which tells us that if you spend large portions

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,480
of your day in a state of fragmented attention.

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,880
So large portions of your day where you're constantly breaking up your attention, take

117
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,440
a quick glance, do a just check, let me just quickly look at Instagram, that this can permanently

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,720
reduce your capacity for concentration.

119
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,880
In other words you could permanently reduce your capacity to do exactly the type of deep

120
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,880
effort that we're finding to be more and more necessary in an increasingly competitive

121
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
economy.

122
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,600
So social media use is not harmless, it can actually have a significant negative impact

123
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
on your ability to thrive in the economy.

124
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,440
I am especially worried about this when we look at the younger generation coming up which

125
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,640
is the most saturated in this technology.

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,160
If you lose your ability to sustain concentration you're going to become less and less relevant

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,760
to this economy.

128
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,880
There's also psychological harms that are well documented that social media brings that

129
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,280
we do need to address.

130
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,800
So we know from the research literature that the more you use social media the more likely

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,060
you are to feel lonely or isolated.

132
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,320
We know that the constant exposure to your friends carefully curated positive portrayals

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,360
of their life can leave you to feel inadequate and can increase rates of depression.

134
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,160
And something I think we're going to be hearing more about in the near future is that there's

135
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,560
a fundamental mismatch between the way our brains are wired and this behavior of exposing

136
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,000
yourself to stimuli with intermittent rewards throughout all of your waking hours.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,120
So it's one thing to spend a couple hours at the slot machine in Las Vegas but if you

138
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,360
bring a slot machine with you and you pull that handle all day long from when you wake

139
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
up to when you go to bed we're not wired from it.

140
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
It short circuits the brain and we're starting to find that it has actual cognitive consequences

141
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,480
one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety.

142
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,000
So the canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,680
If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses they'll tell you along with the rise

144
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,320
of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus came

145
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,000
an explosion of anxiety related disorders on those campuses.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,520
So that's the canary in the coal mine.

147
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,520
This type of behavior is a mismatch for our brain wiring it can make you feel miserable.

148
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,640
So there's real cost to social media use which means when you're trying to decide should

149
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200
I use this or not saying it's harmless is not enough.

150
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,680
You actually have to identify a significantly positive clear benefit that can outweigh these

151
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,200
potential completely non-trivial harms.

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,200
So people often ask okay but what is life like without social media that can actually

153
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,560
be a little bit scary to think about.

154
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,640
What I found from people I know who have gone through this process there can be a few weeks

155
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,480
that are difficult that actually is like a true detox process.

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
The first two weeks can be uncomfortable.

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
You feel a little bit anxious you feel like you're missing a limb but after that things

158
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,960
settle down and actually life after social media can be quite positive.

159
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,440
There's two things I can report back to you from the world of no social media use.

160
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
First it can be quite productive, be quite productive.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,880
So I'm a professor at a research institution I've written five books I rarely work past

162
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,600
five p.m. on the weekday.

163
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Part of the way I'm trying to able to pull that off is because it turns out if you treat

164
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,720
your attention with respect so you don't fragment it you allow it to stay whole you preserve

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
your ability to concentrate when it comes time to work you can actually do one thing

166
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,360
after another and do it with intensity and intensity can be traded for time it's surprising

167
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,440
how much you can get done in eight hour day if you're able to give each thing intense

168
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,640
concentration after another.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Something else I can report back from life without social media is that outside of work

170
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,280
things can be quite peaceful.

171
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,960
So I often joke I'd be very comfortable being a 1930s farmer because if you look at my leisure

172
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,720
time I read newspaper while the sun comes up I listen to baseball on the radio I honest

173
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,240
to God sit in a leather chair and read hardcover books at night after my kids go to bed.

174
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,960
It sounds old fashioned but I'll tell you they were on to something back then it's actually

175
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,120
a restorative very peaceful way to actually spend your time out of work you don't have

176
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,480
the constant home stimuli and the background home of anxiety that comes along with that.

177
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,280
So life without social media is really not so bad.

178
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,180
So we pulled together these threads and you see my full argument for why I think not everyone

179
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,760
but certainly much more people than right now use social media much more people should

180
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,520
not be using social media and that's because we can first summarize discard with the main

181
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,760
concerns that somehow it's a fundamental technology you have to use nonsense it's a slot machine

182
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,000
in your phone we can discard with this notion that you're not going to get a job if you

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,800
don't use social media nonsense anything a 16 year old with a smartphone can do is not

184
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,680
going to be what the market rewards and then I emphasize the point that there's real harms

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,040
with it so it's not just harmless you really would have to have a significant benefit before

186
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,200
you would actually say this trade off is worth and finally I noted that life without social

187
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,520
media there's real positives associated with it.

188
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,440
So I'm hoping that when many of you actually go through this same calculus you'll at least

189
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,200
consider the perspective I'm making right now which is many more people would be much

190
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,680
better off if they didn't use this technology.

191
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,320
Now of course some of you might disagree some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,800
of me and my points and of course I welcome all negative feedback I just ask that you

193
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
direct your comments towards Twitter thank you.
