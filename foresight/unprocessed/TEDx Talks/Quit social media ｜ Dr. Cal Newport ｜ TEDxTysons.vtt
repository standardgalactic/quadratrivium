WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
Alright, so you probably don't realize that right now you're actually looking at something

00:15.520 --> 00:24.160
quite rare because I am a millennial computer scientist book author standing on a TED stage

00:24.160 --> 00:27.420
and yet I've never had a social media account.

00:27.420 --> 00:32.740
While this happened was actually somewhat random, social media first came on to my radar when

00:32.740 --> 00:37.420
I was at college, my sophomore year of college, this is when Facebook arrived at our campus

00:37.420 --> 00:42.220
and at the time which was right after the first dot-com bust, I had had a dorm room

00:42.220 --> 00:46.780
business, I had had to shut it down in the bust and then suddenly this other kid from

00:46.780 --> 00:50.500
Harvard named Mark had this product called Facebook and people were getting excited about

00:50.500 --> 00:54.820
it so it was sort of a fit of somewhat immature professional jealousy, I said I'm not going

00:54.820 --> 00:57.820
to use this thing, I'm not going to help this kid's business, what's I ever going to

00:57.820 --> 00:58.820
mount to?

00:58.820 --> 01:02.300
So as I go along my life I look up not long later and I see that everyone I know is really

01:02.300 --> 01:07.180
hooked on this thing and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity,

01:07.180 --> 01:11.300
some perspective on it I realized this seems a little bit dangerous so I never signed up,

01:11.300 --> 01:14.340
I've never had a social media account since.

01:14.340 --> 01:19.140
So I'm here for two reasons, I want to deliver two messages, the first message I want to deliver

01:19.140 --> 01:25.660
is that even though I've never had a social media account I'm okay, you don't have to

01:25.660 --> 01:30.220
worry, it turns out I still have friends, I still know what's going on in the world,

01:30.220 --> 01:34.660
there's a computer scientist, I still collaborate with people all around the world, I'm still

01:34.660 --> 01:40.060
regularly exposed serendipitously to interesting ideas and I rarely describe myself as lacking

01:40.060 --> 01:41.060
in entertainment options.

01:41.060 --> 01:45.700
So I've been okay but I'd go even farther, I'd go even farther and say not only am I

01:45.700 --> 01:51.140
okay without social media but I think I'm actually better off, I think I'm happier,

01:51.140 --> 01:56.940
I think I find more sustainability in my life and I think I've been more successful professionally

01:56.940 --> 02:00.100
because I don't use social media.

02:00.100 --> 02:04.860
So my second goal here on stage is to try to convince more of you to believe the same

02:04.860 --> 02:10.540
thing, to see if I could actually convince more of you that you too would be better off

02:10.540 --> 02:11.660
if you quit social media.

02:11.660 --> 02:16.340
So if the theme of this TEDx event is future tense, I guess in other words this would be

02:16.340 --> 02:20.900
my vision of the future would be one in which fewer people actually use social media.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.540
Okay, so that's a big claim, I think I need to back it up, so my thought what I would

02:24.540 --> 02:29.900
do is take the three most common objections I hear when I suggest to people that they

02:29.900 --> 02:34.140
quit social media and then for each of these objections I'll try to defuse the hype and

02:34.140 --> 02:37.180
see if I can actually push in some more reality.

02:38.180 --> 02:44.660
So this is the first most common objection I hear, that's not a hermit, that's actually

02:44.660 --> 02:49.060
a hipstered web developer down from H Street, I'm not sure, hipster a hermit sometimes

02:49.060 --> 02:51.540
is hard to tell.

02:51.540 --> 02:56.260
So this first objection goes as follows, Cal social media is one of the fundamental

02:56.260 --> 03:02.580
technologies of the 21st century to reject social media would be an act of extreme bloodism,

03:02.580 --> 03:06.620
it would be like riding to work in a horse or using a rotary phone, I can't take such

03:06.620 --> 03:09.260
a big stance in my life.

03:09.260 --> 03:13.500
So my reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense.

03:13.500 --> 03:18.060
Social media is not a fundamental technology, it leverages some fundamental technologies

03:18.060 --> 03:23.980
but it's better understood as this, which is to say it's a source of entertainment,

03:23.980 --> 03:25.860
it's entertainment product.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.980
The way the technologist Jaron Lanaire puts it is that these companies offer you shiny

03:30.980 --> 03:36.180
treats in exchange for minutes of your attention and bites of your personal data which can

03:36.180 --> 03:39.580
then be packaged up and sold.

03:39.580 --> 03:44.340
So to say that you don't use social media should not be a large social stance, it's

03:44.340 --> 03:48.060
just rejecting one form of entertainment for others, it should be no more controversial

03:48.060 --> 03:52.420
than saying I don't like newspapers, I like to get my news from magazines or I prefer to

03:52.420 --> 03:58.380
watch cable series as opposed to network television series, it's not a major political or social

03:58.380 --> 04:01.100
stance to say you don't use this product.

04:01.100 --> 04:05.700
My use of the slot machine image up here also is not accidental because if you look a little

04:05.700 --> 04:09.060
bit closer at these technologies it's not just that they're a source of entertainment

04:09.060 --> 04:12.540
but they're actually a somewhat unsavory source of entertainment.

04:12.540 --> 04:16.480
We now know that many of the major social media companies hire individuals called attention

04:16.480 --> 04:21.980
engineers who borrow principles from Las Vegas Casino Gambling among other places to try

04:21.980 --> 04:25.740
to make these products as addictive as possible.

04:25.740 --> 04:29.220
That is the desired use case of these products is that you use it in an addictive fashion

04:29.220 --> 04:35.040
because that maximizes the profit that can be extracted from your attention and data.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.160
So it's not a fundamental technology, it's just a source of entertainment, one among

04:38.160 --> 04:43.160
many and it's somewhat unsavory if you look a little bit closer.

04:43.160 --> 04:47.240
So here's the second common objection I hear when I suggest that people quit social media,

04:47.240 --> 04:52.360
the objection goes as follows, Cal, I can't quit social media because it is vital to my

04:52.360 --> 04:55.240
success in the 21st century economy.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.280
If I do not have a well-cultivated social media brand people won't know who I am, people

05:00.280 --> 05:05.800
won't be able to find me, opportunities won't come my way and I will effectively disappear

05:05.800 --> 05:07.200
from the economy.

05:07.200 --> 05:13.160
So again my reaction is once again this objection also is nonsense.

05:13.160 --> 05:19.520
So I recently published this book that draws on multiple different strands of evidence

05:19.520 --> 05:26.640
to make the point that in a competitive 21st century economy what the market values is

05:26.640 --> 05:30.520
the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable.

05:30.520 --> 05:35.000
You can produce something that's rare and is valuable, the market will value that.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.320
What the market dismisses for the most part are activities that are easy to replicate

05:40.320 --> 05:42.960
and produce a small amount of value.

05:42.960 --> 05:48.560
Well social media use is the epitome of an easy to replicate activity that does not directly

05:48.560 --> 05:52.680
produce a lot of value, it's something that any 16 year old with a smartphone can do.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.560
By definition the market is not going to give a lot of value to those behaviors.

05:56.560 --> 06:02.400
It's instead going to reward the deep concentrated work required to build real skills and to

06:02.400 --> 06:07.880
apply those skills to produce things like a craftsman that are rare and that are valuable.

06:07.880 --> 06:14.720
To put it another way, if you can write an elegant algorithm, if you can write a legal

06:14.720 --> 06:18.240
brief that can change a case, if you can write a thousand words of prose that's going to

06:18.240 --> 06:20.240
fixate a reader right to the end.

06:20.240 --> 06:26.200
If you can look at a sea of ambiguous data and apply statistics and pull out insights

06:26.200 --> 06:29.400
that could transform a whole business strategy, if you can do these type of activities which

06:29.400 --> 06:36.400
require deep work that produce outcomes that are rare and valuable, people will find you.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.120
You will be able to write your own ticket, you will be able to build the foundation of

06:39.120 --> 06:43.720
a very meaningful and successful professional life regardless of how many Instagram followers

06:43.720 --> 06:48.360
you have.

06:48.360 --> 06:53.720
So this is the third common objection I hear when I suggest to people that they quit social

06:53.720 --> 06:56.720
media and in some sense I think it might be one of the most important.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.560
So this objection goes as follows, Cal, maybe I agree with you, maybe you're right, it's

07:00.560 --> 07:05.760
not a fundamental technology, maybe using social media is not at the core of my professional

07:05.760 --> 07:09.160
success, but you know what, it's harmless.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.000
I have some fun on it, weird Twitter is funny.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.960
I don't even really use it that much, I'm a first adopter, it's just kind of interesting

07:14.960 --> 07:18.480
to try it out and maybe I might miss out on something if I don't use it.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
What's the harm?

07:20.480 --> 07:25.880
So again I look back and I say this objection also is nonsense.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.600
In this case what it misses is what I think is a very important reality that we need to

07:29.600 --> 07:36.320
talk about more frankly, which is that social media brings with it multiple well documented

07:36.320 --> 07:39.160
significant harms.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.080
And we actually have to confront these harms head on when trying to make decisions about

07:43.080 --> 07:48.480
whether or not we embrace this technology and let it into our lives.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.920
So one of these harms that we know this technology brings has to do with your professional success.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.160
So I just argued before that the ability to focus intensely to produce things that are

07:59.160 --> 08:02.440
rare and valuable, to hone skills that the marketplace values, that this is what's going

08:02.440 --> 08:08.240
to matter in our economy, but right before that I argued that social media tools are

08:08.240 --> 08:10.840
designed to be addictive.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.120
The actual design, desired use case of these tools is that you fragment your attention

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
as much as possible throughout your waking hours.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.800
That's how these tools are designed to use.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.400
Well we have a growing amount of research which tells us that if you spend large portions

08:23.400 --> 08:27.480
of your day in a state of fragmented attention.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.880
So large portions of your day where you're constantly breaking up your attention, take

08:29.880 --> 08:34.440
a quick glance, do a just check, let me just quickly look at Instagram, that this can permanently

08:34.440 --> 08:37.720
reduce your capacity for concentration.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.880
In other words you could permanently reduce your capacity to do exactly the type of deep

08:41.880 --> 08:46.880
effort that we're finding to be more and more necessary in an increasingly competitive

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
economy.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.600
So social media use is not harmless, it can actually have a significant negative impact

08:51.600 --> 08:54.040
on your ability to thrive in the economy.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.440
I am especially worried about this when we look at the younger generation coming up which

08:57.440 --> 08:59.640
is the most saturated in this technology.

08:59.640 --> 09:05.160
If you lose your ability to sustain concentration you're going to become less and less relevant

09:05.160 --> 09:06.760
to this economy.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.880
There's also psychological harms that are well documented that social media brings that

09:10.880 --> 09:13.280
we do need to address.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.800
So we know from the research literature that the more you use social media the more likely

09:16.800 --> 09:20.060
you are to feel lonely or isolated.

09:20.060 --> 09:26.320
We know that the constant exposure to your friends carefully curated positive portrayals

09:26.320 --> 09:32.360
of their life can leave you to feel inadequate and can increase rates of depression.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.160
And something I think we're going to be hearing more about in the near future is that there's

09:36.160 --> 09:42.560
a fundamental mismatch between the way our brains are wired and this behavior of exposing

09:42.560 --> 09:47.000
yourself to stimuli with intermittent rewards throughout all of your waking hours.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.120
So it's one thing to spend a couple hours at the slot machine in Las Vegas but if you

09:50.120 --> 09:53.360
bring a slot machine with you and you pull that handle all day long from when you wake

09:53.360 --> 09:56.240
up to when you go to bed we're not wired from it.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.320
It short circuits the brain and we're starting to find that it has actual cognitive consequences

10:00.320 --> 10:05.480
one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety.

10:05.480 --> 10:09.000
So the canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.680
If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses they'll tell you along with the rise

10:14.680 --> 10:19.320
of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus came

10:19.320 --> 10:23.000
an explosion of anxiety related disorders on those campuses.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.520
So that's the canary in the coal mine.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.520
This type of behavior is a mismatch for our brain wiring it can make you feel miserable.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.640
So there's real cost to social media use which means when you're trying to decide should

10:34.640 --> 10:37.200
I use this or not saying it's harmless is not enough.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.680
You actually have to identify a significantly positive clear benefit that can outweigh these

10:42.680 --> 10:48.200
potential completely non-trivial harms.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.200
So people often ask okay but what is life like without social media that can actually

10:52.200 --> 10:54.560
be a little bit scary to think about.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.640
What I found from people I know who have gone through this process there can be a few weeks

10:57.640 --> 11:00.480
that are difficult that actually is like a true detox process.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.360
The first two weeks can be uncomfortable.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.680
You feel a little bit anxious you feel like you're missing a limb but after that things

11:07.680 --> 11:12.960
settle down and actually life after social media can be quite positive.

11:12.960 --> 11:17.440
There's two things I can report back to you from the world of no social media use.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.480
First it can be quite productive, be quite productive.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.880
So I'm a professor at a research institution I've written five books I rarely work past

11:25.880 --> 11:28.600
five p.m. on the weekday.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.400
Part of the way I'm trying to able to pull that off is because it turns out if you treat

11:32.400 --> 11:38.720
your attention with respect so you don't fragment it you allow it to stay whole you preserve

11:38.720 --> 11:41.440
your ability to concentrate when it comes time to work you can actually do one thing

11:41.440 --> 11:46.360
after another and do it with intensity and intensity can be traded for time it's surprising

11:46.360 --> 11:49.440
how much you can get done in eight hour day if you're able to give each thing intense

11:49.440 --> 11:52.640
concentration after another.

11:52.640 --> 11:57.280
Something else I can report back from life without social media is that outside of work

11:57.280 --> 12:01.280
things can be quite peaceful.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.960
So I often joke I'd be very comfortable being a 1930s farmer because if you look at my leisure

12:04.960 --> 12:09.720
time I read newspaper while the sun comes up I listen to baseball on the radio I honest

12:09.720 --> 12:15.240
to God sit in a leather chair and read hardcover books at night after my kids go to bed.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.960
It sounds old fashioned but I'll tell you they were on to something back then it's actually

12:19.960 --> 12:24.120
a restorative very peaceful way to actually spend your time out of work you don't have

12:24.120 --> 12:29.480
the constant home stimuli and the background home of anxiety that comes along with that.

12:29.480 --> 12:33.280
So life without social media is really not so bad.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.180
So we pulled together these threads and you see my full argument for why I think not everyone

12:37.180 --> 12:40.760
but certainly much more people than right now use social media much more people should

12:40.760 --> 12:45.520
not be using social media and that's because we can first summarize discard with the main

12:45.520 --> 12:49.760
concerns that somehow it's a fundamental technology you have to use nonsense it's a slot machine

12:49.760 --> 12:53.000
in your phone we can discard with this notion that you're not going to get a job if you

12:53.000 --> 12:56.800
don't use social media nonsense anything a 16 year old with a smartphone can do is not

12:56.800 --> 13:01.680
going to be what the market rewards and then I emphasize the point that there's real harms

13:01.680 --> 13:06.040
with it so it's not just harmless you really would have to have a significant benefit before

13:06.040 --> 13:10.200
you would actually say this trade off is worth and finally I noted that life without social

13:10.200 --> 13:13.520
media there's real positives associated with it.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.440
So I'm hoping that when many of you actually go through this same calculus you'll at least

13:18.440 --> 13:22.200
consider the perspective I'm making right now which is many more people would be much

13:22.200 --> 13:24.680
better off if they didn't use this technology.

13:24.680 --> 13:31.320
Now of course some of you might disagree some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques

13:31.320 --> 13:35.800
of me and my points and of course I welcome all negative feedback I just ask that you

13:35.800 --> 13:38.800
direct your comments towards Twitter thank you.
