1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
Well, imagine a 14-year-old teenager in the largest city of Brazil, facing a modeling

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,200
career which is in the beginning, chasing a dream.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,720
I found myself in my black bikinis and high heels, holding my modeling portfolio for the

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,360
very first time, and I was standing in front of this designer who had the power of choosing

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,720
me or not for his fashion show.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,360
And let me tell you, in the modeling industry, if you're lucky, the designers will ask you

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,640
to walk, try and close, and return another day.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,520
On the other hand, if you're unlucky, they'll coldly and maybe even rudely ask you to leave.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,040
Let's just say this time I was pretty unlucky, and I felt devastated.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,680
But that traumatizing moment allowed me to discover the amount of power I had in my hands.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Literally, in my hands.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,440
As soon as I left that room, I grabbed my cell phone and I began opening up to my 500

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,840
followers at the time about my failure and how it ignited a flame on me to do better

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,960
the next time.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,840
But I was most surprised with the response I had from my followers.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,920
So many of them identified themselves and deeply thanked me for the words of motivation.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,480
And from that moment on, I began sharing my daily experiences on social media, and I used

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,600
my platform to showcase my modeling work, arts, love for the environment, my hardships,

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,040
and most importantly, how I overcame them, but always maintaining a smile on my face.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,240
And I saw my followers beginning to grow.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,880
And now I'm 17 years old, and I have almost 340 followers on all my social platforms.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,840
And I call it the art of connecting through vulnerability.

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,560
As soon as I left that room, I opened up for all my followers.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,280
And by sharing the messages, and by sharing the lessons I learned while trying to become

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,080
the best individual I possibly can, I'm able to inspire and be inspired by so many

26
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
people.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm able to change someone's day.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,120
I have the power to make someone smile.

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,720
Actually, we all do.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,320
Even if it's only one person, it's worth it, because smiles multiply exponentially when

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,200
they're ignited by love.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,160
And now, I guess you're waiting for the moment where I'm going to talk about the negative

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,200
aspects of social media, which, well, there are many.

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
A classic example is this one.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm sure we've all seen.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,480
All our friends in the dinner table, in a party, and everybody's looking down.

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,000
Everybody's looking at their phones.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,640
So yeah, if we do not use it with caution, we can become passive consumers of it, and

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,440
maybe even addicts to it.

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,520
But we have a tendency to focus on the negative aspects of things.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,760
And if personal interrelationships are one of the key aspects in life, then social media

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
allows us to facilitate this.

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
It has allowed us to break barriers in communication.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,640
I can literally send a tweet to the president.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,520
I don't know if you'll answer me, but still, I have the power to do so.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
We all have.

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,320
And that's what matters.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,280
This device, which I'm sure we all have less than a meter away from us, allows us to communicate

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,320
with the entire world.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,200
And social media is the present and the future of our generation.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,680
We can fast from it, control the amount we use it, but there's no definite escape from

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,080
it.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,040
And that's why, while using our social media, we should be careful and always maintain a

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,880
positive attitude.

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,360
It has caused such an impact because it's changed the way we live our lives.

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Now, we don't need huge physical encyclopedias anymore, but we do need to be careful with

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,880
what we post on social media.

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,360
And that's scary, right?

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Yeah.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,960
It's scary to leave our comfort zones, but maybe we should.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,480
And I've always heard people talking about social media as if it is this toxic environment.

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,560
And for a while, I ended up believing it was.

63
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:32,040
But as soon as I discovered that by sharing the lessons we learn, and by knowing that

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,280
it will only become a toxic environment, because we allow it to be, I changed my mind.

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,400
So I was curious to see if people actually thought it was such a toxic environment.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,600
And I decided to make a survey on my Instagram account, which I would say is quite ironic.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
And these were the answers.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,600
9,050 people entered the survey, and 90% believed it is a toxic environment.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,960
But what is most shocking about these results is why they thought it was such a toxic environment.

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Most of the answers referred to this illusion we are able to create virtually.

71
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,800
We can selectively share only the positive aspects of life, while the people who are

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
viewing it, they will compare their entire life.

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,760
And therefore, I decided to ask them how they thought we could change the situation.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,840
And there were three main answers.

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,960
Firstly, we should share our reality, meaning that sharing our hardships may be more powerful

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
and more impacting on people's lives than only sharing the positive things.

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,480
Secondly, stop comparing each other.

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,240
We are all unique, and that's what makes us special.

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,880
And thirdly, we should be more aware of what is shared on social media.

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,000
Every single thing we share will have an impact on someone.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Therefore, let's be careful and not be shared, and make sure we only share what's positive.

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,640
And therefore, I decided to create this formula called effects.

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,840
And effects measures the impacts every single post will have on the followers on social media.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,120
I decided to measure how much I impacted my followers.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,400
And as soon as I noticed the amount I actually impacted on their lives, I tried to merge

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,640
what I discovered from the survey and my personal experiences to create this formula.

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,600
A means aesthetic.

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Is the aesthetic of your post visually pleasing?

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,320
F stands for function and purpose.

90
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,960
What is the function of your post?

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
What is the intention?

92
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
Is it for the good?

93
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,280
E stands for energy.

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,720
Does the energy your post creates is a positive one?

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
K stands for knowledge.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Does your post create relevant and new knowledge?

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,360
And S stands for sustainability.

98
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,720
Is your post encouraging sustainability?

99
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,760
This is a formula which you can use in every single post and it will work just fine.

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,560
So, an example is this photograph I posted on my social media.

101
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,880
Before I posted it, I checked its effects.

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,960
My intention was to raise awareness about plastic use and encourage people to use to run beach cleanups.

103
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
So, it has a pleasant overall aesthetic.

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,720
It is providing, it has a clear function.

105
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,920
It is providing people with good energy.

106
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
It will generate good energy.

107
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,200
And the knowledge is provided by the caption.

108
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,480
And obviously, it's encouraging sustainability.

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,680
But these are vital aspects which I consider in every single post I make on my social account.

110
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,520
But the formula is easily malleable and easily adaptable to the intention of your post.

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,720
This is a video I posted on my Instagram channel.

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:04,000
And it has as an intention to help students, just like me, to organize their mind before studying.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,600
And this time, the knowledge is much more important than the sustainability aspect.

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:16,960
Therefore, I simply cut sustainability out and introduce another case as a formula.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,440
And this is a form of joining our digital life and our real life and making them run side by side.

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Every single time this formula is applied, your post will necessarily provide good energy and positive energy.

117
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,680
And therefore, this will boost people's lives when they're offline, when they're off the platform.

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,000
And while I came to the conclusion that while I cannot control the behavior of others,

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120
I can control my own.

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,560
And I'm far from perfect, don't get me wrong.

121
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,360
But still, I try to use my space inside this platform for good.

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,040
And social media has allowed me to become not only a fashion model, but a role model for so many people.

123
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,000
And I invite you all to do the same.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,440
I invite you all to try applying the effects formula on your next five posts on social media.

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
And simply observe its effects.

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
We have a very powerful tool on our hands.

127
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,720
Let's use it for the good.

128
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Let's enjoy the right of life while trying to become the best individual we possibly can.

129
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,280
And helping others, by the way, let's help others to expand.

130
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Thank you.
