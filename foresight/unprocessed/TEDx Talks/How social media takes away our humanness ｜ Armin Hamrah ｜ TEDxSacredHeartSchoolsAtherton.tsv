0	19520	Hi, I'm Armin and wait, hold on one second.
19520	20920	Alright where was I?
20920	25200	Okay so obviously I was scripted and I meant it in a lighthearted way because it can be
25200	28120	amusing when we recognize our own faults.
28120	32480	What is not so funny is when our faults limit our real life interactions.
32480	35880	We have all been the person to whip out our phone at the wrong time, but rarely are we
35880	37440	called out for it.
37440	39880	Why is that?
39880	44520	We are the creators of social media, we have accustomed to this irrational idea that replacing
44520	48160	real conversations with online communication is okay.
48160	51880	I'm here to prove to you that it is not.
51880	55600	Social media has begun to encroach upon our humanity, to the point that it even takes
55600	58080	away our humaneness.
58080	61160	Now you may be wondering what this really means.
61160	65440	The dictionary says that it involves the nature of people.
65440	71760	Technology and more specifically social media are quite evidently not in our nature.
71760	77160	Not only does it change what we do, but it changes who we are.
77160	82120	The instant you were born were you inclined to send a snap to your friend or to cry, looking
82120	84400	into your mom's eyes.
84400	88880	The name social media also misses with our minds a little, making us think that what
88880	90680	we are doing is social.
90680	94480	In reality, it is the polar opposite.
94480	99160	In order to identify how social media brought us here, we need to examine our past.
99160	103320	So let me give you a brief overview of how social media came to be.
103320	108000	The first recognizable source of social media was Six Degrees, founded by Andrew Wynredt
108000	113840	in 1997, aiming to help friends communicate in a more convenient way, online.
113840	117480	The first renowned source of social media, Facebook, was launched seven years later by
117480	118960	Mark Zuckerberg.
118960	123120	It helps close friends keep in touch and distance friends stay in touch.
123120	127320	But by communicating online, it becomes unnatural.
127320	130680	This attitude we have is commonly misconceived as OK.
130680	134680	As human-like and unnatural, the intentions have been lost.
134680	141400	We are letting social media take us to places we never wanted to go and we are stuck.
141400	146120	Stop and amaze full of crossed wires and do not know which way to turn.
146120	148560	Which path should we take?
148560	154400	Now, it is easy to get lost in thinking about these thick questions, as they are deep and
154400	156080	unanswerable.
156080	161920	On the contrary, I feel that smaller and easier questions can help us see the issue from above.
161920	167360	I asked many of you the Spring VA survey a couple of thin and answerable questions to
167360	171600	help us see from a broader scope.
171600	177080	Out of the 145 respondents, approximately 90% of people said that they used their phones
177080	183560	for two hours or more on each weekday, and another 40% used them for four hours plus.
183560	189640	On the weekends, over 60% used them for five hours or more each day, adding up to ten hours
189640	190640	in total.
190640	194960	Now, when we find ourselves mindlessly wasting our time on these machines, how is it fair
194960	199680	to tell our parents we can't come to the table for a family dinner?
199680	203760	As my charts indicate, health and humanists are directly related.
203760	208680	According to the majority of you guys, social media takes up too much of your time.
208680	213080	Due to the ongoing pressure here in the technology capital of the world, many of us are sleep
213080	214760	deprived.
214760	218920	Social media almost always has a negative impact on the amount of sleep we get each night,
218920	222840	and less than 15% said that it never affected their sleep time.
222840	226720	This data also shows that students feel that their grades would be better without social
226720	229080	media.
229080	232880	Although we can all agree it has a number of social benefits, only some of your real
232880	235160	self is shown online.
235160	239520	You can pick out your identity and change who you are.
239520	244240	Online interactions have become junk food for our brains and have us hooked.
244240	246160	How much more direct could I get than that?
246160	251640	I just supplied you with relevant and relatable statistics that you could be a part of.
251640	259120	Most of you feel that it takes away from your sleep, that it is dehumanizing.
259120	263960	Cal Newport, a professor at Georgetown University, states that there is a growing amount of research
263960	268800	telling us that if you spend your day in a state of fragmented detention to take a quick
268800	275760	glance or just check your phone, it can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration.
275760	279680	Quite ironically, this act of trying to be a well-rounded human by taking care of your
279680	283400	social profile is actually dehumanizing.
283400	288760	All the attempts to say and touch distance you from being social.
288760	292400	Keeping in touch with our friends is good if used in a healthy way.
292400	296400	Communicating in real life is much more valuable than doing so online.
296400	300000	Next time you open your phone to message a nearby friend about how their day was or
300000	304720	send a picture of your face with no context, I urge you to set up a time to meet and hang
304720	305840	out.
305840	310480	This shouldn't take more than 10 or so seconds and is a great first step in retaining your
310480	312480	humanness.
312480	316560	If this is too hard for you at the moment and you need time to adjust to this virtue of
316560	321760	spending less time online, try sending yourself a screen time if your parents haven't already.
321760	326240	If they have, maybe ask them to lower it a bit, to challenge yourself and strive for
326240	327920	a better you.
327920	335200	Whether it's social media or social life, TED Talks or TikToks, you need to make a choice.
