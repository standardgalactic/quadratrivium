00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hi everyone.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.360
I come from a country where there was communism before I was born, and actually when I was

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
born.

00:16.360 --> 00:22.160
And my parents didn't have the same options as I do.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.960
They didn't have the same options to go out and start a business.

00:25.960 --> 00:33.080
They didn't have the same options of having a transparent government, of being able to

00:33.080 --> 00:34.720
go to the government and ask for something.

00:34.720 --> 00:40.880
In fact, my parents didn't join the Communist Party, even though they were college educated,

00:40.880 --> 00:48.040
and they didn't have the same benefits, even though, you know, kind of now everybody does.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.200
And I feel lucky about that.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.320
I feel lucky that we have a chance to have equal opportunity.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.640
And I think, you know, how I think of social media, the business I'm in, is that it gives

01:00.640 --> 01:07.200
us more equal opportunity in what we do, and that it enhances the way we think about things.

01:07.200 --> 01:16.720
So if I define social media first for you, so for me, social media isn't about Facebook,

01:16.720 --> 01:21.080
isn't about Twitter, isn't about all these platforms together.

01:21.080 --> 01:25.720
Social media for me is the people on those platforms.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.160
It's you, you, everyone.

01:28.160 --> 01:35.400
So to think about social media, you can think about it as the platforms, but it's the people.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.840
When we're thinking about working with governments, when we're thinking about working with companies,

01:40.840 --> 01:49.200
the way we often feel is that we're the little guys, and there are big companies, big institutions,

01:49.560 --> 01:51.960
that you have to be working with.

01:51.960 --> 01:57.040
But what we don't realize as people is that we have a lot more power.

01:57.040 --> 02:03.520
And the last few years have shown us the examples of that power, not the full extent of it,

02:03.520 --> 02:06.040
but the first examples of that power.

02:06.040 --> 02:11.600
So we see this from Egypt, from Tahrir Square, a couple of years ago in the Arab Spring.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.000
That was just the beginning.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.240
We see this in Turkey.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.280
Turkey banned Twitter.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.360
Then they banned YouTube.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.680
The U.S. called it the modern-day book burning.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.080
And I believe that's exactly what it was.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.960
It was a political move.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.880
It got quickly ousted by the Supreme Court, who says this is not constitutional.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.760
This is against freedom of speech, which is great, and that's what they did just two days ago.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.680
Thank God.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.640
But during the ban, people totally defied it.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.360
In the first day of the ban, Twitter and Turkey sent more tweets than ever before historically.

02:51.360 --> 02:57.320
And they kept finding new and new ways after the government kept blocking them and blocking them and blocking them.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.760
They kept finding new ways to get on Twitter, even though they didn't really have to.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.880
They could have talked to each other on Facebook.

03:03.880 --> 03:08.760
It was for the sake of doing it, of being able to tweet when it's banned by the government,

03:08.760 --> 03:11.440
because it was the wrong thing to do.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.880
And then there are right examples, like the White House.

03:13.880 --> 03:20.960
The White House puts up a petition where everybody that gets over 100,000 votes now, it was actually lower,

03:20.960 --> 03:25.800
but can come in and get a response from the White House.

03:25.800 --> 03:32.520
Now, of course, there are silly things like deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card.

03:32.520 --> 03:39.120
There are more serious matters, like, you know, we would like to build a death star.

03:39.120 --> 03:44.440
And they respond to that, that it's not in their budget, unfortunately.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.440
But they would love to, and they've got a lot of more exciting projects.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.560
But there's no budget for the death star.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.440
No, but really, there are amazing projects, actually.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.680
There were, through this platform, there was Stop SOPA through this platform,

03:56.680 --> 04:00.600
was that had every time it had over 100,000 petition votes.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.120
And that's great. That's something that really helps open up the government, open up the businesses.

04:06.120 --> 04:11.760
And have you understand that, okay, I'm living in a world where the government listens.

04:11.760 --> 04:17.840
Now, I don't have 100,000 votes yet, but there are easier ways through social media to get them today.

04:17.840 --> 04:22.600
So I consider this platform a social platform.

04:22.600 --> 04:29.640
And one thing to visualize, I mean, politicians today, they really feel like they're in power,

04:29.640 --> 04:33.960
but it's a democracy that we vote these guys into their roles.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.920
And unless they really listen to what we're saying, and unless they do what we kind of want,

04:38.920 --> 04:41.400
we won't vote them there again.

04:41.400 --> 04:46.320
And the better off, I mean, we have a chance to be social about it, discuss opinions,

04:46.320 --> 04:48.960
change facts, exchange information.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.800
And that information, I mean, I've heard so many times,

04:51.800 --> 04:54.440
like what this politician did, what this politician did.

04:54.440 --> 05:01.200
Very soon, you'll be able to monitor each politician by what he said on social media,

05:01.240 --> 05:06.640
in the media, what he did, what he voted for, for so perfectly,

05:06.640 --> 05:10.200
that they will not be able to hide against their votes anymore.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.880
And this is, of course, applies to governments, this applies to politicians,

05:13.880 --> 05:18.160
this applies to institution, as well as companies in the market.

05:18.160 --> 05:24.120
So there was a tweet that, it was a Twitter hack of the Associated Press,

05:24.120 --> 05:28.640
and the Associated Press sent out this tweet to explosions in the White House,

05:28.640 --> 05:31.840
and Barack Obama is injured.

05:31.840 --> 05:39.200
The market immediately responded, this tweet costs over $100 billion.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.760
That's about a billion per character, just if you're counting it.

05:43.760 --> 05:49.920
And the market quickly recovered, but it could have been 10 billion higher during that day,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.360
if you look at the numbers.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.240
You kind of see that the market could have been $510 billion higher that day.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.840
So it only cost the market $510 billion, still a pretty good hack.

06:00.840 --> 06:05.480
But that only shows you how powerful social media is.

06:05.480 --> 06:09.640
And maybe eventually, without social media, we'd come to the same conclusion.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.440
But social media works as an amplifier.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.600
We get there faster, we get there easier, and it works perfectly for that.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.840
Another great example is Starbucks.

06:20.840 --> 06:25.320
Starbucks in the UK doesn't pay corporate tax in the UK.

06:25.320 --> 06:31.120
They funnel their money through different procedures that I don't understand, but they do that.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.240
And the UK was very, very upset with them.

06:33.240 --> 06:38.760
They're a bunch of protests, social media updates, kind of people talking about social,

06:38.760 --> 06:45.440
the damage was done to them, to their identity, to their brand.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.360
And that kind of drives ROI down for that brand.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.640
I mean, PR-wise, it's a disaster.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.960
Another case is British Airways.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.840
They have quite bad customer service online and through social media.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.080
I mean, try writing them.

07:01.080 --> 07:05.640
There was even this guy that wrote them, says, guys, I really need your help.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.000
I lost my luggage.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.120
I'm gonna be in Portugal for the next two days.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.240
They responded in three.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.760
So this guy obviously didn't need any more help.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.960
Another one and an example of that escalating is somebody said,

07:19.960 --> 07:21.440
don't fly British Airways.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.520
This customer was in no way motivated.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.120
It wasn't any motivation in particular.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.960
Their customer service is horrendous.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.320
That would be a normal, regular tweet.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.400
Every company gets a million of them.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.320
The difference between this and

07:34.320 --> 07:38.960
all the other tweets that they've been getting is that this person paid for

07:38.960 --> 07:39.640
promoting it.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.320
He paid a couple thousand dollars to promote this tweet to a lot of people.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.240
They now call that complain-vertising.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.240
Power of the individual.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.720
Amplify, this guy had 100 followers or something like that, right?

07:56.720 --> 08:00.520
I mean, 100 followers amplified through paid media.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.520
They're retweets.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.120
Then the media attention and then every piece of media in the world was

08:06.120 --> 08:11.320
reporting from BBC to Financial Times, promoted tweet to British Airways,

08:11.320 --> 08:13.480
complaining about customer service.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.600
PR campaign worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.920
That is the power of one individual, of one tweet.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.280
And that's quite powerful.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.320
Now, if we remember the world without social media,

08:27.320 --> 08:31.120
I mean, we imagine it today, we feel like, okay, what was it like?

08:31.120 --> 08:36.600
But really, if you think about it, world without having a phone being connected

08:36.600 --> 08:41.800
to a network being able to take a picture, that's what really makes a difference.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.760
In Tunisia, there was a revolution during the Arab Spring, and

08:45.760 --> 08:48.120
they successfully took down the government.

08:48.120 --> 08:54.000
But before that, two years before the burning of this guy that burned himself.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.960
I mean, there was another kind of spark, and it was much stronger.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.920
But at the time, it didn't stick.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.120
The people didn't go out to the streets.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.840
And it was for a couple of reasons.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.480
But primarily, Facebook penetration at the time was at 50,000.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.880
There was no way to spread the word for the people.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.160
They didn't have enough phones connected with data so

09:14.160 --> 09:16.600
they could spread the word between each other.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.080
So there was a problem.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.880
But two years later, with Facebook being at the millions of users,

09:22.880 --> 09:27.040
with social media being connected, with people being connected on their phones,

09:27.040 --> 09:30.720
they suddenly shed it out to the world and the problem was gone.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.240
Because people with their phones, they're connected.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.960
Ten years ago, this was not the case.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.920
And in 2005, we all spoke about citizen journalism.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.240
It's gonna be about citizen journalism, mobile citizen journalism.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.280
People taking pictures, reporting crime, reporting it to the media.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.320
Citizen journalism is social media today.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.760
It just got renamed.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.800
And we don't call it citizen journalism anymore.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.080
And coming back to the power of the individual.

10:01.080 --> 10:06.600
The individuals today have more power than they ever, ever had before.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.600
They have power to talk and change companies, to change governments,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.480
to change institutions.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.920
And I encourage every one of you to think about how you can influence

10:15.920 --> 10:17.040
the world around you.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.920
Because you can influence it more than you ever could for

10:20.920 --> 10:22.560
the last several generations.

10:22.560 --> 10:26.680
You have the power of social media, the power of amplifying those thoughts,

10:26.680 --> 10:28.720
amplifying those actions.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.320
So today, you're standing against one big company and

10:33.320 --> 10:36.880
they did something very wrong, you're not alone.

10:36.880 --> 10:41.120
You have a lot of company that helps you, and that's a good thing.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.880
And when I look at companies, and when I look at companies and

10:43.880 --> 10:48.440
the way they do things, these are the values that they should be having.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.520
They don't all have those values.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.400
I mean, I myself, I have a company of running it for seven years now.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.480
And before that, I've had it for six years.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.920
I had a company that I ran for seven years, and it was a mobile games company.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.720
And that didn't go so well.

11:04.720 --> 11:09.080
It bankrupted for me, and that was a very difficult moment.

11:09.080 --> 11:14.120
And the way I chose to deal with that ending was I chose to keep it to myself,

11:14.120 --> 11:17.120
work it through, and try to find a solution on my own.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.720
I didn't communicate it to anyone, must just to my closest.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.280
And I kept it in, all internal, completely internalized.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.440
At the other hand, there's another startup now that had gone bankrupt.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.360
And they're tweeting about it.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.440
They're blogging about it.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.280
They're publishing their PNL.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.440
And they're saying, this is what we still think is valuable about our business.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.080
This is why we did it, and this is why we think it's valuable.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.320
And they're actually managing through the process very well.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.200
Investors are very happy with the process.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.280
But I didn't do it that way.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.240
And of course, I didn't have the options of social media,

11:51.240 --> 11:52.760
of being able to put it on a platform.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.640
I'd have to program that blog, figure it out.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.000
By the time I'd be done, I'd already be finished.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
So, we didn't really have those options long time ago.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
So I believe in the next 10 years of social and in social media,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
is that individuals' voice will be heard so much more.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
U.S. people, you have new powers that you never thought you could have before.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
My parents, they look at this, they're like, whoa, what's going on?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
They don't understand this.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
But at the end of the day, they will be users of this one way or the other.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
They will go and vaguely comment on your Facebook updates, at least, if nothing else.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And social media, it's about people being connected.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Social media in the next 10 years will help solve bigger problems.

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
Today, we share things in social media that are perhaps not the most important.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Of course, it's important for us to share how we feel.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
This is a great picture.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
I felt nervous about that.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
But I think social media will be used for bigger and bigger causes

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
to help create a united mind of people to change something,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
to help finally change the world and create a better place.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And institutions and companies, as a result of that,

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
institutions and companies will have to be a lot more flexible than we are today.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
We have the power of choice.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And this is the most beautiful thing in social media.

13:19.000 --> 13:31.000
What I'll conclude with is that when I look at the most retweeted tweet of all times,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
is an Oscars selfie with a bunch of celebrities.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Now, don't get me wrong, they're gorgeous celebrities.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
But at the same time, it lacks vision.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It has over 3 million retweets.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
Yet at the same time, why don't we retweet something stronger?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Something that will help change the world.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
We need it, and not a selfie, hopefully.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
We need a picture, a message, an action that will help us change the world,

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
whether it's a problem of health, of hunger, of specific issues that we want to solve and address.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
We want to raise money on Kickstarter.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
We want to raise a lot of money through charity.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
That's exactly what social media is for, and that's what it's great.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
And that's what everybody should be able to use it for.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Thank you very much.
