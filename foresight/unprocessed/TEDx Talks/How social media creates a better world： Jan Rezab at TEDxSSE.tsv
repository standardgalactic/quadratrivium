0	8000	Hi everyone.
8000	15360	I come from a country where there was communism before I was born, and actually when I was
15360	16360	born.
16360	22160	And my parents didn't have the same options as I do.
22160	25960	They didn't have the same options to go out and start a business.
25960	33080	They didn't have the same options of having a transparent government, of being able to
33080	34720	go to the government and ask for something.
34720	40880	In fact, my parents didn't join the Communist Party, even though they were college educated,
40880	48040	and they didn't have the same benefits, even though, you know, kind of now everybody does.
48040	49200	And I feel lucky about that.
49200	54320	I feel lucky that we have a chance to have equal opportunity.
54320	60640	And I think, you know, how I think of social media, the business I'm in, is that it gives
60640	67200	us more equal opportunity in what we do, and that it enhances the way we think about things.
67200	76720	So if I define social media first for you, so for me, social media isn't about Facebook,
76720	81080	isn't about Twitter, isn't about all these platforms together.
81080	85720	Social media for me is the people on those platforms.
85720	88160	It's you, you, everyone.
88160	95400	So to think about social media, you can think about it as the platforms, but it's the people.
95400	100840	When we're thinking about working with governments, when we're thinking about working with companies,
100840	109200	the way we often feel is that we're the little guys, and there are big companies, big institutions,
109560	111960	that you have to be working with.
111960	117040	But what we don't realize as people is that we have a lot more power.
117040	123520	And the last few years have shown us the examples of that power, not the full extent of it,
123520	126040	but the first examples of that power.
126040	131600	So we see this from Egypt, from Tahrir Square, a couple of years ago in the Arab Spring.
131600	134000	That was just the beginning.
134000	136240	We see this in Turkey.
136280	138280	Turkey banned Twitter.
138280	140360	Then they banned YouTube.
140360	143680	The U.S. called it the modern-day book burning.
143680	146080	And I believe that's exactly what it was.
146080	147960	It was a political move.
147960	152880	It got quickly ousted by the Supreme Court, who says this is not constitutional.
152880	158760	This is against freedom of speech, which is great, and that's what they did just two days ago.
158760	160680	Thank God.
160680	164640	But during the ban, people totally defied it.
164640	171360	In the first day of the ban, Twitter and Turkey sent more tweets than ever before historically.
171360	177320	And they kept finding new and new ways after the government kept blocking them and blocking them and blocking them.
177320	181760	They kept finding new ways to get on Twitter, even though they didn't really have to.
181760	183880	They could have talked to each other on Facebook.
183880	188760	It was for the sake of doing it, of being able to tweet when it's banned by the government,
188760	191440	because it was the wrong thing to do.
191440	193880	And then there are right examples, like the White House.
193880	200960	The White House puts up a petition where everybody that gets over 100,000 votes now, it was actually lower,
200960	205800	but can come in and get a response from the White House.
205800	212520	Now, of course, there are silly things like deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card.
212520	219120	There are more serious matters, like, you know, we would like to build a death star.
219120	224440	And they respond to that, that it's not in their budget, unfortunately.
224440	227440	But they would love to, and they've got a lot of more exciting projects.
227440	229560	But there's no budget for the death star.
229560	232440	No, but really, there are amazing projects, actually.
232440	236680	There were, through this platform, there was Stop SOPA through this platform,
236680	240600	was that had every time it had over 100,000 petition votes.
240600	246120	And that's great. That's something that really helps open up the government, open up the businesses.
246120	251760	And have you understand that, okay, I'm living in a world where the government listens.
251760	257840	Now, I don't have 100,000 votes yet, but there are easier ways through social media to get them today.
257840	262600	So I consider this platform a social platform.
262600	269640	And one thing to visualize, I mean, politicians today, they really feel like they're in power,
269640	273960	but it's a democracy that we vote these guys into their roles.
274000	278920	And unless they really listen to what we're saying, and unless they do what we kind of want,
278920	281400	we won't vote them there again.
281400	286320	And the better off, I mean, we have a chance to be social about it, discuss opinions,
286320	288960	change facts, exchange information.
288960	291800	And that information, I mean, I've heard so many times,
291800	294440	like what this politician did, what this politician did.
294440	301200	Very soon, you'll be able to monitor each politician by what he said on social media,
301240	306640	in the media, what he did, what he voted for, for so perfectly,
306640	310200	that they will not be able to hide against their votes anymore.
310200	313880	And this is, of course, applies to governments, this applies to politicians,
313880	318160	this applies to institution, as well as companies in the market.
318160	324120	So there was a tweet that, it was a Twitter hack of the Associated Press,
324120	328640	and the Associated Press sent out this tweet to explosions in the White House,
328640	331840	and Barack Obama is injured.
331840	339200	The market immediately responded, this tweet costs over $100 billion.
339200	343760	That's about a billion per character, just if you're counting it.
343760	349920	And the market quickly recovered, but it could have been 10 billion higher during that day,
349920	351360	if you look at the numbers.
351360	355240	You kind of see that the market could have been $510 billion higher that day.
355240	360840	So it only cost the market $510 billion, still a pretty good hack.
360840	365480	But that only shows you how powerful social media is.
365480	369640	And maybe eventually, without social media, we'd come to the same conclusion.
369640	372440	But social media works as an amplifier.
372440	377600	We get there faster, we get there easier, and it works perfectly for that.
377600	380840	Another great example is Starbucks.
380840	385320	Starbucks in the UK doesn't pay corporate tax in the UK.
385320	391120	They funnel their money through different procedures that I don't understand, but they do that.
391120	393240	And the UK was very, very upset with them.
393240	398760	They're a bunch of protests, social media updates, kind of people talking about social,
398760	405440	the damage was done to them, to their identity, to their brand.
405440	409360	And that kind of drives ROI down for that brand.
409400	411640	I mean, PR-wise, it's a disaster.
411640	414960	Another case is British Airways.
414960	419840	They have quite bad customer service online and through social media.
419840	421080	I mean, try writing them.
421080	425640	There was even this guy that wrote them, says, guys, I really need your help.
425640	427000	I lost my luggage.
427000	430120	I'm gonna be in Portugal for the next two days.
430120	431240	They responded in three.
432720	435760	So this guy obviously didn't need any more help.
435760	439960	Another one and an example of that escalating is somebody said,
439960	441440	don't fly British Airways.
441440	443520	This customer was in no way motivated.
443520	446120	It wasn't any motivation in particular.
446120	447960	Their customer service is horrendous.
447960	450320	That would be a normal, regular tweet.
450320	452400	Every company gets a million of them.
452400	454320	The difference between this and
454320	458960	all the other tweets that they've been getting is that this person paid for
458960	459640	promoting it.
461280	465320	He paid a couple thousand dollars to promote this tweet to a lot of people.
465320	467240	They now call that complain-vertising.
469480	471240	Power of the individual.
472760	476720	Amplify, this guy had 100 followers or something like that, right?
476720	480520	I mean, 100 followers amplified through paid media.
480520	481520	They're retweets.
481520	486120	Then the media attention and then every piece of media in the world was
486120	491320	reporting from BBC to Financial Times, promoted tweet to British Airways,
491320	493480	complaining about customer service.
493520	496600	PR campaign worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
496600	499920	That is the power of one individual, of one tweet.
501640	503280	And that's quite powerful.
503280	507320	Now, if we remember the world without social media,
507320	511120	I mean, we imagine it today, we feel like, okay, what was it like?
511120	516600	But really, if you think about it, world without having a phone being connected
516600	521800	to a network being able to take a picture, that's what really makes a difference.
521800	525760	In Tunisia, there was a revolution during the Arab Spring, and
525760	528120	they successfully took down the government.
528120	534000	But before that, two years before the burning of this guy that burned himself.
534000	538960	I mean, there was another kind of spark, and it was much stronger.
538960	540920	But at the time, it didn't stick.
540920	543120	The people didn't go out to the streets.
543120	544840	And it was for a couple of reasons.
544840	549480	But primarily, Facebook penetration at the time was at 50,000.
549480	551880	There was no way to spread the word for the people.
551880	554160	They didn't have enough phones connected with data so
554160	556600	they could spread the word between each other.
556600	558080	So there was a problem.
558080	562880	But two years later, with Facebook being at the millions of users,
562880	567040	with social media being connected, with people being connected on their phones,
567040	570720	they suddenly shed it out to the world and the problem was gone.
570720	574240	Because people with their phones, they're connected.
574240	576960	Ten years ago, this was not the case.
576960	580920	And in 2005, we all spoke about citizen journalism.
580920	585240	It's gonna be about citizen journalism, mobile citizen journalism.
585240	589280	People taking pictures, reporting crime, reporting it to the media.
590560	593320	Citizen journalism is social media today.
593320	594760	It just got renamed.
594760	596800	And we don't call it citizen journalism anymore.
598280	601080	And coming back to the power of the individual.
601080	606600	The individuals today have more power than they ever, ever had before.
606600	610600	They have power to talk and change companies, to change governments,
610600	612480	to change institutions.
612480	615920	And I encourage every one of you to think about how you can influence
615920	617040	the world around you.
617040	620920	Because you can influence it more than you ever could for
620920	622560	the last several generations.
622560	626680	You have the power of social media, the power of amplifying those thoughts,
626680	628720	amplifying those actions.
628720	633320	So today, you're standing against one big company and
633320	636880	they did something very wrong, you're not alone.
636880	641120	You have a lot of company that helps you, and that's a good thing.
641120	643880	And when I look at companies, and when I look at companies and
643880	648440	the way they do things, these are the values that they should be having.
648440	650520	They don't all have those values.
651600	656400	I mean, I myself, I have a company of running it for seven years now.
656400	658480	And before that, I've had it for six years.
658480	662920	I had a company that I ran for seven years, and it was a mobile games company.
662920	664720	And that didn't go so well.
664720	669080	It bankrupted for me, and that was a very difficult moment.
669080	674120	And the way I chose to deal with that ending was I chose to keep it to myself,
674120	677120	work it through, and try to find a solution on my own.
677120	680720	I didn't communicate it to anyone, must just to my closest.
680720	684280	And I kept it in, all internal, completely internalized.
685920	689440	At the other hand, there's another startup now that had gone bankrupt.
689440	691360	And they're tweeting about it.
691360	692440	They're blogging about it.
692440	694280	They're publishing their PNL.
694280	697440	And they're saying, this is what we still think is valuable about our business.
697440	701080	This is why we did it, and this is why we think it's valuable.
701080	703320	And they're actually managing through the process very well.
703320	705200	Investors are very happy with the process.
706480	708280	But I didn't do it that way.
708280	711240	And of course, I didn't have the options of social media,
711240	712760	of being able to put it on a platform.
712760	714640	I'd have to program that blog, figure it out.
714640	717000	By the time I'd be done, I'd already be finished.
718000	722000	So, we didn't really have those options long time ago.
722000	728000	So I believe in the next 10 years of social and in social media,
728000	732000	is that individuals' voice will be heard so much more.
732000	737000	U.S. people, you have new powers that you never thought you could have before.
737000	742000	My parents, they look at this, they're like, whoa, what's going on?
742000	744000	They don't understand this.
745000	749000	But at the end of the day, they will be users of this one way or the other.
749000	754000	They will go and vaguely comment on your Facebook updates, at least, if nothing else.
754000	757000	And social media, it's about people being connected.
757000	761000	Social media in the next 10 years will help solve bigger problems.
761000	768000	Today, we share things in social media that are perhaps not the most important.
768000	771000	Of course, it's important for us to share how we feel.
771000	772000	This is a great picture.
772000	773000	I felt nervous about that.
773000	777000	But I think social media will be used for bigger and bigger causes
777000	781000	to help create a united mind of people to change something,
781000	785000	to help finally change the world and create a better place.
785000	788000	And institutions and companies, as a result of that,
788000	793000	institutions and companies will have to be a lot more flexible than we are today.
793000	795000	We have the power of choice.
795000	799000	And this is the most beautiful thing in social media.
799000	811000	What I'll conclude with is that when I look at the most retweeted tweet of all times,
811000	815000	is an Oscars selfie with a bunch of celebrities.
815000	819000	Now, don't get me wrong, they're gorgeous celebrities.
819000	823000	But at the same time, it lacks vision.
823000	826000	It has over 3 million retweets.
826000	831000	Yet at the same time, why don't we retweet something stronger?
831000	833000	Something that will help change the world.
833000	836000	We need it, and not a selfie, hopefully.
836000	842000	We need a picture, a message, an action that will help us change the world,
842000	850000	whether it's a problem of health, of hunger, of specific issues that we want to solve and address.
850000	853000	We want to raise money on Kickstarter.
853000	855000	We want to raise a lot of money through charity.
855000	859000	That's exactly what social media is for, and that's what it's great.
859000	864000	And that's what everybody should be able to use it for.
864000	866000	Thank you very much.
