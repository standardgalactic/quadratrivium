00:00.000 --> 00:18.320
Hi, thank you very much.

00:18.320 --> 00:23.960
I'd like to start out by asking everyone to power down their devices during my talk.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.080
And for those of you that don't know, the power button is either on the top or on the

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
side of your phone.

00:30.080 --> 00:35.080
I'd also like to thank the guys from state.com for permission to use this video.

00:35.080 --> 00:41.080
I want to post about how great this coffee is, but I can't think of a funny way to say it.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.080
This post is like a page long.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.080
How do I shorten this?

00:44.080 --> 00:46.080
Just take out all the vowels.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.080
No, seriously, seriously.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.080
Hey guys, you on Twitter?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Follow me.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.080
Sometimes I want to move to another country where I wouldn't have to deal with this stuff.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.080
What?

00:56.080 --> 00:58.080
I'm just tweeting.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.080
Do you think I'm making fun of you?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
Hashtag follow the day.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.080
Hashtag, I quit.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.080
Just kidding.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.080
Hashtag multi-tasking.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.080
Hashtag squirm work.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
Hashtag road trip, dudes.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
Not while you're driving, man.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.080
Hashtag yo, Loi.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.080
Has anybody even been on this?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
Fasties.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.080
Coffee friends.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.080
Mini bagels.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
Shoes.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
On subscribe.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
What's up, Facebook?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
Follow my new shoes.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
Unfollow.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Ah, look!

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Coffee.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
We're going viral.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.080
Nobody cares.

01:26.080 --> 01:33.080
I'm going to hide all of you.

01:33.080 --> 01:41.080
Dude, I made the popular page.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.080
So I want to talk about three things tonight.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.080
How social media is disconnecting us.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
What's happening now.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.080
And how we can do better.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.080
Gallup took a poll in 2001.

01:54.080 --> 01:59.080
And every average American said that they had 10 really close friends.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.080
The same poll this year said we had two.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.080
So what happened?

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
Where did everybody go?

02:05.080 --> 02:07.080
And I think we know where.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.080
I think we've all seen this by now.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.080
Maybe even been a little guilty of it ourselves.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.080
I see families like this out to dinner all the time.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.080
And it drives me nuts.

02:18.080 --> 02:24.080
And I see couples on dates, clearly together, but on their cell phones.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.080
It's one of the strangest things I've ever seen.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.080
But to me, what does this say when we are together?

02:31.080 --> 02:36.080
To me, it says that there's someone, anyone on the other end of the screen,

02:36.080 --> 02:40.080
that's way more important than you, who's right in front of my face.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.080
There's a study by a merry maker that says we touch our phones or check our phones

02:45.080 --> 02:48.080
150 times a day.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.080
And we upload 1.8 billion pictures to Facebook.

02:52.080 --> 02:59.080
That's a little over a sixth of the population a day for pictures.

02:59.080 --> 03:02.080
Remember when the internet was new?

03:02.080 --> 03:04.080
Those of us that do?

03:04.080 --> 03:08.080
That was really actually only about 25 years ago, if you can imagine.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.080
I remember when we had pagers, time seemed a little simpler back then.

03:13.080 --> 03:18.080
You'd get the beep, you may return the call, you may not return the call.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.080
Or when we had answer machines, you could always say that you weren't home.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.080
Now we have a list of all these excuses that may or may not work.

03:27.080 --> 03:32.080
But it seems like the more we talk about how technology divides us,

03:32.080 --> 03:35.080
the more we demand from it.

03:35.080 --> 03:42.080
And I think that's a huge risk that we're running in our society today.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.080
We have this shortened vocabulary now.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.080
It's all about the texting.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.080
Even my mom, she says, just text me.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.080
And she's a little bit older, I won't say, because she'll see this later.

03:54.080 --> 04:07.080
So, OMG, oh my goodness, LOL, laugh out loud, WTF, why the face?

04:07.080 --> 04:13.080
So when we abbreviate our vocabulary, what we risk is losing the nuances, subtleties,

04:13.080 --> 04:20.080
and intimate parts of our personalities that make up our very rich American vocabulary.

04:20.080 --> 04:26.080
And with that shortening, we lose and run the risk of not being able to fully express ourselves

04:26.080 --> 04:29.080
and communicate as we move forward.

04:29.080 --> 04:36.080
And that losing our vocabulary equals a potential loss of being able to express ourselves.

04:36.080 --> 04:43.080
How many times does anybody look in horror when their cell phone rings with a personal call?

04:43.080 --> 04:47.080
A whole conversation starts happening in your head when it rings.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.080
Tiffany, why is Tiffany calling?

04:51.080 --> 04:54.080
What does Tiffany want?

04:54.080 --> 04:56.080
Why is she calling me?

04:56.080 --> 05:01.080
And then you have that last ringtone moment where you know you have to pick up that phone

05:01.080 --> 05:04.080
or let it go to a voicemail you may or may not check.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.080
Hey, Tiffany, what's up?

05:06.080 --> 05:13.080
The whole time thinking she could have completely texted this whole message to me.

05:13.080 --> 05:21.080
If I asked everybody in here if they could take their phone, set it down, and walk away for an hour, could you do it?

05:21.080 --> 05:25.080
An immediate sense of panic comes over us.

05:25.080 --> 05:34.080
We will turn the car around, even if we are halfway to our destination, just to go back and get our cell phone.

05:34.080 --> 05:41.080
I had a blackberry, which I adored, and I kept it for a really long time.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.080
But you guys remember when we had blackberries, don't you?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.080
What did we call them back then?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.080
That's right, crackberries.

05:49.080 --> 05:53.080
So it's no surprise where we've landed ourselves now.

05:53.080 --> 05:58.080
So I took my blackberry into the Apple Store when everybody else had their Apple phone

05:58.080 --> 06:05.080
and the transition was more than I could bear experiencing phone shame.

06:05.080 --> 06:10.080
And I went in, and of course it was completely jam-packed at the Apple Store, and this cute kid comes up to me,

06:10.080 --> 06:12.080
and he's like, may I help you?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.080
And I said, yes, you can.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.080
I would like a phone that could do this.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.080
So I took my blackberry and I threw it on the ground, but pop, pop, pop.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.080
It goes all the way across the store.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.080
Everybody just stops in the store, gasps.

06:27.080 --> 06:32.080
And I walk over and I pick it up, and I said, see the screen's fully intact and it still works.

06:32.080 --> 06:41.080
And he just looked not missing a beat, and he said, we don't have a phone that can do that.

06:41.080 --> 06:46.080
A new study out by the Cohen's Children Medical Center in New Hyde Park,

06:46.080 --> 06:53.080
their study says this year that texting while driving is now the number one cause of death for teens.

06:53.080 --> 06:58.080
More than drinking and driving.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.080
So what this means is there's a lot of drunks on the road.

07:03.080 --> 07:09.080
I was speaking to some high school students, and of course, you know, they're always willing to make some sort of bargain,

07:09.080 --> 07:14.080
and they raise their hand and they said, well, what if you're at a stop sign?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Or what if you're at a stoplight?

07:16.080 --> 07:22.080
And I said my message was I don't think there's really anything that can't wait until we get to our destination.

07:22.080 --> 07:28.080
And don't forget if you send that text at the stop sign, they're probably going to text you back while you're driving.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.080
So maybe not the best idea.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
And I'll give you an example.

07:32.080 --> 07:37.080
If you're driving 55 miles an hour and you look down at your phone for five seconds,

07:37.080 --> 07:45.080
you've just now driven the length of an entire football field completely blind.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.080
And it's not just our kids.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
It's us as well.

07:49.080 --> 07:57.080
We are constantly at work, constantly connected, and constantly distracted.

07:57.080 --> 08:03.080
Every one of us thinks of some sort of extreme vacation we need to go on where we may say to our bosses,

08:03.080 --> 08:06.080
you know, I'm going to go on a very extreme vacation.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.080
There's just absolutely no way I can return anything during the day.

08:10.080 --> 08:15.080
But you're still expected to go back to the hotel and return your work emails.

08:15.080 --> 08:20.080
So if we as adults are this distracted, our kids are seeing this.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.080
We're always at work.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.080
And where are they?

08:24.080 --> 08:27.080
Always on their devices.

08:27.080 --> 08:32.080
And how many times have you guys heard, what do you mean you don't know?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.080
I posted it on Facebook.

08:34.080 --> 08:41.080
So for some reason now, we're all supposed to know about each other's lives because they posted it on Facebook.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.080
And I don't know that you climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.080
You didn't tell me last week when we were at brunch.

08:47.080 --> 08:52.080
And what do we present really when we are on Facebook?

08:52.080 --> 08:58.080
We present an idyllic life, perfect parenting, great relationships.

08:58.080 --> 09:05.080
We never give any bad news or copy about ourselves because that doesn't make for a lot of likes.

09:05.080 --> 09:12.080
Different high school group I was speaking to and they raised their hand and educated me on something I didn't know.

09:12.080 --> 09:18.080
They said, you know, we wait until five o'clock before we post our Instagram pictures

09:18.080 --> 09:23.080
because that's when we know all of our friends are out and we'll get the most traffic.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.080
I thought that was pretty interesting.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.080
And then they started talking a little bit more about how they get jealous.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.080
So if one person gets more likes on Instagram than the other, then they just take it down.

09:34.080 --> 09:42.080
So there's all this emotional turmoil and strife going on with our number of likes somehow equaling our self-esteem.

09:42.080 --> 09:49.080
We are all our own public relations firms, always trying to figure out how we can increase our numbers.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.080
Work sometimes demands that from us as well.

09:52.080 --> 09:57.080
Certainly we do that a lot in our personal life.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.080
And this is what we present on Facebook.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.080
I mean, here's who we really are in real life.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.080
And this is what we present on Facebook.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.080
Guilty, a little bit of it.

10:09.080 --> 10:13.080
We have the selfie now.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.080
And if you think about a selfie, it's rather a sad invention.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.080
It's us taking a picture of ourselves by ourselves.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.080
Maybe we can get two more people if somebody really has a long arm.

10:25.080 --> 10:29.080
The bathroom selfie, I find this hilarious.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.080
I see it all the time.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.080
I'm like, oh great, that's you in front of a mirror.

10:34.080 --> 10:44.080
Great, going to a party I probably was not invited to, that you're going to be selfieing your way through while I watch Home Alone on Facebook.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.080
We have the Oscar selfie.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.080
That was a lot of fun.

10:47.080 --> 10:51.080
That crashed the Twitter feed, I think most people now.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.080
And then we have the funeral selfie, not so fun.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.080
She looks very unpleased.

11:00.080 --> 11:07.080
And we have the driving selfie because I mentioned research shows that won't kill you at all.

11:07.080 --> 11:16.080
I think we would all live life better if we had hands to hold rather than keys to click.

11:16.080 --> 11:21.080
Thank you.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.080
I think we need to take that pause in our life.

11:24.080 --> 11:36.080
Make mud pies, build a fort, take the time to gaze at the clouds for rhinosporuses and unicorns screen free.

11:36.080 --> 11:41.080
And if change starts from within, we are that change.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
We can be that change.

11:43.080 --> 11:49.080
And teach our kids what it was like before we lived life in front of a screen.

11:49.080 --> 11:57.080
We can use social media to create positive face-to-face groups and organizations and meeting places like we have tonight.

11:57.080 --> 12:05.080
Not hashtag activism, but people activism.

12:05.080 --> 12:09.080
We need to look up and see who our neighbor is.

12:09.080 --> 12:15.080
We need to look up and put that phone away.

12:15.080 --> 12:25.080
Make a human connection, teach human interaction as if it were as important as the very breath we breathe.

12:25.080 --> 12:31.080
Look up at me, look up at each other, and look up at you.

12:31.080 --> 12:39.080
And I'm going to ask everyone in here to take a screen free challenge, unplug for one hour a day.

12:39.080 --> 12:42.080
And if you like this message, please share it.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.080
Thank you very much.
