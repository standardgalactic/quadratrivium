0	18320	Hi, thank you very much.
18320	23960	I'd like to start out by asking everyone to power down their devices during my talk.
23960	28080	And for those of you that don't know, the power button is either on the top or on the
29080	30080	side of your phone.
30080	35080	I'd also like to thank the guys from state.com for permission to use this video.
35080	41080	I want to post about how great this coffee is, but I can't think of a funny way to say it.
41080	43080	This post is like a page long.
43080	44080	How do I shorten this?
44080	46080	Just take out all the vowels.
46080	49080	No, seriously, seriously.
49080	51080	Hey guys, you on Twitter?
51080	52080	Follow me.
52080	55080	Sometimes I want to move to another country where I wouldn't have to deal with this stuff.
55080	56080	What?
56080	58080	I'm just tweeting.
58080	60080	Do you think I'm making fun of you?
60080	61080	Hashtag follow the day.
61080	63080	Hashtag, I quit.
63080	64080	Just kidding.
64080	65080	Hashtag multi-tasking.
65080	67080	Hashtag squirm work.
67080	68080	Hashtag road trip, dudes.
68080	69080	Not while you're driving, man.
69080	71080	Hashtag yo, Loi.
71080	73080	Has anybody even been on this?
73080	74080	Fasties.
74080	75080	Coffee friends.
75080	76080	Mini bagels.
76080	77080	Shoes.
77080	78080	On subscribe.
78080	79080	What's up, Facebook?
79080	80080	Follow my new shoes.
80080	81080	Unfollow.
81080	82080	Ah, look!
82080	83080	Coffee.
83080	84080	We're going viral.
84080	86080	Nobody cares.
86080	93080	I'm going to hide all of you.
93080	101080	Dude, I made the popular page.
101080	105080	So I want to talk about three things tonight.
105080	108080	How social media is disconnecting us.
108080	109080	What's happening now.
109080	112080	And how we can do better.
112080	114080	Gallup took a poll in 2001.
114080	119080	And every average American said that they had 10 really close friends.
119080	122080	The same poll this year said we had two.
122080	124080	So what happened?
124080	125080	Where did everybody go?
125080	127080	And I think we know where.
127080	130080	I think we've all seen this by now.
130080	134080	Maybe even been a little guilty of it ourselves.
134080	137080	I see families like this out to dinner all the time.
137080	138080	And it drives me nuts.
138080	144080	And I see couples on dates, clearly together, but on their cell phones.
144080	147080	It's one of the strangest things I've ever seen.
147080	151080	But to me, what does this say when we are together?
151080	156080	To me, it says that there's someone, anyone on the other end of the screen,
156080	160080	that's way more important than you, who's right in front of my face.
160080	165080	There's a study by a merry maker that says we touch our phones or check our phones
165080	168080	150 times a day.
168080	172080	And we upload 1.8 billion pictures to Facebook.
172080	179080	That's a little over a sixth of the population a day for pictures.
179080	182080	Remember when the internet was new?
182080	184080	Those of us that do?
184080	188080	That was really actually only about 25 years ago, if you can imagine.
188080	193080	I remember when we had pagers, time seemed a little simpler back then.
193080	198080	You'd get the beep, you may return the call, you may not return the call.
198080	202080	Or when we had answer machines, you could always say that you weren't home.
202080	207080	Now we have a list of all these excuses that may or may not work.
207080	212080	But it seems like the more we talk about how technology divides us,
212080	215080	the more we demand from it.
215080	222080	And I think that's a huge risk that we're running in our society today.
222080	226080	We have this shortened vocabulary now.
226080	228080	It's all about the texting.
228080	231080	Even my mom, she says, just text me.
231080	234080	And she's a little bit older, I won't say, because she'll see this later.
234080	247080	So, OMG, oh my goodness, LOL, laugh out loud, WTF, why the face?
247080	253080	So when we abbreviate our vocabulary, what we risk is losing the nuances, subtleties,
253080	260080	and intimate parts of our personalities that make up our very rich American vocabulary.
260080	266080	And with that shortening, we lose and run the risk of not being able to fully express ourselves
266080	269080	and communicate as we move forward.
269080	276080	And that losing our vocabulary equals a potential loss of being able to express ourselves.
276080	283080	How many times does anybody look in horror when their cell phone rings with a personal call?
283080	287080	A whole conversation starts happening in your head when it rings.
287080	291080	Tiffany, why is Tiffany calling?
291080	294080	What does Tiffany want?
294080	296080	Why is she calling me?
296080	301080	And then you have that last ringtone moment where you know you have to pick up that phone
301080	304080	or let it go to a voicemail you may or may not check.
304080	306080	Hey, Tiffany, what's up?
306080	313080	The whole time thinking she could have completely texted this whole message to me.
313080	321080	If I asked everybody in here if they could take their phone, set it down, and walk away for an hour, could you do it?
321080	325080	An immediate sense of panic comes over us.
325080	334080	We will turn the car around, even if we are halfway to our destination, just to go back and get our cell phone.
334080	341080	I had a blackberry, which I adored, and I kept it for a really long time.
341080	345080	But you guys remember when we had blackberries, don't you?
345080	347080	What did we call them back then?
347080	349080	That's right, crackberries.
349080	353080	So it's no surprise where we've landed ourselves now.
353080	358080	So I took my blackberry into the Apple Store when everybody else had their Apple phone
358080	365080	and the transition was more than I could bear experiencing phone shame.
365080	370080	And I went in, and of course it was completely jam-packed at the Apple Store, and this cute kid comes up to me,
370080	372080	and he's like, may I help you?
372080	374080	And I said, yes, you can.
374080	376080	I would like a phone that could do this.
376080	381080	So I took my blackberry and I threw it on the ground, but pop, pop, pop.
381080	383080	It goes all the way across the store.
383080	387080	Everybody just stops in the store, gasps.
387080	392080	And I walk over and I pick it up, and I said, see the screen's fully intact and it still works.
392080	401080	And he just looked not missing a beat, and he said, we don't have a phone that can do that.
401080	406080	A new study out by the Cohen's Children Medical Center in New Hyde Park,
406080	413080	their study says this year that texting while driving is now the number one cause of death for teens.
413080	418080	More than drinking and driving.
418080	423080	So what this means is there's a lot of drunks on the road.
423080	429080	I was speaking to some high school students, and of course, you know, they're always willing to make some sort of bargain,
429080	434080	and they raise their hand and they said, well, what if you're at a stop sign?
434080	436080	Or what if you're at a stoplight?
436080	442080	And I said my message was I don't think there's really anything that can't wait until we get to our destination.
442080	448080	And don't forget if you send that text at the stop sign, they're probably going to text you back while you're driving.
448080	450080	So maybe not the best idea.
450080	452080	And I'll give you an example.
452080	457080	If you're driving 55 miles an hour and you look down at your phone for five seconds,
457080	465080	you've just now driven the length of an entire football field completely blind.
465080	467080	And it's not just our kids.
467080	469080	It's us as well.
469080	477080	We are constantly at work, constantly connected, and constantly distracted.
477080	483080	Every one of us thinks of some sort of extreme vacation we need to go on where we may say to our bosses,
483080	486080	you know, I'm going to go on a very extreme vacation.
486080	490080	There's just absolutely no way I can return anything during the day.
490080	495080	But you're still expected to go back to the hotel and return your work emails.
495080	500080	So if we as adults are this distracted, our kids are seeing this.
500080	502080	We're always at work.
502080	504080	And where are they?
504080	507080	Always on their devices.
507080	512080	And how many times have you guys heard, what do you mean you don't know?
512080	514080	I posted it on Facebook.
514080	521080	So for some reason now, we're all supposed to know about each other's lives because they posted it on Facebook.
521080	524080	And I don't know that you climb Mount Kilimanjaro.
524080	527080	You didn't tell me last week when we were at brunch.
527080	532080	And what do we present really when we are on Facebook?
532080	538080	We present an idyllic life, perfect parenting, great relationships.
538080	545080	We never give any bad news or copy about ourselves because that doesn't make for a lot of likes.
545080	552080	Different high school group I was speaking to and they raised their hand and educated me on something I didn't know.
552080	558080	They said, you know, we wait until five o'clock before we post our Instagram pictures
558080	563080	because that's when we know all of our friends are out and we'll get the most traffic.
563080	565080	I thought that was pretty interesting.
565080	569080	And then they started talking a little bit more about how they get jealous.
569080	574080	So if one person gets more likes on Instagram than the other, then they just take it down.
574080	582080	So there's all this emotional turmoil and strife going on with our number of likes somehow equaling our self-esteem.
582080	589080	We are all our own public relations firms, always trying to figure out how we can increase our numbers.
589080	592080	Work sometimes demands that from us as well.
592080	597080	Certainly we do that a lot in our personal life.
597080	599080	And this is what we present on Facebook.
599080	602080	I mean, here's who we really are in real life.
602080	606080	And this is what we present on Facebook.
606080	609080	Guilty, a little bit of it.
609080	613080	We have the selfie now.
613080	617080	And if you think about a selfie, it's rather a sad invention.
617080	621080	It's us taking a picture of ourselves by ourselves.
621080	625080	Maybe we can get two more people if somebody really has a long arm.
625080	629080	The bathroom selfie, I find this hilarious.
629080	631080	I see it all the time.
631080	634080	I'm like, oh great, that's you in front of a mirror.
634080	644080	Great, going to a party I probably was not invited to, that you're going to be selfieing your way through while I watch Home Alone on Facebook.
644080	646080	We have the Oscar selfie.
646080	647080	That was a lot of fun.
647080	651080	That crashed the Twitter feed, I think most people now.
651080	656080	And then we have the funeral selfie, not so fun.
656080	660080	She looks very unpleased.
660080	667080	And we have the driving selfie because I mentioned research shows that won't kill you at all.
667080	676080	I think we would all live life better if we had hands to hold rather than keys to click.
676080	681080	Thank you.
681080	684080	I think we need to take that pause in our life.
684080	696080	Make mud pies, build a fort, take the time to gaze at the clouds for rhinosporuses and unicorns screen free.
696080	701080	And if change starts from within, we are that change.
701080	703080	We can be that change.
703080	709080	And teach our kids what it was like before we lived life in front of a screen.
709080	717080	We can use social media to create positive face-to-face groups and organizations and meeting places like we have tonight.
717080	725080	Not hashtag activism, but people activism.
725080	729080	We need to look up and see who our neighbor is.
729080	735080	We need to look up and put that phone away.
735080	745080	Make a human connection, teach human interaction as if it were as important as the very breath we breathe.
745080	751080	Look up at me, look up at each other, and look up at you.
751080	759080	And I'm going to ask everyone in here to take a screen free challenge, unplug for one hour a day.
759080	762080	And if you like this message, please share it.
762080	764080	Thank you very much.
