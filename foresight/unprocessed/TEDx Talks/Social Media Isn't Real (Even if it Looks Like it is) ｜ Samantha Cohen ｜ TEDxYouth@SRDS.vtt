00:00.000 --> 00:22.880
Social media is a drug, and I, like so many people today, am totally addicted.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.080
I'm addicted to scrolling.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.560
I'm addicted to making every account on every social media site look perfect.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.200
I'm addicted to liking, to commenting, to seeing photos of random celebrities, to seeing

00:33.200 --> 00:39.880
drama of random celebrities, and to refreshing the same page over and over again.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.760
And with every drug comes a high, a moment when one feels like they're on top of the

00:43.760 --> 00:48.720
world and nothing can stop them, until everything just comes crashing down again.

00:48.720 --> 00:54.520
For me, even if the picture I've posted looks nothing like me or isn't real at all, when

00:54.520 --> 00:57.160
the likes in the comments start pouring in, that's the high.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.880
I feel people must like me, my self-esteem goes up, and I feel this temporary happiness

01:01.880 --> 01:06.840
and this temporary joy, until a couple hours pass by, and the likes in the comments slow

01:06.840 --> 01:12.080
down, and me and my self-esteem just kind of go crashing down again.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.000
Social media can slash down your confidence, and in a fraction of a second make you feel

01:16.000 --> 01:19.240
like the loneliest person in the world.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.080
And this is a problem that persists now within our modern society.

01:23.080 --> 01:27.160
With a couple of taps on a smartphone, anyone can make any account on almost any social

01:27.160 --> 01:31.120
media site and make up a whole life that they don't even have.

01:31.120 --> 01:35.080
And as our technology gets better every single day, it becomes easier and easier for people

01:35.080 --> 01:39.240
to post a picture where they look 20 pounds skinnier, to photoshop themselves into a party

01:39.240 --> 01:44.960
they never went to, or in more extreme cases do things like this, where they put a toilet

01:44.960 --> 01:50.480
seat up against a window, so it looks like they're going on an exotic vacation, even

01:50.480 --> 01:52.840
if they're actually not.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.960
This phenomenon is particularly prominent in what is now known as influencers on social

01:56.960 --> 01:59.000
media.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.800
Influencers look like they live the amazing life.

02:01.800 --> 02:06.080
They're usually on any social media platform, but specifically Instagram and YouTube and

02:06.080 --> 02:09.120
have millions of followers or subscribers.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.400
As I said before, their life looks perfect and even companies use them to promote products

02:13.400 --> 02:15.480
for easy advertising.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.760
Looking at a social media influencer can make the average person feel pretty insecure at

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
times.

02:21.880 --> 02:28.840
An example of one of these influencers is James Charles, a 19 year old makeup artist

02:28.840 --> 02:32.840
with over 15 million followers a minute.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.440
He doesn't look bad in any single photo on his Instagram.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.720
His makeup is always flawless and he never shows you the time or the money it takes to

02:41.720 --> 02:47.240
put all that on, so it looks quick and easy and like he did it in a minute.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.440
Another one, Hailey Baldwin Bieber.

02:50.440 --> 02:55.760
She has over 18.3 million followers and she posts pictures of herself under the most beautiful

02:55.760 --> 02:57.640
beaches in the world.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.520
Spoiler alert, nobody wakes up and looks like that.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.400
It takes time, energy, money, and so many different resources.

03:05.400 --> 03:10.560
And I'm not a fancy influencer, but I'll admit I do it myself.

03:10.560 --> 03:15.080
I mean, I know this talk is probably going to be shared somewhere on the internet, so

03:15.080 --> 03:17.600
I dressed up better than I normally do.

03:17.640 --> 03:23.000
In real life, my hair is large and curly, I wear glasses and I prefer to wear big sweatshirts

03:23.000 --> 03:24.320
over anything else.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.200
But on every single photo on my Instagram, my hair has been straightened, I have my contacts

03:28.200 --> 03:31.960
in, my makeup's done, and I'm dressed up far better than I do regularly.

03:31.960 --> 03:37.360
Me, influencers, and so many other people now, only put on Instagram what we want other

03:37.360 --> 03:38.960
people to see.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.960
When you're scrolling through Instagram, you only see what the Instagrammer has specifically

03:41.960 --> 03:46.200
designed, specific moments in their time where they're looking happy and they're dressed

03:46.240 --> 03:49.920
up and nobody has to see any other part of their life.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.840
According to sociologist Julie Albright from University of Southern California, people's

03:54.840 --> 03:58.880
persona online may be much more fabulous, much more exciting than the everyday life that

03:58.880 --> 04:00.720
they're leading.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.160
And this isn't a problem just for teenagers anymore.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.440
I mean, my grandparents have Facebook.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.600
I was born in 2001 on this weird generation Z millennial cusp, and I'll find that I spend

04:12.600 --> 04:16.560
hours on Instagram and Snapchat and just end up feeling sorry for myself.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.360
I wonder why people who I haven't even spoken to in years look like they have their entire

04:20.360 --> 04:22.320
life together, and I don't.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.840
I wonder why it looks like everyone's having the best time ever.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.560
And with these photos quite literally in my face all the time, it's so easy to wonder

04:30.560 --> 04:36.400
why am I not that pretty, why am I not that skinny, or why am I not that popular or cool.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.040
I had a conversation with a teacher of mine as well, a millennial who says one of the

04:40.040 --> 04:41.840
worst parts about social media.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.920
It's going out to Facebook and seeing people she used to go to school with now raising

04:44.920 --> 04:46.400
their own families.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.200
This makes her wonder, is she raising her family right?

04:49.200 --> 04:53.160
And how can she make her son just as good or even better than every single other kid

04:53.160 --> 04:54.920
she sees on Facebook?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.360
And I've seen it in my little sister too, Generation Z.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.320
I've seen her swiping through Snapchat wondering how it looks like every other middle schooler

05:01.320 --> 05:05.680
in the world is the most secure person in the world.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.080
We all know that's probably not true.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.360
Although social media can make us feel so lonely.

05:12.360 --> 05:16.680
It's so easy to feel alone when it looks like every other person has it together and you

05:16.680 --> 05:18.480
feel like you don't.

05:18.480 --> 05:23.480
So it shouldn't take any big scientific discovery to promote the claim that social media has

05:23.480 --> 05:26.200
detrimental effects on our mental health.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.800
But scientists have done the study and it's proven true.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.960
Melissa G. Hunt from University of Pennsylvania stated that using less social media than you

05:33.960 --> 05:39.200
normally do would lead to significant decreases in both oppression and loneliness.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.560
And George Albrecht from University of Amsterdam stated passive social media use co-occurred

05:44.560 --> 05:48.840
with a loss of interest, concentration problems, fatigue and loneliness.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.000
So what do we do?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.360
We can't just avoid social media.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
It's everywhere.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.360
It's on our news.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.360
It's in our schools.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
It's in our homes.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
It's in our workplaces.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.480
It's impossible to just forget about it.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.560
But it has given us a huge advantage in some ways.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.840
We have the ability to communicate more than ever before.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.640
And that's amazing.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.160
I'm about to go to college and I've talked to people from all around the world that

06:12.160 --> 06:16.280
I'll be going to school with next year and I've talked with my roommate so many times.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.440
When my parents went to college, they had no idea who they'd be living with for the

06:19.440 --> 06:21.080
next year.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.800
And my TED Talks from the past few years have been put on YouTube and my message about mental

06:24.800 --> 06:29.240
health has spread to people who I will never know.

06:29.240 --> 06:34.320
So in the words of Stanley and his favorite comic book, Spider-Man, with great power comes

06:34.320 --> 06:36.080
great responsibility.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.080
Social media has given us an amazing advantage to communicate, to share ideas, to bring people

06:40.080 --> 06:42.240
from all around the world together.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.880
But it's also made it easier for people to fake their lives, fake a personality and for

06:45.880 --> 06:48.880
us to become more insecure.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.960
And going back to the Instagram influencers, it's hard sometimes to just remind ourselves

06:52.960 --> 06:57.600
that not everyone is going to look like the favorite celebrity.

06:57.960 --> 07:03.240
Jamila Jamil, an actress known for the NBC show The Good Place, has now started a campaign

07:03.240 --> 07:05.640
called I-Way.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.800
The purpose of her campaign is to call out and show celebrities and point out to regular

07:09.800 --> 07:13.880
people that celebrities and influencers have amazing resources to some of the best food,

07:13.880 --> 07:18.680
the best personal trainers, the best gyms, and the best magazine editors in the world.

07:18.680 --> 07:22.080
So no wonder they look better than the average person.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.560
Jamil has also called out celebrities who are now using their fans' weight insecurities

07:26.600 --> 07:30.920
to sell diet pills so everyone can look just as good as they do.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.520
Jamila has become the beginning of an amazing campaign to make us feel better in our bodies

07:34.520 --> 07:39.800
and not to compare ourselves with every single person we see on the internet.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.760
And sometimes when you're just at your worst, it's better just to delete the apps off your

07:43.760 --> 07:46.000
phone.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.520
Sometimes as I said, when I'm feeling my worst, I just delete the apps off my phone.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.480
I don't delete the accounts necessarily, but without the apps physically there, there's

07:53.480 --> 07:56.960
nothing for me to be just checking throughout the day.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.320
And usually I can go for weeks out of time until I feel comfortable enough that I can

08:00.320 --> 08:04.560
redownload it and it won't affect my mental health so much.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.760
So I know a week's hard, but I ask all of you, take one day, just delete the apps off

08:09.760 --> 08:14.920
your phone, whatever it is, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, MySpace, whatever

08:14.920 --> 08:21.240
it is, delete it for one day, and I promise that it'll be like a huge weight taking off

08:21.240 --> 08:22.240
your chest.

08:22.240 --> 08:27.400
You may find that you have more time to do things you like, like making music, dancing

08:27.400 --> 08:30.120
or volunteering with kids.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.920
So if there's one message that you take from this talk, it's I hope that you know you are

08:34.920 --> 08:39.600
not defined by the amount of likes and comments on your post on social media.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.880
Social media is not real, and no way can a single account on a social media website encapsulate

08:44.880 --> 08:48.760
the entire brilliant personality of a single human being.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.760
Thank you.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.760
Thank you.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.760

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
