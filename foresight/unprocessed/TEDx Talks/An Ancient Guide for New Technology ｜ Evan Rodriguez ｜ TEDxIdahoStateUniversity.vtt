00:00.000 --> 00:23.120
There's something oddly reassuring about how bad most of us are at predicting the future.

00:23.120 --> 00:29.200
25 years ago, I was an innocent kid exploring a relatively new internet through an old dial-up

00:29.200 --> 00:35.760
modem. For me, at least, all these connections were pure excitement and possibility. I was

00:35.760 --> 00:42.080
blissfully unaware of the vast changes and controversies they'd bring. Looking at my own

00:42.080 --> 00:47.520
ten-month-old today, I realized that about the only thing I can predict is that he'll consider

00:47.520 --> 00:53.280
dial-up modems, and probably me too, to be about as relevant as an ancient Greek chariot.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.960
But for just a moment here, I want to try to see the world through the eyes of someone else who

00:59.600 --> 01:06.400
unlike me, was deeply worried about the effects of new technology. This someone was a keen observer

01:06.400 --> 01:12.320
of how technology shapes the world around us. They saw people using it to gain personal and

01:12.320 --> 01:18.240
political power in ways that weren't always truthful. They noticed us being more obstinate

01:18.240 --> 01:23.600
than ever, just clean to our own opinions, not even considering the other side. And they were

01:23.600 --> 01:30.720
keenly aware that ideas are now being spread at an ever more blistering pace. Because of all this,

01:30.720 --> 01:35.520
the person I have in mind was deeply worried about the effects on our ability to have a real

01:35.520 --> 01:41.600
conversation with each other. Now you might be thinking, okay, okay, we've heard these concerns

01:41.600 --> 01:46.560
before. But what you might not know is that they've been around for a bit longer than you might

01:46.560 --> 01:52.880
expect. This person wasn't talking about Twitter or Facebook. They weren't a pioneering computer

01:52.880 --> 02:00.080
scientist or cognitive psychologist. It was the philosopher Plato. And what he was worried about

02:00.080 --> 02:09.200
over 2,500 years ago was this new technology of writing. Now, as a philosopher myself,

02:09.200 --> 02:13.440
I'm very grateful that Plato wrote down his concerns about writing. Otherwise, we wouldn't

02:13.440 --> 02:18.720
have access to them today. And I should say, well, Plato's solution is going to be about

02:18.720 --> 02:24.080
encouraging conversation. If you ever need to end the conversation, just try announcing I'm a

02:24.080 --> 02:31.040
philosopher. I found that works pretty well. But Plato really is fascinating, not just for the

02:31.040 --> 02:37.200
surprising relevance of what he has to say, but for the creative way that he says it. So today,

02:37.200 --> 02:42.400
I'd like to walk through three of Plato's stories with you that really highlight the challenges

02:42.480 --> 02:49.280
that new technology brings. Its tendency to trade in reasoning for convenience, its dependence on

02:49.280 --> 02:57.440
just a single viewpoint, and its emphasis on speed. Let's start with speed. This is a familiar aspect

02:57.440 --> 03:02.960
of our world today. Everything needs to be available in an instant and broadcast in real time.

03:04.240 --> 03:09.120
But Plato thought that speed has its drawbacks, especially when it comes to something like writing.

03:10.080 --> 03:15.520
Think of, say, just reading a written essay as opposed to having a conversation. When reading,

03:15.520 --> 03:20.640
it's easy just to skim through and think you're done. The back and forth of conversation tends

03:20.640 --> 03:27.200
to take a little more time, but it can really also lead to deeper engagement. Plato uses a really

03:27.200 --> 03:34.400
neat image to drive this point home. He likens the way that we approach writing to gardens of Adonis.

03:34.720 --> 03:40.800
These were part of a yearly ritual that the Greeks used to commemorate the famed lover of

03:40.800 --> 03:47.760
Aphrodite who had an all too short life. What they would do is they would plant seeds in these shallow

03:47.760 --> 03:54.560
pot shards and they'd force them to sprout in just a few days. The result was this beautiful bed of

03:54.560 --> 04:02.480
lush green leaves. But soon those plants would wither from their shallow roots, so the Greeks

04:03.440 --> 04:07.920
would just take them down to the coast and ritually cast them into the waves.

04:09.920 --> 04:14.480
Now Plato isn't saying that these little gardens are entirely useless. In a way,

04:14.480 --> 04:18.880
the whole point is that they're temporary, beautiful one moment and then gone the next.

04:19.680 --> 04:25.360
But make no mistake, they're not designed for nor will they provide long lasting sustenance.

04:27.120 --> 04:32.000
I have to say, I can't help but imagine how odd it must have been to watch people

04:32.080 --> 04:37.440
rushing these shallow little gardens just to toss them into the sea. But at the same time,

04:37.440 --> 04:42.880
I can't help but wonder if Plato could watch us today posting to social media, would he see it

04:42.880 --> 04:49.280
any differently? If he was worried about the speed of writing, what does that tell us about our

04:49.280 --> 04:57.520
on-demand culture today? Now his concerns about speed have to do partly with the second point,

04:57.520 --> 05:03.600
about the difficulty of truly engaging with other perspectives. Plato talks about how

05:04.240 --> 05:09.360
speech, once written down, simply wanders around saying the same things over and over again.

05:10.080 --> 05:15.280
If you already agree, you aren't likely to learn anything new. If you don't, it's easiest just to

05:15.280 --> 05:24.080
ignore it. This brings us to a second story that he uses about the Egyptian gods meeting to discuss

05:24.080 --> 05:30.800
the merits of writing. The inventor of writing is of course very excited. He presents his wares

05:30.800 --> 05:36.560
to the king of the gods and tells him, I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.360
But the god king isn't convinced. He says that writing will actually instill forgetfulness

05:44.000 --> 05:47.840
and give people the false sense of thinking that they know when they actually don't.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.640
Just think for example of how few phone numbers we can recite today

05:52.640 --> 05:59.600
now that they're all stored in our smartphones. Now it's easy to think here, okay, got it. Obviously

05:59.600 --> 06:05.120
inventor of writing thinks it's good, but the wise god king shows that it's bad. But more is

06:05.120 --> 06:10.880
going on here than meets the eye. According to Plato, the king had good things to say about writing

06:10.880 --> 06:17.440
too. Plato just doesn't tell us what they were. And he's presenting us with criticism after criticism

06:17.440 --> 06:23.040
of writing in the form of a written dialogue. Surely he doesn't think writing is all bad.

06:26.160 --> 06:34.480
Now this brings us to one more point that Plato actually found this really creative way

06:34.480 --> 06:42.960
to create writings while still preserving the benefits of conversation. We call them dialogues

06:42.960 --> 06:48.400
because they depict a thorough discussion that genuinely takes multiple perspectives seriously.

06:49.440 --> 06:54.800
Instead of simply announcing these benefits to us, Plato shows us through the way that he crafts

06:54.800 --> 07:01.120
these written dialogues. If he could do it for writing, in writing, despite all of his concerns

07:01.120 --> 07:07.760
about writing, how might that translate to our context today? How can we preserve the benefits

07:07.760 --> 07:15.120
of dialogue while still engaging with modern technology? Okay, so Plato has one more story

07:15.120 --> 07:23.120
for us. This one has to do about the importance of reason. Plato tells us that the most valuable

07:23.120 --> 07:28.000
thing you could get your hands on in ancient times was one of these mythical statues of

07:28.000 --> 07:34.800
Daedalus. They were so skillfully made, so lifelike in their design, that they actually moved.

07:35.040 --> 07:39.760
But even if you were able to get your hands on one and say to get on home, the minute you weren't

07:39.760 --> 07:45.840
looking, that statue might just move on over to some other person's yard. Turns out they're not

07:45.840 --> 07:53.040
going to retain their value unless you have some way of tying them down. Plato stresses that we

07:53.040 --> 08:00.240
need to tie down our ideas too with the underlying reason that motivates them. Otherwise, they too

08:00.320 --> 08:05.440
will get us get away from us, just like one of those elusive statues.

08:08.400 --> 08:14.560
Now, part of Plato's concern here is that sometimes we have this false impression,

08:15.360 --> 08:20.080
say just liking a quote will get us out of the hard work of truly understanding it.

08:21.040 --> 08:27.120
There's this seductive idea that even philosophy culminates with some pity statement, something

08:27.120 --> 08:33.440
just so true, it exudes wisdom. But even the people we like to quote most, they have a whole body

08:33.440 --> 08:42.400
of work to back up what they're saying. So similarly, modern shortcuts like hashtags,

08:42.400 --> 08:46.960
they're great at collecting information, giving a quick read on where someone stands,

08:47.600 --> 08:53.520
but they're not so great at communicating the underlying motivation. We have to ask ourselves

08:53.520 --> 08:59.760
for any given claim, what's going to tie down that idea? Why should we support it? What's the

08:59.760 --> 09:07.520
evidence? Now, I want to take just one more moment here to appreciate how uncanny it is

09:07.520 --> 09:13.280
that these concerns from well over 2,000 years ago can still speak to us today.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.080
That's not to say that all of our problems have been solved. For all their inventions,

09:20.160 --> 09:23.280
the Greeks never even figured out how to make clothing with pockets.

09:25.520 --> 09:31.680
But it is to say we need to think hard about how technology impacts our most deeply held values.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.800
We need to continue that dialogue that Plato started for us so many years ago.

09:38.480 --> 09:45.360
When we do, we should remember that technology is a tool for crafting our own intricate statues

09:45.360 --> 09:49.200
and that they retain their value when grounded in what we really care about.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.640
We need to work on including different perspectives just like that Egyptian god king.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.320
Rather than meaning that we've got something wrong, exploring both sides is more often a sign

10:00.320 --> 10:06.480
that we're really doing something right. And not everything can serve its purpose in an instant,

10:06.480 --> 10:12.000
like those beautiful gardens of Adonis, but changes that come about more slowly

10:12.880 --> 10:19.600
often bear the greatest fruit. New technologies are inevitable, so it would be pointless to

10:19.600 --> 10:26.640
insist on richly casting them into the sea. But Plato's challenge is for us to keep finding new

10:26.640 --> 10:34.000
ways to enable and encourage this old technology of conversation, ways that retain those core values

10:34.560 --> 10:47.120
of reason, of patience, and of open-mindedness. Thank you.
