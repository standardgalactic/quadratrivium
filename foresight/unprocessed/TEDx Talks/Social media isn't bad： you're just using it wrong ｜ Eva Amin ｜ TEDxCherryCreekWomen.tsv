0	26100	The other day, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I come across this post that says social
26100	34660	media is bad. So I think to myself, I'm looking at a post about how posts are bad. But that's
34660	39880	not even the best part. The best part is I click on it and the caption says save this
39880	46700	for later as a reminder. So basically, they want me to get off social media, but to get
46700	56020	back on so I can reread why I shouldn't have been on in the first place. This got me thinking.
56020	61500	And I realize that it's so often taught that social media is this horrible thing. In fact,
61500	65300	at the beginning of each school year, most high school students are sat in a safety
65300	70860	assembly. Part of the safety assembly talks about safety on social media. They tell you
70860	76220	how you're going to get catfished or kidnapped, but they stop there. They don't tell you
76220	80460	how you can use it in a safe and beneficial way, and unfortunately, those are very real
80460	85780	things and do happen way more than it should. But the way to stop that is to teach teens
85780	90820	how to use it in a beneficial way. You know, I think a lot of people don't realize the
90820	96860	true impact that social media has on us. In fact, I didn't realize the true impact until
96860	103620	one day my English teacher, she said, class, what is the purpose of children's books?
103620	106980	So I thought to myself, okay, well, there's multiple different reasons for children's
106980	112620	books. But one of the biggest ones is to teach children lessons without them realizing that
112620	117700	they're learning. Looking back, I learned not to take food from strangers because snow
117700	124300	white ate a poisonous apple. See, back then it was children's books. But it's no longer
124300	127940	just children's books. It's all the content we're choosing to surround ourselves with.
127940	134420	TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all of it. I'm currently reading this book. It's called
134420	140780	The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down. And the author of this book, they say,
140780	147780	the world is neither good or bad. It's just there. And the way we perceive the world is
147780	154660	based on our individual experiences. So let's think about that from a social media standpoint.
154660	160100	There are seven billion people in this world. And in our day to day lives, we don't even
160100	165660	interact with 1%. In fact, it's far less than 1%. So the way we learn about life outside
165660	169940	of just our little bubble is through things like traveling. But unfortunately, we can't
170140	176540	always be traveling. So another primary way we do this is through social media. Therefore,
176540	180980	if your social media is filled with drama, toxicity, and things that make you feel bad
180980	187380	about yourself, naturally, you're going to view the world as more of a negative place.
187380	191060	Whereas if your social media is filled with positivity and things that align with your
191060	196380	goals, you're going to view the world as more of a positive place. See, the problem isn't
196420	203020	social media. The problem is how you're choosing to use it. I hear a lot of stories about people
203020	208540	having these bad experiences on social media. And I've had social media for a while now.
208540	214300	And honestly, the only scary thing on my Instagram is when I look at my archived posts and see
214300	220380	what I used to post in middle school. But other than that, it's been a pretty positive
220420	227420	experience. So what's my secret? How do I keep my social media this positive, uplifting place?
228420	235420	Well, there's four groups of people you should be following. The first, friends, family, and
235420	242820	positive acquaintances. Now, I truly mean positive because so often I'll hear someone say, I don't
242820	246140	like this person. They're so mean to me. But then you'll go on their Instagram and guess who
246180	252580	they're following. That person who's so mean to them. Why surround yourself with that toxic energy
252580	262300	if you have the choice to simply not? The second group, people who align with your goals. Now, for
262300	267380	me, my future goal is to create my own business one day. So the types of people I follow are people
267380	271980	who have started their own businesses, people who give financial advice or investing advice, or
271980	279300	just business in general. Because the easiest way to achieve your goal is to ask someone or watch
279300	286380	someone who's already done it. The third group, people who inspire you. Now, this is different
286380	292460	from people who align with your goals. I was a gymnast off and on for about 12 years. I wanted to go
292460	296940	to the Olympics. I truly thought I was going to go to the Olympics. In fact, I used to write Dear
296940	301300	Future Me's to myself and I was reading them a few weeks ago and all of them started with Dear
301340	308820	Future Me. Are you in the Olympics yet? Unfortunately not. But my point is, at the time, going to the
308820	313700	Olympics was my goal. So the types of people I would follow were people like Simone Biles, Ali
313700	319620	Razeman, Gabby Douglas. However, going to the Olympics is no longer my goal. Yet I never unfollowed
319620	327740	those people because they still inspire me. The fourth group, entertainers. Now, of course,
327740	332500	social media is an entertainment platform and I'm not telling you not to use it as one. I'm just
332500	337460	telling you to be mindful of the types of entertainment you're consuming. A great example of
337460	342820	positive entertainment are your favorite artists. People like Shawn Mendes, Selena Gomez, Taylor
342820	349020	Swift, whoever it may be, as long as what they're posting makes you feel good about yourself. See,
349020	354340	when you start to categorize your following into these four groups, not only are you going to be
354380	360780	happier, but opportunities are also going to start to come to you. Back in May, I came across this
360780	366900	ad on Instagram. It was for this program called BetaCamp. BetaCamp advertised themselves to be
366900	371380	the six-week program where they challenged teens to create a revenue-generating startup with the
371380	376900	help of business mentors. Now, this sounded perfect for me. But of course, at first, I was skeptical
376900	381300	as you should be with ads you see on social media because a lot of the time they're going to be
381300	386020	fake. But I was safe about it. I looked at their Instagram, I looked at their website, and turns
386020	392140	out it was real. And I successfully created a revenue-generating startup in just six weeks. Now,
392140	401300	was it good? Absolutely not. Did I make money? Yes, so I'd call that a win. But through that program,
401300	406700	I was then offered a fellowship to continue this journey throughout the school year. Through that
406740	411380	fellowship, I was able to take two additional classes, one about creating a platform, and one
411380	419180	about investing. So my point is, just because my social media reflects my goals, I was given
419180	426060	opportunities that align with those goals. Now, how does this work? Well, TikTok, Facebook,
426060	431580	Instagram, whatever it may be, all these social medias love making money. How do they do this? They
431580	436260	put things on your feed based on what you've interacted with in the past or based on the people
436300	443860	you follow. So follow positive people, follow people who align with your goals. Now, before you all
443860	449820	leave today, I have two asks. My first ask is to start being mindful of the types of content you're
449820	456780	consuming. Start welcoming the positivity and blocking out the negativity. And my second ask,
456780	462740	stop participating and spreading this idea that social media is this horrible thing. Instead,
463220	469220	educate on the dangers while encouraging people to use it in a positive way. Now, I've said a lot
469220	475460	today. So to sum up everything I've said, I leave you all with one of my favorite quotes. Goes a
475460	484100	little like this. Nothing of me is original. I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known. Now,
484100	490620	that's a beautiful quote, but I'd like to add on to it. I'd like to say, nothing of me is original.
491340	497620	I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known and the content I've surrounded myself with. Thank
497620	497940	you.
