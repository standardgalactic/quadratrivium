1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
In 1942, Albert Einstein was teaching at Oxford University and one day he just gave an exam

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,240
of physics to his senior class of physics students and he was walking on the campus with his

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,240
assistant and all of a sudden the assistant looked at Albert Einstein and said, Dr. Einstein,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,200
this exam which you just gave to the senior class of physics students, isn't that exactly the

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,200
same exam you gave to exactly the same class one year ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,680
said Albert Einstein, it's exactly the same. But Dr. Einstein, how could you possibly do

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:57,400
that? The assistant said, well, said Einstein, the answers have changed. The answers have

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,880
changed. In other words, what is true for 1942 is even more true for today. We live in a world

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,240
where the questions might be the same, but the answers have changed. In other words,

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,000
what has got you here will no longer get you there. And if you want to have results that

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,920
you've never had before, well, you need to start doing things you've never done before.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, the key question for today is, of course, is there a method to the madness? Is there a way

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,560
that each of us can do impossible things to truly create dramatic results? And good news is that

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,680
the answer to that question is yes, because what I'm going to explain today is when it comes to

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,760
high performance, why the majority is always wrong and how you can use that to get everything

16
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:52,320
you can out of everything you've got. But let me first introduce you to something interesting,

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,000
an interesting observation. When people, teams and organizations, whenever they hit a wall,

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,720
they tend to do one of two things. They either do more of the same things or they do less of the

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,640
same things. But what you very seldom see is that they start to do different things instead. And

20
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,280
it's interesting if you look at the data, approximately 3% of people are inclined to even

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,440
do different things. And the remaining 97% continues to smash into the wall, like some kind of crazy

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:32,160
energy bunny on steroids. And why is that? Why is that? And to understand what is going on here,

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,120
we need to ask ourselves another question. And the question we need to ask ourselves is what is

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,520
the purpose of thinking? What is the purpose of thinking? Now, if you ask that question to a

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,680
brain scientist, the brain scientist will say, well, the purpose of thinking is to stop thinking.

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,640
The purpose of thinking is to stop thinking. Now, what does she mean by that? Well, here's the thing.

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Thinking is a high energy activity. It takes a lot of energy to think. So whenever we think,

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:08,040
we try to think as short as possible. And then we return to automatic pilot. Over 95% of our

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,680
life, we run on automatic pilot. For example, if you ever driven a car and then you realize, whoa,

30
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,760
what did I do in the past half an hour? That's your brain on automatic pilot. Another example,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,400
many of you right now are listening to me on automatic pilot. And I know who you are.

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
Now, here's the thing. If your brain is an automatic pilot, this leads to what a scientist

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,120
called mental myopia, also known as tunnel vision. And if you have tunnel vision, that's a bit of a

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,480
problem because it confuses people about our own performance. And this is the reason that many

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,040
people go through life acting like a mediocre race car driver who sits in his car, looks in his

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,320
rearview mirror, sees his competition and is so far behind that they think they are first.

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,880
In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we tend to think inside the box. And the box is a very

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,800
good metaphor here. So let me draw a box. And if you take a close look at the box,

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,960
you see that the boundaries of this box are very well defined. So we think inside defined

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,200
boundaries. I'll give you an example. One boundary is a legal boundary. And we think within the

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,560
legal framework. I'll give you an example where very few of you would think of stealing the wallet

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,400
of the person next to you in order to fund your next cool startup. At least that's what I hope.

43
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
So we think in legal boundaries, but there are other boundaries as well. We think in technological

44
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,680
boundaries, we think in physical boundaries, but we also think in moral boundaries. And this is why

45
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,840
we think inside the box. At least that's what we think. Because the reality is that the box in

46
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:20,080
which we think looks more like this. Now, for those of you in the back who cannot see it,

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,960
the reason is this is a very small box. And let me illustrate how small this box can be. For

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,440
example, if I would say tonight, let's have something to eat, have dinner tonight, what would

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,960
be options to do that? And probably you can come up with, hey, let's buy some pizza, go to restaurant,

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,680
cook at home, all kinds of cool ideas. But I believe that very few of you would raise their

51
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,200
hand and say, hey, let's go to the highway close by, see if we can pick up some dead animals on

52
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:00,240
the side of the road and prepare ourselves a crispy dinner. That's a disturbing thought.

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
But here's the funny thing, for many people in the world, this would be a perfectly normal

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,040
response. Nothing wrong with that. So what it shows is that the box in which we think

55
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,280
is actually very, very small. And if you take a look, if you take a closer look at your industry

56
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,560
or professional field, you also think inside a very small box. And the boundaries of this box,

57
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,920
they are called industry standards or industry norms. For example, if you are in the restaurant

58
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,600
business, then the industry standard is that people come to your establishment, they eat,

59
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,120
and then they pay. That's the standard. That's how everyone is doing it. Another example,

60
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,160
if you're in the banking business, this norm is that people give you money, you say, thank you

61
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:56,720
very much, and you give the money to someone else. I mean, that's banking. So those are standards,

62
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,320
those are norms in the industry or professional field. But this is what you need to know,

63
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,520
the word norm is an abbreviation for normal. In other words, if you do what everyone else is

64
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,000
doing, you get results that everyone else is getting, and those are normal results.

65
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,400
And the thing is, what we are after today are extraordinary results. So the key question

66
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,360
is, of course, how can you kick yourself out of the box, out of this very small box of your

67
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,080
industry and professional field, and move to the happy place where cool innovation happens?

68
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Now, how can you do that? Now, let me introduce you to the curious case of the London taxi drivers.

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
If you want to become a taxi driver in London, you need to know the entire city by heart.

70
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
And this is called the knowledge. And you can imagine it takes years to get the knowledge

71
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,480
in your head. And that's a bit of a problem if you want to rapidly expand your taxi business.

72
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
So they ask themselves a question. How can we rapidly expand our taxi business,

73
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,240
while at the same time employing taxi drivers who do not know anything about the city of London?

74
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,760
And then they came up with a very ingenious solution. What they said, well, actually,

75
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,600
then we make two kinds of taxis. One is a normal taxi. And the other taxi has a big sign on it,

76
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,080
which says the driver of this vehicle does not know anything

77
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,200
about the city of London, but loves to get directions from you.

78
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,760
And that's a brilliant solution because this attracted those people who lived in London,

79
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,520
knew the city very well, and finally, finally, finally, could pay boss in a taxi.

80
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Yeah, brilliant. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this sounds like a very cute story,

81
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,400
but there's much more than meets the eye. Because what we have found is that breakthrough

82
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,320
innovation, extraordinary results happen when people decide to finally break the standards

83
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,040
or the norms in their industry or professional field. And you see this over and over again.

84
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,240
For example, if you would have a furniture business and one day you would decide to no

85
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,520
longer assemble furniture for your customers, probably you would end up with a company called

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,200
IKEA. Another example, if you own a computer business and one day you would decide to no

87
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,160
longer sell your computer using a physical store, probably you would end up with a company called

88
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Dell Computers. Yeah. So ladies and gentlemen, what it tells us there is a method to the madness.

89
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,680
And by understanding that the majority is always wrong when it comes to high performance,

90
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,920
finally you have the opportunity to quit fixing things and move to massive innovation instead.

91
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:05,520
Ladies and gentlemen, the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, once said that the object of life

92
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,760
is not to side with the majority. But the object of life is to escape finding oneself

93
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,720
joining the ranks of the clinically insane. If you do what everyone else is doing,

94
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,720
you're not distinguishing yourself and you're probably stuck. And this is why when it comes

95
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,400
to high performance, the majority is always wrong. This is what we know. We know that three percent

96
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:42,000
of people are able to achieve extraordinary results. And each of you can become part of those three

97
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,680
percent by deciding as of today to break your industry standards and to break your industry norms.

98
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,920
The alternative, of course, is that you become part of the ninety seven percent who in the end

99
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:07,920
works for those three percent. And as of today, that choice is completely yours. Thank you very much.
