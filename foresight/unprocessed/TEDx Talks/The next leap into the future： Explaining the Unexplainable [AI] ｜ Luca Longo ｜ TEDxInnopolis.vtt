WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.840
Artificial intelligence, how many times have we heard this?

00:12.840 --> 00:17.520
We wake up in the morning, we drink our coffee, we read newspaper, and there is something

00:17.520 --> 00:19.240
about it.

00:19.240 --> 00:25.080
We watch the television and we hear something talking about the latest technological progress.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.960
We drive in the car, we listen to the radio and there is someone talking about artificial

00:29.960 --> 00:31.520
intelligence.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.120
How many times have we heard their robot will take over?

00:35.120 --> 00:37.240
How can we trust a robot?

00:37.240 --> 00:41.640
A robot will take our job.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.200
You think I'm going to do another class on artificial intelligence today.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.600
Forget about it.

00:47.600 --> 00:54.240
Today we're going to talk about self-serve coffee machine.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.160
How many of you have taken one of this coffee?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
Everybody.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.520
Well, me too.

01:02.520 --> 01:10.240
How many of you can build a self-serve coffee machine from scratch?

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Nobody.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.960
Me neither.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.480
But we consume the coffee.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.480
We trust that machine.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.920
How we trust this machine?

01:21.920 --> 01:27.160
For sure we are not going to open the machine or read the electrical scheme of the machine.

01:27.160 --> 01:31.200
We are not going to read the software code of the machine.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.440
We trust the machine because of the coffee we take, we consume.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.840
We drink our coffee and we like it.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.720
We trust the machine.

01:41.720 --> 01:47.000
You might wonder why I'm here in Annapolis listening to Luca talking about self-serve

01:47.000 --> 01:50.240
coffee machine.

01:50.240 --> 01:57.160
Because artificial intelligence today is exactly like this self-serve machine.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.520
We use all the time.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.800
We trust what it does for us.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.520
But we use all the time.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.840
We go in the airport.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.320
We put our passport on the screen reader.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.640
The gate opens.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.880
We go through.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
We play Rizzico.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.320
We play Monopoly with our friends while we have dinner.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.400
Alexa, play Bohemia Rhapsody of Queen.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.680
And it's our play.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.320
We have a job interview.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.520
We don't know where to go.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.760
We put Google Maps.

02:33.760 --> 02:37.520
Google Maps tell take this street, left, right.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.640
We arrive at destination.

02:39.640 --> 02:43.040
We use every day artificial intelligence.

02:43.040 --> 02:49.640
We don't know how it works, but we trust what it does for us.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.360
But it's not always good as it seems.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.400
A few years ago, I had a friend.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.840
He wanted to buy a nice car.

02:59.840 --> 03:03.640
He was saving every month some money.

03:03.640 --> 03:10.320
But he realized it would have taken many years to save the money to buy the car.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
He was a nerd.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.600
He was an engineer.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.040
He was always the first of the class.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.240
He was a high-skilled individual.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.200
So he started building a software.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.280
He started building a predictive model.

03:23.280 --> 03:29.720
And he started investing in his own favorite cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.120
So he built this model.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.120
He started using this model.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.920
This model was telling him, A, tomorrow open a position, Bitcoin is going up.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.880
Or close this position, Bitcoin is going down.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.560
For a few months, he started making money.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.120
He trust his own model.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.880
Everything was working perfectly.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.200
But all of a sudden, on a rainy day, things start changing.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.440
And he started losing money.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.240
Bitcoin was dropping.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.040
And he was not able to understand why.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.440
He built something.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.560
He was a very skilled engineer.

04:04.560 --> 04:15.160
And he was not even able to understand his own artificial intelligence.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.400
Imagine you are the owner of a bookstore.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.560
And you have thousands of books on display.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.880
You are the owner.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.960
And you want to maximize revenue.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.560
So you hired a consultant.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.080
This consultant is an expert in machine learning, in computer vision specifically.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.640
And he installed a lot of cameras on your shop.

04:37.640 --> 04:43.960
Every camera pointing to a specific area of the bookstore.

04:43.960 --> 04:52.520
And basically, he created a model that employs computer vision and performs facial recognition

04:52.520 --> 04:54.200
of expression.

04:54.200 --> 05:02.240
So you recognize if a customer is happy, is engaged, is sad, is disengaged.

05:02.240 --> 05:07.880
So the model can say, hey, in this area of the shop, all the people are engaged.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.640
In this area of the shop, all the people are disengaged.

05:10.640 --> 05:17.400
So the owner can have a suggestion on where to put books.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.920
But for a few months, again, he started making money.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.040
He started selling books.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.920
Everything was going okay.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.600
But all of a sudden, the revenue started dropping.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.520
He called the consultant, the consultant answered, hey, I have some problem here.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.160
I keep taking the decision according to the model.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.400
But my revenue is going down.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.640
And the consultant says, hey, listen, I don't know.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.400
This is the model that is telling me what to do.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Everything is automatic.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.960
I don't know.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
So imagine the frustration of the owner.

05:52.960 --> 05:58.400
He's so frustrated that he says, I don't want to play with artificial intelligence anymore.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.720
I fire you.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.720
A few years ago, I had a friend.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.640
One night, he started shaking.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.120
And he lost control of half of his body.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.960
He thought he had an ictus.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.080
He was sleeping with the wife.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.080
And he started losing vision from one eyes.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.320
He couldn't see any more from one eyes.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.720
He was very reactive.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.560
And he called the wife and said, please bring me to the hospital.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.880
Something is going on.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.200
So they go straight to the hospital.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.160
The doctor understood something was wrong.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.560
And he performed a scan of the brain.

06:39.560 --> 06:48.160
And there was something as big as a grain, mice grain, that he was in his brain.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.400
And the doctor said, hey, I'm sorry, but you have a tumor.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
You have a malignant tumor.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.160
You have just a few months of life.

06:57.160 --> 07:02.200
What you can imagine, my friend, he was destroyed psychologically.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
He didn't know what to do.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.000
He didn't know how to react.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.480
He was destroyed.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.200
But the doctor started giving him cortisone.

07:11.200 --> 07:17.200
And he was performing overtime these brain scans to see if something is happening.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.600
And strangely, every day, something good was happening.

07:21.600 --> 07:28.920
He started seeing again from the left eyes, he started getting control of his half part

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
of the body.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.480
Well, he was getting happy.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.120
But the doctor didn't know what's going on.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.160
He was trusting the machine who took those pictures.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.440
He was interpreting, there is a tumor.

07:42.440 --> 07:46.160
And he still didn't know what to do, what to say.

07:46.160 --> 07:55.080
So the doctor couldn't trust the machine, couldn't trust artificial intelligence anymore.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.640
So what is the moral of this?

07:57.640 --> 08:01.000
Should we really trust artificial intelligence?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.520
We cannot stop technological progress.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.040
It doesn't make sense.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.680
We cannot stop to build intelligence machines.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.520
It doesn't make sense.

08:11.520 --> 08:20.280
But we can challenge the prediction, the assessment, the inference of these black box machines.

08:20.280 --> 08:24.480
And above all, we have the right to understand how they work.

08:24.480 --> 08:33.520
And we have the right to get explanation on the recommendation of the machine.

08:33.520 --> 08:40.040
So what is the solution of these black box artificial intelligence?

08:40.040 --> 08:46.640
Nowadays, in artificial intelligence, there is a sub-discipline that is called explainable

08:46.640 --> 08:48.560
artificial intelligence.

08:48.560 --> 08:54.640
And this is getting at the forefront of artificial intelligence in our society, everywhere in

08:54.640 --> 08:56.640
the world.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.600
So remember my friends who wanted to get some money for his car.

09:01.600 --> 09:07.960
Now let's assume that this black box model is saying, A, there's going to be an increment

09:07.960 --> 09:10.400
in price of 5%.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
But it doesn't know.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
Why?

09:13.400 --> 09:19.520
Imagine now that there is artificial intelligence that tells, A, there is a 5% increase, add

09:19.520 --> 09:21.080
something more.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.280
For example, he had a statement like this.

09:24.280 --> 09:30.800
The number of buying orders have significantly increased at current prices.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.280
Therefore, investors are willing to enter the market now.

09:36.280 --> 09:41.200
Or in the last months, Bitcoin has dropped by 20%.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.600
Every time it happens, it's strongly rebounded.

09:44.600 --> 09:49.440
Therefore, we have high chances of a positive price increase.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.160
Again, with current trading volumes, there are high chances of a big price move.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.760
As you can see now, we have a prediction from the machine, which is plus 5%.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.680
But we have a set of explanation.

10:04.680 --> 10:10.720
This is in artificial intelligence are called propositional rules.

10:10.720 --> 10:17.440
And you can understand that with this type of information, we can actually inform our

10:17.440 --> 10:18.440
decision-making.

10:18.440 --> 10:28.960
Now, let's go back to the bookstore.

10:28.960 --> 10:35.440
You were losing money, but the model was saying, A, all the people in the shop are happy.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.440
But still, you are making money.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.440
You are losing money.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
Sorry.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.240
Imagine you have something like this now.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.480
You have a dashboard of visual analytics.

10:47.480 --> 10:53.000
So now you know the number of people that enter your shop during the day.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.280
So we have in the morning, lunchtime, evening.

10:57.280 --> 11:00.440
As you can see, most of the day, people were happy.

11:00.440 --> 11:05.320
But during lunchtime, there were so many people in your bookstore that even if you put the

11:05.320 --> 11:10.720
books in the right order and organize the book properly, there are so many people that

11:10.720 --> 11:14.840
their experience is negative.

11:14.840 --> 11:21.320
And now, with this visual analytics, we have a better understanding of why and what's going

11:21.320 --> 11:22.600
on.

11:22.600 --> 11:32.240
And again, with this type of information, we can better inform our decision-making.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.640
Now let's go back to my friend.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.120
He was diagnosed a tumor.

11:39.120 --> 11:44.240
I don't know if I would have survived just with this information.

11:44.240 --> 11:52.520
Now imagine the doctor beside this prediction, which is evidently wrongly, has some more

11:52.520 --> 11:55.760
information.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.400
We have two premises.

11:57.400 --> 12:06.240
White pixel in the picture, in tissue, brain tissue, suggests abnormal cells that are present.

12:06.240 --> 12:11.360
And when we have abnormal cells, and we know that they are actually growing after multiple

12:11.360 --> 12:20.160
scan over time, therefore, we have high evidence of a tumor grade 3-4, which is a malignant

12:20.160 --> 12:22.960
tumor.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.920
This is another argument.

12:26.920 --> 12:32.760
The patient reported the recurrent adiabics in the morning, followed by nausea.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.440
And his vision was diminishing over time.

12:35.440 --> 12:44.040
Therefore, there is further evidence that abnormal cells are actually tumor.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.160
But then, we have something different now.

12:46.160 --> 12:51.680
We have a third argument.

12:51.680 --> 12:59.520
Neurological specialists demonstrate a very rare condition called multiple cavernomas.

12:59.520 --> 13:07.400
Multiple cavernomas causes cluster of abnormal blood vessels to form in the brain, causing

13:07.400 --> 13:09.520
headache and seizure.

13:09.520 --> 13:18.360
Therefore, our previous argument, one and two, are no longer applicable.

13:18.360 --> 13:25.160
So now you can imagine that if the doctor would have such information, he would think

13:25.160 --> 13:28.680
twice to say you have a tumor.

13:28.680 --> 13:33.880
In artificial intelligence, this is called the feasible argumentation.

13:33.880 --> 13:40.720
We can express information as arguments, premises, and conclusion, and all of you understand

13:40.720 --> 13:42.040
what's going on.

13:42.040 --> 13:51.640
But also, we can add other arguments, and with this, we can retract the previous conclusion.

13:51.640 --> 14:00.880
As you can see, with this type of information, we can actually inform our decision-making.

14:00.880 --> 14:10.240
So we need to focus on building an artificial intelligence system, not only focus on what,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.360
but also focus on why.

14:12.360 --> 14:17.640
We should build an intelligent machine, focus on what, and on why.

14:17.640 --> 14:25.040
This machine that can actually empower human, that can actually empower our decision-making,

14:25.040 --> 14:27.840
can inform our decision-making.

14:27.840 --> 14:35.240
And we should have the right to understand what's going on and interpret this machine

14:35.240 --> 14:39.000
and interpret their inference.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.800
Alan Turing, who's already 50 years ago, 60 years ago, is considered the father of artificial

14:44.800 --> 14:48.880
intelligence, when everything started.

14:48.880 --> 14:55.520
And yet, the very simple question, can machine think?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.960
Probably some of you know how things have evolved.

14:58.960 --> 15:04.720
And artificial intelligence now is spanning across sector in our life, in our society.

15:04.720 --> 15:13.400
But we have built a very powerful, very accurate, very robust system, but they look like black

15:13.400 --> 15:14.600
boxes.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.440
We don't understand what's going on inside.

15:17.440 --> 15:22.360
We get the input, we take the input, and we get the output.

15:22.360 --> 15:30.040
Stephen Hawkins says, success in creating artificial intelligence will be the biggest

15:30.040 --> 15:33.000
event in human history.

15:33.000 --> 15:44.080
Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.800
So it is time to take action.

15:47.800 --> 15:54.960
It is time to build an intelligence machine that can actually inform our decision-making.

15:54.960 --> 16:01.120
We need to take control of this system, intelligence system that we build.

16:01.120 --> 16:09.320
And we need to use this system, artificial intelligence, to empower human intelligence.

16:09.320 --> 16:18.160
We need to do a revolution, a revolution that democratizes artificial intelligence.

16:18.160 --> 16:24.400
It is time to open black boxes.

16:24.400 --> 16:24.600
Thank you.
