0	15520	Alright, so you probably don't realize that right now you're actually looking at something
15520	24160	quite rare because I am a millennial computer scientist book author standing on a TED stage
24160	27420	and yet I've never had a social media account.
27420	32740	While this happened was actually somewhat random, social media first came on to my radar when
32740	37420	I was at college, my sophomore year of college, this is when Facebook arrived at our campus
37420	42220	and at the time which was right after the first dot-com bust, I had had a dorm room
42220	46780	business, I had had to shut it down in the bust and then suddenly this other kid from
46780	50500	Harvard named Mark had this product called Facebook and people were getting excited about
50500	54820	it so it was sort of a fit of somewhat immature professional jealousy, I said I'm not going
54820	57820	to use this thing, I'm not going to help this kid's business, what's I ever going to
57820	58820	mount to?
58820	62300	So as I go along my life I look up not long later and I see that everyone I know is really
62300	67180	hooked on this thing and from the clarity you can get when you have some objectivity,
67180	71300	some perspective on it I realized this seems a little bit dangerous so I never signed up,
71300	74340	I've never had a social media account since.
74340	79140	So I'm here for two reasons, I want to deliver two messages, the first message I want to deliver
79140	85660	is that even though I've never had a social media account I'm okay, you don't have to
85660	90220	worry, it turns out I still have friends, I still know what's going on in the world,
90220	94660	there's a computer scientist, I still collaborate with people all around the world, I'm still
94660	100060	regularly exposed serendipitously to interesting ideas and I rarely describe myself as lacking
100060	101060	in entertainment options.
101060	105700	So I've been okay but I'd go even farther, I'd go even farther and say not only am I
105700	111140	okay without social media but I think I'm actually better off, I think I'm happier,
111140	116940	I think I find more sustainability in my life and I think I've been more successful professionally
116940	120100	because I don't use social media.
120100	124860	So my second goal here on stage is to try to convince more of you to believe the same
124860	130540	thing, to see if I could actually convince more of you that you too would be better off
130540	131660	if you quit social media.
131660	136340	So if the theme of this TEDx event is future tense, I guess in other words this would be
136340	140900	my vision of the future would be one in which fewer people actually use social media.
140900	144540	Okay, so that's a big claim, I think I need to back it up, so my thought what I would
144540	149900	do is take the three most common objections I hear when I suggest to people that they
149900	154140	quit social media and then for each of these objections I'll try to defuse the hype and
154140	157180	see if I can actually push in some more reality.
158180	164660	So this is the first most common objection I hear, that's not a hermit, that's actually
164660	169060	a hipstered web developer down from H Street, I'm not sure, hipster a hermit sometimes
169060	171540	is hard to tell.
171540	176260	So this first objection goes as follows, Cal social media is one of the fundamental
176260	182580	technologies of the 21st century to reject social media would be an act of extreme bloodism,
182580	186620	it would be like riding to work in a horse or using a rotary phone, I can't take such
186620	189260	a big stance in my life.
189260	193500	So my reaction to that objection is I think that is nonsense.
193500	198060	Social media is not a fundamental technology, it leverages some fundamental technologies
198060	203980	but it's better understood as this, which is to say it's a source of entertainment,
203980	205860	it's entertainment product.
205860	210980	The way the technologist Jaron Lanaire puts it is that these companies offer you shiny
210980	216180	treats in exchange for minutes of your attention and bites of your personal data which can
216180	219580	then be packaged up and sold.
219580	224340	So to say that you don't use social media should not be a large social stance, it's
224340	228060	just rejecting one form of entertainment for others, it should be no more controversial
228060	232420	than saying I don't like newspapers, I like to get my news from magazines or I prefer to
232420	238380	watch cable series as opposed to network television series, it's not a major political or social
238380	241100	stance to say you don't use this product.
241100	245700	My use of the slot machine image up here also is not accidental because if you look a little
245700	249060	bit closer at these technologies it's not just that they're a source of entertainment
249060	252540	but they're actually a somewhat unsavory source of entertainment.
252540	256480	We now know that many of the major social media companies hire individuals called attention
256480	261980	engineers who borrow principles from Las Vegas Casino Gambling among other places to try
261980	265740	to make these products as addictive as possible.
265740	269220	That is the desired use case of these products is that you use it in an addictive fashion
269220	275040	because that maximizes the profit that can be extracted from your attention and data.
275040	278160	So it's not a fundamental technology, it's just a source of entertainment, one among
278160	283160	many and it's somewhat unsavory if you look a little bit closer.
283160	287240	So here's the second common objection I hear when I suggest that people quit social media,
287240	292360	the objection goes as follows, Cal, I can't quit social media because it is vital to my
292360	295240	success in the 21st century economy.
295240	300280	If I do not have a well-cultivated social media brand people won't know who I am, people
300280	305800	won't be able to find me, opportunities won't come my way and I will effectively disappear
305800	307200	from the economy.
307200	313160	So again my reaction is once again this objection also is nonsense.
313160	319520	So I recently published this book that draws on multiple different strands of evidence
319520	326640	to make the point that in a competitive 21st century economy what the market values is
326640	330520	the ability to produce things that are rare and are valuable.
330520	335000	You can produce something that's rare and is valuable, the market will value that.
335000	340320	What the market dismisses for the most part are activities that are easy to replicate
340320	342960	and produce a small amount of value.
342960	348560	Well social media use is the epitome of an easy to replicate activity that does not directly
348560	352680	produce a lot of value, it's something that any 16 year old with a smartphone can do.
352680	356560	By definition the market is not going to give a lot of value to those behaviors.
356560	362400	It's instead going to reward the deep concentrated work required to build real skills and to
362400	367880	apply those skills to produce things like a craftsman that are rare and that are valuable.
367880	374720	To put it another way, if you can write an elegant algorithm, if you can write a legal
374720	378240	brief that can change a case, if you can write a thousand words of prose that's going to
378240	380240	fixate a reader right to the end.
380240	386200	If you can look at a sea of ambiguous data and apply statistics and pull out insights
386200	389400	that could transform a whole business strategy, if you can do these type of activities which
389400	396400	require deep work that produce outcomes that are rare and valuable, people will find you.
396400	399120	You will be able to write your own ticket, you will be able to build the foundation of
399120	403720	a very meaningful and successful professional life regardless of how many Instagram followers
403720	408360	you have.
408360	413720	So this is the third common objection I hear when I suggest to people that they quit social
413720	416720	media and in some sense I think it might be one of the most important.
416720	420560	So this objection goes as follows, Cal, maybe I agree with you, maybe you're right, it's
420560	425760	not a fundamental technology, maybe using social media is not at the core of my professional
425760	429160	success, but you know what, it's harmless.
429160	432000	I have some fun on it, weird Twitter is funny.
432000	434960	I don't even really use it that much, I'm a first adopter, it's just kind of interesting
434960	438480	to try it out and maybe I might miss out on something if I don't use it.
438480	440480	What's the harm?
440480	445880	So again I look back and I say this objection also is nonsense.
445880	449600	In this case what it misses is what I think is a very important reality that we need to
449600	456320	talk about more frankly, which is that social media brings with it multiple well documented
456320	459160	significant harms.
459160	463080	And we actually have to confront these harms head on when trying to make decisions about
463080	468480	whether or not we embrace this technology and let it into our lives.
468480	473920	So one of these harms that we know this technology brings has to do with your professional success.
473920	479160	So I just argued before that the ability to focus intensely to produce things that are
479160	482440	rare and valuable, to hone skills that the marketplace values, that this is what's going
482440	488240	to matter in our economy, but right before that I argued that social media tools are
488240	490840	designed to be addictive.
490840	495120	The actual design, desired use case of these tools is that you fragment your attention
495120	497120	as much as possible throughout your waking hours.
497120	499800	That's how these tools are designed to use.
499800	503400	Well we have a growing amount of research which tells us that if you spend large portions
503400	507480	of your day in a state of fragmented attention.
507480	509880	So large portions of your day where you're constantly breaking up your attention, take
509880	514440	a quick glance, do a just check, let me just quickly look at Instagram, that this can permanently
514440	517720	reduce your capacity for concentration.
517720	521880	In other words you could permanently reduce your capacity to do exactly the type of deep
521880	526880	effort that we're finding to be more and more necessary in an increasingly competitive
526880	527880	economy.
527880	531600	So social media use is not harmless, it can actually have a significant negative impact
531600	534040	on your ability to thrive in the economy.
534040	537440	I am especially worried about this when we look at the younger generation coming up which
537440	539640	is the most saturated in this technology.
539640	545160	If you lose your ability to sustain concentration you're going to become less and less relevant
545160	546760	to this economy.
546760	550880	There's also psychological harms that are well documented that social media brings that
550880	553280	we do need to address.
553280	556800	So we know from the research literature that the more you use social media the more likely
556800	560060	you are to feel lonely or isolated.
560060	566320	We know that the constant exposure to your friends carefully curated positive portrayals
566320	572360	of their life can leave you to feel inadequate and can increase rates of depression.
572360	576160	And something I think we're going to be hearing more about in the near future is that there's
576160	582560	a fundamental mismatch between the way our brains are wired and this behavior of exposing
582560	587000	yourself to stimuli with intermittent rewards throughout all of your waking hours.
587000	590120	So it's one thing to spend a couple hours at the slot machine in Las Vegas but if you
590120	593360	bring a slot machine with you and you pull that handle all day long from when you wake
593360	596240	up to when you go to bed we're not wired from it.
596240	600320	It short circuits the brain and we're starting to find that it has actual cognitive consequences
600320	605480	one of them being this sort of pervasive background hum of anxiety.
605480	609000	So the canary in the coal mine for this issue is actually college campuses.
609000	614680	If you talk to mental health experts on college campuses they'll tell you along with the rise
614680	619320	of ubiquitous smartphone use and social media use among the students on the campus came
619320	623000	an explosion of anxiety related disorders on those campuses.
623000	625520	So that's the canary in the coal mine.
625520	628520	This type of behavior is a mismatch for our brain wiring it can make you feel miserable.
628520	634640	So there's real cost to social media use which means when you're trying to decide should
634640	637200	I use this or not saying it's harmless is not enough.
637200	642680	You actually have to identify a significantly positive clear benefit that can outweigh these
642680	648200	potential completely non-trivial harms.
648200	652200	So people often ask okay but what is life like without social media that can actually
652200	654560	be a little bit scary to think about.
654560	657640	What I found from people I know who have gone through this process there can be a few weeks
657640	660480	that are difficult that actually is like a true detox process.
660480	663360	The first two weeks can be uncomfortable.
663360	667680	You feel a little bit anxious you feel like you're missing a limb but after that things
667680	672960	settle down and actually life after social media can be quite positive.
672960	677440	There's two things I can report back to you from the world of no social media use.
677440	680480	First it can be quite productive, be quite productive.
680480	685880	So I'm a professor at a research institution I've written five books I rarely work past
685880	688600	five p.m. on the weekday.
688600	692400	Part of the way I'm trying to able to pull that off is because it turns out if you treat
692400	698720	your attention with respect so you don't fragment it you allow it to stay whole you preserve
698720	701440	your ability to concentrate when it comes time to work you can actually do one thing
701440	706360	after another and do it with intensity and intensity can be traded for time it's surprising
706360	709440	how much you can get done in eight hour day if you're able to give each thing intense
709440	712640	concentration after another.
712640	717280	Something else I can report back from life without social media is that outside of work
717280	721280	things can be quite peaceful.
721280	724960	So I often joke I'd be very comfortable being a 1930s farmer because if you look at my leisure
724960	729720	time I read newspaper while the sun comes up I listen to baseball on the radio I honest
729720	735240	to God sit in a leather chair and read hardcover books at night after my kids go to bed.
735240	739960	It sounds old fashioned but I'll tell you they were on to something back then it's actually
739960	744120	a restorative very peaceful way to actually spend your time out of work you don't have
744120	749480	the constant home stimuli and the background home of anxiety that comes along with that.
749480	753280	So life without social media is really not so bad.
753280	757180	So we pulled together these threads and you see my full argument for why I think not everyone
757180	760760	but certainly much more people than right now use social media much more people should
760760	765520	not be using social media and that's because we can first summarize discard with the main
765520	769760	concerns that somehow it's a fundamental technology you have to use nonsense it's a slot machine
769760	773000	in your phone we can discard with this notion that you're not going to get a job if you
773000	776800	don't use social media nonsense anything a 16 year old with a smartphone can do is not
776800	781680	going to be what the market rewards and then I emphasize the point that there's real harms
781680	786040	with it so it's not just harmless you really would have to have a significant benefit before
786040	790200	you would actually say this trade off is worth and finally I noted that life without social
790200	793520	media there's real positives associated with it.
793520	798440	So I'm hoping that when many of you actually go through this same calculus you'll at least
798440	802200	consider the perspective I'm making right now which is many more people would be much
802200	804680	better off if they didn't use this technology.
804680	811320	Now of course some of you might disagree some of you might have scathing but accurate critiques
811320	815800	of me and my points and of course I welcome all negative feedback I just ask that you
815800	818800	direct your comments towards Twitter thank you.
