0	10000	The Weir is about to start time for another round of applause.
10000	13380	Please welcome Ms.
13380	27180	Pala and Ms.
27180	47420	Just a moment, I'm posting this.
47420	51780	A few years ago, I attended a social media event.
51780	58340	This is an event where people gather and share their ideas with an audience.
58340	65980	Many of these influencers had spent years creating videos and sharing their stories
65980	74460	and encouraging others to build authentic relationships.
74540	81940	I watched with enthusiasm each one walk into the conference and write on by,
81940	88820	headed for the most Instagram worthy location in the conference hall.
88820	95940	With each attempt to introduce myself, I was ignored or brushed off.
95940	105740	You see, they chose to connect online rather than to connect with a human being.
105740	115580	They chose social media over the potential of a real relationship right in front of them.
115580	123820	That was the moment, the moment that changed my perspective.
123860	129860	Social media is making us unsocial.
129860	135300	Social media is killing relationships.
135300	143900	Social media is replacing experiences.
143900	148220	Look familiar?
148220	153140	Or this?
153140	162220	How about this?
162220	166820	Social media has changed the way we live our lives,
166820	172260	from the way we get news to the way we interact with loved ones.
172260	174300	It's everywhere.
174300	177460	It's powerful.
177460	182020	And it's growing.
182020	190780	According to the Global Web Index, we spend on average two hours a day on social media,
190780	196660	and it's increasing at a rate of two minutes per day.
196660	207420	Over the course of a lifetime, that's five years and four months on social media.
207420	215980	That's over 40,000 hours.
215980	224580	The experience of art and history are being replaced with a digital representation of those things.
224580	229420	Rather than visit a museum or art gallery,
229420	237380	we take to Instagram to view the works of artists like Banksy.
237380	242340	Social media is impacting social issues too.
242340	248660	Have you heard the term slacktivism?
248660	254340	While social media activism brings awareness to societal issues,
254340	260380	the awareness isn't translating into real change.
260380	264060	It's a shift to devices.
264060	274780	People are pressing a like button rather than actively engaging with campaigns in real life.
274780	283460	We care more about how other people perceive our adventures than actually having them.
283460	291100	The urge to check social media is stronger than the urge for sex.
291140	297500	Yet both are driven by a need to connect.
297500	305340	Many relationships have been jeopardized or ruined because of micro-cheating,
305340	311860	pushing the boundaries of fidelity through social media.
311860	317820	We know that the world is changing with every passing moment
317820	325140	because of technological inventions and rapid adoption of the technology.
325140	330540	But technology is not the problem.
330540	333140	We are.
333140	339460	And the reality is we are slowly becoming addicted.
339460	341380	How do I know?
341380	344220	I'm on the inside.
344220	347660	For the past 20 years, I've been in marketing.
347660	355580	And as long as there are advertisers looking to capture your attention and get you hooked,
355580	359060	there will be new social platforms.
359060	363460	There will be new social channels.
363460	370220	For the last few years, I had been creating content on social, specifically on LinkedIn.
370220	374340	And I was named a top voice on the platform.
374340	381980	But what I realized was the more I was creating online and building relationships online,
381980	388260	I was losing touch with people in real life.
388260	396060	After food and shelter, our need to belong and feel positively connected
396060	409580	is arguably the number one predictor of health, happiness, well-being, and even longevity.
409580	415740	Human connection brings complex value to our lives.
415740	423900	It's the interactive exchange that defines us.
423900	430180	We need to use social media as a support to building real relationships,
430180	433700	not a catalyst to losing them.
433700	443700	Remember, some of the most brilliant minds in the world, think Silicon Valley tech,
443700	451660	have dedicated their lives to making social media more addictive.
451700	454700	We need to get aggressive to get our focus back.
454700	456300	We can do it.
456300	458220	Here's how.
458220	461860	Turn notifications off.
461860	467340	Delete social media apps from your phone.
467340	475980	Educate others and help our children understand how to manage their usage.
475980	484660	Use social media to build relationships and take it offline.
484660	500260	We already know the risks, anxiety, isolation, depression, cyberbullying, low self-worth.
500260	504500	We can do it.
504540	510180	Let's disconnect to connect.
510180	511180	Thank you.
