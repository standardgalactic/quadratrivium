1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,340
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:21,160
I stand here with a simple offer, an offer that, if accepted, yields instantaneous results

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,120
and inevitable positive consequences.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:33,780
My offer is this, the chance to purge yourself of social media and reclaim your personal identity.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,120
I challenge everyone to try going one week without social media, and I guarantee it will

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,200
change your life.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,760
I can attest to this because I personally have been without any social media for almost

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,920
a year, and it's completely changed the way I view the world.

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
I'm not saying that all social media is bad.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Social media can be used for marketing or to spread a positive message to the world.

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:16,320
However, apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat are taking over our lives.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,280
They're taking us out of the present moment and causing us to exist only in a virtual

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,240
world, and nobody should live like that.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,800
Social media has taken over astonishingly quickly.

15
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,040
If you think about it, when we meet a new person, the norm is no longer to ask them for

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,920
their phone number.

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,000
The norm is to friend them on Facebook or ask for their Snapchat or Twitter username.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,000
In 2008, only 24% of the US population had a social media profile.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,760
Now 81% has one.

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,080
This astronomical growth is because social media is seen as a do-it-all platform.

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,760
It's widely replaced texting and email in a lot of cases, and it's used as our main

22
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,280
source of news.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,400
This leads to people spending hours a day with their noses just glued to their phones.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,040
Psychologists at Trent Nottingham University found that we spend twice as much time on

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:34,280
our phones as we think we do, and that amount of time is five hours a day, nearly a third

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,880
of our entire waking lives.

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm sure you're familiar with this site.

28
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
That used to be me.

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,440
In fact, I would wake up every morning and immediately reach for my phone.

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,800
The amount of notifications I had would determine how good my morning was.

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,300
Yay!

32
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,680
People want to talk to me!

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,360
I would spend one to two hours thoughtlessly scrolling through all my social media profiles

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,760
before even getting out of bed.

35
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,520
I would check Twitter, then Snapchat, then Instagram, then go back to Twitter to see

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,600
if anything new had been posted just in the last 30 minutes.

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,960
I was an addict wasting my time, and the time that I was wasting was being spent looking

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,200
at other people's posts and seeing how I thought other people lived.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,240
This influenced me to shape my life in a similar way, and I took on the values of what

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,720
I saw online.

41
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,040
In hindsight, I wasn't living my life at all.

42
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,380
I was living society's life.

43
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,000
This is one of the biggest problems with social media.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,360
It causes people to live their life based on some societal standard.

45
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,520
This has always had an instinct to fit in.

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,760
Collaboration and cooperation were necessary for our species to survive.

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,180
Because of this, a sense of belonging is one of the most sought after and rewarding feelings

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,880
anyone can experience.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,400
Think of the feeling of your favorite sports team winning the big game, or finally finishing

50
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,120
a group project where each member of the group knew their role and carried it out perfectly.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,360
Successful group interaction triggers a firing of the pleasure centers in the brain, and releases

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,000
amounts of dopamine synonymous with drug use.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,400
A feeling of belonging is sought in humans like drug addicts seek their next fix.

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,280
And social media is designed to exploit this.

55
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,720
All the little features, like comments, likes, and being able to share posts, are just gimmicks

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
designed to get us hooked by causing dopamine to be released.

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,440
I was guiltier of just posting what I thought everyone wanted to see than anyone.

58
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,080
I knew that on social media, I was simply crafting an image of myself.

59
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,480
But I didn't care.

60
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:38,000
I loved attention, and I loved the ability to portray myself any way I wanted.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,760
It wasn't me.

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,120
I was losing touch with my authentic self.

63
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,480
And this problem manifests mainly in my generation, as teenagers have grown up with the internet.

64
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,440
We've spent our whole lives interacting with our peers online.

65
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,960
We're more comfortable on our phones than in a face-to-face interaction.

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,760
And this has catastrophic consequences on our mental health.

67
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,160
Studies have shown that kids who spend more time on their phones have less developed frontal

68
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,880
cortexes.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,320
And we need our frontal cortex to plan for the future, think rationally, and solve problems.

70
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:34,520
My generation is losing those abilities because we can't focus on anything besides our phones.

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,200
Combine that with the fact that social media is our main source of forming connections with

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,320
other people.

73
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:50,760
And it's easy to see why teen depression has skyrocketed 33 percent just since 2010.

74
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,680
And teen suicides have gone up 31 percent in the same period.

75
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,400
We are killing ourselves just to fit in.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Yet, everyone around me somehow thinks they're better than social media.

77
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,720
They tell me, oh, I only use it to look at memes.

78
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,760
Or, I just like to keep up with my friends that I can't see every day.

79
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,520
Yet, the conversation that I constantly hear is gossip and judgment.

80
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,680
Did you see my post?

81
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
Did you like it?

82
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,080
Did you see her post?

83
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
Why was she hanging out with him?

84
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,120
Why did he say that?

85
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,840
He's so creepy.

86
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,760
Why did she post that?

87
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,120
She has no self-respect.

88
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,160
The people around me are addicted to stalking other people.

89
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,440
Yet, maintain the assertion that they're somehow above it all.

90
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,320
And all the features that I talked about earlier, the gimmicks, they can't replace real life

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
interaction.

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,960
A like can't replace a smile or a compliment.

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,240
But we treat it as if it can.

94
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,440
We allow ourselves to become less social and lose touch with the face-to-face interactions

95
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,360
that really matter.

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,600
In a study by Pew Research Center, 55% of participants said they interact with their

97
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,040
friends online on a daily basis.

98
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,920
Only 33% said they interact with their friends face-to-face on a daily basis.

99
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,880
Think about this.

100
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,120
How many of you have ever pulled out your phone and stared at it just to avoid an awkward

101
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,640
social situation?

102
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,200
I know I see that every day in school.

103
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,680
How many of you have ever taken a long video at a sporting event or concert so you can

104
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,240
relive the moment later or share it with your friends instead of actually making sure that

105
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,280
you're living in the moment and enjoying life as it happens?

106
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,520
Last winter, I was at a crossroads in my life.

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,040
I've always been driven, but I really had no idea what I wanted to do.

108
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,640
Track has always been my main sport, but I didn't really think I wanted to run in college.

109
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,240
I've also always had dreams of attending a top-level academic school.

110
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,800
But schools like that required true excellence.

111
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,680
I had no motivating force and nothing that separated me from the people around me.

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,680
I cared more about creating the image that I wanted of myself online than working to

113
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,560
secure the future that I wanted.

114
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,120
Everybody has dreams of greatness when they're a kid.

115
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Everybody wants to live an average and unfulfilling life, yet so few people are willing to put

116
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:11,400
in the work to developing themselves and unlocking their full potential.

117
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,800
I realized that if I devoted myself to improving on the track, I would have a way of standing

118
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,680
out from other applicants and maybe reaching one of my dream schools.

119
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,720
So I began dedicating myself to track more and attempting to spend less time on social

120
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
media.

121
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,720
However, about two weeks into this new routine, I realized that while I was training for track

122
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,960
more, I was spending about the same amount of time on social media.

123
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,640
I was simply shirking my academic duties and losing some sleep.

124
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,080
I had to decide if running track in college and my future was more important to me than

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,000
trying to fit in.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,080
And it was.

127
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:08,240
Slowly but surely, I became disgusted with who I was and I wondered how I had let myself

128
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,040
become so addicted to something that had no value in the long run.

129
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
I decided to quit social media cold turkey.

130
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,120
Instantly it was as if a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,400
I began to see the beauty and the world around me.

132
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,800
I discovered my passion for life and I found a sense of individuality and contentment with

133
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,480
who I was.

134
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,440
And the week after I deleted social media, I changed more than I have at any other point

135
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
in my life.

136
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,200
I re-evaluated not only my actions, but my mindset, my goals, and my overall attitude

137
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,100
towards life.

138
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:04,000
I realized that at any given moment, I can be doing anything I want to in the world.

139
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,200
I simply have to choose to do what's best for myself.

140
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Because of this, I'm on my own path now and I'm my own person.

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm not standing up here proclaiming that I'm a perfect person, devoid of weakness just

142
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,880
because I deleted social media.

143
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:33,720
But I am claiming that I'm in control of my own happiness and satisfaction with life.

144
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm also not claiming that by deleting social media, you will immediately become a better

145
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,280
person, find happiness, and reach your goals.

146
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,680
Deleting social media in itself doesn't bring anything of a direct value to your life.

147
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,160
It's simply an avenue towards individual thought and freedom.

148
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,320
Everybody spends their life searching for happiness and yearning for fulfillment, yet most people

149
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,760
spend so much of it looking at other people's lives online.

150
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,260
If you have the superpower to be present in the moment, and you aren't so preoccupied

151
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,000
with what everyone else is doing, you'll find that life is a little easier.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
Happiness is always at hand.

153
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,920
It's easier to treat the people around you with kindness and have straightforward but

154
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,640
profound relationships.

155
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,440
I think the world would be a better place if everyone possessed this skill.

156
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Thank you.

157
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,940
Thank you.
