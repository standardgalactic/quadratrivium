00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Imagine if you could take your brain and then turn it inside out, and then have access

00:15.920 --> 00:19.760
to the information to be able to solve virtually any problem.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.240
It sounds pretty cool, right?

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
Well, here's how.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.680
We're going to take a look at problem solving in a very different way, one that can bring

00:27.680 --> 00:30.080
tremendous benefit to your life.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.240
And this is a technique I was first introduced to at the age of 12 when I began studying

00:34.240 --> 00:40.440
the art form of magic, and I've continued to develop it throughout my professional career.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.560
And now, best of all, this will be able to work for you in your personal life, professional,

00:45.560 --> 00:48.840
or to help you create that next billion-dollar idea.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.520
And in any field, sales, marketing, show business, it doesn't matter.

00:54.120 --> 00:59.760
Now throughout this talk, I'm going to be revealing to you three core psychological

00:59.760 --> 01:05.200
principles that magicians have been using for more than 5,000 years.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.360
And all of these principles have one thing in common.

01:08.360 --> 01:17.800
They all revolve around the most important concept in magic, and that is the answer to

01:17.800 --> 01:24.320
every problem is hiding in plain sight.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
So let me explain.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.000
Imagine you're seated at a table and you're given a problem to solve, using nothing except

01:30.000 --> 01:40.840
for these items, a candle, some pushpins, and some matches.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.680
Now you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to attach this candle to the wall in a way

01:45.680 --> 01:47.640
that when it's lit.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.440
The wax will not drip down onto the table.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.720
So some of you may be familiar with this, but for the rest of you, when you're trying

01:54.720 --> 01:58.040
to figure this out, let me give you a little bit of history of where this came from.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.680
Now, this is a classic test of creative problem solving developed by the renowned psychologist

02:02.680 --> 02:07.240
Dr. Carl Dunker, and it was first published in 1945.

02:07.240 --> 02:11.680
But although this is over three quarters of a century old, Dr. Dunker's assessment of

02:11.680 --> 02:15.440
how our cognitive brain solves problems hasn't really changed at all.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.680
Again, it's back to what I said earlier.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.760
The answer to every problem is hiding in plain sight.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.920
You see, the thing is, we look right at the answer, but we rarely see it.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.120
And in this case, most people are so consumed with how to attach the candle to the wall

02:32.120 --> 02:37.280
using tax, while the real answer is right in front of them.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.280
You guys see it?

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
The box.

02:40.720 --> 02:46.760
Again, that's what I mean by the answer is hidden in plain sight.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.960
And again, the reason we don't think the box is one of the solutions is because it's not

02:50.960 --> 02:53.040
presented to us as such.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.880
It's locked away in our brain in position simply as a container for the pins.

02:56.880 --> 03:02.520
Now, Dr. Dunker called this functional fixin'ness, the cognitive bias that limits a person to

03:02.520 --> 03:06.360
using an object only in the way that it's traditionally intended.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.480
And the same is also true of ideas and concepts.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.760
For example, this candlestick problem was presented to you simply as a creative problem

03:14.760 --> 03:19.600
solving test, when in fact, it also had a secondary purpose.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.000
It contained a very important clue, one that was hiding in plain sight, which you will

03:25.000 --> 03:29.560
need to unlock another facet of your cognitive problem solving ability.

03:29.560 --> 03:33.600
Now the thing is, you probably didn't notice because you weren't instructed to look for

03:33.600 --> 03:34.600
it.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.280
So right now, I'm giving you a heads up.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.840
There's going to be one more clue hidden during this talk.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.280
So pay close attention to every detail.

03:45.280 --> 03:50.480
Now to make all this a lot easier to understand, I've simplified the process into three words.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.920
The first word is misconceptions.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.240
Most people think a difficult problem must have a complex solution.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.600
The second word, assumptions.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.280
We utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and we don't think beyond

04:03.280 --> 04:04.680
those parameters.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.560
And the third word is expectations.

04:07.560 --> 04:12.360
The answer we expect to find often limits us and does not allow us to see what's really

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
going on.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.880
Now I thought it'd be kind of fun to show you what all three of these words look like

04:16.880 --> 04:20.840
in action, and then we'll dive into each one in a little bit more detail.

04:20.840 --> 04:27.560
So for this here, I've got a few bills, two, three, four, I think five dollars here.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.280
So here's the goal.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.440
The goal is to be able to take these bills, if I can do this properly, we'll actually

04:34.440 --> 04:37.000
be able to take them on the count of three.

04:37.000 --> 04:48.360
We go one, two, three, like that, and let you transform into five hundred dollars.

04:48.360 --> 04:56.520
Okay, now I have to say this, I can't promise you'll actually be able to transform money

04:56.520 --> 05:01.800
at your fingertips by the end of this talk, but you will be able to utilize these same

05:01.800 --> 05:02.800
principles.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.720
The same principles I just used to turn one dollar bills into hundred dollar bills to

05:06.720 --> 05:08.600
solve virtually any problem.

05:08.600 --> 05:14.120
All right, so let's break this whole thing down right now, starting with misconceptions.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.880
This is the exact same thing that happens with the candlestick problem.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.360
You see, most people are so focused on how to attach the candlestick, they can't figure

05:21.360 --> 05:25.920
out exactly what's going on with the box, it gets buried in their brains.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.480
And what happens, you have to force your brain to reassess everything about the situation

05:29.480 --> 05:33.800
every detail, to bring the information to the surface, and then be able to expand your

05:33.800 --> 05:36.200
ability to utilize cognitive thinking.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.880
So I've got another little, this is so fun, I can't wait to show you this, so this here

05:39.880 --> 05:44.960
is a little thing, so guys, take a look right over here, we've got a couple cards, six cards

05:44.960 --> 05:50.780
to be exact, each card is different, and each card has been selected for a very important

05:50.780 --> 05:53.200
psychological reason.

05:53.200 --> 05:59.080
You'll find out why in just a moment, so right now, I want you to focus on just one card

05:59.200 --> 06:01.120
and remember it.

06:01.120 --> 06:06.600
Keep repeating the name of your card over and over and over in your mind, you got it?

06:06.600 --> 06:11.840
Great, I'm going to turn the cards over, start mixing them up.

06:11.840 --> 06:21.440
Now if I did this correctly, all of you, yes, all of you will have been influenced to choose

06:21.440 --> 06:27.400
the exact same card.

06:27.400 --> 06:34.280
And I'm going to remove your card right now.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.280
Let's see if it worked.

06:35.280 --> 06:47.680
So it's pretty crazy, right, so, okay, so how did this happen?

06:47.680 --> 06:54.000
Like I said, there is a psychological reason why these cards were selected, but it is not

06:54.080 --> 06:57.840
so that all of you would be drawn to the same card, it's so that all of you would focus

06:57.840 --> 07:03.120
on only one card and ignore the rest, and that's where the misconception comes in, because

07:03.120 --> 07:09.760
what you don't know is that there's actually two separate sets of cards, again, the answer

07:09.760 --> 07:12.920
was hiding in plain sight.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.080
The reason you didn't notice is because both sets of cards are actually very similar, so

07:17.080 --> 07:22.000
let's say for instance, in the first spread you selected the king of clubs, in the second

07:22.000 --> 07:27.240
spread it was replaced by the king of spades, so no matter what card you chose in the first

07:27.240 --> 07:31.040
spread, it's not going to show up in the second spread, and to top it all off, you were so

07:31.040 --> 07:36.600
focused on your one card, you didn't even notice any of the other cards around it.

07:36.600 --> 07:41.160
This is why misconception is so dangerous, and it often makes problem solving take way

07:41.160 --> 07:43.160
longer than it really should.

07:43.160 --> 07:48.040
All right, now the next idea we're going to tackle is assumptions, and more importantly,

07:48.040 --> 07:49.520
false assumptions.

07:49.520 --> 07:55.720
So why don't you take a look at this animation right now, and tell me, which way is the key

07:55.720 --> 07:59.520
rotating?

07:59.520 --> 08:05.880
Now some of you will assume the key is rotating clockwise, others will assume the key is rotating

08:05.880 --> 08:12.720
counterclockwise, and both of those assumptions are wrong.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.480
You see, we assume the key is moving in just one direction or the other, but I can assure

08:16.480 --> 08:18.480
you it's not.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.520
Now if you're more of a right brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the

08:22.520 --> 08:23.520
right.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.480
If you're more of a left brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the left, but

08:27.480 --> 08:31.760
by switching your thinking from right brain to left brain, you'll be able to shift the

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
direction of the key.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.480
Now this takes a little bit of practice, but the results are almost magical.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.720
So how does this relate to hiding in plain sight?

08:40.720 --> 08:47.640
Well in this situation, our brain thinks and assumes that there's only one of two possible

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
answers.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.920
The only two it readily knows and accepts.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.200
The key can rotate right or the key can rotate left.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.200
It's inconceivable the key can be rotating in both directions at the same time.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.560
But you see, if we really study the image, we realize we don't have enough information

09:02.560 --> 09:06.040
to determine the key's direction at all, because you see, the key is solid black.

09:06.040 --> 09:11.000
There's no highlights, shadows, or any other distinguishing marks to give us the appropriate

09:11.000 --> 09:12.500
information.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.560
Now our brain fills in these missing pieces, and we assume, because our mind likes to work

09:16.640 --> 09:22.640
in an orderly fashion, that what we see is the key rotating in one direction or the other.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.360
It doesn't even occur to us that maybe we're missing the relevant information to make an

09:26.360 --> 09:27.880
informed decision.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.200
And we assume that what our mind tells us, based on the way that it chooses to function

09:32.200 --> 09:35.920
at that moment, that our logic is correct.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.240
So the correct answer to this one is simply hiding in plain sight.

09:41.240 --> 09:46.680
Hiding on your perception, the key rotates in both directions.

09:46.680 --> 09:52.880
Now there's still one more crucial word we need to explore, and that is expectations.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.640
The answer we expect to find can blind us to what is actually happening, and this is

09:57.640 --> 10:00.800
what makes problem-solving so difficult.

10:00.800 --> 10:05.360
Now a great example of this is when I was asked to be on the TV show America's Got Talent.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.920
There was just one problem.

10:06.920 --> 10:12.440
At the time, the producers of the show expected magicians to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type

10:12.440 --> 10:15.680
illusions, which I didn't do.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.840
Now the reason that America's Got Talent wanted these types of acts was because the show was

10:18.840 --> 10:23.640
being taped in front of 6,000 people at Radio City Music Hall, and they wanted the show

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
to feel huge.

10:25.640 --> 10:30.520
But I noticed that none of the magicians ever made it past the first few rounds, so I started

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
analyzing why.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.800
I mean their acts were great in front of the 6,000 people in the audience, but to the millions

10:36.840 --> 10:42.000
of people who were watching on TV at home, and then voting, there was a disconnect between

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
the performer.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.560
Again, I analyzed why.

10:45.560 --> 10:50.080
Well television is really an intimate medium, and the best kind of magic for television

10:50.080 --> 10:52.640
is close-up magic, because it too is intimate.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.720
It draws the viewer in.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.240
So armed with this new insight, I realized the answer was right in front of me.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.040
It was literally hiding in plain sight.

11:00.040 --> 11:06.480
I didn't need to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type illusions, I needed to do small, close-up,

11:06.480 --> 11:12.440
flashy performances that would blow the minds of the judges and the people watching at home.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.720
Now it took a bit of convincing to get the producers to agree to this whole thing.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.880
They definitely did not see it the way that I did at that time.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.560
But once I was able to refocus their attention back to what they already knew, which is that

11:22.560 --> 11:27.920
television is intimate, therefore the magic actually be intimate as well, they said, okay,

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
let's do it.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.880
And it was a paradigm-shifting way for magic to be done on America's Got Talent, and I

11:32.880 --> 11:37.760
actually became the first magician to ever make it into the finals on that show.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.760
Thank you.

11:38.760 --> 11:46.680
Now it all happened because I was able to shift the producer's expectations of what

11:46.680 --> 11:48.480
they thought would work.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.640
So right now, it's time for me to shift yours.

11:51.640 --> 11:56.400
As I mentioned earlier, throughout this entire talk, I've given you two clues to the problems

11:56.400 --> 11:59.320
I'm about to show you right now.

11:59.320 --> 12:04.240
Now you may or may not have noticed them, and if you didn't, here's a little hint.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.360
If you go back and watch this again, you'll notice that every time I touch my key, say

12:08.360 --> 12:13.040
the answer is hiding in plain sight, I would point to the clue that you will need to quickly

12:13.040 --> 12:14.560
solve these next few problems.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.920
Now there's a chance you probably just didn't even notice it, that you perceived the touch

12:17.920 --> 12:20.840
against my key just in a relevant gesture.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.640
You didn't expect such a simple action could contain the answer to what you perceived as

12:24.640 --> 12:26.920
a much more complicated problem.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.560
So here are the challenges.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.920
The first one.

12:31.920 --> 12:36.440
How do you drink champagne from the bottle without opening it?

12:36.440 --> 12:40.160
Immediately, your mind will start thinking of all these different solutions, most of

12:40.160 --> 12:44.120
which probably have to do with a complicated way of getting the cork off and getting the

12:44.120 --> 12:48.240
champagne out without actually opening up the bottle.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.880
Keep thinking.

12:50.880 --> 13:01.520
The next one here involves two glasses, a dollar bill suspended between them, and a

13:01.520 --> 13:03.160
salt shaker.

13:03.160 --> 13:07.820
And the challenge is to get the salt shaker to balance on top of the dollar bill while

13:07.820 --> 13:09.320
staying suspended.

13:09.320 --> 13:13.240
So when you let go, it won't drop down to the table.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.640
Again, the answer is probably a lot easier than you think.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.360
And also, again, if you want to learn these, all you got to do is watch this again and

13:20.360 --> 13:25.520
look for the times when I touch my key point and say the answer is hiding in plain sight.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.680
Now, this here is actually what people would consider a bar bet.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.120
So if you're familiar with magic and puzzles, you probably recognize it, and it uses the

13:33.120 --> 13:37.200
exact same principles that magicians have been using all along.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.120
If you had a bit of difficulty like figuring it out, don't worry, because it's actually

13:41.120 --> 13:48.720
much easier to fool a really intelligent person than someone who maybe isn't quite as sophisticated.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.480
I got you, I got you.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
But it's really true.

13:52.480 --> 13:56.280
It's actually very difficult to fool children, and I'll explain why.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.600
For a really sophisticated person, you will almost always talk yourself out of the simple

14:00.600 --> 14:05.680
solution, even though it's the right solution, your misconception will cause you to overlook

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
the obvious.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.680
Now, this also has you call create a false set of assumptions.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.840
For example, a child will see a lady floating in the air and say, yeah, well, there are

14:14.840 --> 14:16.400
strings holding her up.

14:16.440 --> 14:20.320
A more sophisticated person would say, but see, I can't see any strings.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.000
Plus, it would take a lot of strings to support the weight of a person.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.840
They utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and they don't go beyond those

14:27.840 --> 14:29.080
parameters.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.600
And finally, they create a false set of expectations.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.520
Because a magician passed a hoop around the lady, they allow this one simple action to

14:38.520 --> 14:41.720
blind them from the truth.

14:41.720 --> 14:48.960
It's the perfect example of misconceptions, assumptions, and expectations all working

14:48.960 --> 14:55.560
against you, all stopping you from achieving your goal.

14:55.560 --> 15:03.760
But once you master these principles, you will be able to unleash the answers and realize

15:03.760 --> 15:11.680
the benefits that are always hiding in plain sight.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.680
Thank you.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.560
Thank you all so much.
