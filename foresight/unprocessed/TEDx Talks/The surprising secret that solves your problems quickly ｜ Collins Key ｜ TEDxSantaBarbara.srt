1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Imagine if you could take your brain and then turn it inside out, and then have access

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,760
to the information to be able to solve virtually any problem.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,240
It sounds pretty cool, right?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Well, here's how.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,680
We're going to take a look at problem solving in a very different way, one that can bring

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
tremendous benefit to your life.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,240
And this is a technique I was first introduced to at the age of 12 when I began studying

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,440
the art form of magic, and I've continued to develop it throughout my professional career.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,560
And now, best of all, this will be able to work for you in your personal life, professional,

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,840
or to help you create that next billion-dollar idea.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,520
And in any field, sales, marketing, show business, it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,760
Now throughout this talk, I'm going to be revealing to you three core psychological

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,200
principles that magicians have been using for more than 5,000 years.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,360
And all of these principles have one thing in common.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:17,800
They all revolve around the most important concept in magic, and that is the answer to

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,320
every problem is hiding in plain sight.

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
So let me explain.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,000
Imagine you're seated at a table and you're given a problem to solve, using nothing except

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,840
for these items, a candle, some pushpins, and some matches.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,680
Now you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to attach this candle to the wall in a way

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
that when it's lit.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,440
The wax will not drip down onto the table.

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,720
So some of you may be familiar with this, but for the rest of you, when you're trying

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,040
to figure this out, let me give you a little bit of history of where this came from.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,680
Now, this is a classic test of creative problem solving developed by the renowned psychologist

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,240
Dr. Carl Dunker, and it was first published in 1945.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,680
But although this is over three quarters of a century old, Dr. Dunker's assessment of

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,440
how our cognitive brain solves problems hasn't really changed at all.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Again, it's back to what I said earlier.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
The answer to every problem is hiding in plain sight.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,920
You see, the thing is, we look right at the answer, but we rarely see it.

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,120
And in this case, most people are so consumed with how to attach the candle to the wall

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,280
using tax, while the real answer is right in front of them.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
You guys see it?

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
The box.

36
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,760
Again, that's what I mean by the answer is hidden in plain sight.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,960
And again, the reason we don't think the box is one of the solutions is because it's not

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,040
presented to us as such.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,880
It's locked away in our brain in position simply as a container for the pins.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,520
Now, Dr. Dunker called this functional fixin'ness, the cognitive bias that limits a person to

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,360
using an object only in the way that it's traditionally intended.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,480
And the same is also true of ideas and concepts.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,760
For example, this candlestick problem was presented to you simply as a creative problem

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,600
solving test, when in fact, it also had a secondary purpose.

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,000
It contained a very important clue, one that was hiding in plain sight, which you will

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,560
need to unlock another facet of your cognitive problem solving ability.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,600
Now the thing is, you probably didn't notice because you weren't instructed to look for

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
it.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
So right now, I'm giving you a heads up.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,840
There's going to be one more clue hidden during this talk.

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
So pay close attention to every detail.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Now to make all this a lot easier to understand, I've simplified the process into three words.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,920
The first word is misconceptions.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,240
Most people think a difficult problem must have a complex solution.

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,600
The second word, assumptions.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,280
We utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and we don't think beyond

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
those parameters.

58
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,560
And the third word is expectations.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,360
The answer we expect to find often limits us and does not allow us to see what's really

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
going on.

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Now I thought it'd be kind of fun to show you what all three of these words look like

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,840
in action, and then we'll dive into each one in a little bit more detail.

63
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,560
So for this here, I've got a few bills, two, three, four, I think five dollars here.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,280
So here's the goal.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,440
The goal is to be able to take these bills, if I can do this properly, we'll actually

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,000
be able to take them on the count of three.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:48,360
We go one, two, three, like that, and let you transform into five hundred dollars.

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,520
Okay, now I have to say this, I can't promise you'll actually be able to transform money

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,800
at your fingertips by the end of this talk, but you will be able to utilize these same

70
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
principles.

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
The same principles I just used to turn one dollar bills into hundred dollar bills to

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
solve virtually any problem.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,120
All right, so let's break this whole thing down right now, starting with misconceptions.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,880
This is the exact same thing that happens with the candlestick problem.

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,360
You see, most people are so focused on how to attach the candlestick, they can't figure

76
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,920
out exactly what's going on with the box, it gets buried in their brains.

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,480
And what happens, you have to force your brain to reassess everything about the situation

78
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,800
every detail, to bring the information to the surface, and then be able to expand your

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
ability to utilize cognitive thinking.

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,880
So I've got another little, this is so fun, I can't wait to show you this, so this here

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,960
is a little thing, so guys, take a look right over here, we've got a couple cards, six cards

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,780
to be exact, each card is different, and each card has been selected for a very important

83
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,200
psychological reason.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,080
You'll find out why in just a moment, so right now, I want you to focus on just one card

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,120
and remember it.

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Keep repeating the name of your card over and over and over in your mind, you got it?

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,840
Great, I'm going to turn the cards over, start mixing them up.

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Now if I did this correctly, all of you, yes, all of you will have been influenced to choose

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,400
the exact same card.

90
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,280
And I'm going to remove your card right now.

91
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Let's see if it worked.

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:47,680
So it's pretty crazy, right, so, okay, so how did this happen?

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,000
Like I said, there is a psychological reason why these cards were selected, but it is not

94
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
so that all of you would be drawn to the same card, it's so that all of you would focus

95
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
on only one card and ignore the rest, and that's where the misconception comes in, because

96
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,760
what you don't know is that there's actually two separate sets of cards, again, the answer

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,920
was hiding in plain sight.

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,080
The reason you didn't notice is because both sets of cards are actually very similar, so

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,000
let's say for instance, in the first spread you selected the king of clubs, in the second

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,240
spread it was replaced by the king of spades, so no matter what card you chose in the first

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,040
spread, it's not going to show up in the second spread, and to top it all off, you were so

102
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,600
focused on your one card, you didn't even notice any of the other cards around it.

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,160
This is why misconception is so dangerous, and it often makes problem solving take way

104
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
longer than it really should.

105
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,040
All right, now the next idea we're going to tackle is assumptions, and more importantly,

106
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,520
false assumptions.

107
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,720
So why don't you take a look at this animation right now, and tell me, which way is the key

108
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,520
rotating?

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,880
Now some of you will assume the key is rotating clockwise, others will assume the key is rotating

110
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,720
counterclockwise, and both of those assumptions are wrong.

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,480
You see, we assume the key is moving in just one direction or the other, but I can assure

112
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
you it's not.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,520
Now if you're more of a right brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the

114
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
right.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,480
If you're more of a left brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the left, but

116
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,760
by switching your thinking from right brain to left brain, you'll be able to shift the

117
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
direction of the key.

118
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,480
Now this takes a little bit of practice, but the results are almost magical.

119
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,720
So how does this relate to hiding in plain sight?

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,640
Well in this situation, our brain thinks and assumes that there's only one of two possible

121
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
answers.

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,920
The only two it readily knows and accepts.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
The key can rotate right or the key can rotate left.

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
It's inconceivable the key can be rotating in both directions at the same time.

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,560
But you see, if we really study the image, we realize we don't have enough information

126
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,040
to determine the key's direction at all, because you see, the key is solid black.

127
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,000
There's no highlights, shadows, or any other distinguishing marks to give us the appropriate

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,500
information.

129
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,560
Now our brain fills in these missing pieces, and we assume, because our mind likes to work

130
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,640
in an orderly fashion, that what we see is the key rotating in one direction or the other.

131
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,360
It doesn't even occur to us that maybe we're missing the relevant information to make an

132
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,880
informed decision.

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,200
And we assume that what our mind tells us, based on the way that it chooses to function

134
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,920
at that moment, that our logic is correct.

135
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,240
So the correct answer to this one is simply hiding in plain sight.

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,680
Hiding on your perception, the key rotates in both directions.

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,880
Now there's still one more crucial word we need to explore, and that is expectations.

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,640
The answer we expect to find can blind us to what is actually happening, and this is

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,800
what makes problem-solving so difficult.

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,360
Now a great example of this is when I was asked to be on the TV show America's Got Talent.

141
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,920
There was just one problem.

142
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,440
At the time, the producers of the show expected magicians to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type

143
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,680
illusions, which I didn't do.

144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,840
Now the reason that America's Got Talent wanted these types of acts was because the show was

145
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,640
being taped in front of 6,000 people at Radio City Music Hall, and they wanted the show

146
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
to feel huge.

147
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,520
But I noticed that none of the magicians ever made it past the first few rounds, so I started

148
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
analyzing why.

149
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,800
I mean their acts were great in front of the 6,000 people in the audience, but to the millions

150
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,000
of people who were watching on TV at home, and then voting, there was a disconnect between

151
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
the performer.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,560
Again, I analyzed why.

153
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,080
Well television is really an intimate medium, and the best kind of magic for television

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,640
is close-up magic, because it too is intimate.

155
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
It draws the viewer in.

156
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,240
So armed with this new insight, I realized the answer was right in front of me.

157
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,040
It was literally hiding in plain sight.

158
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,480
I didn't need to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type illusions, I needed to do small, close-up,

159
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,440
flashy performances that would blow the minds of the judges and the people watching at home.

160
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,720
Now it took a bit of convincing to get the producers to agree to this whole thing.

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,880
They definitely did not see it the way that I did at that time.

162
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
But once I was able to refocus their attention back to what they already knew, which is that

163
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,920
television is intimate, therefore the magic actually be intimate as well, they said, okay,

164
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
let's do it.

165
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,880
And it was a paradigm-shifting way for magic to be done on America's Got Talent, and I

166
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
actually became the first magician to ever make it into the finals on that show.

167
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Thank you.

168
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,680
Now it all happened because I was able to shift the producer's expectations of what

169
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
they thought would work.

170
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,640
So right now, it's time for me to shift yours.

171
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,400
As I mentioned earlier, throughout this entire talk, I've given you two clues to the problems

172
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,320
I'm about to show you right now.

173
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,240
Now you may or may not have noticed them, and if you didn't, here's a little hint.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,360
If you go back and watch this again, you'll notice that every time I touch my key, say

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,040
the answer is hiding in plain sight, I would point to the clue that you will need to quickly

176
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,560
solve these next few problems.

177
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,920
Now there's a chance you probably just didn't even notice it, that you perceived the touch

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,840
against my key just in a relevant gesture.

179
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,640
You didn't expect such a simple action could contain the answer to what you perceived as

180
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,920
a much more complicated problem.

181
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,560
So here are the challenges.

182
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,920
The first one.

183
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,440
How do you drink champagne from the bottle without opening it?

184
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,160
Immediately, your mind will start thinking of all these different solutions, most of

185
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,120
which probably have to do with a complicated way of getting the cork off and getting the

186
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,240
champagne out without actually opening up the bottle.

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
Keep thinking.

188
00:12:50,880 --> 00:13:01,520
The next one here involves two glasses, a dollar bill suspended between them, and a

189
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,160
salt shaker.

190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,820
And the challenge is to get the salt shaker to balance on top of the dollar bill while

191
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,320
staying suspended.

192
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,240
So when you let go, it won't drop down to the table.

193
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,640
Again, the answer is probably a lot easier than you think.

194
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,360
And also, again, if you want to learn these, all you got to do is watch this again and

195
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,520
look for the times when I touch my key point and say the answer is hiding in plain sight.

196
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,680
Now, this here is actually what people would consider a bar bet.

197
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,120
So if you're familiar with magic and puzzles, you probably recognize it, and it uses the

198
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
exact same principles that magicians have been using all along.

199
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,120
If you had a bit of difficulty like figuring it out, don't worry, because it's actually

200
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,720
much easier to fool a really intelligent person than someone who maybe isn't quite as sophisticated.

201
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,480
I got you, I got you.

202
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
But it's really true.

203
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,280
It's actually very difficult to fool children, and I'll explain why.

204
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,600
For a really sophisticated person, you will almost always talk yourself out of the simple

205
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,680
solution, even though it's the right solution, your misconception will cause you to overlook

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
the obvious.

207
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Now, this also has you call create a false set of assumptions.

208
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,840
For example, a child will see a lady floating in the air and say, yeah, well, there are

209
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,400
strings holding her up.

210
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,320
A more sophisticated person would say, but see, I can't see any strings.

211
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
Plus, it would take a lot of strings to support the weight of a person.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,840
They utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and they don't go beyond those

213
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,080
parameters.

214
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,600
And finally, they create a false set of expectations.

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,520
Because a magician passed a hoop around the lady, they allow this one simple action to

216
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,720
blind them from the truth.

217
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,960
It's the perfect example of misconceptions, assumptions, and expectations all working

218
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,560
against you, all stopping you from achieving your goal.

219
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:03,760
But once you master these principles, you will be able to unleash the answers and realize

220
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:11,680
the benefits that are always hiding in plain sight.

221
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Thank you.

222
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,560
Thank you all so much.
