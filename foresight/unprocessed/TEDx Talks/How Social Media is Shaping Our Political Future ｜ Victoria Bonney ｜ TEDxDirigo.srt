1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Since the 2016 election, we've seen how social media has degraded our political system.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,680
From Russian bots to the president's midnight tweets, it's easy to see the harm it's doing.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,120
But if you also notice that it's made our democracy more diverse and transparent, I've

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,760
worked in government and campaigns for over a decade, and I have.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
I used to believe only a certain kind of person can run for office.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
That only one kind of experience mattered to voters.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,800
An Ivy League degree, lots of money, famous last name, being mail.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Basically, the guys on Mount Rushmore.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,880
But that was before Facebook and Instagram and Twitter allowed politicians to speak

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,360
directly to voters.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,920
Before that, they had to go through these traditional media gatekeepers, like 60 minutes

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,800
and meet the press and all the Sunday shows.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,040
And those were impossible to book unless you had connections.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,160
I grew up in New Hampshire, a state with outsized impact on national politics, because every

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,600
four years, it hosts the presidential primary.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,320
Which means, if you had presidential ambitions, you probably came to my school or my neighborhood

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
to make your case.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,040
I remember Bill Clinton's motorcade driving by my yard sale.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,120
And Bob Dole hanging out in the cafeteria, and Bill Bradley shooting hoops in the gym.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,680
And despite this front row seat to politics, it just never appealed to me.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,760
Of course, part of that was my age, but the other part was that they seemed so scripted

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,840
and unrelatable.

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,000
That changed when I was about 19, after America declared war with Iraq.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,480
I woke up one morning in my college dorm, and someone had left the TV on.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,120
And this governor from Vermont was on Meet the Press, Howard Dean.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,280
And he said, Iraq hadn't attacked us on 9-11.

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,040
Our justification for war was wrong, and my generation was going to deal with the consequences

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
of that conflict.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,680
I had never seen a politician speak so forcefully against the war.

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,240
And for the first time in my young life, I wanted to be a part of a campaign.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,160
So I called this campaign every day for weeks, until finally they said, sure, you could knock

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,240
on stranger's doors in the freezing cold for no money at all.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,640
And I was like, yes!

34
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,520
I felt like I was part of a movement.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,640
And believe it or not, in 2004, I was.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,560
Howard Dean did something that no one had done.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,960
He raised low dollar donations on the internet, which gave him the ability to run a national

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,080
campaign as an outsider.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,880
But he still had to go through those traditional media gatekeepers.

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,000
Social media wouldn't be what it is today for a very long time.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Facebook wouldn't even be available to the public for two years.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,480
And the thing is, those traditional media gatekeepers, they weren't a big fan of Howard

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,040
Dean's off-script speeches.

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,520
The Prime Minister may remember his most infamous after the Iowa caucus.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,400
It went a little something like this.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,120
We're going to South Carolina, we're going to Oregon, we're going to Washington, D.C.

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,480
to take back the White House.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,600
Yeah.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:29,960
So that so-called Dean Scream doomed his campaign.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,720
He was seen as unhinged and too angry.

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,160
Right.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,760
Because you sit here 14 years later, you may think, too angry.

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
That's Tuesday.

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
And you're right.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
Right now, our current president holds rallies almost every Tuesday where people scream in

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
unison, lock her up.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
So how did we get here?

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,600
Social media changed the game.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,400
It broke the way that politicians could communicate.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,960
No longer would canned talking points break through the clutter of Twitter.

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,240
Having poll tested, people just tuned it out.

62
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,360
When I ran for state representative in my hometown 12 years ago, I doubted that voters

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,560
wanted a woman who was working two waitressing jobs and had college loan debt to represent

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
them.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,320
However, a waitress with college loan debt might be the kind of representative who understands

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,560
why we need a living wage and student loan relief.

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
But I didn't see my experience as an asset.

68
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
And even if I had, I had no way of getting that message out.

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,280
I misread my strengths as liabilities simply because I didn't look like those guys on

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Mount Rushmore or any other politician I'd seen.

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,040
And maybe that's why I lost.

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Campaigns today are different.

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,920
Candidates are using viral videos to tell their experiences with issues ranging from homelessness,

74
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,960
teen pregnancy, debt, depression.

75
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
Voters are seeing these stories and they're feeling galvanized by stories they relate

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,840
to and they're giving money to help move those campaigns along.

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
You know, there's long been a practice in politics called opposition research.

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
It's where your opponent digs up all the dirt they can find on you.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,680
But in the age of social media, that could be useless because it turns out showing vulnerability

80
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,040
is shrewd politics.

81
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,920
Everyone likes a story and everyone has a story to tell.

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,680
These candidates will not accept that their experience is disqualifying simply because

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
no one like them has run before.

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
Look at Stacey Abrams.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
She told me to be the first African-American governor of Georgia.

86
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,400
Her opponent said, she's in debt.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
She's unqualified.

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,520
She said, yeah, like millions of Americans, I have debt, but I won't feel ashamed that

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,800
I needed a loan to get an education or to support myself.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,880
And with her response, she shut down that line of criticism and made herself more relatable.

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,160
Look at Beto O'Rourke.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,320
He's documented almost every moment of his campaign on social media and it's introduced

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,400
him to millions of Americans and helped him to raise an unprecedented $40 million in three

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
months.

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,440
Even if these campaigns are unsuccessful this time, they will have changed how campaigns

96
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,760
communicate going forward, just as Howard Dean did with fundraising in 2004.

97
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,080
But beyond campaigns, social media has made government more transparent.

98
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,440
Who would have thought our 72-year-old president would get every member of Congress to use

99
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,120
Twitter?

100
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,400
But every time he tweets, the traditional media come asking for a response.

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,080
So the need for conviction, authenticity, responsiveness, I know requirements of elected

102
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
officials.

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,920
Because if you don't respond, you're seen as totally out of touch.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,560
You're like, how does she know that?

105
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,760
Well, I'm currently a communications director for a member of Congress and you would not

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,480
want to know how many times a week we get calls about presidential tweets.

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,320
Around Memorial Day of this year, the hashtag where the children went viral.

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,120
The Trump administration had begun separating immigrant children from their families at

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
the U.S. border.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Our phones, our emails, our social media platforms were flooded by constituents who were outraged

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,760
by this inhumanity.

112
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,800
The congresswoman who I worked for was also outraged.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,520
She and I flew to Brownsville, Texas and saw the detention centers for ourselves.

114
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,240
Along the way, we documented everything, videos, tweets.

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,520
And in her capacity as an elected official, she was the eyes and ears of her constituents.

116
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,520
And when she got back to D.C., she lent a voice to their outrage by backing legislation

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,400
to address this ongoing crisis.

118
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Social media has created a dialogue that's never existed between elected officials and

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,320
those they represent.

120
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,600
It's opened the door for people who thought they could never run, and it served as a microphone

121
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,520
for those who've never had one.

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Most importantly, it's changing the face of politics, maybe.

123
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Maybe it could even change those faces on Mount Rushmore.

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Thank you.

125
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Thank you.

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Thank you.
