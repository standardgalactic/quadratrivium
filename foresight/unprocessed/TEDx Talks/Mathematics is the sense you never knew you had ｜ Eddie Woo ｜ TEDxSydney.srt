1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,340
I love mathematics.

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,880
Is exactly what to say at a party if you want to spend the next couple of hours sipping

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,520
your drink alone in the least cool corner of the room.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,400
And that's because when it comes to this subject, all the numbers, formulas, symbols

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,960
and calculations, the vast majority of us are outsiders.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,880
And that includes me.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,560
That's why today I want to share with you an outsider's perspective of mathematics.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,520
What I understand of it from someone who's always struggled with the subject, and what

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,600
I've discovered as someone who went from being an outsider to making maths my career, is

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,120
that surprisingly, we are all deep down born to be mathematicians.

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,680
But back to being an outsider, I know what you're thinking, wait a second Eddie, what

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,240
would you know?

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,120
You're a maths teacher, you went to a selective school, you wear glasses and you're Asian.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,760
Now, firstly, that's racist.

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,000
Secondly, that's wrong.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,120
When I was at school, my favourite subjects were English and history.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,920
And this caused a lot of angst for me as a teenager because my high school truly honoured

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
mathematics.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,840
Your status in the school pretty much correlated with which mathematics class you ranked in.

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,360
There were eight classes, so if you were in maths four, that made you just about average.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,920
If you were in maths one, you were like royalty.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,440
Each year, our school entered the prestigious Australian mathematics competition and would

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,680
print out a list of everyone in the school in order of our scores.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Students who received prizes and high distinctions were pinned up at the start of a long corridor,

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,080
far, far away from the dark and shameful place where my name appeared.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Maths was not really my thing.

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,560
Stories, characters, narratives.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,360
This is where I was at home.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,280
And that's why I raised my sales and set course to become an English and history teacher.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,040
But, a chance encounter at senior university altered my life forever.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
I was in line to enrol at the Faculty of Education when I started a conversation with one of its

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,920
professors.

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,720
He noticed that while my academic life had been dominated by humanities, I had actually

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,680
attempted some high level maths at school.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,840
What he saw was not that I had a problem with maths, but that I had persevered with maths.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
And he knew something I didn't, that there was a critical shortage of mathematics educators

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
in Australian schools, a shortage that remains to this day.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
So he encouraged me to change my teaching area to mathematics.

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,040
For me, becoming a teacher wasn't about my love for a particular subject.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,560
It was about having a personal impact on the lives of young people.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,320
I'd seen firsthand at school what a lasting and positive difference a great teacher can

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
make.

43
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,280
I wanted to do that for someone, and it didn't matter to me what subject I did it in.

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,200
If there was an acute need in mathematics, then it made sense for me to go there.

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,800
As I studied my degree though, I discovered that mathematics was a very different subject

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,080
to what I'd originally thought.

47
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,680
I'd made the same mistake about mathematics that I'd made earlier in my life about music.

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Like a good migrant child, I dutifully learned to play the piano when I was young.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,280
My weekends were filled with endlessly repeating scales and memorizing every note in the peace

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,640
spring and winter.

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,160
I lasted two years before my career was abruptly ended when my teacher told my parents his fingers

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
are too short.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,800
I will not teach him any more.

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,160
At seven years old, I thought of music like torture.

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,640
It was a dry, solitary, joyless exercise that I only engaged with because someone else forced

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
me to.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,920
It took me 11 years to emerge from that sad place.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,080
In year 12, I picked up a steel string acoustic guitar for the first time.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,360
I wanted to play it for church, and there was also a girl I was fairly keen on impressing.

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,600
So I convinced my brother to teach me a few chords, and slowly, but surely, my mind changed.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,440
I was engaged in a creative process.

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,760
I was making music, and I was hooked.

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,040
I started playing in a band, and I felt the delight of rhythm pulsing through my body

64
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
as we brought our sounds together.

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,480
I had been surrounded by a musical ocean my entire life, and for the first time, I realized

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,640
I could swim in it.

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,360
I went through an almost identical experience when it came to mathematics.

68
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,400
I used to believe that math was about rote learning in screwtable formulas to solve abstract

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,600
problems that didn't mean anything to me.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,240
But at university, I began to see that mathematics is immensely practical and even beautiful.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,440
That it's not just about finding answers, but also about learning to ask the right questions.

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,840
And that mathematics isn't about mindlessly crunching numbers, but rather about forming

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,920
new ways to see problems so we can solve them by combining insight with imagination.

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,200
It gradually dawned on me that mathematics is a sense.

75
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Mathematics is a sense just like sight and touch.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,600
It's a sense that allows us to perceive realities which would be otherwise intangible to us.

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,320
You know, we talk about a sense of humor and a sense of rhythm.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Mathematics is our sense for patterns, relationships, and logical connections.

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,960
It's a whole new way to see the world.

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,200
Now, I want to show you a mathematical reality that I guarantee you've seen before, but perhaps

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,560
never really perceived.

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,400
It's been hidden in plain sight your entire life.

83
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,080
This is a river delta.

84
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
It's a beautiful piece of geometry.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,760
When we hear the word geometry, most of us think of triangles and circles.

86
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,760
But geometry is the mathematics of all shapes, and this meeting of land and sea has created

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,000
shapes with an undeniable pattern.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,240
It has a mathematically recursive structure.

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,720
Every part of the river delta, with its twists and turns, is a microversion of the greater

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
whole.

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,800
So, I want you to see the mathematics in this, but that's not all.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,360
I want you to compare this river delta with this amazing tree.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,440
It's a wonder in itself, but focus with me on the similarities between this and the river.

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,240
What I want to know is why on earth should these shapes look so remarkably alike?

95
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,920
Why should they have anything in common?

96
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,600
Things get even more perplexing when you realize it's not just water systems and plants that

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
do this.

98
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,600
If you keep your eyes open, you'll see these same shapes are everywhere.

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,160
Lightning bolts disappear so quickly that we seldom have the opportunity to ponder their

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,200
geometry, but their shape is so unmistakable and so similar to what we've just seen that

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,440
one can't help but be suspicious.

102
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,440
And then there's the fact that every single person in this room is filled with these shapes,

103
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
too.

104
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,880
Every cubic centimeter of your body is packed with blood vessels that trace out this same

105
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
pattern.

106
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,720
There's a mathematical reality woven into the fabric of the universe that you share with

107
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,800
winding rivers, towering trees, and raging storms.

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,600
These shapes are examples of what we call fractals as mathematicians.

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,880
Fractals get their name from the same place as fractions and fractures.

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,240
It's a reference to the broken and shattered shapes we find around us in nature.

111
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,640
Now, once you have a sense for fractals, you really do start to see them everywhere, ahead

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,760
of broccoli, the leaves of a fern, even clouds in the sky.

113
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,600
Like the other senses, our mathematical sense can be refined with practice.

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,040
It's just like developing perfect pitch or a taste for wines.

115
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,800
You can learn to perceive the mathematics around you with time and the right guidance.

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Naturally, some people are born with sharper senses than the rest of us.

117
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,880
Others are born with impairment.

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,880
As you can see, I drew a short straw in the genetic lottery when it came to my eyesight.

119
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,120
Without my glasses, everything is a blur.

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,800
I've wrestled with this sense my entire life, but I would never dream of saying, well, seeing

121
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
has always been a struggle for me.

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,120
I guess I'm just not a seeing kind of person.

123
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:38,160
Yet, I meet people every day who feel it quite natural to say exactly that about mathematics.

124
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm convinced we close ourselves off from a huge part of the human experience if we

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,280
do this, because all human beings are wired to see patterns.

126
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,240
We live in a patterned universe, a cosmos.

127
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,120
That's what cosmos means, orderly and patterned, as opposed to chaos, which means disorderly

128
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
and random.

129
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,280
It isn't just seeing patterns that humans are so good at.

130
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,960
We love making patterns, too, and the people who do this well have a special name.

131
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:18,760
We call them artists, musicians, sculptors, painters, cinematographers.

132
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,080
They're all pattern creators.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,040
Music is once described as the joy that people feel when they are counting, but don't know

134
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,800
it.

135
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Some of the most striking examples of mathematical patterns are in Islamic art and design, and

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,480
a version to depicting humans and animals led to a rich history of intricate tile arrangements

137
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
and geometric forms.

138
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,640
The aesthetic side of mathematical patterns like these brings us back to nature itself.

139
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,360
For instance, flowers are a universal symbol of beauty.

140
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Every culture around the planet and throughout history has regarded them as objects of wonder.

141
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,880
One aspect of their beauty is that they exhibit a special kind of symmetry.

142
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Flowers grow organically from a center that expands outwards in the shape of a spiral,

143
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,760
and this creates what we call rotational symmetry.

144
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,160
You can spin a flower around and around, and it still looks basically the same.

145
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
But not all spirals are created equal.

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,800
It all depends on the angle of rotation that goes into creating the spiral.

147
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,240
For instance, if we build a spiral from an angle of 90 degrees, we get a cross that is

148
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,600
neither beautiful nor efficient.

149
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,840
Huge parts of the flower's area are wasted and don't produce seeds.

150
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,160
Using an angle of 62 degrees is better and produces a nice circular shape, like what

151
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,320
we usually associate with flowers, but it's still not great.

152
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,680
There are still large parts of the area that are a poise of resources for the flower.

153
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:11,840
However, if we use 137.5 degrees, we get this beautiful pattern.

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,840
It's astonishing, and it is exactly the kind of pattern used by that most majestic of flowers,

155
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
the sunflower.

156
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Now, 137.5 degrees might seem pretty random, but it actually emerges out of a special number

157
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
that we call the Golden Ratio.

158
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,680
The Golden Ratio is a mathematical reality that, like fractals, you can find everywhere

159
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,360
from the phalanges of your fingers to the pillars of the Parthenon, and that's why, even

160
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,440
at a party of 5,000 people, I'm proud to declare I love mathematics.
