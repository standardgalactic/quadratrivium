0	13120	Where ever you are, you're always using your senses to give you information about the world
13120	14620	around you.
14620	21200	And when you came into the auditorium today, you probably looked around, saw the stage setting,
21200	25640	you might have heard the chatter of people excitedly taking their seats, the quietening
25640	28760	hush, and then the voice of the speaker.
28760	34680	But I wonder how many of you paid attention to the smell of the auditorium.
34680	41080	And actually, we give smell very little attention of all the senses that are giving us information
41080	42080	about the world.
42080	46360	It's the one we neglect and we sometimes devalue.
46360	52320	Now that's probably because we think that we only smell when we're sniffing.
52400	56080	It's only when we're sniffing that we actually get some smell.
56080	58440	But that's not true.
58440	63160	As J.J. Gibson, the psychologist, said, we smell because we breathe.
63160	68560	We're actually always being bombarded with lots of volatile molecules.
68560	70160	And off-action is always on.
70160	72440	The processing is always going on.
72440	77320	So the question is, why are we not more aware of it?
77320	84000	Well, lots of people devalue the sense of smell, including rather famous philosophers.
84000	86240	And it's a famous party game that people play.
86240	91240	If I had to lose one of my senses, which would I willingly give up first?
91240	92240	And it's often smell.
92240	95320	So here's Immanuel Kant saying just that.
95320	100400	Which organic sense is the most ungrateful and also seems the most dispensable, the
100400	102040	sense of smell?
102040	107480	It does not pay to cultivate it or to refine it at all in order to enjoy, for there are
107480	114800	more disgusting objects than pleasant ones, especially in crowded places, like this.
114800	118600	He says, even when we come across something fragrant, the pleasure coming from the sense
118600	122320	of smell is fleeting and transient.
122320	128040	Now that's why I think a lot of people believe that smell could be easily dispensed with.
128040	132560	And a recent survey showed that many teenagers would rather lose their sense of smell than
132560	137760	give up one of their social media accounts.
137760	142000	That's how little we care about our sense of smell.
142000	145640	But that's a mistake.
145640	150720	It's a sense that we only recognize the value of when we lose it.
150720	156680	And when people lose their sense of smell, often because of head injury, a virus, taking
156680	163400	medication, respiratory infections, the sudden loss of a sense of smell comes with a change
163400	165520	in their emotional world.
165520	167800	People feel this less savor to life.
167800	169520	They often develop depression.
169520	174760	And in fact, people who lose their sense of smell are often depressed longer than those
174760	177000	who lose their sight.
177000	183640	It means that we no longer take for granted the familiar people in places around us.
183640	187160	And it's often smell that's giving us that sense of familiarity.
187160	192560	This is wonderful work done by these two sensory scientists in Dresden, Thomas Hummel and Ilona
192560	199040	Croy, who've studied the effects on our quality of life and there's a huge reduction in quality
199040	201400	of life when we lose our sense of smell.
201400	205080	And as we get older, we'll all start to lose our sense of smell.
205080	208280	Just like eyesight and hearing, it will diminish.
208280	212840	The good news is that right now you can improve your sense of smell and I'll tell you a little
212840	215120	bit about that later.
215120	221280	But that way in which smell is part of the environment and makes us feel that we're somewhere
221280	222280	familiar.
222280	227920	Again, we don't notice it until it's maybe going to be lost.
227920	234240	And the problem here is that smell is very emotionally loaded.
234240	235680	It's very emotionally loaded.
235680	242600	Smell memories, odor memories, key into some of our oldest and our most emotional memories.
242600	246640	The smell of your grandmother's kitchen, the smell of a place where you were on holiday.
246640	253160	And some of those things come back when you just get the briefest whiff of the odor again.
253160	261160	And the olfactory cortex here projects directly to centers of emotion and memory, the amygdala
261160	263240	and the entorhinal cortex.
263240	266080	Unlike the other senses, it's not gated by the thalamus.
266080	269160	It doesn't go round the brain before it gets to those emotional centers.
269160	270600	It's very direct.
270600	274560	And that's why we get a big charge, emotional charge.
274560	278800	And when people lose their sense of smell, their emotions are depressed.
278800	283720	Their emotions are not getting fed with those regular signals.
283720	285160	Here's a gallery I know very well.
285160	289960	And I want to invite you to think about museums and galleries that you like to visit.
289960	292480	They will have a characteristic smell.
292480	295760	You probably, if you think about it, know how they smell.
295760	301480	This is a Kelvin Grove art gallery and museum in Glasgow, my hometown.
301480	306040	And it recently went through a major multi-million pound refit.
306040	312000	And when it was going to be closed for four years to be refitted, the Glaswegians said,
312000	314880	almost as one, don't change the smell.
314880	316520	Don't change the smell.
316520	317520	Why?
317520	321680	Because they had been there as children, taken there by schools.
321680	326280	They had gone back as adults and recognized it and perhaps taken their own children in
326280	327280	turn.
327280	332360	And it always had that familiar smell that they knew so well, something between stone
332360	336920	and furniture polish, but was very distinctive and characteristic of this place.
336920	339560	And people didn't want to lose it.
339560	345040	And people often think that their sense of smell is probably not so important because,
345040	348240	unlike other animals, maybe we're not good at smelling.
348240	349240	Dogs are very good at smelling.
349240	350760	Rats are good at smelling.
350760	353840	But maybe we humans are not.
353840	356440	But it's not that we are poor at smelling.
356440	358440	In fact, we've got a superb sense of smell.
358440	360520	We just don't trust our nose.
360520	363240	And we don't use it because we're not on all fours.
363240	367560	The fact that we're standing on two legs and we're looking and hearing, we use those to
367560	369360	detect the environment.
369360	373200	But nothing stops us from being able to be like a dog.
373200	377960	And this is wonderful work by Noam Sobel and colleagues when he was in Berkeley, where
377960	384680	he got his undergraduates to put on blindfolds and to follow an odor trail that was chocolate
384680	385960	odor.
385960	388360	And the chocolate odor was laid out on the grass.
388360	391960	And it turns out that humans can get to the source of the chocolate.
391960	393480	They're a little slower than dogs.
393480	395760	They're not as direct.
395760	397680	But they can do it.
397680	400720	So we're underutilizing our sense of smell.
400720	403920	It's there and it can be used.
403920	410000	Then our sense of smell is important for signals that are social signals we give off to one
410000	411000	another.
411000	413920	Our body odors actually convey information.
413920	419520	And we give chemo signals that can affect our own emotions.
419520	424600	Again lovely work by the Sobel group from the Weissmann Institute shows that there are
424600	430760	chemical signals in emotional tears that reduce men's testosterone and affect their
430760	431760	libido.
431760	433880	Who knew?
433880	438200	Similarly, we can smell fear from other people.
438200	442920	Lovely work by Bettina Pauls and Denise Chen showing that we can smell and be affected
442920	446760	by the body odor of someone who's undergone fear.
446760	451400	And how they do that is they take t-shirts of people who've been skydiving and then t-shirts
451400	456480	of people who've been doing vigorous exercise and it's the skydiving t-shirts, the smell
456480	463040	of fear that we can recognize as the fearful ones and also can affect us.
463040	466320	So we're probably chemo signaling to one another.
466320	472480	Right now your near neighbors are giving off scent and of course scent occupies the space
472480	473920	between us.
473920	479300	It's there for the taking but we often don't pay attention to it.
479300	482600	We use it to recognize our nearest and dearest.
482600	486880	Just by their clothes, by t-shirts you can recognize whether this is a relative of yours
486880	491880	or not and I know you may have some relatives in mind and think I'd know him or her anywhere
492320	494280	but in general we can do this.
494280	498600	In general we can tell is this person related to me.
498600	504400	And not only that, smell is also involved in sexual selection.
504400	510520	So it turns out that you're more attracted to people whose body odor indicates that their
510520	517600	immune system is further away from yours and that if they're sent and their body odor signals
517600	523040	that they're too close to you, you wouldn't find them so attractive.
523040	528600	Somebody's major histocompatibility complex in humans called the human leukocyte antigens
528600	532780	are actually partly responsible for how they smell.
532780	538580	So your smell is due to three things, is due to your immune system, what you eat and the
538580	540600	bacteria on you.
540600	547520	So when we smell people we can, as it were, be sensitive to their attractiveness because
547520	552620	of the distance their immune system is from ours and that's going to help the chance of
552620	554920	successful reproduction.
554920	559400	So it's very interesting that somebody may be very attractive, very nice, you might have
559400	563200	known them for a long time and think oh, they'll be a lovely companion but if they don't smell
563200	567560	right there's nothing you can do.
567560	573440	And equally, equally, you can sometimes find a stranger and you just suddenly think wow,
573440	579360	they're really attractive and I was just so attracted to that person that it might be
579360	583080	love it for smell, not love it for sight.
583080	589840	So don't neglect it but are all the things I'm talking to you about things that go on
589840	590840	unconsciously?
590840	595800	Are these ways in which olfactory processing happens but it's not in consciousness?
596320	600640	And might it be that it's only every now and then and occasionally things break through
600640	604080	into consciousness that smells reach us?
604080	608600	And that might happen because smells are a little overpowering, it might be that they're
608600	613420	a little disgusting but it's not just disgusting odours that capture our attention, it can
613420	620040	also be intoxicating odours, wow, that smells incredible, this smells delicious and of course
620040	625600	we can direct our attention to bring smell into consciousness when we pay this sort of
625600	629240	attention to people.
629240	634000	And we all, we all go in for sniffing at times whether it's just to find out whether the
634000	639480	milk in the fridge is fresh and whether we should continue putting it in our tea or coffee.
639480	644400	Now of course, as I said earlier, smell can be trained unlike your eyesight and hearing,
644400	649560	you can actually improve your sense of smell and that's what leads to perfumers and wine
649560	655040	tasters and coffee tasters being better than the rest of us and in fact there are changes
655040	661280	in the brain, perfumers have more grey matter in the entorhinal cortex and sommeliers have
661280	667320	more dense grey matter in their orbital frontal cortex so there is really development you
667320	671840	can do that will make a difference, a real difference to the kind of information you
671840	674720	can extract and what you know.
674720	680760	But of course we might wonder how good is our sense of smell, other individual differences
680760	681760	that matter?
682480	689680	Well yes there are and on average women are better in their sense of smell than men on
689680	694200	average which doesn't mean there won't be men with a very good sense of smell and women
694200	696040	with a poor sense of smell.
696040	700160	But how do we know what people's sense of smell is, well we can test it.
700160	706560	We can use these sniffing sticks, a really good test devised by Thomas Hummel's group
706560	710960	in Dresden where these are pens that you smell and some of them are not as good as
710960	717960	other pens we might enjoy on occasion as teachers but these allow us to detect, these
717960	721840	allow us to detect somebody's threshold, when is there a difference between no odor
721840	728640	and an odor being noticeable, discrimination are two odors the same or different and finally
728640	735240	identification is that rose or mint or leather or tar when you smell one of these pens and
735240	740880	the funny thing is that lots of people who take this test will say to you oh I'm no good
740920	746040	at smelling I really can't do this and in fact they're very very accurate they've got
746040	753240	very high score and in the contrary sense there are people who continuously complain
753240	757960	about their awareness of odors oh I'm very bothered by smells I can smell smells and
757960	762240	I'm perturbed by them I've got very good sense of smell but when we test them they don't
762240	767840	have a good sense of smell they're either average or poor so our awareness of how good
767880	772840	our sense of smell is doesn't correlate with how accurate we are that might be a reason
772840	779840	why we neglect smell but a place where we don't neglect it and where odor really makes a
780760	786640	difference to our experience consciously is in eating but here smell doesn't get the
786640	793640	recognition it's due most of what we call tasting is due to smell so when you think
793760	800760	of what the tongue can provide it can provide salt sweet sour bitter umami savory that's
800840	807840	about it and yet you can taste strawberry mango melon peach you don't have peach receptors
808240	813920	on your tongue that's all coming from smell so people who lose their sense of smell will
813920	819120	often go to a doctor and say I can't taste anything and a good medic will put some salt
819120	824560	on their tongue or lemon juice or sugar and say can you taste that and they'll say yes
824560	830360	but that's all I can taste and now they realize how much of tasting was due to smell but we
830360	835560	confuse taste and smell a lot if I gave you vanilla pods to smell you would say smell
835560	841560	sweet the sweet's a taste not a smell and if I clipped a little bit of the vanilla pod
841560	847680	off and got you to chew it there's no sweetness in there at all it's quite bitter so what's
847680	853520	happening what's happening is the brain is going from its usual association of combining
853520	860520	vanilla aroma with things that have sucrose or sugar chocolate ice cream custard biscuits
862560	867020	and it's saying whenever I get that aroma it's usually accompanied by something sweet
867020	872640	and you transfer that quality of sweetness onto a smell even though it's not really there
872760	877720	so we have confusions but smell is playing a huge part in food and not getting a look
877720	882520	in but it's not smell as we usually think of it it's not inhaling molecules from the
882520	888360	outside it's the second source of smell which is going from the mouth to the nose up the
888360	892960	back of the nasopharynx and it's when you swallow or chew food that you pulse odors
892960	899880	up to the nose and that's when you get a big flavor hit so smell along with touch and taste
899960	906720	and temperature are all integrated into a single experience of flavor that we often call taste
906720	913920	and our mistake is not crediting smell for playing the largest part in that experience
913920	918760	but smell doesn't just combine with taste and touch it combines with other senses too
918760	923640	did you know there are odors in shampoo that make your hair feel softer this is strange
923640	931280	so smell interacts with touch interacts with taste now our sense of smell so keen when we're
931280	937000	younger we'll start to diminish as we get older by the age of 70 about quarter of the
937000	941800	population are functionally nosmic that means they don't have a sense of smell and their
941800	946160	quality of life will suffer they'll be more subject to depression they won't take pleasure
946160	951760	in their food they won't recognize the familiarity of people in places around them but we can
951760	959560	do something about that because we know from recent research that smell training or factory
959560	965240	training sniffing odors if you get four essential oils and you smell them first thing in the
965240	969960	morning and last thing at night that will preserve your sense of smell longer as you
969960	977520	age and it will also make you cognitively more alert so it turns out that smelling odors
977520	983760	smell training is better for you than Sudoku do that and you'll have a much more active
983760	990440	life now people who've never had a sense of smell often wonder what they're missing and
990440	994440	they often say well if I go into they've they were born without a sense of smell what what
994440	998780	is it I'm missing what's this invisible thing you talk about and a Spanish philosopher Marta
998780	1004720	Tafaya said maybe it's when I'm in a garden and I can see the beauty of the physical arrangement
1004720	1009640	but I don't get the odors and aromas so I don't feel as immersed so maybe you feel immersed
1009640	1014880	in a space when you're getting smells and notice that we don't notice smell because
1014880	1019800	we stop paying attention to it when it's familiar we no longer notice the smell of our own home
1019800	1024760	everybody else's home's got a smell isn't that odd but yours now well it's that you've
1024760	1030880	stopped paying attention to it but of course it's good enough that if you go home you'll
1030880	1037400	say something's changed did I leave the garbage out somebody been smoking so you would notice
1037400	1042880	so I think all faction is not absent it doesn't get switched off in the gaps instead all faction
1042880	1048520	is a constant background to our experience because it's always there we pay less attention
1048520	1054480	to it but it modulates our moods it affects our attention and awareness and it's consolidating
1054480	1060880	our memory of familiar things so many people named here have helped me in understanding
1060880	1066320	the importance of all faction and all of them would want me to tell all of you that if you
1066320	1072560	think you can live just as well without your sense of smell you need to think again thank you
