0	17720	Well, imagine a 14-year-old teenager in the largest city of Brazil, facing a modeling
17720	22200	career which is in the beginning, chasing a dream.
22200	26720	I found myself in my black bikinis and high heels, holding my modeling portfolio for the
26720	32360	very first time, and I was standing in front of this designer who had the power of choosing
32360	35720	me or not for his fashion show.
35720	40360	And let me tell you, in the modeling industry, if you're lucky, the designers will ask you
40360	44640	to walk, try and close, and return another day.
44640	50520	On the other hand, if you're unlucky, they'll coldly and maybe even rudely ask you to leave.
50520	56040	Let's just say this time I was pretty unlucky, and I felt devastated.
56040	61680	But that traumatizing moment allowed me to discover the amount of power I had in my hands.
61680	65680	Literally, in my hands.
65680	70440	As soon as I left that room, I grabbed my cell phone and I began opening up to my 500
70440	74840	followers at the time about my failure and how it ignited a flame on me to do better
74840	76960	the next time.
76960	80840	But I was most surprised with the response I had from my followers.
80840	87920	So many of them identified themselves and deeply thanked me for the words of motivation.
87920	93480	And from that moment on, I began sharing my daily experiences on social media, and I used
93480	99600	my platform to showcase my modeling work, arts, love for the environment, my hardships,
99600	106040	and most importantly, how I overcame them, but always maintaining a smile on my face.
106040	109240	And I saw my followers beginning to grow.
109240	116880	And now I'm 17 years old, and I have almost 340 followers on all my social platforms.
116880	123840	And I call it the art of connecting through vulnerability.
123840	128560	As soon as I left that room, I opened up for all my followers.
128560	134280	And by sharing the messages, and by sharing the lessons I learned while trying to become
134280	139080	the best individual I possibly can, I'm able to inspire and be inspired by so many
139080	140080	people.
140080	142360	I'm able to change someone's day.
142360	145120	I have the power to make someone smile.
145120	148720	Actually, we all do.
148720	153320	Even if it's only one person, it's worth it, because smiles multiply exponentially when
153320	156200	they're ignited by love.
156200	160160	And now, I guess you're waiting for the moment where I'm going to talk about the negative
160160	164200	aspects of social media, which, well, there are many.
164200	166480	A classic example is this one.
166480	168960	I'm sure we've all seen.
168960	173480	All our friends in the dinner table, in a party, and everybody's looking down.
173480	175000	Everybody's looking at their phones.
175000	179640	So yeah, if we do not use it with caution, we can become passive consumers of it, and
179640	182440	maybe even addicts to it.
182440	186520	But we have a tendency to focus on the negative aspects of things.
186520	191760	And if personal interrelationships are one of the key aspects in life, then social media
191760	194560	allows us to facilitate this.
194560	197200	It has allowed us to break barriers in communication.
197200	199640	I can literally send a tweet to the president.
199640	203520	I don't know if you'll answer me, but still, I have the power to do so.
203520	205240	We all have.
205240	208320	And that's what matters.
208320	213280	This device, which I'm sure we all have less than a meter away from us, allows us to communicate
213280	216320	with the entire world.
216320	220200	And social media is the present and the future of our generation.
220200	224680	We can fast from it, control the amount we use it, but there's no definite escape from
224680	227080	it.
227080	236040	And that's why, while using our social media, we should be careful and always maintain a
236040	238880	positive attitude.
238880	242360	It has caused such an impact because it's changed the way we live our lives.
242360	247000	Now, we don't need huge physical encyclopedias anymore, but we do need to be careful with
247000	248880	what we post on social media.
248880	250360	And that's scary, right?
250360	251360	Yeah.
251360	254960	It's scary to leave our comfort zones, but maybe we should.
254960	260480	And I've always heard people talking about social media as if it is this toxic environment.
260480	263560	And for a while, I ended up believing it was.
263560	272040	But as soon as I discovered that by sharing the lessons we learn, and by knowing that
272040	278280	it will only become a toxic environment, because we allow it to be, I changed my mind.
278280	282400	So I was curious to see if people actually thought it was such a toxic environment.
282400	286600	And I decided to make a survey on my Instagram account, which I would say is quite ironic.
286600	288600	And these were the answers.
288600	295600	9,050 people entered the survey, and 90% believed it is a toxic environment.
295600	302960	But what is most shocking about these results is why they thought it was such a toxic environment.
302960	307760	Most of the answers referred to this illusion we are able to create virtually.
307760	312800	We can selectively share only the positive aspects of life, while the people who are
312800	317120	viewing it, they will compare their entire life.
317120	322760	And therefore, I decided to ask them how they thought we could change the situation.
322760	324840	And there were three main answers.
324840	330960	Firstly, we should share our reality, meaning that sharing our hardships may be more powerful
330960	336160	and more impacting on people's lives than only sharing the positive things.
336200	339480	Secondly, stop comparing each other.
339480	343240	We are all unique, and that's what makes us special.
343240	347880	And thirdly, we should be more aware of what is shared on social media.
347880	351000	Every single thing we share will have an impact on someone.
351000	357360	Therefore, let's be careful and not be shared, and make sure we only share what's positive.
357360	362640	And therefore, I decided to create this formula called effects.
362640	368840	And effects measures the impacts every single post will have on the followers on social media.
370840	377120	I decided to measure how much I impacted my followers.
377120	382400	And as soon as I noticed the amount I actually impacted on their lives, I tried to merge
382400	387640	what I discovered from the survey and my personal experiences to create this formula.
388640	390600	A means aesthetic.
390600	394400	Is the aesthetic of your post visually pleasing?
394400	397320	F stands for function and purpose.
397320	398960	What is the function of your post?
398960	400040	What is the intention?
400040	402320	Is it for the good?
402320	404280	E stands for energy.
404280	408720	Does the energy your post creates is a positive one?
408720	410560	K stands for knowledge.
410560	414040	Does your post create relevant and new knowledge?
414040	416360	And S stands for sustainability.
416400	419720	Is your post encouraging sustainability?
419720	424760	This is a formula which you can use in every single post and it will work just fine.
424760	431560	So, an example is this photograph I posted on my social media.
431560	434880	Before I posted it, I checked its effects.
434880	441960	My intention was to raise awareness about plastic use and encourage people to use to run beach cleanups.
441960	445680	So, it has a pleasant overall aesthetic.
445680	449720	It is providing, it has a clear function.
449720	451920	It is providing people with good energy.
451920	453800	It will generate good energy.
453800	457200	And the knowledge is provided by the caption.
457200	460480	And obviously, it's encouraging sustainability.
460480	466680	But these are vital aspects which I consider in every single post I make on my social account.
466680	472520	But the formula is easily malleable and easily adaptable to the intention of your post.
472520	475720	This is a video I posted on my Instagram channel.
475720	484000	And it has as an intention to help students, just like me, to organize their mind before studying.
484000	489600	And this time, the knowledge is much more important than the sustainability aspect.
489600	496960	Therefore, I simply cut sustainability out and introduce another case as a formula.
497000	505440	And this is a form of joining our digital life and our real life and making them run side by side.
505440	513280	Every single time this formula is applied, your post will necessarily provide good energy and positive energy.
513280	519680	And therefore, this will boost people's lives when they're offline, when they're off the platform.
519720	525000	And while I came to the conclusion that while I cannot control the behavior of others,
525000	527120	I can control my own.
527120	529560	And I'm far from perfect, don't get me wrong.
529560	535360	But still, I try to use my space inside this platform for good.
535360	542040	And social media has allowed me to become not only a fashion model, but a role model for so many people.
542040	544000	And I invite you all to do the same.
544000	549440	I invite you all to try applying the effects formula on your next five posts on social media.
549440	552000	And simply observe its effects.
554560	557280	We have a very powerful tool on our hands.
557280	559720	Let's use it for the good.
559720	564720	Let's enjoy the right of life while trying to become the best individual we possibly can.
564720	569280	And helping others, by the way, let's help others to expand.
569280	570280	Thank you.
