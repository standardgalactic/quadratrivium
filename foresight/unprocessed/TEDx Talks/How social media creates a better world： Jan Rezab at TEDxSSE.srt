00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,360
I come from a country where there was communism before I was born, and actually when I was

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
born.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,160
And my parents didn't have the same options as I do.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,960
They didn't have the same options to go out and start a business.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,080
They didn't have the same options of having a transparent government, of being able to

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,720
go to the government and ask for something.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,880
In fact, my parents didn't join the Communist Party, even though they were college educated,

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,040
and they didn't have the same benefits, even though, you know, kind of now everybody does.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,200
And I feel lucky about that.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
I feel lucky that we have a chance to have equal opportunity.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,640
And I think, you know, how I think of social media, the business I'm in, is that it gives

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,200
us more equal opportunity in what we do, and that it enhances the way we think about things.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:16,720
So if I define social media first for you, so for me, social media isn't about Facebook,

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,080
isn't about Twitter, isn't about all these platforms together.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,720
Social media for me is the people on those platforms.

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,160
It's you, you, everyone.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,400
So to think about social media, you can think about it as the platforms, but it's the people.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,840
When we're thinking about working with governments, when we're thinking about working with companies,

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,200
the way we often feel is that we're the little guys, and there are big companies, big institutions,

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,960
that you have to be working with.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,040
But what we don't realize as people is that we have a lot more power.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,520
And the last few years have shown us the examples of that power, not the full extent of it,

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,040
but the first examples of that power.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,600
So we see this from Egypt, from Tahrir Square, a couple of years ago in the Arab Spring.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
That was just the beginning.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,240
We see this in Turkey.

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Turkey banned Twitter.

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,360
Then they banned YouTube.

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,680
The U.S. called it the modern-day book burning.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
And I believe that's exactly what it was.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,960
It was a political move.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,880
It got quickly ousted by the Supreme Court, who says this is not constitutional.

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,760
This is against freedom of speech, which is great, and that's what they did just two days ago.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
Thank God.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,640
But during the ban, people totally defied it.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,360
In the first day of the ban, Twitter and Turkey sent more tweets than ever before historically.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,320
And they kept finding new and new ways after the government kept blocking them and blocking them and blocking them.

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,760
They kept finding new ways to get on Twitter, even though they didn't really have to.

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,880
They could have talked to each other on Facebook.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,760
It was for the sake of doing it, of being able to tweet when it's banned by the government,

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,440
because it was the wrong thing to do.

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,880
And then there are right examples, like the White House.

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,960
The White House puts up a petition where everybody that gets over 100,000 votes now, it was actually lower,

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,800
but can come in and get a response from the White House.

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Now, of course, there are silly things like deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card.

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,120
There are more serious matters, like, you know, we would like to build a death star.

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,440
And they respond to that, that it's not in their budget, unfortunately.

49
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,440
But they would love to, and they've got a lot of more exciting projects.

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,560
But there's no budget for the death star.

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,440
No, but really, there are amazing projects, actually.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,680
There were, through this platform, there was Stop SOPA through this platform,

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,600
was that had every time it had over 100,000 petition votes.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,120
And that's great. That's something that really helps open up the government, open up the businesses.

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,760
And have you understand that, okay, I'm living in a world where the government listens.

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
Now, I don't have 100,000 votes yet, but there are easier ways through social media to get them today.

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,600
So I consider this platform a social platform.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,640
And one thing to visualize, I mean, politicians today, they really feel like they're in power,

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,960
but it's a democracy that we vote these guys into their roles.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,920
And unless they really listen to what we're saying, and unless they do what we kind of want,

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,400
we won't vote them there again.

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,320
And the better off, I mean, we have a chance to be social about it, discuss opinions,

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
change facts, exchange information.

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,800
And that information, I mean, I've heard so many times,

65
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,440
like what this politician did, what this politician did.

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,200
Very soon, you'll be able to monitor each politician by what he said on social media,

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,640
in the media, what he did, what he voted for, for so perfectly,

68
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,200
that they will not be able to hide against their votes anymore.

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,880
And this is, of course, applies to governments, this applies to politicians,

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,160
this applies to institution, as well as companies in the market.

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,120
So there was a tweet that, it was a Twitter hack of the Associated Press,

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,640
and the Associated Press sent out this tweet to explosions in the White House,

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,840
and Barack Obama is injured.

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,200
The market immediately responded, this tweet costs over $100 billion.

75
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,760
That's about a billion per character, just if you're counting it.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,920
And the market quickly recovered, but it could have been 10 billion higher during that day,

77
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
if you look at the numbers.

78
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,240
You kind of see that the market could have been $510 billion higher that day.

79
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,840
So it only cost the market $510 billion, still a pretty good hack.

80
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,480
But that only shows you how powerful social media is.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,640
And maybe eventually, without social media, we'd come to the same conclusion.

82
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,440
But social media works as an amplifier.

83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,600
We get there faster, we get there easier, and it works perfectly for that.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,840
Another great example is Starbucks.

85
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,320
Starbucks in the UK doesn't pay corporate tax in the UK.

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,120
They funnel their money through different procedures that I don't understand, but they do that.

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
And the UK was very, very upset with them.

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,760
They're a bunch of protests, social media updates, kind of people talking about social,

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,440
the damage was done to them, to their identity, to their brand.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,360
And that kind of drives ROI down for that brand.

91
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,640
I mean, PR-wise, it's a disaster.

92
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,960
Another case is British Airways.

93
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,840
They have quite bad customer service online and through social media.

94
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,080
I mean, try writing them.

95
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,640
There was even this guy that wrote them, says, guys, I really need your help.

96
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
I lost my luggage.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm gonna be in Portugal for the next two days.

98
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
They responded in three.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,760
So this guy obviously didn't need any more help.

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,960
Another one and an example of that escalating is somebody said,

101
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,440
don't fly British Airways.

102
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
This customer was in no way motivated.

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,120
It wasn't any motivation in particular.

104
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Their customer service is horrendous.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,320
That would be a normal, regular tweet.

106
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,400
Every company gets a million of them.

107
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,320
The difference between this and

108
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,960
all the other tweets that they've been getting is that this person paid for

109
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,640
promoting it.

110
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,320
He paid a couple thousand dollars to promote this tweet to a lot of people.

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,240
They now call that complain-vertising.

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,240
Power of the individual.

113
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,720
Amplify, this guy had 100 followers or something like that, right?

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,520
I mean, 100 followers amplified through paid media.

115
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
They're retweets.

116
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Then the media attention and then every piece of media in the world was

117
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,320
reporting from BBC to Financial Times, promoted tweet to British Airways,

118
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,480
complaining about customer service.

119
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,600
PR campaign worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,920
That is the power of one individual, of one tweet.

121
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,280
And that's quite powerful.

122
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Now, if we remember the world without social media,

123
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,120
I mean, we imagine it today, we feel like, okay, what was it like?

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,600
But really, if you think about it, world without having a phone being connected

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,800
to a network being able to take a picture, that's what really makes a difference.

126
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,760
In Tunisia, there was a revolution during the Arab Spring, and

127
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,120
they successfully took down the government.

128
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,000
But before that, two years before the burning of this guy that burned himself.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,960
I mean, there was another kind of spark, and it was much stronger.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
But at the time, it didn't stick.

131
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,120
The people didn't go out to the streets.

132
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,840
And it was for a couple of reasons.

133
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,480
But primarily, Facebook penetration at the time was at 50,000.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,880
There was no way to spread the word for the people.

135
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
They didn't have enough phones connected with data so

136
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,600
they could spread the word between each other.

137
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,080
So there was a problem.

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,880
But two years later, with Facebook being at the millions of users,

139
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
with social media being connected, with people being connected on their phones,

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,720
they suddenly shed it out to the world and the problem was gone.

141
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
Because people with their phones, they're connected.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Ten years ago, this was not the case.

143
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,920
And in 2005, we all spoke about citizen journalism.

144
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,240
It's gonna be about citizen journalism, mobile citizen journalism.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,280
People taking pictures, reporting crime, reporting it to the media.

146
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,320
Citizen journalism is social media today.

147
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
It just got renamed.

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,800
And we don't call it citizen journalism anymore.

149
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,080
And coming back to the power of the individual.

150
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,600
The individuals today have more power than they ever, ever had before.

151
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,600
They have power to talk and change companies, to change governments,

152
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
to change institutions.

153
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
And I encourage every one of you to think about how you can influence

154
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
the world around you.

155
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,920
Because you can influence it more than you ever could for

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,560
the last several generations.

157
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,680
You have the power of social media, the power of amplifying those thoughts,

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,720
amplifying those actions.

159
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,320
So today, you're standing against one big company and

160
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,880
they did something very wrong, you're not alone.

161
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,120
You have a lot of company that helps you, and that's a good thing.

162
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,880
And when I look at companies, and when I look at companies and

163
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,440
the way they do things, these are the values that they should be having.

164
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,520
They don't all have those values.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,400
I mean, I myself, I have a company of running it for seven years now.

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,480
And before that, I've had it for six years.

167
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,920
I had a company that I ran for seven years, and it was a mobile games company.

168
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,720
And that didn't go so well.

169
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,080
It bankrupted for me, and that was a very difficult moment.

170
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,120
And the way I chose to deal with that ending was I chose to keep it to myself,

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
work it through, and try to find a solution on my own.

172
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
I didn't communicate it to anyone, must just to my closest.

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,280
And I kept it in, all internal, completely internalized.

174
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,440
At the other hand, there's another startup now that had gone bankrupt.

175
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,360
And they're tweeting about it.

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
They're blogging about it.

177
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,280
They're publishing their PNL.

178
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,440
And they're saying, this is what we still think is valuable about our business.

179
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,080
This is why we did it, and this is why we think it's valuable.

180
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,320
And they're actually managing through the process very well.

181
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Investors are very happy with the process.

182
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
But I didn't do it that way.

183
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,240
And of course, I didn't have the options of social media,

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,760
of being able to put it on a platform.

185
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
I'd have to program that blog, figure it out.

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,000
By the time I'd be done, I'd already be finished.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So, we didn't really have those options long time ago.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I believe in the next 10 years of social and in social media,

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
is that individuals' voice will be heard so much more.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
U.S. people, you have new powers that you never thought you could have before.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
My parents, they look at this, they're like, whoa, what's going on?

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They don't understand this.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But at the end of the day, they will be users of this one way or the other.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They will go and vaguely comment on your Facebook updates, at least, if nothing else.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And social media, it's about people being connected.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Social media in the next 10 years will help solve bigger problems.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Today, we share things in social media that are perhaps not the most important.

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Of course, it's important for us to share how we feel.

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is a great picture.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I felt nervous about that.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But I think social media will be used for bigger and bigger causes

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
to help create a united mind of people to change something,

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to help finally change the world and create a better place.

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And institutions and companies, as a result of that,

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
institutions and companies will have to be a lot more flexible than we are today.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We have the power of choice.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And this is the most beautiful thing in social media.

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What I'll conclude with is that when I look at the most retweeted tweet of all times,

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is an Oscars selfie with a bunch of celebrities.

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now, don't get me wrong, they're gorgeous celebrities.

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But at the same time, it lacks vision.

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It has over 3 million retweets.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yet at the same time, why don't we retweet something stronger?

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Something that will help change the world.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We need it, and not a selfie, hopefully.

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We need a picture, a message, an action that will help us change the world,

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
whether it's a problem of health, of hunger, of specific issues that we want to solve and address.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We want to raise money on Kickstarter.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We want to raise a lot of money through charity.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's exactly what social media is for, and that's what it's great.

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And that's what everybody should be able to use it for.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Thank you very much.
