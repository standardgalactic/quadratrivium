1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,120
There's something oddly reassuring about how bad most of us are at predicting the future.

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,200
25 years ago, I was an innocent kid exploring a relatively new internet through an old dial-up

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,760
modem. For me, at least, all these connections were pure excitement and possibility. I was

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,080
blissfully unaware of the vast changes and controversies they'd bring. Looking at my own

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,520
ten-month-old today, I realized that about the only thing I can predict is that he'll consider

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
dial-up modems, and probably me too, to be about as relevant as an ancient Greek chariot.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
But for just a moment here, I want to try to see the world through the eyes of someone else who

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,400
unlike me, was deeply worried about the effects of new technology. This someone was a keen observer

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,320
of how technology shapes the world around us. They saw people using it to gain personal and

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,240
political power in ways that weren't always truthful. They noticed us being more obstinate

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,600
than ever, just clean to our own opinions, not even considering the other side. And they were

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,720
keenly aware that ideas are now being spread at an ever more blistering pace. Because of all this,

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
the person I have in mind was deeply worried about the effects on our ability to have a real

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,600
conversation with each other. Now you might be thinking, okay, okay, we've heard these concerns

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,560
before. But what you might not know is that they've been around for a bit longer than you might

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,880
expect. This person wasn't talking about Twitter or Facebook. They weren't a pioneering computer

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,080
scientist or cognitive psychologist. It was the philosopher Plato. And what he was worried about

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:09,200
over 2,500 years ago was this new technology of writing. Now, as a philosopher myself,

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm very grateful that Plato wrote down his concerns about writing. Otherwise, we wouldn't

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
have access to them today. And I should say, well, Plato's solution is going to be about

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,080
encouraging conversation. If you ever need to end the conversation, just try announcing I'm a

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,040
philosopher. I found that works pretty well. But Plato really is fascinating, not just for the

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,200
surprising relevance of what he has to say, but for the creative way that he says it. So today,

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,400
I'd like to walk through three of Plato's stories with you that really highlight the challenges

25
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,280
that new technology brings. Its tendency to trade in reasoning for convenience, its dependence on

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,440
just a single viewpoint, and its emphasis on speed. Let's start with speed. This is a familiar aspect

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,960
of our world today. Everything needs to be available in an instant and broadcast in real time.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,120
But Plato thought that speed has its drawbacks, especially when it comes to something like writing.

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,520
Think of, say, just reading a written essay as opposed to having a conversation. When reading,

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,640
it's easy just to skim through and think you're done. The back and forth of conversation tends

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,200
to take a little more time, but it can really also lead to deeper engagement. Plato uses a really

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,400
neat image to drive this point home. He likens the way that we approach writing to gardens of Adonis.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,800
These were part of a yearly ritual that the Greeks used to commemorate the famed lover of

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Aphrodite who had an all too short life. What they would do is they would plant seeds in these shallow

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,560
pot shards and they'd force them to sprout in just a few days. The result was this beautiful bed of

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,480
lush green leaves. But soon those plants would wither from their shallow roots, so the Greeks

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,920
would just take them down to the coast and ritually cast them into the waves.

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
Now Plato isn't saying that these little gardens are entirely useless. In a way,

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
the whole point is that they're temporary, beautiful one moment and then gone the next.

40
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,360
But make no mistake, they're not designed for nor will they provide long lasting sustenance.

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
I have to say, I can't help but imagine how odd it must have been to watch people

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,440
rushing these shallow little gardens just to toss them into the sea. But at the same time,

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,880
I can't help but wonder if Plato could watch us today posting to social media, would he see it

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,280
any differently? If he was worried about the speed of writing, what does that tell us about our

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,520
on-demand culture today? Now his concerns about speed have to do partly with the second point,

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,600
about the difficulty of truly engaging with other perspectives. Plato talks about how

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,360
speech, once written down, simply wanders around saying the same things over and over again.

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,280
If you already agree, you aren't likely to learn anything new. If you don't, it's easiest just to

49
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:24,080
ignore it. This brings us to a second story that he uses about the Egyptian gods meeting to discuss

50
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,800
the merits of writing. The inventor of writing is of course very excited. He presents his wares

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,560
to the king of the gods and tells him, I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,360
But the god king isn't convinced. He says that writing will actually instill forgetfulness

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
and give people the false sense of thinking that they know when they actually don't.

54
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,640
Just think for example of how few phone numbers we can recite today

55
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,600
now that they're all stored in our smartphones. Now it's easy to think here, okay, got it. Obviously

56
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
inventor of writing thinks it's good, but the wise god king shows that it's bad. But more is

57
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
going on here than meets the eye. According to Plato, the king had good things to say about writing

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,440
too. Plato just doesn't tell us what they were. And he's presenting us with criticism after criticism

59
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,040
of writing in the form of a written dialogue. Surely he doesn't think writing is all bad.

60
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,480
Now this brings us to one more point that Plato actually found this really creative way

61
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:42,960
to create writings while still preserving the benefits of conversation. We call them dialogues

62
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,400
because they depict a thorough discussion that genuinely takes multiple perspectives seriously.

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,800
Instead of simply announcing these benefits to us, Plato shows us through the way that he crafts

64
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,120
these written dialogues. If he could do it for writing, in writing, despite all of his concerns

65
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,760
about writing, how might that translate to our context today? How can we preserve the benefits

66
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:15,120
of dialogue while still engaging with modern technology? Okay, so Plato has one more story

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,120
for us. This one has to do about the importance of reason. Plato tells us that the most valuable

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
thing you could get your hands on in ancient times was one of these mythical statues of

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Daedalus. They were so skillfully made, so lifelike in their design, that they actually moved.

70
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,760
But even if you were able to get your hands on one and say to get on home, the minute you weren't

71
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,840
looking, that statue might just move on over to some other person's yard. Turns out they're not

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,040
going to retain their value unless you have some way of tying them down. Plato stresses that we

73
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:00,240
need to tie down our ideas too with the underlying reason that motivates them. Otherwise, they too

74
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,440
will get us get away from us, just like one of those elusive statues.

75
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,560
Now, part of Plato's concern here is that sometimes we have this false impression,

76
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,080
say just liking a quote will get us out of the hard work of truly understanding it.

77
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,120
There's this seductive idea that even philosophy culminates with some pity statement, something

78
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,440
just so true, it exudes wisdom. But even the people we like to quote most, they have a whole body

79
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:42,400
of work to back up what they're saying. So similarly, modern shortcuts like hashtags,

80
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,960
they're great at collecting information, giving a quick read on where someone stands,

81
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,520
but they're not so great at communicating the underlying motivation. We have to ask ourselves

82
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,760
for any given claim, what's going to tie down that idea? Why should we support it? What's the

83
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,520
evidence? Now, I want to take just one more moment here to appreciate how uncanny it is

84
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,280
that these concerns from well over 2,000 years ago can still speak to us today.

85
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,080
That's not to say that all of our problems have been solved. For all their inventions,

86
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,280
the Greeks never even figured out how to make clothing with pockets.

87
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,680
But it is to say we need to think hard about how technology impacts our most deeply held values.

88
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,800
We need to continue that dialogue that Plato started for us so many years ago.

89
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,360
When we do, we should remember that technology is a tool for crafting our own intricate statues

90
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
and that they retain their value when grounded in what we really care about.

91
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,640
We need to work on including different perspectives just like that Egyptian god king.

92
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Rather than meaning that we've got something wrong, exploring both sides is more often a sign

93
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,480
that we're really doing something right. And not everything can serve its purpose in an instant,

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,000
like those beautiful gardens of Adonis, but changes that come about more slowly

95
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,600
often bear the greatest fruit. New technologies are inevitable, so it would be pointless to

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,640
insist on richly casting them into the sea. But Plato's challenge is for us to keep finding new

97
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,000
ways to enable and encourage this old technology of conversation, ways that retain those core values

98
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:47,120
of reason, of patience, and of open-mindedness. Thank you.
