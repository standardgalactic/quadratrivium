00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The Weir is about to start time for another round of applause.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.380
Please welcome Ms.

00:13.380 --> 00:27.180
Pala and Ms.

00:27.180 --> 00:47.420
Just a moment, I'm posting this.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.780
A few years ago, I attended a social media event.

00:51.780 --> 00:58.340
This is an event where people gather and share their ideas with an audience.

00:58.340 --> 01:05.980
Many of these influencers had spent years creating videos and sharing their stories

01:05.980 --> 01:14.460
and encouraging others to build authentic relationships.

01:14.540 --> 01:21.940
I watched with enthusiasm each one walk into the conference and write on by,

01:21.940 --> 01:28.820
headed for the most Instagram worthy location in the conference hall.

01:28.820 --> 01:35.940
With each attempt to introduce myself, I was ignored or brushed off.

01:35.940 --> 01:45.740
You see, they chose to connect online rather than to connect with a human being.

01:45.740 --> 01:55.580
They chose social media over the potential of a real relationship right in front of them.

01:55.580 --> 02:03.820
That was the moment, the moment that changed my perspective.

02:03.860 --> 02:09.860
Social media is making us unsocial.

02:09.860 --> 02:15.300
Social media is killing relationships.

02:15.300 --> 02:23.900
Social media is replacing experiences.

02:23.900 --> 02:28.220
Look familiar?

02:28.220 --> 02:33.140
Or this?

02:33.140 --> 02:42.220
How about this?

02:42.220 --> 02:46.820
Social media has changed the way we live our lives,

02:46.820 --> 02:52.260
from the way we get news to the way we interact with loved ones.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.300
It's everywhere.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.460
It's powerful.

02:57.460 --> 03:02.020
And it's growing.

03:02.020 --> 03:10.780
According to the Global Web Index, we spend on average two hours a day on social media,

03:10.780 --> 03:16.660
and it's increasing at a rate of two minutes per day.

03:16.660 --> 03:27.420
Over the course of a lifetime, that's five years and four months on social media.

03:27.420 --> 03:35.980
That's over 40,000 hours.

03:35.980 --> 03:44.580
The experience of art and history are being replaced with a digital representation of those things.

03:44.580 --> 03:49.420
Rather than visit a museum or art gallery,

03:49.420 --> 03:57.380
we take to Instagram to view the works of artists like Banksy.

03:57.380 --> 04:02.340
Social media is impacting social issues too.

04:02.340 --> 04:08.660
Have you heard the term slacktivism?

04:08.660 --> 04:14.340
While social media activism brings awareness to societal issues,

04:14.340 --> 04:20.380
the awareness isn't translating into real change.

04:20.380 --> 04:24.060
It's a shift to devices.

04:24.060 --> 04:34.780
People are pressing a like button rather than actively engaging with campaigns in real life.

04:34.780 --> 04:43.460
We care more about how other people perceive our adventures than actually having them.

04:43.460 --> 04:51.100
The urge to check social media is stronger than the urge for sex.

04:51.140 --> 04:57.500
Yet both are driven by a need to connect.

04:57.500 --> 05:05.340
Many relationships have been jeopardized or ruined because of micro-cheating,

05:05.340 --> 05:11.860
pushing the boundaries of fidelity through social media.

05:11.860 --> 05:17.820
We know that the world is changing with every passing moment

05:17.820 --> 05:25.140
because of technological inventions and rapid adoption of the technology.

05:25.140 --> 05:30.540
But technology is not the problem.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.140
We are.

05:33.140 --> 05:39.460
And the reality is we are slowly becoming addicted.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.380
How do I know?

05:41.380 --> 05:44.220
I'm on the inside.

05:44.220 --> 05:47.660
For the past 20 years, I've been in marketing.

05:47.660 --> 05:55.580
And as long as there are advertisers looking to capture your attention and get you hooked,

05:55.580 --> 05:59.060
there will be new social platforms.

05:59.060 --> 06:03.460
There will be new social channels.

06:03.460 --> 06:10.220
For the last few years, I had been creating content on social, specifically on LinkedIn.

06:10.220 --> 06:14.340
And I was named a top voice on the platform.

06:14.340 --> 06:21.980
But what I realized was the more I was creating online and building relationships online,

06:21.980 --> 06:28.260
I was losing touch with people in real life.

06:28.260 --> 06:36.060
After food and shelter, our need to belong and feel positively connected

06:36.060 --> 06:49.580
is arguably the number one predictor of health, happiness, well-being, and even longevity.

06:49.580 --> 06:55.740
Human connection brings complex value to our lives.

06:55.740 --> 07:03.900
It's the interactive exchange that defines us.

07:03.900 --> 07:10.180
We need to use social media as a support to building real relationships,

07:10.180 --> 07:13.700
not a catalyst to losing them.

07:13.700 --> 07:23.700
Remember, some of the most brilliant minds in the world, think Silicon Valley tech,

07:23.700 --> 07:31.660
have dedicated their lives to making social media more addictive.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.700
We need to get aggressive to get our focus back.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.300
We can do it.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.220
Here's how.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.860
Turn notifications off.

07:41.860 --> 07:47.340
Delete social media apps from your phone.

07:47.340 --> 07:55.980
Educate others and help our children understand how to manage their usage.

07:55.980 --> 08:04.660
Use social media to build relationships and take it offline.

08:04.660 --> 08:20.260
We already know the risks, anxiety, isolation, depression, cyberbullying, low self-worth.

08:20.260 --> 08:24.500
We can do it.

08:24.540 --> 08:30.180
Let's disconnect to connect.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.180
Thank you.
