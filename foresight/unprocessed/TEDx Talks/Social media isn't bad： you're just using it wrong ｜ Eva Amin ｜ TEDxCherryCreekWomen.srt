00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,100
The other day, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I come across this post that says social

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:34,660
media is bad. So I think to myself, I'm looking at a post about how posts are bad. But that's

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,880
not even the best part. The best part is I click on it and the caption says save this

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,700
for later as a reminder. So basically, they want me to get off social media, but to get

5
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:56,020
back on so I can reread why I shouldn't have been on in the first place. This got me thinking.

6
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,500
And I realize that it's so often taught that social media is this horrible thing. In fact,

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,300
at the beginning of each school year, most high school students are sat in a safety

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,860
assembly. Part of the safety assembly talks about safety on social media. They tell you

9
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,220
how you're going to get catfished or kidnapped, but they stop there. They don't tell you

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,460
how you can use it in a safe and beneficial way, and unfortunately, those are very real

11
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,780
things and do happen way more than it should. But the way to stop that is to teach teens

12
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,820
how to use it in a beneficial way. You know, I think a lot of people don't realize the

13
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,860
true impact that social media has on us. In fact, I didn't realize the true impact until

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,620
one day my English teacher, she said, class, what is the purpose of children's books?

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,980
So I thought to myself, okay, well, there's multiple different reasons for children's

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,620
books. But one of the biggest ones is to teach children lessons without them realizing that

17
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,700
they're learning. Looking back, I learned not to take food from strangers because snow

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,300
white ate a poisonous apple. See, back then it was children's books. But it's no longer

19
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,940
just children's books. It's all the content we're choosing to surround ourselves with.

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,420
TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all of it. I'm currently reading this book. It's called

21
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,780
The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down. And the author of this book, they say,

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,780
the world is neither good or bad. It's just there. And the way we perceive the world is

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,660
based on our individual experiences. So let's think about that from a social media standpoint.

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,100
There are seven billion people in this world. And in our day to day lives, we don't even

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,660
interact with 1%. In fact, it's far less than 1%. So the way we learn about life outside

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,940
of just our little bubble is through things like traveling. But unfortunately, we can't

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,540
always be traveling. So another primary way we do this is through social media. Therefore,

28
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,980
if your social media is filled with drama, toxicity, and things that make you feel bad

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,380
about yourself, naturally, you're going to view the world as more of a negative place.

30
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,060
Whereas if your social media is filled with positivity and things that align with your

31
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,380
goals, you're going to view the world as more of a positive place. See, the problem isn't

32
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,020
social media. The problem is how you're choosing to use it. I hear a lot of stories about people

33
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,540
having these bad experiences on social media. And I've had social media for a while now.

34
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,300
And honestly, the only scary thing on my Instagram is when I look at my archived posts and see

35
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,380
what I used to post in middle school. But other than that, it's been a pretty positive

36
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,420
experience. So what's my secret? How do I keep my social media this positive, uplifting place?

37
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Well, there's four groups of people you should be following. The first, friends, family, and

38
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,820
positive acquaintances. Now, I truly mean positive because so often I'll hear someone say, I don't

39
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,140
like this person. They're so mean to me. But then you'll go on their Instagram and guess who

40
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,580
they're following. That person who's so mean to them. Why surround yourself with that toxic energy

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:22,300
if you have the choice to simply not? The second group, people who align with your goals. Now, for

42
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,380
me, my future goal is to create my own business one day. So the types of people I follow are people

43
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,980
who have started their own businesses, people who give financial advice or investing advice, or

44
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,300
just business in general. Because the easiest way to achieve your goal is to ask someone or watch

45
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,380
someone who's already done it. The third group, people who inspire you. Now, this is different

46
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,460
from people who align with your goals. I was a gymnast off and on for about 12 years. I wanted to go

47
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,940
to the Olympics. I truly thought I was going to go to the Olympics. In fact, I used to write Dear

48
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,300
Future Me's to myself and I was reading them a few weeks ago and all of them started with Dear

49
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,820
Future Me. Are you in the Olympics yet? Unfortunately not. But my point is, at the time, going to the

50
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,700
Olympics was my goal. So the types of people I would follow were people like Simone Biles, Ali

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,620
Razeman, Gabby Douglas. However, going to the Olympics is no longer my goal. Yet I never unfollowed

52
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:27,740
those people because they still inspire me. The fourth group, entertainers. Now, of course,

53
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,500
social media is an entertainment platform and I'm not telling you not to use it as one. I'm just

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,460
telling you to be mindful of the types of entertainment you're consuming. A great example of

55
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,820
positive entertainment are your favorite artists. People like Shawn Mendes, Selena Gomez, Taylor

56
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,020
Swift, whoever it may be, as long as what they're posting makes you feel good about yourself. See,

57
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,340
when you start to categorize your following into these four groups, not only are you going to be

58
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,780
happier, but opportunities are also going to start to come to you. Back in May, I came across this

59
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,900
ad on Instagram. It was for this program called BetaCamp. BetaCamp advertised themselves to be

60
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,380
the six-week program where they challenged teens to create a revenue-generating startup with the

61
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,900
help of business mentors. Now, this sounded perfect for me. But of course, at first, I was skeptical

62
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,300
as you should be with ads you see on social media because a lot of the time they're going to be

63
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,020
fake. But I was safe about it. I looked at their Instagram, I looked at their website, and turns

64
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,140
out it was real. And I successfully created a revenue-generating startup in just six weeks. Now,

65
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:41,300
was it good? Absolutely not. Did I make money? Yes, so I'd call that a win. But through that program,

66
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,700
I was then offered a fellowship to continue this journey throughout the school year. Through that

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,380
fellowship, I was able to take two additional classes, one about creating a platform, and one

68
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:59,180
about investing. So my point is, just because my social media reflects my goals, I was given

69
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,060
opportunities that align with those goals. Now, how does this work? Well, TikTok, Facebook,

70
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,580
Instagram, whatever it may be, all these social medias love making money. How do they do this? They

71
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,260
put things on your feed based on what you've interacted with in the past or based on the people

72
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:23,860
you follow. So follow positive people, follow people who align with your goals. Now, before you all

73
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,820
leave today, I have two asks. My first ask is to start being mindful of the types of content you're

74
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,780
consuming. Start welcoming the positivity and blocking out the negativity. And my second ask,

75
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,740
stop participating and spreading this idea that social media is this horrible thing. Instead,

76
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,220
educate on the dangers while encouraging people to use it in a positive way. Now, I've said a lot

77
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,460
today. So to sum up everything I've said, I leave you all with one of my favorite quotes. Goes a

78
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:04,100
little like this. Nothing of me is original. I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known. Now,

79
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,620
that's a beautiful quote, but I'd like to add on to it. I'd like to say, nothing of me is original.

80
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,620
I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known and the content I've surrounded myself with. Thank

81
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,940
you.
