1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Where ever you are, you're always using your senses to give you information about the world

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,620
around you.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,200
And when you came into the auditorium today, you probably looked around, saw the stage setting,

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,640
you might have heard the chatter of people excitedly taking their seats, the quietening

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,760
hush, and then the voice of the speaker.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,680
But I wonder how many of you paid attention to the smell of the auditorium.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,080
And actually, we give smell very little attention of all the senses that are giving us information

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
about the world.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,360
It's the one we neglect and we sometimes devalue.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Now that's probably because we think that we only smell when we're sniffing.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,080
It's only when we're sniffing that we actually get some smell.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,440
But that's not true.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,160
As J.J. Gibson, the psychologist, said, we smell because we breathe.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,560
We're actually always being bombarded with lots of volatile molecules.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,160
And off-action is always on.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,440
The processing is always going on.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,320
So the question is, why are we not more aware of it?

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, lots of people devalue the sense of smell, including rather famous philosophers.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
And it's a famous party game that people play.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,240
If I had to lose one of my senses, which would I willingly give up first?

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
And it's often smell.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,320
So here's Immanuel Kant saying just that.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,400
Which organic sense is the most ungrateful and also seems the most dispensable, the

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,040
sense of smell?

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,480
It does not pay to cultivate it or to refine it at all in order to enjoy, for there are

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,800
more disgusting objects than pleasant ones, especially in crowded places, like this.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,600
He says, even when we come across something fragrant, the pleasure coming from the sense

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,320
of smell is fleeting and transient.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,040
Now that's why I think a lot of people believe that smell could be easily dispensed with.

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,560
And a recent survey showed that many teenagers would rather lose their sense of smell than

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,760
give up one of their social media accounts.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
That's how little we care about our sense of smell.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,640
But that's a mistake.

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,720
It's a sense that we only recognize the value of when we lose it.

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,680
And when people lose their sense of smell, often because of head injury, a virus, taking

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,400
medication, respiratory infections, the sudden loss of a sense of smell comes with a change

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,520
in their emotional world.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,800
People feel this less savor to life.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,520
They often develop depression.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,760
And in fact, people who lose their sense of smell are often depressed longer than those

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
who lose their sight.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,640
It means that we no longer take for granted the familiar people in places around us.

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,160
And it's often smell that's giving us that sense of familiarity.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,560
This is wonderful work done by these two sensory scientists in Dresden, Thomas Hummel and Ilona

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,040
Croy, who've studied the effects on our quality of life and there's a huge reduction in quality

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,400
of life when we lose our sense of smell.

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,080
And as we get older, we'll all start to lose our sense of smell.

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,280
Just like eyesight and hearing, it will diminish.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,840
The good news is that right now you can improve your sense of smell and I'll tell you a little

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,120
bit about that later.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,280
But that way in which smell is part of the environment and makes us feel that we're somewhere

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
familiar.

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Again, we don't notice it until it's maybe going to be lost.

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,240
And the problem here is that smell is very emotionally loaded.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
It's very emotionally loaded.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Smell memories, odor memories, key into some of our oldest and our most emotional memories.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,640
The smell of your grandmother's kitchen, the smell of a place where you were on holiday.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,160
And some of those things come back when you just get the briefest whiff of the odor again.

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,160
And the olfactory cortex here projects directly to centers of emotion and memory, the amygdala

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,240
and the entorhinal cortex.

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Unlike the other senses, it's not gated by the thalamus.

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,160
It doesn't go round the brain before it gets to those emotional centers.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,600
It's very direct.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
And that's why we get a big charge, emotional charge.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
And when people lose their sense of smell, their emotions are depressed.

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,720
Their emotions are not getting fed with those regular signals.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
Here's a gallery I know very well.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,960
And I want to invite you to think about museums and galleries that you like to visit.

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,480
They will have a characteristic smell.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,760
You probably, if you think about it, know how they smell.

71
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,480
This is a Kelvin Grove art gallery and museum in Glasgow, my hometown.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,040
And it recently went through a major multi-million pound refit.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,000
And when it was going to be closed for four years to be refitted, the Glaswegians said,

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,880
almost as one, don't change the smell.

75
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,520
Don't change the smell.

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Why?

77
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Because they had been there as children, taken there by schools.

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,280
They had gone back as adults and recognized it and perhaps taken their own children in

79
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
turn.

80
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,360
And it always had that familiar smell that they knew so well, something between stone

81
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,920
and furniture polish, but was very distinctive and characteristic of this place.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,560
And people didn't want to lose it.

83
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,040
And people often think that their sense of smell is probably not so important because,

84
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,240
unlike other animals, maybe we're not good at smelling.

85
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Dogs are very good at smelling.

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,760
Rats are good at smelling.

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,840
But maybe we humans are not.

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
But it's not that we are poor at smelling.

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
In fact, we've got a superb sense of smell.

90
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,520
We just don't trust our nose.

91
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,240
And we don't use it because we're not on all fours.

92
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,560
The fact that we're standing on two legs and we're looking and hearing, we use those to

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
detect the environment.

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,200
But nothing stops us from being able to be like a dog.

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,960
And this is wonderful work by Noam Sobel and colleagues when he was in Berkeley, where

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,680
he got his undergraduates to put on blindfolds and to follow an odor trail that was chocolate

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,960
odor.

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,360
And the chocolate odor was laid out on the grass.

99
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,960
And it turns out that humans can get to the source of the chocolate.

100
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,480
They're a little slower than dogs.

101
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,760
They're not as direct.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,680
But they can do it.

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
So we're underutilizing our sense of smell.

104
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,920
It's there and it can be used.

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Then our sense of smell is important for signals that are social signals we give off to one

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
another.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,920
Our body odors actually convey information.

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,520
And we give chemo signals that can affect our own emotions.

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Again lovely work by the Sobel group from the Weissmann Institute shows that there are

110
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,760
chemical signals in emotional tears that reduce men's testosterone and affect their

111
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
libido.

112
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,880
Who knew?

113
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Similarly, we can smell fear from other people.

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,920
Lovely work by Bettina Pauls and Denise Chen showing that we can smell and be affected

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,760
by the body odor of someone who's undergone fear.

116
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,400
And how they do that is they take t-shirts of people who've been skydiving and then t-shirts

117
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,480
of people who've been doing vigorous exercise and it's the skydiving t-shirts, the smell

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,040
of fear that we can recognize as the fearful ones and also can affect us.

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,320
So we're probably chemo signaling to one another.

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Right now your near neighbors are giving off scent and of course scent occupies the space

121
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,920
between us.

122
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,300
It's there for the taking but we often don't pay attention to it.

123
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,600
We use it to recognize our nearest and dearest.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,880
Just by their clothes, by t-shirts you can recognize whether this is a relative of yours

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,880
or not and I know you may have some relatives in mind and think I'd know him or her anywhere

126
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,280
but in general we can do this.

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,600
In general we can tell is this person related to me.

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,400
And not only that, smell is also involved in sexual selection.

129
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,520
So it turns out that you're more attracted to people whose body odor indicates that their

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,600
immune system is further away from yours and that if they're sent and their body odor signals

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,040
that they're too close to you, you wouldn't find them so attractive.

132
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,600
Somebody's major histocompatibility complex in humans called the human leukocyte antigens

133
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,780
are actually partly responsible for how they smell.

134
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,580
So your smell is due to three things, is due to your immune system, what you eat and the

135
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,600
bacteria on you.

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,520
So when we smell people we can, as it were, be sensitive to their attractiveness because

137
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,620
of the distance their immune system is from ours and that's going to help the chance of

138
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,920
successful reproduction.

139
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,400
So it's very interesting that somebody may be very attractive, very nice, you might have

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,200
known them for a long time and think oh, they'll be a lovely companion but if they don't smell

141
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,560
right there's nothing you can do.

142
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,440
And equally, equally, you can sometimes find a stranger and you just suddenly think wow,

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,360
they're really attractive and I was just so attracted to that person that it might be

144
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,080
love it for smell, not love it for sight.

145
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,840
So don't neglect it but are all the things I'm talking to you about things that go on

146
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
unconsciously?

147
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,800
Are these ways in which olfactory processing happens but it's not in consciousness?

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
And might it be that it's only every now and then and occasionally things break through

149
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,080
into consciousness that smells reach us?

150
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,600
And that might happen because smells are a little overpowering, it might be that they're

151
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,420
a little disgusting but it's not just disgusting odours that capture our attention, it can

152
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:20,040
also be intoxicating odours, wow, that smells incredible, this smells delicious and of course

153
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,600
we can direct our attention to bring smell into consciousness when we pay this sort of

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,240
attention to people.

155
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,000
And we all, we all go in for sniffing at times whether it's just to find out whether the

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,480
milk in the fridge is fresh and whether we should continue putting it in our tea or coffee.

157
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,400
Now of course, as I said earlier, smell can be trained unlike your eyesight and hearing,

158
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,560
you can actually improve your sense of smell and that's what leads to perfumers and wine

159
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,040
tasters and coffee tasters being better than the rest of us and in fact there are changes

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,280
in the brain, perfumers have more grey matter in the entorhinal cortex and sommeliers have

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,320
more dense grey matter in their orbital frontal cortex so there is really development you

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,840
can do that will make a difference, a real difference to the kind of information you

163
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,720
can extract and what you know.

164
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,760
But of course we might wonder how good is our sense of smell, other individual differences

165
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
that matter?

166
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Well yes there are and on average women are better in their sense of smell than men on

167
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,200
average which doesn't mean there won't be men with a very good sense of smell and women

168
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,040
with a poor sense of smell.

169
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,160
But how do we know what people's sense of smell is, well we can test it.

170
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,560
We can use these sniffing sticks, a really good test devised by Thomas Hummel's group

171
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,960
in Dresden where these are pens that you smell and some of them are not as good as

172
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,960
other pens we might enjoy on occasion as teachers but these allow us to detect, these

173
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,840
allow us to detect somebody's threshold, when is there a difference between no odor

174
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,640
and an odor being noticeable, discrimination are two odors the same or different and finally

175
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,240
identification is that rose or mint or leather or tar when you smell one of these pens and

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,880
the funny thing is that lots of people who take this test will say to you oh I'm no good

177
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,040
at smelling I really can't do this and in fact they're very very accurate they've got

178
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,240
very high score and in the contrary sense there are people who continuously complain

179
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,960
about their awareness of odors oh I'm very bothered by smells I can smell smells and

180
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,240
I'm perturbed by them I've got very good sense of smell but when we test them they don't

181
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,840
have a good sense of smell they're either average or poor so our awareness of how good

182
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,840
our sense of smell is doesn't correlate with how accurate we are that might be a reason

183
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,840
why we neglect smell but a place where we don't neglect it and where odor really makes a

184
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,640
difference to our experience consciously is in eating but here smell doesn't get the

185
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,640
recognition it's due most of what we call tasting is due to smell so when you think

186
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,760
of what the tongue can provide it can provide salt sweet sour bitter umami savory that's

187
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,840
about it and yet you can taste strawberry mango melon peach you don't have peach receptors

188
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,920
on your tongue that's all coming from smell so people who lose their sense of smell will

189
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,120
often go to a doctor and say I can't taste anything and a good medic will put some salt

190
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,560
on their tongue or lemon juice or sugar and say can you taste that and they'll say yes

191
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,360
but that's all I can taste and now they realize how much of tasting was due to smell but we

192
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,560
confuse taste and smell a lot if I gave you vanilla pods to smell you would say smell

193
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,560
sweet the sweet's a taste not a smell and if I clipped a little bit of the vanilla pod

194
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,680
off and got you to chew it there's no sweetness in there at all it's quite bitter so what's

195
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,520
happening what's happening is the brain is going from its usual association of combining

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,520
vanilla aroma with things that have sucrose or sugar chocolate ice cream custard biscuits

197
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,020
and it's saying whenever I get that aroma it's usually accompanied by something sweet

198
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,640
and you transfer that quality of sweetness onto a smell even though it's not really there

199
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,720
so we have confusions but smell is playing a huge part in food and not getting a look

200
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,520
in but it's not smell as we usually think of it it's not inhaling molecules from the

201
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,360
outside it's the second source of smell which is going from the mouth to the nose up the

202
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,960
back of the nasopharynx and it's when you swallow or chew food that you pulse odors

203
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,880
up to the nose and that's when you get a big flavor hit so smell along with touch and taste

204
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,720
and temperature are all integrated into a single experience of flavor that we often call taste

205
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,920
and our mistake is not crediting smell for playing the largest part in that experience

206
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,760
but smell doesn't just combine with taste and touch it combines with other senses too

207
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,640
did you know there are odors in shampoo that make your hair feel softer this is strange

208
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:31,280
so smell interacts with touch interacts with taste now our sense of smell so keen when we're

209
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,000
younger we'll start to diminish as we get older by the age of 70 about quarter of the

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,800
population are functionally nosmic that means they don't have a sense of smell and their

211
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,160
quality of life will suffer they'll be more subject to depression they won't take pleasure

212
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,760
in their food they won't recognize the familiarity of people in places around them but we can

213
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,560
do something about that because we know from recent research that smell training or factory

214
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,240
training sniffing odors if you get four essential oils and you smell them first thing in the

215
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,960
morning and last thing at night that will preserve your sense of smell longer as you

216
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:17,520
age and it will also make you cognitively more alert so it turns out that smelling odors

217
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,760
smell training is better for you than Sudoku do that and you'll have a much more active

218
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,440
life now people who've never had a sense of smell often wonder what they're missing and

219
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,440
they often say well if I go into they've they were born without a sense of smell what what

220
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,780
is it I'm missing what's this invisible thing you talk about and a Spanish philosopher Marta

221
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:44,720
Tafaya said maybe it's when I'm in a garden and I can see the beauty of the physical arrangement

222
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,640
but I don't get the odors and aromas so I don't feel as immersed so maybe you feel immersed

223
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,880
in a space when you're getting smells and notice that we don't notice smell because

224
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,800
we stop paying attention to it when it's familiar we no longer notice the smell of our own home

225
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,760
everybody else's home's got a smell isn't that odd but yours now well it's that you've

226
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,880
stopped paying attention to it but of course it's good enough that if you go home you'll

227
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,400
say something's changed did I leave the garbage out somebody been smoking so you would notice

228
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,880
so I think all faction is not absent it doesn't get switched off in the gaps instead all faction

229
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,520
is a constant background to our experience because it's always there we pay less attention

230
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,480
to it but it modulates our moods it affects our attention and awareness and it's consolidating

231
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,880
our memory of familiar things so many people named here have helped me in understanding

232
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,320
the importance of all faction and all of them would want me to tell all of you that if you

233
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,560
think you can live just as well without your sense of smell you need to think again thank you
