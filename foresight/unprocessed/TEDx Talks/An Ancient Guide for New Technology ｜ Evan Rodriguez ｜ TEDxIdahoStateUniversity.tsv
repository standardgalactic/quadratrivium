0	23120	There's something oddly reassuring about how bad most of us are at predicting the future.
23120	29200	25 years ago, I was an innocent kid exploring a relatively new internet through an old dial-up
29200	35760	modem. For me, at least, all these connections were pure excitement and possibility. I was
35760	42080	blissfully unaware of the vast changes and controversies they'd bring. Looking at my own
42080	47520	ten-month-old today, I realized that about the only thing I can predict is that he'll consider
47520	53280	dial-up modems, and probably me too, to be about as relevant as an ancient Greek chariot.
54480	58960	But for just a moment here, I want to try to see the world through the eyes of someone else who
59600	66400	unlike me, was deeply worried about the effects of new technology. This someone was a keen observer
66400	72320	of how technology shapes the world around us. They saw people using it to gain personal and
72320	78240	political power in ways that weren't always truthful. They noticed us being more obstinate
78240	83600	than ever, just clean to our own opinions, not even considering the other side. And they were
83600	90720	keenly aware that ideas are now being spread at an ever more blistering pace. Because of all this,
90720	95520	the person I have in mind was deeply worried about the effects on our ability to have a real
95520	101600	conversation with each other. Now you might be thinking, okay, okay, we've heard these concerns
101600	106560	before. But what you might not know is that they've been around for a bit longer than you might
106560	112880	expect. This person wasn't talking about Twitter or Facebook. They weren't a pioneering computer
112880	120080	scientist or cognitive psychologist. It was the philosopher Plato. And what he was worried about
120080	129200	over 2,500 years ago was this new technology of writing. Now, as a philosopher myself,
129200	133440	I'm very grateful that Plato wrote down his concerns about writing. Otherwise, we wouldn't
133440	138720	have access to them today. And I should say, well, Plato's solution is going to be about
138720	144080	encouraging conversation. If you ever need to end the conversation, just try announcing I'm a
144080	151040	philosopher. I found that works pretty well. But Plato really is fascinating, not just for the
151040	157200	surprising relevance of what he has to say, but for the creative way that he says it. So today,
157200	162400	I'd like to walk through three of Plato's stories with you that really highlight the challenges
162480	169280	that new technology brings. Its tendency to trade in reasoning for convenience, its dependence on
169280	177440	just a single viewpoint, and its emphasis on speed. Let's start with speed. This is a familiar aspect
177440	182960	of our world today. Everything needs to be available in an instant and broadcast in real time.
184240	189120	But Plato thought that speed has its drawbacks, especially when it comes to something like writing.
190080	195520	Think of, say, just reading a written essay as opposed to having a conversation. When reading,
195520	200640	it's easy just to skim through and think you're done. The back and forth of conversation tends
200640	207200	to take a little more time, but it can really also lead to deeper engagement. Plato uses a really
207200	214400	neat image to drive this point home. He likens the way that we approach writing to gardens of Adonis.
214720	220800	These were part of a yearly ritual that the Greeks used to commemorate the famed lover of
220800	227760	Aphrodite who had an all too short life. What they would do is they would plant seeds in these shallow
227760	234560	pot shards and they'd force them to sprout in just a few days. The result was this beautiful bed of
234560	242480	lush green leaves. But soon those plants would wither from their shallow roots, so the Greeks
243440	247920	would just take them down to the coast and ritually cast them into the waves.
249920	254480	Now Plato isn't saying that these little gardens are entirely useless. In a way,
254480	258880	the whole point is that they're temporary, beautiful one moment and then gone the next.
259680	265360	But make no mistake, they're not designed for nor will they provide long lasting sustenance.
267120	272000	I have to say, I can't help but imagine how odd it must have been to watch people
272080	277440	rushing these shallow little gardens just to toss them into the sea. But at the same time,
277440	282880	I can't help but wonder if Plato could watch us today posting to social media, would he see it
282880	289280	any differently? If he was worried about the speed of writing, what does that tell us about our
289280	297520	on-demand culture today? Now his concerns about speed have to do partly with the second point,
297520	303600	about the difficulty of truly engaging with other perspectives. Plato talks about how
304240	309360	speech, once written down, simply wanders around saying the same things over and over again.
310080	315280	If you already agree, you aren't likely to learn anything new. If you don't, it's easiest just to
315280	324080	ignore it. This brings us to a second story that he uses about the Egyptian gods meeting to discuss
324080	330800	the merits of writing. The inventor of writing is of course very excited. He presents his wares
330800	336560	to the king of the gods and tells him, I have discovered a potion for memory and for wisdom.
338400	343360	But the god king isn't convinced. He says that writing will actually instill forgetfulness
344000	347840	and give people the false sense of thinking that they know when they actually don't.
348880	352640	Just think for example of how few phone numbers we can recite today
352640	359600	now that they're all stored in our smartphones. Now it's easy to think here, okay, got it. Obviously
359600	365120	inventor of writing thinks it's good, but the wise god king shows that it's bad. But more is
365120	370880	going on here than meets the eye. According to Plato, the king had good things to say about writing
370880	377440	too. Plato just doesn't tell us what they were. And he's presenting us with criticism after criticism
377440	383040	of writing in the form of a written dialogue. Surely he doesn't think writing is all bad.
386160	394480	Now this brings us to one more point that Plato actually found this really creative way
394480	402960	to create writings while still preserving the benefits of conversation. We call them dialogues
402960	408400	because they depict a thorough discussion that genuinely takes multiple perspectives seriously.
409440	414800	Instead of simply announcing these benefits to us, Plato shows us through the way that he crafts
414800	421120	these written dialogues. If he could do it for writing, in writing, despite all of his concerns
421120	427760	about writing, how might that translate to our context today? How can we preserve the benefits
427760	435120	of dialogue while still engaging with modern technology? Okay, so Plato has one more story
435120	443120	for us. This one has to do about the importance of reason. Plato tells us that the most valuable
443120	448000	thing you could get your hands on in ancient times was one of these mythical statues of
448000	454800	Daedalus. They were so skillfully made, so lifelike in their design, that they actually moved.
455040	459760	But even if you were able to get your hands on one and say to get on home, the minute you weren't
459760	465840	looking, that statue might just move on over to some other person's yard. Turns out they're not
465840	473040	going to retain their value unless you have some way of tying them down. Plato stresses that we
473040	480240	need to tie down our ideas too with the underlying reason that motivates them. Otherwise, they too
480320	485440	will get us get away from us, just like one of those elusive statues.
488400	494560	Now, part of Plato's concern here is that sometimes we have this false impression,
495360	500080	say just liking a quote will get us out of the hard work of truly understanding it.
501040	507120	There's this seductive idea that even philosophy culminates with some pity statement, something
507120	513440	just so true, it exudes wisdom. But even the people we like to quote most, they have a whole body
513440	522400	of work to back up what they're saying. So similarly, modern shortcuts like hashtags,
522400	526960	they're great at collecting information, giving a quick read on where someone stands,
527600	533520	but they're not so great at communicating the underlying motivation. We have to ask ourselves
533520	539760	for any given claim, what's going to tie down that idea? Why should we support it? What's the
539760	547520	evidence? Now, I want to take just one more moment here to appreciate how uncanny it is
547520	553280	that these concerns from well over 2,000 years ago can still speak to us today.
555920	560080	That's not to say that all of our problems have been solved. For all their inventions,
560160	563280	the Greeks never even figured out how to make clothing with pockets.
565520	571680	But it is to say we need to think hard about how technology impacts our most deeply held values.
572640	576800	We need to continue that dialogue that Plato started for us so many years ago.
578480	585360	When we do, we should remember that technology is a tool for crafting our own intricate statues
585360	589200	and that they retain their value when grounded in what we really care about.
590400	594640	We need to work on including different perspectives just like that Egyptian god king.
595520	600320	Rather than meaning that we've got something wrong, exploring both sides is more often a sign
600320	606480	that we're really doing something right. And not everything can serve its purpose in an instant,
606480	612000	like those beautiful gardens of Adonis, but changes that come about more slowly
612880	619600	often bear the greatest fruit. New technologies are inevitable, so it would be pointless to
619600	626640	insist on richly casting them into the sea. But Plato's challenge is for us to keep finding new
626640	634000	ways to enable and encourage this old technology of conversation, ways that retain those core values
634560	647120	of reason, of patience, and of open-mindedness. Thank you.
