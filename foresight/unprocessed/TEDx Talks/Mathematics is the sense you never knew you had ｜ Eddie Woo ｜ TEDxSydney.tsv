0	19340	I love mathematics.
19340	23880	Is exactly what to say at a party if you want to spend the next couple of hours sipping
23880	28520	your drink alone in the least cool corner of the room.
28520	33400	And that's because when it comes to this subject, all the numbers, formulas, symbols
33400	37960	and calculations, the vast majority of us are outsiders.
37960	39880	And that includes me.
39880	44560	That's why today I want to share with you an outsider's perspective of mathematics.
44560	49520	What I understand of it from someone who's always struggled with the subject, and what
49520	55600	I've discovered as someone who went from being an outsider to making maths my career, is
55600	63120	that surprisingly, we are all deep down born to be mathematicians.
63120	68680	But back to being an outsider, I know what you're thinking, wait a second Eddie, what
68680	70240	would you know?
70240	77120	You're a maths teacher, you went to a selective school, you wear glasses and you're Asian.
77120	83760	Now, firstly, that's racist.
84760	87000	Secondly, that's wrong.
87000	91120	When I was at school, my favourite subjects were English and history.
91120	95920	And this caused a lot of angst for me as a teenager because my high school truly honoured
95920	96920	mathematics.
96920	101840	Your status in the school pretty much correlated with which mathematics class you ranked in.
101840	106360	There were eight classes, so if you were in maths four, that made you just about average.
106360	110920	If you were in maths one, you were like royalty.
110920	115440	Each year, our school entered the prestigious Australian mathematics competition and would
115440	121680	print out a list of everyone in the school in order of our scores.
121680	128240	Students who received prizes and high distinctions were pinned up at the start of a long corridor,
128240	134080	far, far away from the dark and shameful place where my name appeared.
134080	136280	Maths was not really my thing.
136280	139560	Stories, characters, narratives.
139560	141360	This is where I was at home.
141360	147280	And that's why I raised my sales and set course to become an English and history teacher.
147280	153040	But, a chance encounter at senior university altered my life forever.
153040	157440	I was in line to enrol at the Faculty of Education when I started a conversation with one of its
157440	158920	professors.
158920	163720	He noticed that while my academic life had been dominated by humanities, I had actually
163720	166680	attempted some high level maths at school.
166800	173840	What he saw was not that I had a problem with maths, but that I had persevered with maths.
173840	178400	And he knew something I didn't, that there was a critical shortage of mathematics educators
178400	183040	in Australian schools, a shortage that remains to this day.
183040	188040	So he encouraged me to change my teaching area to mathematics.
188040	192040	For me, becoming a teacher wasn't about my love for a particular subject.
192040	196560	It was about having a personal impact on the lives of young people.
196560	201320	I'd seen firsthand at school what a lasting and positive difference a great teacher can
201320	202520	make.
202520	207280	I wanted to do that for someone, and it didn't matter to me what subject I did it in.
207280	213200	If there was an acute need in mathematics, then it made sense for me to go there.
213200	217800	As I studied my degree though, I discovered that mathematics was a very different subject
217800	220080	to what I'd originally thought.
220080	226680	I'd made the same mistake about mathematics that I'd made earlier in my life about music.
226680	232000	Like a good migrant child, I dutifully learned to play the piano when I was young.
232000	237280	My weekends were filled with endlessly repeating scales and memorizing every note in the peace
237280	239640	spring and winter.
239640	245160	I lasted two years before my career was abruptly ended when my teacher told my parents his fingers
245160	246160	are too short.
246160	250800	I will not teach him any more.
250800	255160	At seven years old, I thought of music like torture.
255160	261640	It was a dry, solitary, joyless exercise that I only engaged with because someone else forced
261640	263640	me to.
263640	266920	It took me 11 years to emerge from that sad place.
266920	272080	In year 12, I picked up a steel string acoustic guitar for the first time.
272080	278360	I wanted to play it for church, and there was also a girl I was fairly keen on impressing.
278360	286600	So I convinced my brother to teach me a few chords, and slowly, but surely, my mind changed.
286600	289440	I was engaged in a creative process.
289440	292760	I was making music, and I was hooked.
292760	297040	I started playing in a band, and I felt the delight of rhythm pulsing through my body
297040	299480	as we brought our sounds together.
299480	306480	I had been surrounded by a musical ocean my entire life, and for the first time, I realized
306480	308640	I could swim in it.
308640	312360	I went through an almost identical experience when it came to mathematics.
312360	317400	I used to believe that math was about rote learning in screwtable formulas to solve abstract
317400	320600	problems that didn't mean anything to me.
320600	327240	But at university, I began to see that mathematics is immensely practical and even beautiful.
328000	334440	That it's not just about finding answers, but also about learning to ask the right questions.
334440	338840	And that mathematics isn't about mindlessly crunching numbers, but rather about forming
338840	346920	new ways to see problems so we can solve them by combining insight with imagination.
346920	353200	It gradually dawned on me that mathematics is a sense.
353200	357000	Mathematics is a sense just like sight and touch.
357000	362600	It's a sense that allows us to perceive realities which would be otherwise intangible to us.
362600	368320	You know, we talk about a sense of humor and a sense of rhythm.
368320	373320	Mathematics is our sense for patterns, relationships, and logical connections.
373320	375960	It's a whole new way to see the world.
375960	382200	Now, I want to show you a mathematical reality that I guarantee you've seen before, but perhaps
382200	384560	never really perceived.
384560	389400	It's been hidden in plain sight your entire life.
389400	392080	This is a river delta.
392080	394720	It's a beautiful piece of geometry.
394720	398760	When we hear the word geometry, most of us think of triangles and circles.
398760	404760	But geometry is the mathematics of all shapes, and this meeting of land and sea has created
404760	408000	shapes with an undeniable pattern.
408000	411240	It has a mathematically recursive structure.
411240	416720	Every part of the river delta, with its twists and turns, is a microversion of the greater
416720	417720	whole.
417720	423800	So, I want you to see the mathematics in this, but that's not all.
423800	430360	I want you to compare this river delta with this amazing tree.
430360	437440	It's a wonder in itself, but focus with me on the similarities between this and the river.
437440	443240	What I want to know is why on earth should these shapes look so remarkably alike?
443240	445920	Why should they have anything in common?
445920	449600	Things get even more perplexing when you realize it's not just water systems and plants that
449600	450600	do this.
450600	457600	If you keep your eyes open, you'll see these same shapes are everywhere.
457600	461160	Lightning bolts disappear so quickly that we seldom have the opportunity to ponder their
461160	467200	geometry, but their shape is so unmistakable and so similar to what we've just seen that
467200	470440	one can't help but be suspicious.
470440	477440	And then there's the fact that every single person in this room is filled with these shapes,
477440	478640	too.
478640	484880	Every cubic centimeter of your body is packed with blood vessels that trace out this same
484880	485880	pattern.
485880	491720	There's a mathematical reality woven into the fabric of the universe that you share with
491720	496800	winding rivers, towering trees, and raging storms.
496800	501600	These shapes are examples of what we call fractals as mathematicians.
501600	505880	Fractals get their name from the same place as fractions and fractures.
505880	510240	It's a reference to the broken and shattered shapes we find around us in nature.
510240	516640	Now, once you have a sense for fractals, you really do start to see them everywhere, ahead
516640	523760	of broccoli, the leaves of a fern, even clouds in the sky.
523760	528600	Like the other senses, our mathematical sense can be refined with practice.
528600	533040	It's just like developing perfect pitch or a taste for wines.
533040	538800	You can learn to perceive the mathematics around you with time and the right guidance.
538800	543400	Naturally, some people are born with sharper senses than the rest of us.
543400	545880	Others are born with impairment.
545880	550880	As you can see, I drew a short straw in the genetic lottery when it came to my eyesight.
550880	556120	Without my glasses, everything is a blur.
556120	562800	I've wrestled with this sense my entire life, but I would never dream of saying, well, seeing
562800	564200	has always been a struggle for me.
564200	569120	I guess I'm just not a seeing kind of person.
569120	578160	Yet, I meet people every day who feel it quite natural to say exactly that about mathematics.
578280	583000	I'm convinced we close ourselves off from a huge part of the human experience if we
583000	588280	do this, because all human beings are wired to see patterns.
588280	592240	We live in a patterned universe, a cosmos.
592240	600120	That's what cosmos means, orderly and patterned, as opposed to chaos, which means disorderly
600120	601120	and random.
601120	605280	It isn't just seeing patterns that humans are so good at.
605280	610960	We love making patterns, too, and the people who do this well have a special name.
610960	618760	We call them artists, musicians, sculptors, painters, cinematographers.
618760	622080	They're all pattern creators.
622080	627040	Music is once described as the joy that people feel when they are counting, but don't know
627040	628800	it.
628800	635000	Some of the most striking examples of mathematical patterns are in Islamic art and design, and
635000	640480	a version to depicting humans and animals led to a rich history of intricate tile arrangements
640480	642800	and geometric forms.
642800	648640	The aesthetic side of mathematical patterns like these brings us back to nature itself.
648640	653360	For instance, flowers are a universal symbol of beauty.
653360	659280	Every culture around the planet and throughout history has regarded them as objects of wonder.
659280	663880	One aspect of their beauty is that they exhibit a special kind of symmetry.
663880	669880	Flowers grow organically from a center that expands outwards in the shape of a spiral,
669880	673760	and this creates what we call rotational symmetry.
673760	680160	You can spin a flower around and around, and it still looks basically the same.
680160	682640	But not all spirals are created equal.
682640	687800	It all depends on the angle of rotation that goes into creating the spiral.
687800	695240	For instance, if we build a spiral from an angle of 90 degrees, we get a cross that is
695240	698600	neither beautiful nor efficient.
698600	703840	Huge parts of the flower's area are wasted and don't produce seeds.
703840	709160	Using an angle of 62 degrees is better and produces a nice circular shape, like what
709160	713320	we usually associate with flowers, but it's still not great.
713320	719680	There are still large parts of the area that are a poise of resources for the flower.
719680	731840	However, if we use 137.5 degrees, we get this beautiful pattern.
731840	738840	It's astonishing, and it is exactly the kind of pattern used by that most majestic of flowers,
738840	740440	the sunflower.
740440	747760	Now, 137.5 degrees might seem pretty random, but it actually emerges out of a special number
747760	750800	that we call the Golden Ratio.
750800	756680	The Golden Ratio is a mathematical reality that, like fractals, you can find everywhere
756680	763360	from the phalanges of your fingers to the pillars of the Parthenon, and that's why, even
763360	769440	at a party of 5,000 people, I'm proud to declare I love mathematics.
