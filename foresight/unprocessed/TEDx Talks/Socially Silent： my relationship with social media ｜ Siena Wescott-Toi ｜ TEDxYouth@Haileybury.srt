Can a life be changed in five weeks? Hello, I'm Sienna and I'm here to tell you about five weeks that changed my life forever.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'd like to start by asking you all a simple question. How many hours do you think you spend on social media a day?

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Social media has been vital in the past two years as what it truly does and intends to do is connect us.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
However, I believe social media is about balance. It can create a polarized society, a society addicted to perfection, a social pandemic.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
However, social media also has the power to unite and allow people to use their voice.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It began as an exciting new concept, one where people from around the globe could share ideas, memories and moments.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
However, with the speed that it grew and the ages it attracted, issues have arisen.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Cyberbullying and societal pressures, just two issues that permeate society, but also all of our lives today.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Picture this. January mid lockdown 2021. I'm sure many of you can agree it was a lonely and difficult time.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Certainly one of the lowest times in my life. Let me tell you why.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I was purely relying on social media as a vessel of escapism.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How you may ask? Well, when I was on my phone it was as if I didn't have to think of anything else.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was fixated on the screen and that was all I was fixated on.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I could hear my mind and my body telling me it was damaging and I decided to listen to my mind and my body.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It wasn't my parents or friends or family. It was me. I could see it hurting my self confidence, my motivation.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, I sat in front of a mirror and it came to me.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook on the one hand helped keep me socially active.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:27,000
However, consuming more than eight hours of my day, the time is still from my life and the pressure to constantly keep connected

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
are precisely the reasons why I chose to become socially silent.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
With a click of a finger and a tap on a screen, my social media had gone.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I decided to close off all of my virtual relationships when physical ones didn't exist.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was able to live carefree and truly experience the moment, the present, the now.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Liberating is the only way I can describe it. It's truly changed my life.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I found that I was spending my time usefully consuming my life with things that only motivated me and kept me going.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I read, I spent time with family, I painted in the garden, I cooked, the list goes on.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I learnt about the world around me. I learnt about my home.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But most importantly, I learnt about how peaceful the world could be without the distraction of social media.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My quality of life had improved, but most importantly, I felt no pressure to conform.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I felt free.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now, I'm not going to deny that it wasn't hard because it most definitely was at the start.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
One becomes so attached to their device. For me, my phone seemed like a safe place, like a haven.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
However, I soon realised how truly dangerous it was, like a trap or a prison.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was scared. I really was. What are people going to think?

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Am I weird? Are my attention-seeking? Will I lose friends?

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But soon, my fears subsided.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I wasn't weird. I didn't lose friends. If anything, I inspired people.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And that's why I'm standing here today.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not here to purely criticise.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
After my social break, I realised the real and principal use of social media is communication.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And that's all I wanted back from it.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I wanted a vessel to communicate.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And that's what social media has become to me.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
For ease, for making plans, for talking to loved ones, for talking to friends.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't want endless feeds and superficial standards.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was ready to create my own relationship with social media, a balanced one that wouldn't overtake my life.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I have.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I wonder if you know the average hours a teenager spent on social media a day in 2020.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For teenagers aged 13 to 19, it was an average of nine hours a day.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's 3,285 hours a year, or on average, 173 full days.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's half a year.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Half a year.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know, sometimes I sit and wonder, when I'm in my 80s and 90s,

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
whether I would have lived my life to its fullest potential, met countless people,

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
been to countless places, experienced countless experiences,

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and dare I say it, going off social media for five weeks has taught me three main things.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I've learnt how to use my time to take control because time is precious.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've learnt my ideal balance.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But most importantly, I have learnt a lot about myself.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, I sit here today to ask you one favour for however long, in whichever way you would like,

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
take some time of social media.

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Find your balance, find your freedom, find your ideal way to communicate.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Because as soon as I stopped communicating with others, I learnt to communicate with myself.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And that's made me the person I am today.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I hope you can leave here thinking, reflecting and considering this approach

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
to learning about life, learning about the world through experience,

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but most vitally, learning about yourself.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank you.
