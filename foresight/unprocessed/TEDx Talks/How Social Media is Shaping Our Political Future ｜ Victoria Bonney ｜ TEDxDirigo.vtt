00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
Since the 2016 election, we've seen how social media has degraded our political system.

00:15.480 --> 00:21.680
From Russian bots to the president's midnight tweets, it's easy to see the harm it's doing.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.120
But if you also notice that it's made our democracy more diverse and transparent, I've

00:27.120 --> 00:31.760
worked in government and campaigns for over a decade, and I have.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.520
I used to believe only a certain kind of person can run for office.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.800
That only one kind of experience mattered to voters.

00:38.800 --> 00:44.800
An Ivy League degree, lots of money, famous last name, being mail.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.440
Basically, the guys on Mount Rushmore.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.880
But that was before Facebook and Instagram and Twitter allowed politicians to speak

00:53.880 --> 00:56.360
directly to voters.

00:56.360 --> 01:00.920
Before that, they had to go through these traditional media gatekeepers, like 60 minutes

01:00.920 --> 01:03.800
and meet the press and all the Sunday shows.

01:03.800 --> 01:08.040
And those were impossible to book unless you had connections.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.160
I grew up in New Hampshire, a state with outsized impact on national politics, because every

01:13.160 --> 01:17.600
four years, it hosts the presidential primary.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.320
Which means, if you had presidential ambitions, you probably came to my school or my neighborhood

01:22.320 --> 01:24.080
to make your case.

01:24.080 --> 01:30.040
I remember Bill Clinton's motorcade driving by my yard sale.

01:30.040 --> 01:36.120
And Bob Dole hanging out in the cafeteria, and Bill Bradley shooting hoops in the gym.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.680
And despite this front row seat to politics, it just never appealed to me.

01:40.680 --> 01:45.760
Of course, part of that was my age, but the other part was that they seemed so scripted

01:45.760 --> 01:48.840
and unrelatable.

01:48.840 --> 01:55.000
That changed when I was about 19, after America declared war with Iraq.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.480
I woke up one morning in my college dorm, and someone had left the TV on.

01:59.480 --> 02:04.120
And this governor from Vermont was on Meet the Press, Howard Dean.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.280
And he said, Iraq hadn't attacked us on 9-11.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.040
Our justification for war was wrong, and my generation was going to deal with the consequences

02:12.040 --> 02:13.480
of that conflict.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.680
I had never seen a politician speak so forcefully against the war.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.240
And for the first time in my young life, I wanted to be a part of a campaign.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.160
So I called this campaign every day for weeks, until finally they said, sure, you could knock

02:28.160 --> 02:31.240
on stranger's doors in the freezing cold for no money at all.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.640
And I was like, yes!

02:33.640 --> 02:37.520
I felt like I was part of a movement.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.640
And believe it or not, in 2004, I was.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.560
Howard Dean did something that no one had done.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.960
He raised low dollar donations on the internet, which gave him the ability to run a national

02:48.960 --> 02:51.080
campaign as an outsider.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.880
But he still had to go through those traditional media gatekeepers.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.000
Social media wouldn't be what it is today for a very long time.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Facebook wouldn't even be available to the public for two years.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.480
And the thing is, those traditional media gatekeepers, they weren't a big fan of Howard

03:07.480 --> 03:10.040
Dean's off-script speeches.

03:10.040 --> 03:14.520
The Prime Minister may remember his most infamous after the Iowa caucus.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.400
It went a little something like this.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.120
We're going to South Carolina, we're going to Oregon, we're going to Washington, D.C.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.480
to take back the White House.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.600
Yeah.

03:22.600 --> 03:29.960
So that so-called Dean Scream doomed his campaign.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.720
He was seen as unhinged and too angry.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.160
Right.

03:38.160 --> 03:42.760
Because you sit here 14 years later, you may think, too angry.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
That's Tuesday.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.200
And you're right.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.360
Right now, our current president holds rallies almost every Tuesday where people scream in

03:51.360 --> 03:53.680
unison, lock her up.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.360
So how did we get here?

03:56.360 --> 03:58.600
Social media changed the game.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.400
It broke the way that politicians could communicate.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.960
No longer would canned talking points break through the clutter of Twitter.

04:05.960 --> 04:10.240
Having poll tested, people just tuned it out.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.360
When I ran for state representative in my hometown 12 years ago, I doubted that voters

04:14.360 --> 04:18.560
wanted a woman who was working two waitressing jobs and had college loan debt to represent

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
them.

04:19.560 --> 04:25.320
However, a waitress with college loan debt might be the kind of representative who understands

04:25.320 --> 04:28.560
why we need a living wage and student loan relief.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.560
But I didn't see my experience as an asset.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.880
And even if I had, I had no way of getting that message out.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.280
I misread my strengths as liabilities simply because I didn't look like those guys on

04:41.280 --> 04:45.720
Mount Rushmore or any other politician I'd seen.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.040
And maybe that's why I lost.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.840
Campaigns today are different.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.920
Candidates are using viral videos to tell their experiences with issues ranging from homelessness,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.960
teen pregnancy, debt, depression.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.400
Voters are seeing these stories and they're feeling galvanized by stories they relate

05:02.400 --> 05:07.840
to and they're giving money to help move those campaigns along.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.160
You know, there's long been a practice in politics called opposition research.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.680
It's where your opponent digs up all the dirt they can find on you.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.680
But in the age of social media, that could be useless because it turns out showing vulnerability

05:21.680 --> 05:25.040
is shrewd politics.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.920
Everyone likes a story and everyone has a story to tell.

05:28.920 --> 05:33.680
These candidates will not accept that their experience is disqualifying simply because

05:33.680 --> 05:36.240
no one like them has run before.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.600
Look at Stacey Abrams.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.960
She told me to be the first African-American governor of Georgia.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.400
Her opponent said, she's in debt.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.760
She's unqualified.

05:44.760 --> 05:49.520
She said, yeah, like millions of Americans, I have debt, but I won't feel ashamed that

05:49.520 --> 05:53.800
I needed a loan to get an education or to support myself.

05:53.800 --> 05:59.880
And with her response, she shut down that line of criticism and made herself more relatable.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.160
Look at Beto O'Rourke.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.320
He's documented almost every moment of his campaign on social media and it's introduced

06:05.320 --> 06:10.400
him to millions of Americans and helped him to raise an unprecedented $40 million in three

06:10.400 --> 06:12.800
months.

06:12.800 --> 06:17.440
Even if these campaigns are unsuccessful this time, they will have changed how campaigns

06:17.440 --> 06:23.760
communicate going forward, just as Howard Dean did with fundraising in 2004.

06:23.760 --> 06:29.080
But beyond campaigns, social media has made government more transparent.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.440
Who would have thought our 72-year-old president would get every member of Congress to use

06:34.440 --> 06:37.120
Twitter?

06:37.120 --> 06:42.400
But every time he tweets, the traditional media come asking for a response.

06:42.400 --> 06:48.080
So the need for conviction, authenticity, responsiveness, I know requirements of elected

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
officials.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.920
Because if you don't respond, you're seen as totally out of touch.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.560
You're like, how does she know that?

06:55.560 --> 06:59.760
Well, I'm currently a communications director for a member of Congress and you would not

06:59.760 --> 07:05.480
want to know how many times a week we get calls about presidential tweets.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.320
Around Memorial Day of this year, the hashtag where the children went viral.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.120
The Trump administration had begun separating immigrant children from their families at

07:14.120 --> 07:16.000
the U.S. border.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.800
Our phones, our emails, our social media platforms were flooded by constituents who were outraged

07:20.800 --> 07:22.760
by this inhumanity.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.800
The congresswoman who I worked for was also outraged.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.520
She and I flew to Brownsville, Texas and saw the detention centers for ourselves.

07:30.520 --> 07:36.240
Along the way, we documented everything, videos, tweets.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.520
And in her capacity as an elected official, she was the eyes and ears of her constituents.

07:40.520 --> 07:45.520
And when she got back to D.C., she lent a voice to their outrage by backing legislation

07:45.520 --> 07:49.400
to address this ongoing crisis.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.400
Social media has created a dialogue that's never existed between elected officials and

07:53.400 --> 07:55.320
those they represent.

07:55.320 --> 07:59.600
It's opened the door for people who thought they could never run, and it served as a microphone

07:59.600 --> 08:02.520
for those who've never had one.

08:02.520 --> 08:08.480
Most importantly, it's changing the face of politics, maybe.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.200
Maybe it could even change those faces on Mount Rushmore.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
Thank you.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
Thank you.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.200
Thank you.
