0	15240	In 1942, Albert Einstein was teaching at Oxford University and one day he just gave an exam
15240	20240	of physics to his senior class of physics students and he was walking on the campus with his
20240	25240	assistant and all of a sudden the assistant looked at Albert Einstein and said, Dr. Einstein,
25240	32200	this exam which you just gave to the senior class of physics students, isn't that exactly the
32200	39200	same exam you gave to exactly the same class one year ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
39200	44680	said Albert Einstein, it's exactly the same. But Dr. Einstein, how could you possibly do
44680	57400	that? The assistant said, well, said Einstein, the answers have changed. The answers have
57400	62880	changed. In other words, what is true for 1942 is even more true for today. We live in a world
62880	67240	where the questions might be the same, but the answers have changed. In other words,
67240	73000	what has got you here will no longer get you there. And if you want to have results that
73000	76920	you've never had before, well, you need to start doing things you've never done before.
76920	84000	Now, the key question for today is, of course, is there a method to the madness? Is there a way
84000	91560	that each of us can do impossible things to truly create dramatic results? And good news is that
91560	97680	the answer to that question is yes, because what I'm going to explain today is when it comes to
97760	104760	high performance, why the majority is always wrong and how you can use that to get everything
104760	112320	you can out of everything you've got. But let me first introduce you to something interesting,
112320	117000	an interesting observation. When people, teams and organizations, whenever they hit a wall,
117000	124720	they tend to do one of two things. They either do more of the same things or they do less of the
124760	131640	same things. But what you very seldom see is that they start to do different things instead. And
131640	136280	it's interesting if you look at the data, approximately 3% of people are inclined to even
136280	144440	do different things. And the remaining 97% continues to smash into the wall, like some kind of crazy
144440	152160	energy bunny on steroids. And why is that? Why is that? And to understand what is going on here,
152440	156120	we need to ask ourselves another question. And the question we need to ask ourselves is what is
156120	162520	the purpose of thinking? What is the purpose of thinking? Now, if you ask that question to a
162520	167680	brain scientist, the brain scientist will say, well, the purpose of thinking is to stop thinking.
167680	173640	The purpose of thinking is to stop thinking. Now, what does she mean by that? Well, here's the thing.
173640	179120	Thinking is a high energy activity. It takes a lot of energy to think. So whenever we think,
179360	188040	we try to think as short as possible. And then we return to automatic pilot. Over 95% of our
188040	194680	life, we run on automatic pilot. For example, if you ever driven a car and then you realize, whoa,
194680	201760	what did I do in the past half an hour? That's your brain on automatic pilot. Another example,
202000	210400	many of you right now are listening to me on automatic pilot. And I know who you are.
215440	219040	Now, here's the thing. If your brain is an automatic pilot, this leads to what a scientist
219040	227120	called mental myopia, also known as tunnel vision. And if you have tunnel vision, that's a bit of a
227120	232480	problem because it confuses people about our own performance. And this is the reason that many
232480	239040	people go through life acting like a mediocre race car driver who sits in his car, looks in his
239040	244320	rearview mirror, sees his competition and is so far behind that they think they are first.
251360	254880	In other words, ladies and gentlemen, we tend to think inside the box. And the box is a very
254880	262800	good metaphor here. So let me draw a box. And if you take a close look at the box,
262800	268960	you see that the boundaries of this box are very well defined. So we think inside defined
268960	275200	boundaries. I'll give you an example. One boundary is a legal boundary. And we think within the
275200	282560	legal framework. I'll give you an example where very few of you would think of stealing the wallet
282560	290400	of the person next to you in order to fund your next cool startup. At least that's what I hope.
292320	296320	So we think in legal boundaries, but there are other boundaries as well. We think in technological
296320	301680	boundaries, we think in physical boundaries, but we also think in moral boundaries. And this is why
301680	309840	we think inside the box. At least that's what we think. Because the reality is that the box in
309840	320080	which we think looks more like this. Now, for those of you in the back who cannot see it,
320080	328960	the reason is this is a very small box. And let me illustrate how small this box can be. For
328960	333440	example, if I would say tonight, let's have something to eat, have dinner tonight, what would
333440	338960	be options to do that? And probably you can come up with, hey, let's buy some pizza, go to restaurant,
338960	345680	cook at home, all kinds of cool ideas. But I believe that very few of you would raise their
345680	351200	hand and say, hey, let's go to the highway close by, see if we can pick up some dead animals on
351200	360240	the side of the road and prepare ourselves a crispy dinner. That's a disturbing thought.
362800	366000	But here's the funny thing, for many people in the world, this would be a perfectly normal
366000	371040	response. Nothing wrong with that. So what it shows is that the box in which we think
371040	377280	is actually very, very small. And if you take a look, if you take a closer look at your industry
377280	384560	or professional field, you also think inside a very small box. And the boundaries of this box,
384560	391920	they are called industry standards or industry norms. For example, if you are in the restaurant
391920	397600	business, then the industry standard is that people come to your establishment, they eat,
397600	403120	and then they pay. That's the standard. That's how everyone is doing it. Another example,
403120	408160	if you're in the banking business, this norm is that people give you money, you say, thank you
408160	416720	very much, and you give the money to someone else. I mean, that's banking. So those are standards,
416720	420320	those are norms in the industry or professional field. But this is what you need to know,
420320	427520	the word norm is an abbreviation for normal. In other words, if you do what everyone else is
427520	432000	doing, you get results that everyone else is getting, and those are normal results.
434000	440400	And the thing is, what we are after today are extraordinary results. So the key question
440400	445360	is, of course, how can you kick yourself out of the box, out of this very small box of your
445360	452080	industry and professional field, and move to the happy place where cool innovation happens?
452720	458320	Now, how can you do that? Now, let me introduce you to the curious case of the London taxi drivers.
460000	464720	If you want to become a taxi driver in London, you need to know the entire city by heart.
465360	469520	And this is called the knowledge. And you can imagine it takes years to get the knowledge
469520	474480	in your head. And that's a bit of a problem if you want to rapidly expand your taxi business.
475840	480080	So they ask themselves a question. How can we rapidly expand our taxi business,
480080	486240	while at the same time employing taxi drivers who do not know anything about the city of London?
488240	491760	And then they came up with a very ingenious solution. What they said, well, actually,
491760	497600	then we make two kinds of taxis. One is a normal taxi. And the other taxi has a big sign on it,
497600	502080	which says the driver of this vehicle does not know anything
505040	509200	about the city of London, but loves to get directions from you.
511040	515760	And that's a brilliant solution because this attracted those people who lived in London,
515760	521520	knew the city very well, and finally, finally, finally, could pay boss in a taxi.
521760	529600	Yeah, brilliant. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this sounds like a very cute story,
530560	536400	but there's much more than meets the eye. Because what we have found is that breakthrough
536400	542320	innovation, extraordinary results happen when people decide to finally break the standards
542320	549040	or the norms in their industry or professional field. And you see this over and over again.
549040	554240	For example, if you would have a furniture business and one day you would decide to no
554240	559520	longer assemble furniture for your customers, probably you would end up with a company called
560480	567200	IKEA. Another example, if you own a computer business and one day you would decide to no
567200	574160	longer sell your computer using a physical store, probably you would end up with a company called
574160	581840	Dell Computers. Yeah. So ladies and gentlemen, what it tells us there is a method to the madness.
582960	587680	And by understanding that the majority is always wrong when it comes to high performance,
587680	595920	finally you have the opportunity to quit fixing things and move to massive innovation instead.
596240	605520	Ladies and gentlemen, the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, once said that the object of life
606640	613760	is not to side with the majority. But the object of life is to escape finding oneself
613760	620720	joining the ranks of the clinically insane. If you do what everyone else is doing,
621360	626720	you're not distinguishing yourself and you're probably stuck. And this is why when it comes
626720	634400	to high performance, the majority is always wrong. This is what we know. We know that three percent
634400	642000	of people are able to achieve extraordinary results. And each of you can become part of those three
642000	647680	percent by deciding as of today to break your industry standards and to break your industry norms.
648400	653920	The alternative, of course, is that you become part of the ninety seven percent who in the end
653920	667920	works for those three percent. And as of today, that choice is completely yours. Thank you very much.
