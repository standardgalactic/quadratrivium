0	12840	Artificial intelligence, how many times have we heard this?
12840	17520	We wake up in the morning, we drink our coffee, we read newspaper, and there is something
17520	19240	about it.
19240	25080	We watch the television and we hear something talking about the latest technological progress.
25080	29960	We drive in the car, we listen to the radio and there is someone talking about artificial
29960	31520	intelligence.
31520	35120	How many times have we heard their robot will take over?
35120	37240	How can we trust a robot?
37240	41640	A robot will take our job.
41640	46200	You think I'm going to do another class on artificial intelligence today.
46200	47600	Forget about it.
47600	54240	Today we're going to talk about self-serve coffee machine.
54240	59160	How many of you have taken one of this coffee?
59160	60160	Everybody.
60160	62520	Well, me too.
62520	70240	How many of you can build a self-serve coffee machine from scratch?
70240	71240	Nobody.
71240	73960	Me neither.
73960	76480	But we consume the coffee.
76480	79480	We trust that machine.
79480	81920	How we trust this machine?
81920	87160	For sure we are not going to open the machine or read the electrical scheme of the machine.
87160	91200	We are not going to read the software code of the machine.
91200	96440	We trust the machine because of the coffee we take, we consume.
96440	98840	We drink our coffee and we like it.
98840	101720	We trust the machine.
101720	107000	You might wonder why I'm here in Annapolis listening to Luca talking about self-serve
107000	110240	coffee machine.
110240	117160	Because artificial intelligence today is exactly like this self-serve machine.
117160	119520	We use all the time.
119520	122800	We trust what it does for us.
122800	127520	But we use all the time.
127520	128840	We go in the airport.
128840	132320	We put our passport on the screen reader.
132320	133640	The gate opens.
133640	135880	We go through.
135880	136880	We play Rizzico.
136880	141320	We play Monopoly with our friends while we have dinner.
141320	145400	Alexa, play Bohemia Rhapsody of Queen.
145400	147680	And it's our play.
147680	150320	We have a job interview.
150320	151520	We don't know where to go.
151520	153760	We put Google Maps.
153760	157520	Google Maps tell take this street, left, right.
157520	159640	We arrive at destination.
159640	163040	We use every day artificial intelligence.
163040	169640	We don't know how it works, but we trust what it does for us.
169640	174360	But it's not always good as it seems.
174360	176400	A few years ago, I had a friend.
176400	179840	He wanted to buy a nice car.
179840	183640	He was saving every month some money.
183640	190320	But he realized it would have taken many years to save the money to buy the car.
190320	191320	He was a nerd.
191320	192600	He was an engineer.
192600	195040	He was always the first of the class.
195040	198240	He was a high-skilled individual.
198240	200200	So he started building a software.
200200	203280	He started building a predictive model.
203280	209720	And he started investing in his own favorite cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.
209720	211120	So he built this model.
211120	213120	He started using this model.
213120	218920	This model was telling him, A, tomorrow open a position, Bitcoin is going up.
218920	222880	Or close this position, Bitcoin is going down.
222880	225560	For a few months, he started making money.
225560	228120	He trust his own model.
228120	230880	Everything was working perfectly.
230880	235200	But all of a sudden, on a rainy day, things start changing.
235200	236440	And he started losing money.
236440	238240	Bitcoin was dropping.
238240	241040	And he was not able to understand why.
241040	242440	He built something.
242440	244560	He was a very skilled engineer.
244560	255160	And he was not even able to understand his own artificial intelligence.
255160	258400	Imagine you are the owner of a bookstore.
258400	262560	And you have thousands of books on display.
262560	263880	You are the owner.
263880	266960	And you want to maximize revenue.
266960	268560	So you hired a consultant.
268560	274080	This consultant is an expert in machine learning, in computer vision specifically.
274080	277640	And he installed a lot of cameras on your shop.
277640	283960	Every camera pointing to a specific area of the bookstore.
283960	292520	And basically, he created a model that employs computer vision and performs facial recognition
292520	294200	of expression.
294200	302240	So you recognize if a customer is happy, is engaged, is sad, is disengaged.
302240	307880	So the model can say, hey, in this area of the shop, all the people are engaged.
307880	310640	In this area of the shop, all the people are disengaged.
310640	317400	So the owner can have a suggestion on where to put books.
317400	321920	But for a few months, again, he started making money.
321920	325040	He started selling books.
325040	326920	Everything was going okay.
326920	330600	But all of a sudden, the revenue started dropping.
330600	335520	He called the consultant, the consultant answered, hey, I have some problem here.
335520	340160	I keep taking the decision according to the model.
340160	342400	But my revenue is going down.
342400	345640	And the consultant says, hey, listen, I don't know.
345640	348400	This is the model that is telling me what to do.
348400	349400	Everything is automatic.
349400	350960	I don't know.
350960	352960	So imagine the frustration of the owner.
352960	358400	He's so frustrated that he says, I don't want to play with artificial intelligence anymore.
358400	362720	I fire you.
362720	366720	A few years ago, I had a friend.
366720	369640	One night, he started shaking.
369640	373120	And he lost control of half of his body.
373120	374960	He thought he had an ictus.
374960	377080	He was sleeping with the wife.
377080	380080	And he started losing vision from one eyes.
380080	382320	He couldn't see any more from one eyes.
382320	383720	He was very reactive.
383720	387560	And he called the wife and said, please bring me to the hospital.
387560	388880	Something is going on.
388880	391200	So they go straight to the hospital.
391200	395160	The doctor understood something was wrong.
395160	399560	And he performed a scan of the brain.
399560	408160	And there was something as big as a grain, mice grain, that he was in his brain.
408160	412400	And the doctor said, hey, I'm sorry, but you have a tumor.
412400	414400	You have a malignant tumor.
414400	417160	You have just a few months of life.
417160	422200	What you can imagine, my friend, he was destroyed psychologically.
422200	423200	He didn't know what to do.
423200	425000	He didn't know how to react.
425000	427480	He was destroyed.
427480	431200	But the doctor started giving him cortisone.
431200	437200	And he was performing overtime these brain scans to see if something is happening.
437200	441600	And strangely, every day, something good was happening.
441600	448920	He started seeing again from the left eyes, he started getting control of his half part
448920	449920	of the body.
449920	453480	Well, he was getting happy.
453480	456120	But the doctor didn't know what's going on.
456120	460160	He was trusting the machine who took those pictures.
460160	462440	He was interpreting, there is a tumor.
462440	466160	And he still didn't know what to do, what to say.
466160	475080	So the doctor couldn't trust the machine, couldn't trust artificial intelligence anymore.
475080	477640	So what is the moral of this?
477640	481000	Should we really trust artificial intelligence?
481000	483520	We cannot stop technological progress.
483520	486040	It doesn't make sense.
486040	489680	We cannot stop to build intelligence machines.
489680	491520	It doesn't make sense.
491520	500280	But we can challenge the prediction, the assessment, the inference of these black box machines.
500280	504480	And above all, we have the right to understand how they work.
504480	513520	And we have the right to get explanation on the recommendation of the machine.
513520	520040	So what is the solution of these black box artificial intelligence?
520040	526640	Nowadays, in artificial intelligence, there is a sub-discipline that is called explainable
526640	528560	artificial intelligence.
528560	534640	And this is getting at the forefront of artificial intelligence in our society, everywhere in
534640	536640	the world.
536640	541600	So remember my friends who wanted to get some money for his car.
541600	547960	Now let's assume that this black box model is saying, A, there's going to be an increment
547960	550400	in price of 5%.
550400	552400	But it doesn't know.
552400	553400	Why?
553400	559520	Imagine now that there is artificial intelligence that tells, A, there is a 5% increase, add
559520	561080	something more.
561080	564280	For example, he had a statement like this.
564280	570800	The number of buying orders have significantly increased at current prices.
570800	576280	Therefore, investors are willing to enter the market now.
576280	581200	Or in the last months, Bitcoin has dropped by 20%.
581200	584600	Every time it happens, it's strongly rebounded.
584600	589440	Therefore, we have high chances of a positive price increase.
590200	597160	Again, with current trading volumes, there are high chances of a big price move.
597160	601760	As you can see now, we have a prediction from the machine, which is plus 5%.
601760	604680	But we have a set of explanation.
604680	610720	This is in artificial intelligence are called propositional rules.
610720	617440	And you can understand that with this type of information, we can actually inform our
617440	618440	decision-making.
618440	628960	Now, let's go back to the bookstore.
628960	635440	You were losing money, but the model was saying, A, all the people in the shop are happy.
635440	638440	But still, you are making money.
638440	639440	You are losing money.
639440	640440	Sorry.
640440	643240	Imagine you have something like this now.
643240	647480	You have a dashboard of visual analytics.
647480	653000	So now you know the number of people that enter your shop during the day.
653000	657280	So we have in the morning, lunchtime, evening.
657280	660440	As you can see, most of the day, people were happy.
660440	665320	But during lunchtime, there were so many people in your bookstore that even if you put the
665320	670720	books in the right order and organize the book properly, there are so many people that
670720	674840	their experience is negative.
674840	681320	And now, with this visual analytics, we have a better understanding of why and what's going
681320	682600	on.
682600	692240	And again, with this type of information, we can better inform our decision-making.
692240	695640	Now let's go back to my friend.
695640	699120	He was diagnosed a tumor.
699120	704240	I don't know if I would have survived just with this information.
704240	712520	Now imagine the doctor beside this prediction, which is evidently wrongly, has some more
712520	715760	information.
715760	717400	We have two premises.
717400	726240	White pixel in the picture, in tissue, brain tissue, suggests abnormal cells that are present.
726240	731360	And when we have abnormal cells, and we know that they are actually growing after multiple
731360	740160	scan over time, therefore, we have high evidence of a tumor grade 3-4, which is a malignant
740160	742960	tumor.
742960	746920	This is another argument.
746920	752760	The patient reported the recurrent adiabics in the morning, followed by nausea.
752760	755440	And his vision was diminishing over time.
755440	764040	Therefore, there is further evidence that abnormal cells are actually tumor.
764040	766160	But then, we have something different now.
766160	771680	We have a third argument.
771680	779520	Neurological specialists demonstrate a very rare condition called multiple cavernomas.
779520	787400	Multiple cavernomas causes cluster of abnormal blood vessels to form in the brain, causing
787400	789520	headache and seizure.
789520	798360	Therefore, our previous argument, one and two, are no longer applicable.
798360	805160	So now you can imagine that if the doctor would have such information, he would think
805160	808680	twice to say you have a tumor.
808680	813880	In artificial intelligence, this is called the feasible argumentation.
813880	820720	We can express information as arguments, premises, and conclusion, and all of you understand
820720	822040	what's going on.
822040	831640	But also, we can add other arguments, and with this, we can retract the previous conclusion.
831640	840880	As you can see, with this type of information, we can actually inform our decision-making.
840880	850240	So we need to focus on building an artificial intelligence system, not only focus on what,
850240	852360	but also focus on why.
852360	857640	We should build an intelligent machine, focus on what, and on why.
857640	865040	This machine that can actually empower human, that can actually empower our decision-making,
865040	867840	can inform our decision-making.
867840	875240	And we should have the right to understand what's going on and interpret this machine
875240	879000	and interpret their inference.
879000	884800	Alan Turing, who's already 50 years ago, 60 years ago, is considered the father of artificial
884800	888880	intelligence, when everything started.
888880	895520	And yet, the very simple question, can machine think?
895520	898960	Probably some of you know how things have evolved.
898960	904720	And artificial intelligence now is spanning across sector in our life, in our society.
904720	913400	But we have built a very powerful, very accurate, very robust system, but they look like black
913400	914600	boxes.
914600	917440	We don't understand what's going on inside.
917440	922360	We get the input, we take the input, and we get the output.
922360	930040	Stephen Hawkins says, success in creating artificial intelligence will be the biggest
930040	933000	event in human history.
933000	944080	Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.
944080	947800	So it is time to take action.
947800	954960	It is time to build an intelligence machine that can actually inform our decision-making.
954960	961120	We need to take control of this system, intelligence system that we build.
961120	969320	And we need to use this system, artificial intelligence, to empower human intelligence.
969320	978160	We need to do a revolution, a revolution that democratizes artificial intelligence.
978160	984400	It is time to open black boxes.
984400	984600	Thank you.
