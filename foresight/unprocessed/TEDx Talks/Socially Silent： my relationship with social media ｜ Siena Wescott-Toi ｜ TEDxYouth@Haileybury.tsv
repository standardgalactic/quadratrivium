0	18000	Can a life be changed in five weeks? Hello, I'm Sienna and I'm here to tell you about five weeks that changed my life forever.
18000	28000	I'd like to start by asking you all a simple question. How many hours do you think you spend on social media a day?
29000	37000	Social media has been vital in the past two years as what it truly does and intends to do is connect us.
37000	48000	However, I believe social media is about balance. It can create a polarized society, a society addicted to perfection, a social pandemic.
48000	54000	However, social media also has the power to unite and allow people to use their voice.
54000	63000	It began as an exciting new concept, one where people from around the globe could share ideas, memories and moments.
63000	68000	However, with the speed that it grew and the ages it attracted, issues have arisen.
68000	77000	Cyberbullying and societal pressures, just two issues that permeate society, but also all of our lives today.
78000	89000	Picture this. January mid lockdown 2021. I'm sure many of you can agree it was a lonely and difficult time.
89000	94000	Certainly one of the lowest times in my life. Let me tell you why.
94000	99000	I was purely relying on social media as a vessel of escapism.
99000	106000	How you may ask? Well, when I was on my phone it was as if I didn't have to think of anything else.
106000	111000	I was fixated on the screen and that was all I was fixated on.
111000	118000	I could hear my mind and my body telling me it was damaging and I decided to listen to my mind and my body.
118000	127000	It wasn't my parents or friends or family. It was me. I could see it hurting my self confidence, my motivation.
127000	132000	So, I sat in front of a mirror and it came to me.
132000	138000	Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook on the one hand helped keep me socially active.
138000	147000	However, consuming more than eight hours of my day, the time is still from my life and the pressure to constantly keep connected
147000	152000	are precisely the reasons why I chose to become socially silent.
152000	158000	With a click of a finger and a tap on a screen, my social media had gone.
158000	165000	I decided to close off all of my virtual relationships when physical ones didn't exist.
165000	173000	I was able to live carefree and truly experience the moment, the present, the now.
173000	179000	Liberating is the only way I can describe it. It's truly changed my life.
180000	188000	I found that I was spending my time usefully consuming my life with things that only motivated me and kept me going.
188000	194000	I read, I spent time with family, I painted in the garden, I cooked, the list goes on.
194000	199000	I learnt about the world around me. I learnt about my home.
199000	207000	But most importantly, I learnt about how peaceful the world could be without the distraction of social media.
207000	214000	My quality of life had improved, but most importantly, I felt no pressure to conform.
214000	216000	I felt free.
216000	222000	Now, I'm not going to deny that it wasn't hard because it most definitely was at the start.
222000	229000	One becomes so attached to their device. For me, my phone seemed like a safe place, like a haven.
229000	235000	However, I soon realised how truly dangerous it was, like a trap or a prison.
235000	240000	I was scared. I really was. What are people going to think?
240000	244000	Am I weird? Are my attention-seeking? Will I lose friends?
244000	247000	But soon, my fears subsided.
247000	252000	I wasn't weird. I didn't lose friends. If anything, I inspired people.
252000	256000	And that's why I'm standing here today.
256000	258000	I'm not here to purely criticise.
258000	264000	After my social break, I realised the real and principal use of social media is communication.
264000	267000	And that's all I wanted back from it.
267000	270000	I wanted a vessel to communicate.
270000	273000	And that's what social media has become to me.
273000	278000	For ease, for making plans, for talking to loved ones, for talking to friends.
278000	282000	I didn't want endless feeds and superficial standards.
282000	290000	I was ready to create my own relationship with social media, a balanced one that wouldn't overtake my life.
290000	292000	And I have.
293000	301000	I wonder if you know the average hours a teenager spent on social media a day in 2020.
301000	309000	For teenagers aged 13 to 19, it was an average of nine hours a day.
309000	317000	That's 3,285 hours a year, or on average, 173 full days.
317000	320000	That's half a year.
320000	323000	Half a year.
323000	328000	You know, sometimes I sit and wonder, when I'm in my 80s and 90s,
328000	332000	whether I would have lived my life to its fullest potential, met countless people,
332000	336000	been to countless places, experienced countless experiences,
336000	343000	and dare I say it, going off social media for five weeks has taught me three main things.
343000	349000	I've learnt how to use my time to take control because time is precious.
349000	353000	I've learnt my ideal balance.
353000	359000	But most importantly, I have learnt a lot about myself.
359000	367000	So, I sit here today to ask you one favour for however long, in whichever way you would like,
367000	370000	take some time of social media.
370000	377000	Find your balance, find your freedom, find your ideal way to communicate.
377000	384000	Because as soon as I stopped communicating with others, I learnt to communicate with myself.
384000	387000	And that's made me the person I am today.
387000	393000	I hope you can leave here thinking, reflecting and considering this approach
393000	397000	to learning about life, learning about the world through experience,
397000	401000	but most vitally, learning about yourself.
401000	403000	Thank you.
