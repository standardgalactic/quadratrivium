0	22880	Social media is a drug, and I, like so many people today, am totally addicted.
22880	24080	I'm addicted to scrolling.
24080	28560	I'm addicted to making every account on every social media site look perfect.
28560	33200	I'm addicted to liking, to commenting, to seeing photos of random celebrities, to seeing
33200	39880	drama of random celebrities, and to refreshing the same page over and over again.
39880	43760	And with every drug comes a high, a moment when one feels like they're on top of the
43760	48720	world and nothing can stop them, until everything just comes crashing down again.
48720	54520	For me, even if the picture I've posted looks nothing like me or isn't real at all, when
54520	57160	the likes in the comments start pouring in, that's the high.
57160	61880	I feel people must like me, my self-esteem goes up, and I feel this temporary happiness
61880	66840	and this temporary joy, until a couple hours pass by, and the likes in the comments slow
66840	72080	down, and me and my self-esteem just kind of go crashing down again.
72080	76000	Social media can slash down your confidence, and in a fraction of a second make you feel
76000	79240	like the loneliest person in the world.
79240	83080	And this is a problem that persists now within our modern society.
83080	87160	With a couple of taps on a smartphone, anyone can make any account on almost any social
87160	91120	media site and make up a whole life that they don't even have.
91120	95080	And as our technology gets better every single day, it becomes easier and easier for people
95080	99240	to post a picture where they look 20 pounds skinnier, to photoshop themselves into a party
99240	104960	they never went to, or in more extreme cases do things like this, where they put a toilet
104960	110480	seat up against a window, so it looks like they're going on an exotic vacation, even
110480	112840	if they're actually not.
112840	116960	This phenomenon is particularly prominent in what is now known as influencers on social
116960	119000	media.
119000	121800	Influencers look like they live the amazing life.
121800	126080	They're usually on any social media platform, but specifically Instagram and YouTube and
126080	129120	have millions of followers or subscribers.
129120	133400	As I said before, their life looks perfect and even companies use them to promote products
133400	135480	for easy advertising.
135480	140760	Looking at a social media influencer can make the average person feel pretty insecure at
140760	141760	times.
141880	148840	An example of one of these influencers is James Charles, a 19 year old makeup artist
148840	152840	with over 15 million followers a minute.
152840	156440	He doesn't look bad in any single photo on his Instagram.
156440	161720	His makeup is always flawless and he never shows you the time or the money it takes to
161720	167240	put all that on, so it looks quick and easy and like he did it in a minute.
167240	170440	Another one, Hailey Baldwin Bieber.
170440	175760	She has over 18.3 million followers and she posts pictures of herself under the most beautiful
175760	177640	beaches in the world.
177640	180520	Spoiler alert, nobody wakes up and looks like that.
180520	185400	It takes time, energy, money, and so many different resources.
185400	190560	And I'm not a fancy influencer, but I'll admit I do it myself.
190560	195080	I mean, I know this talk is probably going to be shared somewhere on the internet, so
195080	197600	I dressed up better than I normally do.
197640	203000	In real life, my hair is large and curly, I wear glasses and I prefer to wear big sweatshirts
203000	204320	over anything else.
204320	208200	But on every single photo on my Instagram, my hair has been straightened, I have my contacts
208200	211960	in, my makeup's done, and I'm dressed up far better than I do regularly.
211960	217360	Me, influencers, and so many other people now, only put on Instagram what we want other
217360	218960	people to see.
218960	221960	When you're scrolling through Instagram, you only see what the Instagrammer has specifically
221960	226200	designed, specific moments in their time where they're looking happy and they're dressed
226240	229920	up and nobody has to see any other part of their life.
229920	234840	According to sociologist Julie Albright from University of Southern California, people's
234840	238880	persona online may be much more fabulous, much more exciting than the everyday life that
238880	240720	they're leading.
240720	244160	And this isn't a problem just for teenagers anymore.
244160	247440	I mean, my grandparents have Facebook.
247440	252600	I was born in 2001 on this weird generation Z millennial cusp, and I'll find that I spend
252600	256560	hours on Instagram and Snapchat and just end up feeling sorry for myself.
256560	260360	I wonder why people who I haven't even spoken to in years look like they have their entire
260360	262320	life together, and I don't.
262320	265840	I wonder why it looks like everyone's having the best time ever.
265840	270560	And with these photos quite literally in my face all the time, it's so easy to wonder
270560	276400	why am I not that pretty, why am I not that skinny, or why am I not that popular or cool.
276400	280040	I had a conversation with a teacher of mine as well, a millennial who says one of the
280040	281840	worst parts about social media.
281840	284920	It's going out to Facebook and seeing people she used to go to school with now raising
284920	286400	their own families.
286400	289200	This makes her wonder, is she raising her family right?
289200	293160	And how can she make her son just as good or even better than every single other kid
293160	294920	she sees on Facebook?
294920	297360	And I've seen it in my little sister too, Generation Z.
297360	301320	I've seen her swiping through Snapchat wondering how it looks like every other middle schooler
301320	305680	in the world is the most secure person in the world.
305680	308080	We all know that's probably not true.
308360	312360	Although social media can make us feel so lonely.
312360	316680	It's so easy to feel alone when it looks like every other person has it together and you
316680	318480	feel like you don't.
318480	323480	So it shouldn't take any big scientific discovery to promote the claim that social media has
323480	326200	detrimental effects on our mental health.
326200	329800	But scientists have done the study and it's proven true.
329800	333960	Melissa G. Hunt from University of Pennsylvania stated that using less social media than you
333960	339200	normally do would lead to significant decreases in both oppression and loneliness.
339200	344560	And George Albrecht from University of Amsterdam stated passive social media use co-occurred
344560	348840	with a loss of interest, concentration problems, fatigue and loneliness.
348840	351000	So what do we do?
351000	352360	We can't just avoid social media.
352360	353360	It's everywhere.
353360	354360	It's on our news.
354360	355360	It's in our schools.
355360	356360	It's in our homes.
356360	357360	It's in our workplaces.
357360	360480	It's impossible to just forget about it.
360480	363560	But it has given us a huge advantage in some ways.
363560	366840	We have the ability to communicate more than ever before.
366840	368640	And that's amazing.
368640	372160	I'm about to go to college and I've talked to people from all around the world that
372160	376280	I'll be going to school with next year and I've talked with my roommate so many times.
376280	379440	When my parents went to college, they had no idea who they'd be living with for the
379440	381080	next year.
381080	384800	And my TED Talks from the past few years have been put on YouTube and my message about mental
384800	389240	health has spread to people who I will never know.
389240	394320	So in the words of Stanley and his favorite comic book, Spider-Man, with great power comes
394320	396080	great responsibility.
396080	400080	Social media has given us an amazing advantage to communicate, to share ideas, to bring people
400080	402240	from all around the world together.
402240	405880	But it's also made it easier for people to fake their lives, fake a personality and for
405880	408880	us to become more insecure.
408880	412960	And going back to the Instagram influencers, it's hard sometimes to just remind ourselves
412960	417600	that not everyone is going to look like the favorite celebrity.
417960	423240	Jamila Jamil, an actress known for the NBC show The Good Place, has now started a campaign
423240	425640	called I-Way.
425640	429800	The purpose of her campaign is to call out and show celebrities and point out to regular
429800	433880	people that celebrities and influencers have amazing resources to some of the best food,
433880	438680	the best personal trainers, the best gyms, and the best magazine editors in the world.
438680	442080	So no wonder they look better than the average person.
442080	446560	Jamil has also called out celebrities who are now using their fans' weight insecurities
446600	450920	to sell diet pills so everyone can look just as good as they do.
450920	454520	Jamila has become the beginning of an amazing campaign to make us feel better in our bodies
454520	459800	and not to compare ourselves with every single person we see on the internet.
459800	463760	And sometimes when you're just at your worst, it's better just to delete the apps off your
463760	466000	phone.
466000	469520	Sometimes as I said, when I'm feeling my worst, I just delete the apps off my phone.
469520	473480	I don't delete the accounts necessarily, but without the apps physically there, there's
473480	476960	nothing for me to be just checking throughout the day.
476960	480320	And usually I can go for weeks out of time until I feel comfortable enough that I can
480320	484560	redownload it and it won't affect my mental health so much.
484560	489760	So I know a week's hard, but I ask all of you, take one day, just delete the apps off
489760	494920	your phone, whatever it is, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, MySpace, whatever
494920	501240	it is, delete it for one day, and I promise that it'll be like a huge weight taking off
501240	502240	your chest.
502240	507400	You may find that you have more time to do things you like, like making music, dancing
507400	510120	or volunteering with kids.
510120	514920	So if there's one message that you take from this talk, it's I hope that you know you are
514920	519600	not defined by the amount of likes and comments on your post on social media.
519600	524880	Social media is not real, and no way can a single account on a social media website encapsulate
524880	528760	the entire brilliant personality of a single human being.
528760	529760	Thank you.
529760	530760	Thank you.
