27320	33660	When I left university, I would've probably laughed in your face, because let's be honest, it's quite ridiculous.
34640	36380	How did I get here?
36880	40880	..It's a question II ask myself quite, quite often to be honest,
41460	47660	..but really I think if we wind back and look at where the beginning of my career started
48220	50880	..it was kind of a different planet.
51740	56720	The side of my university career I was also working in fashion retail.

140840	150840	The Devil Wears Prada is actually not a work of fiction at all. It's a pretty accurate representation of what work culture was like on magazines in the noughties.
150840	155840	Some of my editors were comically demanding.
155840	164840	Once, one of them came over to my desk and unrolled the pair of socks that she was wearing, handed them to me and asked me to hand wash them for her
164840	169840	in the criminal lose and then use a hairdryer to dry them.
169840	173840	I will never know why.
173840	178840	It was also pretty poorly paid and when I say pretty I mean extremely.
178840	189840	I worked as a fashion intern for £50 a week expenses for two years and that was nine to nine Monday to Friday for under £3k a year.
189840	194840	It was a really tough gig when you came from a normal person background.
194840	202840	Both my parents grew up in council houses and I'm the first person in my family to get A levels let alone go to university.
202840	207840	So there wasn't exactly a trust fund waiting in the wings to tide me through.
207840	218840	When I started my first proper job, as in I was on staff, my first salary was £14,500 living in central London and working there too.
219840	229840	By the time I was in my mid 30s as a senior editor, on a national magazine, I was still earning well below the London fridge.
229840	240840	Now look, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of poorly paid jobs out there and most of them, let's be honest, are offering the community slightly more importance than mine.
241840	254840	But it's pretty rare you would be paid so little to do a job which projects such an image of glamour that expects you to be dressed head to toe in designer clothes every day with a perfect blow dry.
254840	265840	The disparity between the fantasy of what everyone thought my life was and the reality of how I was actually living in the end got too much for me.
265840	281840	My crunch moment came when I was 31. My husband had just left me and I was in terrible debt and I can remember even though I was working 60 hour weeks having to call my dad up to ask to borrow some money to get a tooth filling.
282840	295840	I just felt like such a failure and what made it all the much worse was that everyone I knew thought I was living this glamorous exciting job, you know, and that I was a success as a person.
295840	306840	I decided to make the break, I quit my job and embarked on a quest to find a way to carry on working in an industry I loved while being able to support myself.
307840	313840	Now, in the midst of all this, the landscape had been changing dramatically.
313840	328840	When I first started my final job on magazines, my editor told me to bin my blackberry and set up an Instagram account and pretty soon I'd attracted a few thousand followers who all got to see the fantasy side of my life.
329840	336840	They didn't get to see the divorce or the debt and they definitely never saw my bad hair days.
337840	349840	I set up a small digital agency to help brands create content for their social channels and their online channels and started to really invest time in grabbing my own Instagram profile.
349840	354840	Soon I became a small player in the social media economy.
354840	362840	Apologies if you all know this, but for those of you who aren't big users of social media, this is how it works.
362840	378840	Back in the day, a brand would have heard a certain amount of advertising and marketing budget which would have been divvied up across traditional channels of advertising like billboards, television and magazines, things that we all kind of understood.
379840	396840	These days, a good percentage of that budget goes to people like me and the reason is that as we've built our platforms, we have gained the trust of our followers and that trust has translated into influencing their purchasing decisions.
396840	398840	It is pretty effective.
398840	407840	In fact, what social media has done is turbo charged the power of word of mouth recommendation.
407840	412840	Now don't get me wrong, you can lose the trust of those followers pretty quickly.
412840	421840	If tomorrow you log on to my Instagram account and I am suddenly advertising teeth whitening strips, I accept that maybe you'll be leaving the day after.
421840	432840	But at the beginning, what brands really wanted to do was to get to work with these influencers who had the highest proportion of followers.
432840	438840	It was all about the huge audiences and a total numbers game.
438840	448840	The thing is, those accounts, the ones that got the most followers, were generally all pretty much the same and they projected the same lifestyle.
448840	453840	A wealthy, glamorous world in which nothing had ever gone wrong.
453840	460840	It was a world that I was very, very ofe with, let's just say, coming from fashion magazines.
460840	466840	My account followed that pattern, that kind of template to a T.
466840	474840	But after about a year of making my money that way, I don't know what it was, but I started to feel a deep sense of unease.
474840	477840	I couldn't put my finger on it.
477840	488840	My damasin moment happened, ironically, in Tulum, Mexico, potentially the most Instagrammable destination in the entire world.
489840	497840	I was sitting on my sun lounger, trying to deal with a really tricky email from, let's call it, a challenging client.
497840	504840	In the background, I could hear one of my girlfriends on the end of the phone to her factory dealing with a significant production issue.
504840	510840	To my left was yet another mate who was going through the most brutal breakup.
510840	516840	To my right, another friend who was dealing with some pretty serious family trauma.
517840	524840	All of us were dealing with something either on a professional or personal level.
524840	528840	And then I looked at the pictures we were all posting.
528840	531840	I bet you can imagine what they looked like.
531840	543840	Sunsets, cocktails, pictures of us all together living our best life in designer bikinis, and something inside me just burst.
543840	548840	I felt like I wanted to scream, this is not real life.
548840	553840	None of these girls are this goddamn happy the entire time.
553840	561840	On that trip, I decided that if I was going to carry on making my money this way,
561840	567840	I was also going to have to start talking about the other side of my life too.
568840	573840	I was going to write about my divorce, I was going to write about my debt,
573840	576840	and my eating issues, and my fertility issues,
576840	585840	and I was going to ask every woman that I knew in both magazine and social media worlds to do the same too.
585840	591840	On the day that I set up workworkwork.co, I received about 50 emails.
591840	597840	The next day, there was another 50 in my inbox, and it continued for weeks.
597840	602840	And broadly, all of the messages said exactly the same thing.
602840	607840	And that was, thank God someone said something.
607840	610840	The relief was palpable.
610840	614840	And don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy.
614840	624840	Telling everybody that you're quite poor after you've been creating this kind of image of glamorous globetrotter for 10 years,
624840	631840	let's be honest, it's a bit awkward, but it also felt so, to be honest.
631840	637840	As I was doing the interviews for the website, one theme kept cropping up time and time again,
637840	644840	and that was the psychological impact of viewing so many images of perfection all day every day.
644840	652840	And this was a universal situation, it didn't matter where these people came from, it didn't matter how much they had.
652840	656840	Over my time on social media, it's made me feel many things.
656840	663840	Unattractive, overweight, stupid and seriously devoid of a sense of humour.
663840	668840	It's made me feel lonely, it's made me feel really unpopular.
668840	675840	It's made me feel poor, but also that I should be spending money that I actually didn't have.
675840	679840	Ultimately, it's fuelled my insecurities.
679840	688840	But this isn't a niche issue, and the more and more I spoke with other women, the more and more I understood that we all feel the same.
688840	694840	And that's why I decided it was really time to tackle this problem head on.
694840	699840	Four months ago, I released my book, Why Social Media's Ruining a Life,
699840	703840	and you may say, biting the hand that feeds, I've heard it.
703840	716840	But equally, I managed to interview international influencers with a following of over 10 million academics, researchers, psychoanalysts, therapists, plastic surgeons,
716840	723840	and all the evidence in a highly abbreviated nutshell pointed into the same direction.
723840	732840	If we continue to use social media the way we have been, we will seriously jeopardise our future health and happiness.
732840	737840	Now, don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic stories about social media as well.
737840	745840	And as humans, it's the way we use technology rather than technology being necessarily nefarious.
745840	751840	For myself, social media has enabled me to continue working while looking after my little boy.
751840	758840	It's meant that I have found this holy grail of working in fashion while being able to support myself.
758840	763840	Importantly, it's meant that I will never wash another woman's pair of socks.
763840	773840	But if we do not change both our mindset and our behaviour, this obsessive comparison, soul-destroing envy,
773840	780840	passive social media use, you'll recognise it, the stalking, the creeping, the lurking.
780840	789840	We, and generations following us, will continue to be feeling these feelings of deep insecurity.
790840	797840	To underline the point, I went back through my social media feed and started reposting pictures where I'd looked happy as Larry,
797840	802840	but actually my world had been falling apart behind the scenes.
803840	813840	I posted pictures of myself where I'd been in beautiful hotel rooms, but actually I'd just been dumped in that hotel room.
813840	818840	I posted pictures of myself where I was on these dreamy holidays that looked so fantastic,
818840	825840	but I'd actually spent the whole time in a pit of despair thinking about the state of my thighs.
825840	829840	I posted pictures where I'd just had morning sickness off camera.
829840	834840	I posted pictures where I'd just had a row with my boyfriend, and I told those true stories.
834840	839840	Beside each picture, I used the hashtag, why social media is ruining your life.
839840	844840	Soon, other women started posting similar images in solidarity.
845840	851840	A few days later, Sky News got in touch, and then the newspapers and magazines followed, and it went wild.
852840	863840	This time, when my inbox was inundated, it was a lot of parents saying that they'd used the campaign to show their kids the difference between the lived life and the online life.
863840	870840	But there were also lots of messages from people that I knew who said that they'd had literally no idea what I was going through,
870840	874840	and that I'd really made them look at social media in a different light.
875840	884840	Now today, social media still pays my mortgage, but I now understand that I have the power to affect change
884840	887840	and not just send people to their next pair of shoes.
887840	891840	Now don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that fantasy.
891840	896840	You know, magazines, they changed the entire trajectory of my future.
896840	899840	As a teenager looking at them, they were everything.
900840	912840	But we need to ground our expectation of reality, of what real life will be like, in the nitty-gritty of what real life is actually like.
913840	921840	Otherwise, the Monday morning commute, the inevitable break-ups, the awful financial struggles that we all go through,
921840	929840	the emotional challenges which, let's be honest, are just part and parcel of a life, they start to feel unbearable.
929840	940840	We start to believe that we are the only ones who suffer while the rest of the world swings their Gucci handbag nonchalantly by as they go by on their busy, perfect lives.
942840	947840	Everyone has demons, no matter how many followers, no matter how much money you have.
947840	957840	And whether you communicate that online or not, they're still there, so you can't use social media to judge how anyone's getting through anything.
958840	960840	Let me give a final example.
960840	965840	Every time I post a picture of myself online, I'll probably have taken a hundred images.
966840	976840	I choose one picture to put up, normally the most flattering, and you get to see a 1% glimpse of one moment of my day.
976840	981840	You have no idea what's going on in my head or my heart.
981840	986840	I could have just been sick, I could have just been dumped, I could have just lost my job.
987840	997840	So don't let those 1% images affect the way you feel about your real life, the one that you're living beyond the squares and screens.
998840	999840	Thank you so much.
