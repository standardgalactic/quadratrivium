00:00.000 --> 00:17.720
Well, imagine a 14-year-old teenager in the largest city of Brazil, facing a modeling

00:17.720 --> 00:22.200
career which is in the beginning, chasing a dream.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.720
I found myself in my black bikinis and high heels, holding my modeling portfolio for the

00:26.720 --> 00:32.360
very first time, and I was standing in front of this designer who had the power of choosing

00:32.360 --> 00:35.720
me or not for his fashion show.

00:35.720 --> 00:40.360
And let me tell you, in the modeling industry, if you're lucky, the designers will ask you

00:40.360 --> 00:44.640
to walk, try and close, and return another day.

00:44.640 --> 00:50.520
On the other hand, if you're unlucky, they'll coldly and maybe even rudely ask you to leave.

00:50.520 --> 00:56.040
Let's just say this time I was pretty unlucky, and I felt devastated.

00:56.040 --> 01:01.680
But that traumatizing moment allowed me to discover the amount of power I had in my hands.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.680
Literally, in my hands.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.440
As soon as I left that room, I grabbed my cell phone and I began opening up to my 500

01:10.440 --> 01:14.840
followers at the time about my failure and how it ignited a flame on me to do better

01:14.840 --> 01:16.960
the next time.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.840
But I was most surprised with the response I had from my followers.

01:20.840 --> 01:27.920
So many of them identified themselves and deeply thanked me for the words of motivation.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.480
And from that moment on, I began sharing my daily experiences on social media, and I used

01:33.480 --> 01:39.600
my platform to showcase my modeling work, arts, love for the environment, my hardships,

01:39.600 --> 01:46.040
and most importantly, how I overcame them, but always maintaining a smile on my face.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.240
And I saw my followers beginning to grow.

01:49.240 --> 01:56.880
And now I'm 17 years old, and I have almost 340 followers on all my social platforms.

01:56.880 --> 02:03.840
And I call it the art of connecting through vulnerability.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.560
As soon as I left that room, I opened up for all my followers.

02:08.560 --> 02:14.280
And by sharing the messages, and by sharing the lessons I learned while trying to become

02:14.280 --> 02:19.080
the best individual I possibly can, I'm able to inspire and be inspired by so many

02:19.080 --> 02:20.080
people.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.360
I'm able to change someone's day.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.120
I have the power to make someone smile.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.720
Actually, we all do.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.320
Even if it's only one person, it's worth it, because smiles multiply exponentially when

02:33.320 --> 02:36.200
they're ignited by love.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.160
And now, I guess you're waiting for the moment where I'm going to talk about the negative

02:40.160 --> 02:44.200
aspects of social media, which, well, there are many.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.480
A classic example is this one.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.960
I'm sure we've all seen.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.480
All our friends in the dinner table, in a party, and everybody's looking down.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.000
Everybody's looking at their phones.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.640
So yeah, if we do not use it with caution, we can become passive consumers of it, and

02:59.640 --> 03:02.440
maybe even addicts to it.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.520
But we have a tendency to focus on the negative aspects of things.

03:06.520 --> 03:11.760
And if personal interrelationships are one of the key aspects in life, then social media

03:11.760 --> 03:14.560
allows us to facilitate this.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.200
It has allowed us to break barriers in communication.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.640
I can literally send a tweet to the president.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.520
I don't know if you'll answer me, but still, I have the power to do so.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.240
We all have.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.320
And that's what matters.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.280
This device, which I'm sure we all have less than a meter away from us, allows us to communicate

03:33.280 --> 03:36.320
with the entire world.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.200
And social media is the present and the future of our generation.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.680
We can fast from it, control the amount we use it, but there's no definite escape from

03:44.680 --> 03:47.080
it.

03:47.080 --> 03:56.040
And that's why, while using our social media, we should be careful and always maintain a

03:56.040 --> 03:58.880
positive attitude.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.360
It has caused such an impact because it's changed the way we live our lives.

04:02.360 --> 04:07.000
Now, we don't need huge physical encyclopedias anymore, but we do need to be careful with

04:07.000 --> 04:08.880
what we post on social media.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.360
And that's scary, right?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.360
Yeah.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.960
It's scary to leave our comfort zones, but maybe we should.

04:14.960 --> 04:20.480
And I've always heard people talking about social media as if it is this toxic environment.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.560
And for a while, I ended up believing it was.

04:23.560 --> 04:32.040
But as soon as I discovered that by sharing the lessons we learn, and by knowing that

04:32.040 --> 04:38.280
it will only become a toxic environment, because we allow it to be, I changed my mind.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.400
So I was curious to see if people actually thought it was such a toxic environment.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.600
And I decided to make a survey on my Instagram account, which I would say is quite ironic.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.600
And these were the answers.

04:48.600 --> 04:55.600
9,050 people entered the survey, and 90% believed it is a toxic environment.

04:55.600 --> 05:02.960
But what is most shocking about these results is why they thought it was such a toxic environment.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.760
Most of the answers referred to this illusion we are able to create virtually.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.800
We can selectively share only the positive aspects of life, while the people who are

05:12.800 --> 05:17.120
viewing it, they will compare their entire life.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.760
And therefore, I decided to ask them how they thought we could change the situation.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.840
And there were three main answers.

05:24.840 --> 05:30.960
Firstly, we should share our reality, meaning that sharing our hardships may be more powerful

05:30.960 --> 05:36.160
and more impacting on people's lives than only sharing the positive things.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.480
Secondly, stop comparing each other.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.240
We are all unique, and that's what makes us special.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.880
And thirdly, we should be more aware of what is shared on social media.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.000
Every single thing we share will have an impact on someone.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.360
Therefore, let's be careful and not be shared, and make sure we only share what's positive.

05:57.360 --> 06:02.640
And therefore, I decided to create this formula called effects.

06:02.640 --> 06:08.840
And effects measures the impacts every single post will have on the followers on social media.

06:10.840 --> 06:17.120
I decided to measure how much I impacted my followers.

06:17.120 --> 06:22.400
And as soon as I noticed the amount I actually impacted on their lives, I tried to merge

06:22.400 --> 06:27.640
what I discovered from the survey and my personal experiences to create this formula.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.600
A means aesthetic.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.400
Is the aesthetic of your post visually pleasing?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.320
F stands for function and purpose.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.960
What is the function of your post?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.040
What is the intention?

06:40.040 --> 06:42.320
Is it for the good?

06:42.320 --> 06:44.280
E stands for energy.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.720
Does the energy your post creates is a positive one?

06:48.720 --> 06:50.560
K stands for knowledge.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.040
Does your post create relevant and new knowledge?

06:54.040 --> 06:56.360
And S stands for sustainability.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.720
Is your post encouraging sustainability?

06:59.720 --> 07:04.760
This is a formula which you can use in every single post and it will work just fine.

07:04.760 --> 07:11.560
So, an example is this photograph I posted on my social media.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.880
Before I posted it, I checked its effects.

07:14.880 --> 07:21.960
My intention was to raise awareness about plastic use and encourage people to use to run beach cleanups.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.680
So, it has a pleasant overall aesthetic.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.720
It is providing, it has a clear function.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.920
It is providing people with good energy.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.800
It will generate good energy.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.200
And the knowledge is provided by the caption.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.480
And obviously, it's encouraging sustainability.

07:40.480 --> 07:46.680
But these are vital aspects which I consider in every single post I make on my social account.

07:46.680 --> 07:52.520
But the formula is easily malleable and easily adaptable to the intention of your post.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.720
This is a video I posted on my Instagram channel.

07:55.720 --> 08:04.000
And it has as an intention to help students, just like me, to organize their mind before studying.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.600
And this time, the knowledge is much more important than the sustainability aspect.

08:09.600 --> 08:16.960
Therefore, I simply cut sustainability out and introduce another case as a formula.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.440
And this is a form of joining our digital life and our real life and making them run side by side.

08:25.440 --> 08:33.280
Every single time this formula is applied, your post will necessarily provide good energy and positive energy.

08:33.280 --> 08:39.680
And therefore, this will boost people's lives when they're offline, when they're off the platform.

08:39.720 --> 08:45.000
And while I came to the conclusion that while I cannot control the behavior of others,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.120
I can control my own.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.560
And I'm far from perfect, don't get me wrong.

08:49.560 --> 08:55.360
But still, I try to use my space inside this platform for good.

08:55.360 --> 09:02.040
And social media has allowed me to become not only a fashion model, but a role model for so many people.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.000
And I invite you all to do the same.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.440
I invite you all to try applying the effects formula on your next five posts on social media.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.000
And simply observe its effects.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.280
We have a very powerful tool on our hands.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.720
Let's use it for the good.

09:19.720 --> 09:24.720
Let's enjoy the right of life while trying to become the best individual we possibly can.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.280
And helping others, by the way, let's help others to expand.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
Thank you.
