00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Hi, thank you very much.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,960
I'd like to start out by asking everyone to power down their devices during my talk.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,080
And for those of you that don't know, the power button is either on the top or on the

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
side of your phone.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,080
I'd also like to thank the guys from state.com for permission to use this video.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,080
I want to post about how great this coffee is, but I can't think of a funny way to say it.

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
This post is like a page long.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
How do I shorten this?

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Just take out all the vowels.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,080
No, seriously, seriously.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Hey guys, you on Twitter?

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Follow me.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Sometimes I want to move to another country where I wouldn't have to deal with this stuff.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
What?

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm just tweeting.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Do you think I'm making fun of you?

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Hashtag follow the day.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Hashtag, I quit.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Just kidding.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Hashtag multi-tasking.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Hashtag squirm work.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Hashtag road trip, dudes.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Not while you're driving, man.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Hashtag yo, Loi.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Has anybody even been on this?

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Fasties.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
Coffee friends.

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Mini bagels.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Shoes.

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
On subscribe.

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
What's up, Facebook?

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Follow my new shoes.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Unfollow.

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Ah, look!

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Coffee.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
We're going viral.

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Nobody cares.

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm going to hide all of you.

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Dude, I made the popular page.

40
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,080
So I want to talk about three things tonight.

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,080
How social media is disconnecting us.

42
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
What's happening now.

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080
And how we can do better.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Gallup took a poll in 2001.

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,080
And every average American said that they had 10 really close friends.

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,080
The same poll this year said we had two.

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
So what happened?

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Where did everybody go?

49
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
And I think we know where.

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I think we've all seen this by now.

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Maybe even been a little guilty of it ourselves.

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,080
I see families like this out to dinner all the time.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
And it drives me nuts.

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,080
And I see couples on dates, clearly together, but on their cell phones.

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
It's one of the strangest things I've ever seen.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
But to me, what does this say when we are together?

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,080
To me, it says that there's someone, anyone on the other end of the screen,

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
that's way more important than you, who's right in front of my face.

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,080
There's a study by a merry maker that says we touch our phones or check our phones

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
150 times a day.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
And we upload 1.8 billion pictures to Facebook.

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,080
That's a little over a sixth of the population a day for pictures.

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Remember when the internet was new?

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Those of us that do?

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
That was really actually only about 25 years ago, if you can imagine.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
I remember when we had pagers, time seemed a little simpler back then.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,080
You'd get the beep, you may return the call, you may not return the call.

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Or when we had answer machines, you could always say that you weren't home.

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Now we have a list of all these excuses that may or may not work.

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,080
But it seems like the more we talk about how technology divides us,

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,080
the more we demand from it.

72
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,080
And I think that's a huge risk that we're running in our society today.

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,080
We have this shortened vocabulary now.

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
It's all about the texting.

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Even my mom, she says, just text me.

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,080
And she's a little bit older, I won't say, because she'll see this later.

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:07,080
So, OMG, oh my goodness, LOL, laugh out loud, WTF, why the face?

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,080
So when we abbreviate our vocabulary, what we risk is losing the nuances, subtleties,

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,080
and intimate parts of our personalities that make up our very rich American vocabulary.

80
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,080
And with that shortening, we lose and run the risk of not being able to fully express ourselves

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
and communicate as we move forward.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,080
And that losing our vocabulary equals a potential loss of being able to express ourselves.

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,080
How many times does anybody look in horror when their cell phone rings with a personal call?

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,080
A whole conversation starts happening in your head when it rings.

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Tiffany, why is Tiffany calling?

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
What does Tiffany want?

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Why is she calling me?

88
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
And then you have that last ringtone moment where you know you have to pick up that phone

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,080
or let it go to a voicemail you may or may not check.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
Hey, Tiffany, what's up?

91
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,080
The whole time thinking she could have completely texted this whole message to me.

92
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:21,080
If I asked everybody in here if they could take their phone, set it down, and walk away for an hour, could you do it?

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,080
An immediate sense of panic comes over us.

94
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:34,080
We will turn the car around, even if we are halfway to our destination, just to go back and get our cell phone.

95
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,080
I had a blackberry, which I adored, and I kept it for a really long time.

96
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,080
But you guys remember when we had blackberries, don't you?

97
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
What did we call them back then?

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
That's right, crackberries.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,080
So it's no surprise where we've landed ourselves now.

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,080
So I took my blackberry into the Apple Store when everybody else had their Apple phone

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,080
and the transition was more than I could bear experiencing phone shame.

102
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,080
And I went in, and of course it was completely jam-packed at the Apple Store, and this cute kid comes up to me,

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
and he's like, may I help you?

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
And I said, yes, you can.

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
I would like a phone that could do this.

106
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,080
So I took my blackberry and I threw it on the ground, but pop, pop, pop.

107
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
It goes all the way across the store.

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Everybody just stops in the store, gasps.

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,080
And I walk over and I pick it up, and I said, see the screen's fully intact and it still works.

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:41,080
And he just looked not missing a beat, and he said, we don't have a phone that can do that.

111
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,080
A new study out by the Cohen's Children Medical Center in New Hyde Park,

112
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,080
their study says this year that texting while driving is now the number one cause of death for teens.

113
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,080
More than drinking and driving.

114
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,080
So what this means is there's a lot of drunks on the road.

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,080
I was speaking to some high school students, and of course, you know, they're always willing to make some sort of bargain,

116
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,080
and they raise their hand and they said, well, what if you're at a stop sign?

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Or what if you're at a stoplight?

118
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,080
And I said my message was I don't think there's really anything that can't wait until we get to our destination.

119
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,080
And don't forget if you send that text at the stop sign, they're probably going to text you back while you're driving.

120
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
So maybe not the best idea.

121
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
And I'll give you an example.

122
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
If you're driving 55 miles an hour and you look down at your phone for five seconds,

123
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,080
you've just now driven the length of an entire football field completely blind.

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
And it's not just our kids.

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
It's us as well.

126
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:57,080
We are constantly at work, constantly connected, and constantly distracted.

127
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Every one of us thinks of some sort of extreme vacation we need to go on where we may say to our bosses,

128
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
you know, I'm going to go on a very extreme vacation.

129
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
There's just absolutely no way I can return anything during the day.

130
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,080
But you're still expected to go back to the hotel and return your work emails.

131
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,080
So if we as adults are this distracted, our kids are seeing this.

132
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
We're always at work.

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
And where are they?

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Always on their devices.

135
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,080
And how many times have you guys heard, what do you mean you don't know?

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
I posted it on Facebook.

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,080
So for some reason now, we're all supposed to know about each other's lives because they posted it on Facebook.

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
And I don't know that you climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,080
You didn't tell me last week when we were at brunch.

140
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,080
And what do we present really when we are on Facebook?

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,080
We present an idyllic life, perfect parenting, great relationships.

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,080
We never give any bad news or copy about ourselves because that doesn't make for a lot of likes.

143
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Different high school group I was speaking to and they raised their hand and educated me on something I didn't know.

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,080
They said, you know, we wait until five o'clock before we post our Instagram pictures

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,080
because that's when we know all of our friends are out and we'll get the most traffic.

146
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
I thought that was pretty interesting.

147
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,080
And then they started talking a little bit more about how they get jealous.

148
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,080
So if one person gets more likes on Instagram than the other, then they just take it down.

149
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:42,080
So there's all this emotional turmoil and strife going on with our number of likes somehow equaling our self-esteem.

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,080
We are all our own public relations firms, always trying to figure out how we can increase our numbers.

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Work sometimes demands that from us as well.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Certainly we do that a lot in our personal life.

153
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
And this is what we present on Facebook.

154
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I mean, here's who we really are in real life.

155
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
And this is what we present on Facebook.

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Guilty, a little bit of it.

157
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,080
We have the selfie now.

158
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,080
And if you think about a selfie, it's rather a sad invention.

159
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,080
It's us taking a picture of ourselves by ourselves.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Maybe we can get two more people if somebody really has a long arm.

161
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
The bathroom selfie, I find this hilarious.

162
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
I see it all the time.

163
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm like, oh great, that's you in front of a mirror.

164
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Great, going to a party I probably was not invited to, that you're going to be selfieing your way through while I watch Home Alone on Facebook.

165
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
We have the Oscar selfie.

166
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
That was a lot of fun.

167
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,080
That crashed the Twitter feed, I think most people now.

168
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,080
And then we have the funeral selfie, not so fun.

169
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,080
She looks very unpleased.

170
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:07,080
And we have the driving selfie because I mentioned research shows that won't kill you at all.

171
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I think we would all live life better if we had hands to hold rather than keys to click.

172
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Thank you.

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I think we need to take that pause in our life.

174
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Make mud pies, build a fort, take the time to gaze at the clouds for rhinosporuses and unicorns screen free.

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,080
And if change starts from within, we are that change.

176
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
We can be that change.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And teach our kids what it was like before we lived life in front of a screen.

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,080
We can use social media to create positive face-to-face groups and organizations and meeting places like we have tonight.

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Not hashtag activism, but people activism.

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,080
We need to look up and see who our neighbor is.

181
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,080
We need to look up and put that phone away.

182
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Make a human connection, teach human interaction as if it were as important as the very breath we breathe.

183
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Look up at me, look up at each other, and look up at you.

184
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,080
And I'm going to ask everyone in here to take a screen free challenge, unplug for one hour a day.

185
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,080
And if you like this message, please share it.

186
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Thank you very much.
