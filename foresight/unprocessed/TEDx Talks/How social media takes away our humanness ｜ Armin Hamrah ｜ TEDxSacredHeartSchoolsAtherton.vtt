00:00.000 --> 00:19.520
Hi, I'm Armin and wait, hold on one second.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.920
Alright where was I?

00:20.920 --> 00:25.200
Okay so obviously I was scripted and I meant it in a lighthearted way because it can be

00:25.200 --> 00:28.120
amusing when we recognize our own faults.

00:28.120 --> 00:32.480
What is not so funny is when our faults limit our real life interactions.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.880
We have all been the person to whip out our phone at the wrong time, but rarely are we

00:35.880 --> 00:37.440
called out for it.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.880
Why is that?

00:39.880 --> 00:44.520
We are the creators of social media, we have accustomed to this irrational idea that replacing

00:44.520 --> 00:48.160
real conversations with online communication is okay.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.880
I'm here to prove to you that it is not.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.600
Social media has begun to encroach upon our humanity, to the point that it even takes

00:55.600 --> 00:58.080
away our humaneness.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.160
Now you may be wondering what this really means.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.440
The dictionary says that it involves the nature of people.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.760
Technology and more specifically social media are quite evidently not in our nature.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.160
Not only does it change what we do, but it changes who we are.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.120
The instant you were born were you inclined to send a snap to your friend or to cry, looking

01:22.120 --> 01:24.400
into your mom's eyes.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.880
The name social media also misses with our minds a little, making us think that what

01:28.880 --> 01:30.680
we are doing is social.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.480
In reality, it is the polar opposite.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.160
In order to identify how social media brought us here, we need to examine our past.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.320
So let me give you a brief overview of how social media came to be.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.000
The first recognizable source of social media was Six Degrees, founded by Andrew Wynredt

01:48.000 --> 01:53.840
in 1997, aiming to help friends communicate in a more convenient way, online.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.480
The first renowned source of social media, Facebook, was launched seven years later by

01:57.480 --> 01:58.960
Mark Zuckerberg.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.120
It helps close friends keep in touch and distance friends stay in touch.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.320
But by communicating online, it becomes unnatural.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.680
This attitude we have is commonly misconceived as OK.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.680
As human-like and unnatural, the intentions have been lost.

02:14.680 --> 02:21.400
We are letting social media take us to places we never wanted to go and we are stuck.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.120
Stop and amaze full of crossed wires and do not know which way to turn.

02:26.120 --> 02:28.560
Which path should we take?

02:28.560 --> 02:34.400
Now, it is easy to get lost in thinking about these thick questions, as they are deep and

02:34.400 --> 02:36.080
unanswerable.

02:36.080 --> 02:41.920
On the contrary, I feel that smaller and easier questions can help us see the issue from above.

02:41.920 --> 02:47.360
I asked many of you the Spring VA survey a couple of thin and answerable questions to

02:47.360 --> 02:51.600
help us see from a broader scope.

02:51.600 --> 02:57.080
Out of the 145 respondents, approximately 90% of people said that they used their phones

02:57.080 --> 03:03.560
for two hours or more on each weekday, and another 40% used them for four hours plus.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.640
On the weekends, over 60% used them for five hours or more each day, adding up to ten hours

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
in total.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.960
Now, when we find ourselves mindlessly wasting our time on these machines, how is it fair

03:14.960 --> 03:19.680
to tell our parents we can't come to the table for a family dinner?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.760
As my charts indicate, health and humanists are directly related.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.680
According to the majority of you guys, social media takes up too much of your time.

03:28.680 --> 03:33.080
Due to the ongoing pressure here in the technology capital of the world, many of us are sleep

03:33.080 --> 03:34.760
deprived.

03:34.760 --> 03:38.920
Social media almost always has a negative impact on the amount of sleep we get each night,

03:38.920 --> 03:42.840
and less than 15% said that it never affected their sleep time.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.720
This data also shows that students feel that their grades would be better without social

03:46.720 --> 03:49.080
media.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.880
Although we can all agree it has a number of social benefits, only some of your real

03:52.880 --> 03:55.160
self is shown online.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.520
You can pick out your identity and change who you are.

03:59.520 --> 04:04.240
Online interactions have become junk food for our brains and have us hooked.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.160
How much more direct could I get than that?

04:06.160 --> 04:11.640
I just supplied you with relevant and relatable statistics that you could be a part of.

04:11.640 --> 04:19.120
Most of you feel that it takes away from your sleep, that it is dehumanizing.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.960
Cal Newport, a professor at Georgetown University, states that there is a growing amount of research

04:23.960 --> 04:28.800
telling us that if you spend your day in a state of fragmented detention to take a quick

04:28.800 --> 04:35.760
glance or just check your phone, it can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.680
Quite ironically, this act of trying to be a well-rounded human by taking care of your

04:39.680 --> 04:43.400
social profile is actually dehumanizing.

04:43.400 --> 04:48.760
All the attempts to say and touch distance you from being social.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.400
Keeping in touch with our friends is good if used in a healthy way.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.400
Communicating in real life is much more valuable than doing so online.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.000
Next time you open your phone to message a nearby friend about how their day was or

05:00.000 --> 05:04.720
send a picture of your face with no context, I urge you to set up a time to meet and hang

05:04.720 --> 05:05.840
out.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.480
This shouldn't take more than 10 or so seconds and is a great first step in retaining your

05:10.480 --> 05:12.480
humanness.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.560
If this is too hard for you at the moment and you need time to adjust to this virtue of

05:16.560 --> 05:21.760
spending less time online, try sending yourself a screen time if your parents haven't already.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.240
If they have, maybe ask them to lower it a bit, to challenge yourself and strive for

05:26.240 --> 05:27.920
a better you.

05:27.920 --> 05:35.200
Whether it's social media or social life, TED Talks or TikToks, you need to make a choice.
