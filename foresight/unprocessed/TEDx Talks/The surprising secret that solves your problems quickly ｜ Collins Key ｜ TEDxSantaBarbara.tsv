0	15920	Imagine if you could take your brain and then turn it inside out, and then have access
15920	19760	to the information to be able to solve virtually any problem.
19760	22240	It sounds pretty cool, right?
22240	23240	Well, here's how.
23240	27680	We're going to take a look at problem solving in a very different way, one that can bring
27680	30080	tremendous benefit to your life.
30080	34240	And this is a technique I was first introduced to at the age of 12 when I began studying
34240	40440	the art form of magic, and I've continued to develop it throughout my professional career.
40440	45560	And now, best of all, this will be able to work for you in your personal life, professional,
45560	48840	or to help you create that next billion-dollar idea.
48840	53520	And in any field, sales, marketing, show business, it doesn't matter.
54120	59760	Now throughout this talk, I'm going to be revealing to you three core psychological
59760	65200	principles that magicians have been using for more than 5,000 years.
65200	68360	And all of these principles have one thing in common.
68360	77800	They all revolve around the most important concept in magic, and that is the answer to
77800	84320	every problem is hiding in plain sight.
84320	85320	So let me explain.
85320	90000	Imagine you're seated at a table and you're given a problem to solve, using nothing except
90000	100840	for these items, a candle, some pushpins, and some matches.
100840	105680	Now you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to attach this candle to the wall in a way
105680	107640	that when it's lit.
107640	111440	The wax will not drip down onto the table.
111440	114720	So some of you may be familiar with this, but for the rest of you, when you're trying
114720	118040	to figure this out, let me give you a little bit of history of where this came from.
118040	122680	Now, this is a classic test of creative problem solving developed by the renowned psychologist
122680	127240	Dr. Carl Dunker, and it was first published in 1945.
127240	131680	But although this is over three quarters of a century old, Dr. Dunker's assessment of
131680	135440	how our cognitive brain solves problems hasn't really changed at all.
135880	137680	Again, it's back to what I said earlier.
137680	141760	The answer to every problem is hiding in plain sight.
141760	146920	You see, the thing is, we look right at the answer, but we rarely see it.
146920	152120	And in this case, most people are so consumed with how to attach the candle to the wall
152120	157280	using tax, while the real answer is right in front of them.
157280	159280	You guys see it?
159280	160280	The box.
160720	166760	Again, that's what I mean by the answer is hidden in plain sight.
166760	170960	And again, the reason we don't think the box is one of the solutions is because it's not
170960	173040	presented to us as such.
173040	176880	It's locked away in our brain in position simply as a container for the pins.
176880	182520	Now, Dr. Dunker called this functional fixin'ness, the cognitive bias that limits a person to
182520	186360	using an object only in the way that it's traditionally intended.
186360	189480	And the same is also true of ideas and concepts.
189480	194760	For example, this candlestick problem was presented to you simply as a creative problem
194760	199600	solving test, when in fact, it also had a secondary purpose.
199600	205000	It contained a very important clue, one that was hiding in plain sight, which you will
205000	209560	need to unlock another facet of your cognitive problem solving ability.
209560	213600	Now the thing is, you probably didn't notice because you weren't instructed to look for
213600	214600	it.
214600	216280	So right now, I'm giving you a heads up.
216280	221840	There's going to be one more clue hidden during this talk.
221840	225280	So pay close attention to every detail.
225280	230480	Now to make all this a lot easier to understand, I've simplified the process into three words.
230480	232920	The first word is misconceptions.
232920	237240	Most people think a difficult problem must have a complex solution.
237240	239600	The second word, assumptions.
239600	243280	We utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and we don't think beyond
243280	244680	those parameters.
244680	247560	And the third word is expectations.
247560	252360	The answer we expect to find often limits us and does not allow us to see what's really
252360	253360	going on.
253360	256880	Now I thought it'd be kind of fun to show you what all three of these words look like
256880	260840	in action, and then we'll dive into each one in a little bit more detail.
260840	267560	So for this here, I've got a few bills, two, three, four, I think five dollars here.
267560	269280	So here's the goal.
269280	274440	The goal is to be able to take these bills, if I can do this properly, we'll actually
274440	277000	be able to take them on the count of three.
277000	288360	We go one, two, three, like that, and let you transform into five hundred dollars.
288360	296520	Okay, now I have to say this, I can't promise you'll actually be able to transform money
296520	301800	at your fingertips by the end of this talk, but you will be able to utilize these same
301800	302800	principles.
302800	306720	The same principles I just used to turn one dollar bills into hundred dollar bills to
306720	308600	solve virtually any problem.
308600	314120	All right, so let's break this whole thing down right now, starting with misconceptions.
314120	317880	This is the exact same thing that happens with the candlestick problem.
317880	321360	You see, most people are so focused on how to attach the candlestick, they can't figure
321360	325920	out exactly what's going on with the box, it gets buried in their brains.
325920	329480	And what happens, you have to force your brain to reassess everything about the situation
329480	333800	every detail, to bring the information to the surface, and then be able to expand your
333800	336200	ability to utilize cognitive thinking.
336200	339880	So I've got another little, this is so fun, I can't wait to show you this, so this here
339880	344960	is a little thing, so guys, take a look right over here, we've got a couple cards, six cards
344960	350780	to be exact, each card is different, and each card has been selected for a very important
350780	353200	psychological reason.
353200	359080	You'll find out why in just a moment, so right now, I want you to focus on just one card
359200	361120	and remember it.
361120	366600	Keep repeating the name of your card over and over and over in your mind, you got it?
366600	371840	Great, I'm going to turn the cards over, start mixing them up.
371840	381440	Now if I did this correctly, all of you, yes, all of you will have been influenced to choose
381440	387400	the exact same card.
387400	394280	And I'm going to remove your card right now.
394280	395280	Let's see if it worked.
395280	407680	So it's pretty crazy, right, so, okay, so how did this happen?
407680	414000	Like I said, there is a psychological reason why these cards were selected, but it is not
414080	417840	so that all of you would be drawn to the same card, it's so that all of you would focus
417840	423120	on only one card and ignore the rest, and that's where the misconception comes in, because
423120	429760	what you don't know is that there's actually two separate sets of cards, again, the answer
429760	432920	was hiding in plain sight.
432920	437080	The reason you didn't notice is because both sets of cards are actually very similar, so
437080	442000	let's say for instance, in the first spread you selected the king of clubs, in the second
442000	447240	spread it was replaced by the king of spades, so no matter what card you chose in the first
447240	451040	spread, it's not going to show up in the second spread, and to top it all off, you were so
451040	456600	focused on your one card, you didn't even notice any of the other cards around it.
456600	461160	This is why misconception is so dangerous, and it often makes problem solving take way
461160	463160	longer than it really should.
463160	468040	All right, now the next idea we're going to tackle is assumptions, and more importantly,
468040	469520	false assumptions.
469520	475720	So why don't you take a look at this animation right now, and tell me, which way is the key
475720	479520	rotating?
479520	485880	Now some of you will assume the key is rotating clockwise, others will assume the key is rotating
485880	492720	counterclockwise, and both of those assumptions are wrong.
492720	496480	You see, we assume the key is moving in just one direction or the other, but I can assure
496480	498480	you it's not.
499200	502520	Now if you're more of a right brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the
502520	503520	right.
503520	507480	If you're more of a left brain user, you'll likely see the key rotating to the left, but
507480	511760	by switching your thinking from right brain to left brain, you'll be able to shift the
511760	512760	direction of the key.
512760	517480	Now this takes a little bit of practice, but the results are almost magical.
517480	520720	So how does this relate to hiding in plain sight?
520720	527640	Well in this situation, our brain thinks and assumes that there's only one of two possible
527680	528680	answers.
528680	529920	The only two it readily knows and accepts.
529920	533200	The key can rotate right or the key can rotate left.
533200	537200	It's inconceivable the key can be rotating in both directions at the same time.
537200	542560	But you see, if we really study the image, we realize we don't have enough information
542560	546040	to determine the key's direction at all, because you see, the key is solid black.
546040	551000	There's no highlights, shadows, or any other distinguishing marks to give us the appropriate
551000	552500	information.
552500	556560	Now our brain fills in these missing pieces, and we assume, because our mind likes to work
556640	562640	in an orderly fashion, that what we see is the key rotating in one direction or the other.
562640	566360	It doesn't even occur to us that maybe we're missing the relevant information to make an
566360	567880	informed decision.
567880	572200	And we assume that what our mind tells us, based on the way that it chooses to function
572200	575920	at that moment, that our logic is correct.
575920	581240	So the correct answer to this one is simply hiding in plain sight.
581240	586680	Hiding on your perception, the key rotates in both directions.
586680	592880	Now there's still one more crucial word we need to explore, and that is expectations.
592880	597640	The answer we expect to find can blind us to what is actually happening, and this is
597640	600800	what makes problem-solving so difficult.
600800	605360	Now a great example of this is when I was asked to be on the TV show America's Got Talent.
605360	606920	There was just one problem.
606920	612440	At the time, the producers of the show expected magicians to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type
612440	615680	illusions, which I didn't do.
615680	618840	Now the reason that America's Got Talent wanted these types of acts was because the show was
618840	623640	being taped in front of 6,000 people at Radio City Music Hall, and they wanted the show
623640	625640	to feel huge.
625640	630520	But I noticed that none of the magicians ever made it past the first few rounds, so I started
630520	632520	analyzing why.
632520	636800	I mean their acts were great in front of the 6,000 people in the audience, but to the millions
636840	642000	of people who were watching on TV at home, and then voting, there was a disconnect between
642000	643000	the performer.
643000	645560	Again, I analyzed why.
645560	650080	Well television is really an intimate medium, and the best kind of magic for television
650080	652640	is close-up magic, because it too is intimate.
652640	654720	It draws the viewer in.
654720	658240	So armed with this new insight, I realized the answer was right in front of me.
658240	660040	It was literally hiding in plain sight.
660040	666480	I didn't need to perform big, flashy, Vegas-type illusions, I needed to do small, close-up,
666480	672440	flashy performances that would blow the minds of the judges and the people watching at home.
672440	675720	Now it took a bit of convincing to get the producers to agree to this whole thing.
675720	678880	They definitely did not see it the way that I did at that time.
678880	682560	But once I was able to refocus their attention back to what they already knew, which is that
682560	687920	television is intimate, therefore the magic actually be intimate as well, they said, okay,
687920	688920	let's do it.
688920	692880	And it was a paradigm-shifting way for magic to be done on America's Got Talent, and I
692880	697760	actually became the first magician to ever make it into the finals on that show.
697760	698760	Thank you.
698760	706680	Now it all happened because I was able to shift the producer's expectations of what
706680	708480	they thought would work.
708480	711640	So right now, it's time for me to shift yours.
711640	716400	As I mentioned earlier, throughout this entire talk, I've given you two clues to the problems
716400	719320	I'm about to show you right now.
719320	724240	Now you may or may not have noticed them, and if you didn't, here's a little hint.
724240	728360	If you go back and watch this again, you'll notice that every time I touch my key, say
728360	733040	the answer is hiding in plain sight, I would point to the clue that you will need to quickly
733040	734560	solve these next few problems.
734560	737920	Now there's a chance you probably just didn't even notice it, that you perceived the touch
737920	740840	against my key just in a relevant gesture.
740840	744640	You didn't expect such a simple action could contain the answer to what you perceived as
744640	746920	a much more complicated problem.
746920	749560	So here are the challenges.
749560	751920	The first one.
751920	756440	How do you drink champagne from the bottle without opening it?
756440	760160	Immediately, your mind will start thinking of all these different solutions, most of
760160	764120	which probably have to do with a complicated way of getting the cork off and getting the
764120	768240	champagne out without actually opening up the bottle.
768240	770880	Keep thinking.
770880	781520	The next one here involves two glasses, a dollar bill suspended between them, and a
781520	783160	salt shaker.
783160	787820	And the challenge is to get the salt shaker to balance on top of the dollar bill while
787820	789320	staying suspended.
789320	793240	So when you let go, it won't drop down to the table.
793240	797640	Again, the answer is probably a lot easier than you think.
797640	800360	And also, again, if you want to learn these, all you got to do is watch this again and
800360	805520	look for the times when I touch my key point and say the answer is hiding in plain sight.
805520	809680	Now, this here is actually what people would consider a bar bet.
809680	813120	So if you're familiar with magic and puzzles, you probably recognize it, and it uses the
813120	817200	exact same principles that magicians have been using all along.
817200	821120	If you had a bit of difficulty like figuring it out, don't worry, because it's actually
821120	828720	much easier to fool a really intelligent person than someone who maybe isn't quite as sophisticated.
828720	831480	I got you, I got you.
831480	832480	But it's really true.
832480	836280	It's actually very difficult to fool children, and I'll explain why.
836280	840600	For a really sophisticated person, you will almost always talk yourself out of the simple
840600	845680	solution, even though it's the right solution, your misconception will cause you to overlook
845680	846680	the obvious.
846680	850680	Now, this also has you call create a false set of assumptions.
850680	854840	For example, a child will see a lady floating in the air and say, yeah, well, there are
854840	856400	strings holding her up.
856440	860320	A more sophisticated person would say, but see, I can't see any strings.
860320	864000	Plus, it would take a lot of strings to support the weight of a person.
864000	867840	They utilize information based upon prior knowledge and experience, and they don't go beyond those
867840	869080	parameters.
869080	873600	And finally, they create a false set of expectations.
873600	878520	Because a magician passed a hoop around the lady, they allow this one simple action to
878520	881720	blind them from the truth.
881720	888960	It's the perfect example of misconceptions, assumptions, and expectations all working
888960	895560	against you, all stopping you from achieving your goal.
895560	903760	But once you master these principles, you will be able to unleash the answers and realize
903760	911680	the benefits that are always hiding in plain sight.
911680	914680	Thank you.
914680	915560	Thank you all so much.
