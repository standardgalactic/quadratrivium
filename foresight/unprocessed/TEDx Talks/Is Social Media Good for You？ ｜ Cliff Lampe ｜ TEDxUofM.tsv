0	9360	My name is Cliff Lampy and I'm here to convince you over the next 13 minutes that social media
9360	10880	is good for you.
10880	14280	Now the natural question you want to ask yourself right now is why did they get an old gray-haired
14280	19200	Sasquatch up here to tell people that social, especially a group of young people that social
19200	20960	media is good for them.
20960	23800	And one of the first things I want to convince you of is that there's actually a science
23800	25200	of social media.
25200	28720	So all of my adult academic life I've been studying social media.
28720	31960	We used to not call it that, but it was still online interaction.
31960	33800	And now the world has moved with me.
33800	38400	So there is hundreds, if not thousands of scholars across the world who are studying
38400	43080	the effects of social media, not just on people, but on society as a whole.
43080	48120	Facebook itself is hiring hundreds of PhDs out of top universities to study the social
48120	49680	effects of social media.
49680	54120	And all social media companies and all universities across the world are really taking this on
54120	55360	as an endeavor.
55360	60280	And social media is good for us, however, is that the root of so many of those questions.
60280	63720	And in spite of or because of some of this, there's a very common narrative that social
63720	66400	media is actually very bad for us, right?
66400	71120	So Prince Ea really gave a nice, I think, introduction to this, sorry.
71120	75520	Where he talks, you've all seen this video, where the title of the video is Can We Auto-Correct
75520	76520	Humanity?
76520	80680	Where he gives a really nice spoken word introduction to the idea that technology is driving us
80680	82080	further apart.
82200	86320	What instead of enhancing intimate relationships, what technology does is drive us away from
86320	87760	intimate relationships.
87760	93240	And I love this Atlantic monthly article or cover for that exact same idea, right?
93240	97000	So the idea that even when we're physically present with one another, that we're somehow
97000	101480	separated, that you're looking at the phone, I'm sure we've all been annoyed by somebody
101480	105320	when we're talking to them who can't but help look down at their phone, right?
105320	107840	It happens.
107960	111520	Sherry Turkle at MIT has called this alone together.
111520	115320	That when sometimes we're in social groups and when we're with one another, that we can
115320	120760	ruin that experience by coming into the mediated environment, that a text will pop up.
120760	124160	And these devices are cleverly designed, a small buzz.
124160	127840	How many of you just salivate when you feel that little buzz of your iPhone across the
127840	128840	table, right?
128840	133080	Ooh, I might have another trivia crack opportunity here.
133080	140040	The other thing that people worry about is that what we're replacing these close intimate
140040	142720	relationships with are unreal relationships, right?
142720	148000	This replacement theory says that it's not just that these are bad relationships, they're
148000	149000	not authentic.
149000	150360	They don't help us at all.
150360	154200	And when I see these fake friends, I think, wow, they're having a much better life than
154200	155200	I am.
155200	159200	If I'm scrolling through Twitter or Facebook and I see these very carefully crafted identities
159200	162560	that they're making, I might think to myself, you know, my kids aren't as good looking as
162560	164360	their kids, you know?
164360	166680	My students just are not as smart as their students.
166680	168720	They go on much better vacations than I do.
168720	169720	They eat better.
169720	170720	Well, that's probably true.
170720	177160	But, you know, it creates basically a sadness in us that these things are happening.
177160	181160	And sometimes I want to say that the social media experience really is quite awful, right?
181160	185560	So this idea is, is it actually bad or is it just our perception that it's bad?
185560	188720	So, you know, is this anxiety real, basically?
188720	192480	You'll be maybe happy to know that this anxiety has existed for as long as we've had technology
192480	193480	technologies.
193480	197520	In the early 20th century, somebody said that jazz would replace thinking with just baseless
197520	202560	inspiration from pundits and jazz.
202560	206960	The telephone was criticized because it would lead to a rude, in-civil society because people
206960	210120	would just interrupt you over your phone at dinner.
210120	215520	Famously, Plato said in Phaedrus, he quoted Socrates as saying that the invention of writing
215520	219620	itself, one of our first forms of information technology, would lead to the degradation
219620	222400	of humanity because it was a dead way of communicating.
222400	224880	It couldn't respond.
224880	227000	And sometimes these things really are bad.
227000	232480	You know, if you look at things like cyberbullying and you look at what's going on with Gamergate,
232480	236720	these things really did cause us to have huge negative reactions.
236720	241680	People have been really hurt, have had trauma, have in some cases killed themselves because
241680	245800	of the bullying incidences that they face through these social media channels.
245800	250480	And the, especially harassment of women and people who are disadvantaged in these channels
250480	254800	is something we need to solve as a society.
254800	258960	But I do think that there are instances when, in growing scientific evidence, that social
258960	262200	media really can be good for you.
262200	266160	So for the past 10 years, my colleague, Nicole Ellison, and I also at the School of Information,
266160	269600	have been studying the relationship between social network sites and a concept called social
269600	270600	capital.
270600	272000	Most of you have probably heard that term.
272000	277200	It's basically the idea of resources or things you can get from your social connections.
277480	282320	Basically, what can be in a social network provide you as another type of resource.
282320	285520	So having social capital means, for instance, in a neighborhood, means that your neighbors
285520	290120	might help you dig out of the snow, which was very useful for us in Michigan this year.
290120	293840	But it can also mean that they provide you emotional support, or it can mean that they
293840	297280	give you physical resources like money or help moving.
297280	301080	But sometimes it's just that they provide you with a new worldview, new insights into
301080	304120	what it's like to be a person not like you.
304120	309240	The idea behind the relationship between social media and social capital is that communication
309240	312440	of all forms helps us to build relationships.
312440	318080	We actually know from a long history in sociology that to build a relationship and to build
318080	324360	energy into a friendship means investing time and actual effort into that relationship.
324360	329480	Now, where social media plays a role in all of this is we tend to think about the effects
329480	333040	of these technologies only on our very close relationships.
333040	335840	We have lots of ways of talking to our close relationships.
335840	340520	When I talk to my best friend or I speak with my spouse, hopefully we're not just communicating
340520	341520	over Facebook.
341520	345080	Hopefully we do communicate over Facebook, but hopefully we also meet face-to-face and
345080	347480	the variety of other ways that we have.
347480	351200	What social media makes different is this group of weak ties.
351200	355200	Weak ties are colleagues or casual acquaintances, people who are not like us.
355200	358240	And these casual acquaintances provide us with a lot of benefits.
358240	360520	The people around you are a lot like you.
360520	362100	That's the effect of homophily.
362100	366260	You surround yourself pretty much with people who are like you and that's okay.
366260	369460	But what weak ties provide you is different information.
369460	370820	Maybe it's a conservative viewpoint.
370820	372780	Maybe it's somebody who's lived in a different city.
372780	378060	These weak ties can provide you with novel information and resources and be hugely powerful
378060	382460	for the types of benefits that you get out of these sites.
382460	385900	Even really ephemeral relationships can be incredibly powerful.
385900	388980	So here's a great example from just a couple of months ago here on University of Michigan's
388980	389980	campus.
389980	395660	Yik Yak, which if you don't know it, is geolocation-based and incredibly anonymous and incredibly ephemeral.
395660	400340	Here's a person who states a fairly specific, what would be worrisome to me, suicide plan
400340	401620	in Yik Yak.
401620	405260	And people responded in really great ways to this person.
405260	406700	I don't know what happened to this person.
406700	408420	It is an anonymous platform.
408420	412340	But what the community did surrounding that, even in a context of anonymity, which we usually
412340	418060	think of as worst case scenario, really does speak to the power of these tools to allow
418060	419420	people to interact.
419420	423620	In this case, Yik Yak's anonymity probably allowed this person to state a feeling they
423620	426700	could not have said to their close friends.
426700	430540	Or they were trying out maybe a really negative emotion or something they were struggling
430540	435140	with in an anonymous community and that played a role.
435140	438660	We also have seen the power of social media to facilitate organizing.
438660	442740	Not even the most rabid social media guy is going to say that social media caused the
442740	444020	Arab Spring.
444020	448500	But we do know from both Arab Spring, we do know from other social movements, that social
448500	452380	media basically makes it easier to communicate and to collaborate.
452380	457140	It reduces the cost of doing business if what you want to do is to collect a whole bunch
457140	458260	of other people.
458260	461620	It raises the voice of people who previously were powerless.
461620	466540	It helps people who previously did not have control of the media to be their own media.
466540	470740	And that is powerful across a variety of social media platforms.
470740	475740	We have seen the ability of things like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube to be a change
475740	479100	agent in all matter of social movements over the past three years.
479100	482820	And it's not just the Arab Spring, but it's also Occupy, it's also Ferguson.
482820	485820	It's also here with Being Black at the University of Michigan.
485820	492020	And what that enabled our students to do for their own power and capacity here.
492020	493580	So how does social media foster these things?
493580	496500	What is it about social media that's important?
496500	499980	One thing is this idea that don't think of social media as a tool, right?
499980	502140	Especially it's not, social media is not one thing.
502140	504620	Even a site like Facebook is not one thing.
504620	509180	Facebook is three dozen applications that have been all tied together as a variety of
509180	510180	ways to communicate.
510180	511660	And I'm sure you've all seen this.
511660	516140	Your Aunt Mary may only send you Farmville invitations, right?
516140	519420	You may have another friend, you probably only use Facebook to communicate through direct
519420	521300	messages or to check on things.
521300	526220	Each of these applications have a variety of tools that afford, as we would say, different
526220	528060	types of interactions.
528060	532740	Just as a normal fork, not our cool chain fork here, affords the action of picking up
532740	539140	food, tools like sharing a photo or tagging or voting, all afford certain types of social
539140	542900	processes that we really need to think about and consider.
542900	548340	So I like you, I'm sure, I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift, right?
548340	552700	They have asked me to stop sending fan mail, but that's okay.
552700	556620	And when you look at things like her retweets, she posts a picture of her cat and you see
556620	561140	she gets thousands of retweets and shares and favorites and everything like this.
561140	565300	That is a signal of a community forming around this particular artist.
565300	569900	This is a way for people to basically take control and to curate their own presence.
569900	577100	And when you have 54 million followers, you can really shake it off, as it were.
577100	583060	So some of the things that these tools allow you, the visibility of these applications,
583060	587420	the fact that I can send out a post on Twitter and X number of people are going to see it,
587420	591380	especially if it gets retweeted, it just enhances the virality, the opportunity for
591380	595500	people to see content, persistence, the fact that it's available, the fact that once you
595500	601220	send it out there, it's powerfully available for people in a week or in a day or whenever.
601220	605140	The editability, the fact that you can curate content, the fact that you can create a presence
605140	609860	online for either yourself or for your organization.
609860	613060	One of the important aspects that that all leads to is this idea of social grooming.
613060	617060	One of the consistent findings that we have is that one of the important parts of social
617060	619100	media is this social grooming effect.
619100	622660	So in primate social grooming, it's like I'm picking fleas off of you and eating them.
622660	626060	In humans, it's much more like, hey, I'm going to spend some of my very precious attention
626060	627220	on you.
627220	630980	And that very little bit of attention that I have is going to be dependent on how much
630980	632640	of a relationship we have.
632640	635340	So my spouse demands a decent amount of my attention.
635340	636580	My kid also.
636580	639940	However, a distant friend on Facebook, not so much.
639940	645460	So you see great instances of social grooming on Facebook with things like the birthday
645460	646460	message.
646460	649660	Now, is getting a Facebook birthday message as good as getting a cake?
649660	652100	And I love me some cake.
652100	653100	It's not.
653100	656300	But I'm going to tell you what, it's either for most of my Facebook list, it's either
656300	657620	that birthday message or nothing.
657620	659420	I'm not going to send them a cake.
659420	663500	And I don't think I would want 500 cakes to arrive at my door for birthdays.
663500	667460	There are certain types of relationships, those weak ties, where these very lightweight
667460	673340	social grooming things, the likes, the votes, the shares, the comments, things that we often
673340	676820	consider banal are hugely powerful.
676820	679780	What do we need to do to increase our chances to benefit from social media?
679780	680780	I think there's a couple of things.
680780	684340	So how, I think social media can be good, but it takes work, right?
684340	686380	It's not just that we're on social media.
686380	688900	There are two main things I think we need to do.
688900	691880	One is we need to become more literate in social media.
691880	695860	We just assume, especially for a younger generation, that they're born knowing how to use the
695860	699580	Twitter and the Facebook, and we throw up our hands and we call it good.
699580	703060	How many of you had social media banned in your high schools, right?
703060	706820	That's where we should be teaching social media, not waiting for you to figure it out
706820	708700	and to get into trouble.
708700	711000	We also need to be really thinking about the design of these things.
711000	715860	This is LO, which really has expanded our opportunity to see new forms of social network
715860	719100	sites and is a reaction to Facebook.
719100	723100	How we use social media and how we decide to use social media is the key secret sauce
723100	724100	here, right?
724100	727020	Social media is a blank canvas and it's us who's painting.
727020	730820	If you don't like what's on social media, I challenge you to change what you put on
730820	734980	social media because you're the ones who are filling in that content.
734980	735580	Thank you very much.
