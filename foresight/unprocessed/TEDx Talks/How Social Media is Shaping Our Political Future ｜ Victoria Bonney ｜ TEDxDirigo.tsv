0	15480	Since the 2016 election, we've seen how social media has degraded our political system.
15480	21680	From Russian bots to the president's midnight tweets, it's easy to see the harm it's doing.
21680	27120	But if you also notice that it's made our democracy more diverse and transparent, I've
27120	31760	worked in government and campaigns for over a decade, and I have.
31760	35520	I used to believe only a certain kind of person can run for office.
35520	38800	That only one kind of experience mattered to voters.
38800	44800	An Ivy League degree, lots of money, famous last name, being mail.
44800	49440	Basically, the guys on Mount Rushmore.
49440	53880	But that was before Facebook and Instagram and Twitter allowed politicians to speak
53880	56360	directly to voters.
56360	60920	Before that, they had to go through these traditional media gatekeepers, like 60 minutes
60920	63800	and meet the press and all the Sunday shows.
63800	68040	And those were impossible to book unless you had connections.
68040	73160	I grew up in New Hampshire, a state with outsized impact on national politics, because every
73160	77600	four years, it hosts the presidential primary.
77600	82320	Which means, if you had presidential ambitions, you probably came to my school or my neighborhood
82320	84080	to make your case.
84080	90040	I remember Bill Clinton's motorcade driving by my yard sale.
90040	96120	And Bob Dole hanging out in the cafeteria, and Bill Bradley shooting hoops in the gym.
96120	100680	And despite this front row seat to politics, it just never appealed to me.
100680	105760	Of course, part of that was my age, but the other part was that they seemed so scripted
105760	108840	and unrelatable.
108840	115000	That changed when I was about 19, after America declared war with Iraq.
115000	119480	I woke up one morning in my college dorm, and someone had left the TV on.
119480	124120	And this governor from Vermont was on Meet the Press, Howard Dean.
124120	127280	And he said, Iraq hadn't attacked us on 9-11.
127280	132040	Our justification for war was wrong, and my generation was going to deal with the consequences
132040	133480	of that conflict.
133480	138680	I had never seen a politician speak so forcefully against the war.
138680	143240	And for the first time in my young life, I wanted to be a part of a campaign.
143240	148160	So I called this campaign every day for weeks, until finally they said, sure, you could knock
148160	151240	on stranger's doors in the freezing cold for no money at all.
151240	153640	And I was like, yes!
153640	157520	I felt like I was part of a movement.
157520	160640	And believe it or not, in 2004, I was.
160640	163560	Howard Dean did something that no one had done.
163560	168960	He raised low dollar donations on the internet, which gave him the ability to run a national
168960	171080	campaign as an outsider.
171080	174880	But he still had to go through those traditional media gatekeepers.
174880	179000	Social media wouldn't be what it is today for a very long time.
179000	183000	Facebook wouldn't even be available to the public for two years.
183000	187480	And the thing is, those traditional media gatekeepers, they weren't a big fan of Howard
187480	190040	Dean's off-script speeches.
190040	194520	The Prime Minister may remember his most infamous after the Iowa caucus.
194520	196400	It went a little something like this.
196400	199120	We're going to South Carolina, we're going to Oregon, we're going to Washington, D.C.
199120	201480	to take back the White House.
201480	202600	Yeah.
202600	209960	So that so-called Dean Scream doomed his campaign.
209960	214720	He was seen as unhinged and too angry.
214720	218160	Right.
218160	222760	Because you sit here 14 years later, you may think, too angry.
222760	223760	That's Tuesday.
223760	227200	And you're right.
227200	231360	Right now, our current president holds rallies almost every Tuesday where people scream in
231360	233680	unison, lock her up.
233680	236360	So how did we get here?
236360	238600	Social media changed the game.
238600	242400	It broke the way that politicians could communicate.
242400	245960	No longer would canned talking points break through the clutter of Twitter.
245960	250240	Having poll tested, people just tuned it out.
250240	254360	When I ran for state representative in my hometown 12 years ago, I doubted that voters
254360	258560	wanted a woman who was working two waitressing jobs and had college loan debt to represent
258560	259560	them.
259560	265320	However, a waitress with college loan debt might be the kind of representative who understands
265320	268560	why we need a living wage and student loan relief.
268560	272560	But I didn't see my experience as an asset.
272560	276880	And even if I had, I had no way of getting that message out.
276880	281280	I misread my strengths as liabilities simply because I didn't look like those guys on
281280	285720	Mount Rushmore or any other politician I'd seen.
285720	289040	And maybe that's why I lost.
289040	290840	Campaigns today are different.
290840	295920	Candidates are using viral videos to tell their experiences with issues ranging from homelessness,
295920	298960	teen pregnancy, debt, depression.
298960	302400	Voters are seeing these stories and they're feeling galvanized by stories they relate
302400	307840	to and they're giving money to help move those campaigns along.
307840	312160	You know, there's long been a practice in politics called opposition research.
312160	315680	It's where your opponent digs up all the dirt they can find on you.
315680	321680	But in the age of social media, that could be useless because it turns out showing vulnerability
321680	325040	is shrewd politics.
325040	328920	Everyone likes a story and everyone has a story to tell.
328920	333680	These candidates will not accept that their experience is disqualifying simply because
333680	336240	no one like them has run before.
336240	337600	Look at Stacey Abrams.
337600	340960	She told me to be the first African-American governor of Georgia.
340960	343400	Her opponent said, she's in debt.
343400	344760	She's unqualified.
344760	349520	She said, yeah, like millions of Americans, I have debt, but I won't feel ashamed that
349520	353800	I needed a loan to get an education or to support myself.
353800	359880	And with her response, she shut down that line of criticism and made herself more relatable.
359880	361160	Look at Beto O'Rourke.
361160	365320	He's documented almost every moment of his campaign on social media and it's introduced
365320	370400	him to millions of Americans and helped him to raise an unprecedented $40 million in three
370400	372800	months.
372800	377440	Even if these campaigns are unsuccessful this time, they will have changed how campaigns
377440	383760	communicate going forward, just as Howard Dean did with fundraising in 2004.
383760	389080	But beyond campaigns, social media has made government more transparent.
389080	394440	Who would have thought our 72-year-old president would get every member of Congress to use
394440	397120	Twitter?
397120	402400	But every time he tweets, the traditional media come asking for a response.
402400	408080	So the need for conviction, authenticity, responsiveness, I know requirements of elected
408080	409080	officials.
409560	413920	Because if you don't respond, you're seen as totally out of touch.
413920	415560	You're like, how does she know that?
415560	419760	Well, I'm currently a communications director for a member of Congress and you would not
419760	425480	want to know how many times a week we get calls about presidential tweets.
425480	430320	Around Memorial Day of this year, the hashtag where the children went viral.
430320	434120	The Trump administration had begun separating immigrant children from their families at
434120	436000	the U.S. border.
436000	440800	Our phones, our emails, our social media platforms were flooded by constituents who were outraged
440800	442760	by this inhumanity.
442760	445800	The congresswoman who I worked for was also outraged.
445800	450520	She and I flew to Brownsville, Texas and saw the detention centers for ourselves.
450520	456240	Along the way, we documented everything, videos, tweets.
456240	460520	And in her capacity as an elected official, she was the eyes and ears of her constituents.
460520	465520	And when she got back to D.C., she lent a voice to their outrage by backing legislation
465520	469400	to address this ongoing crisis.
469400	473400	Social media has created a dialogue that's never existed between elected officials and
473400	475320	those they represent.
475320	479600	It's opened the door for people who thought they could never run, and it served as a microphone
479600	482520	for those who've never had one.
482520	488480	Most importantly, it's changing the face of politics, maybe.
488480	492200	Maybe it could even change those faces on Mount Rushmore.
492200	493200	Thank you.
493200	494200	Thank you.
494200	496200	Thank you.
