The other day, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I come across this post that says social

00:26.100 --> 00:34.660
media is bad. So I think to myself, I'm looking at a post about how posts are bad. But that's

00:34.660 --> 00:39.880
not even the best part. The best part is I click on it and the caption says save this

00:39.880 --> 00:46.700
for later as a reminder. So basically, they want me to get off social media, but to get

00:46.700 --> 00:56.020
back on so I can reread why I shouldn't have been on in the first place. This got me thinking.

00:56.020 --> 01:01.500
And I realize that it's so often taught that social media is this horrible thing. In fact,

01:01.500 --> 01:05.300
at the beginning of each school year, most high school students are sat in a safety

01:05.300 --> 01:10.860
assembly. Part of the safety assembly talks about safety on social media. They tell you

01:10.860 --> 01:16.220
how you're going to get catfished or kidnapped, but they stop there. They don't tell you

01:16.220 --> 01:20.460
how you can use it in a safe and beneficial way, and unfortunately, those are very real

01:20.460 --> 01:25.780
things and do happen way more than it should. But the way to stop that is to teach teens

01:25.780 --> 01:30.820
how to use it in a beneficial way. You know, I think a lot of people don't realize the

01:30.820 --> 01:36.860
true impact that social media has on us. In fact, I didn't realize the true impact until

01:36.860 --> 01:43.620
one day my English teacher, she said, class, what is the purpose of children's books?

01:43.620 --> 01:46.980
So I thought to myself, okay, well, there's multiple different reasons for children's

01:46.980 --> 01:52.620
books. But one of the biggest ones is to teach children lessons without them realizing that

01:52.620 --> 01:57.700
they're learning. Looking back, I learned not to take food from strangers because snow

01:57.700 --> 02:04.300
white ate a poisonous apple. See, back then it was children's books. But it's no longer

02:04.300 --> 02:07.940
just children's books. It's all the content we're choosing to surround ourselves with.

02:07.940 --> 02:14.420
TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all of it. I'm currently reading this book. It's called

02:14.420 --> 02:20.780
The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down. And the author of this book, they say,

02:20.780 --> 02:27.780
the world is neither good or bad. It's just there. And the way we perceive the world is

02:27.780 --> 02:34.660
based on our individual experiences. So let's think about that from a social media standpoint.

02:34.660 --> 02:40.100
There are seven billion people in this world. And in our day to day lives, we don't even

02:40.100 --> 02:45.660
interact with 1%. In fact, it's far less than 1%. So the way we learn about life outside

02:45.660 --> 02:49.940
of just our little bubble is through things like traveling. But unfortunately, we can't

02:50.140 --> 02:56.540
always be traveling. So another primary way we do this is through social media. Therefore,

02:56.540 --> 03:00.980
if your social media is filled with drama, toxicity, and things that make you feel bad

03:00.980 --> 03:07.380
about yourself, naturally, you're going to view the world as more of a negative place.

03:07.380 --> 03:11.060
Whereas if your social media is filled with positivity and things that align with your

03:11.060 --> 03:16.380
goals, you're going to view the world as more of a positive place. See, the problem isn't

03:16.420 --> 03:23.020
social media. The problem is how you're choosing to use it. I hear a lot of stories about people

03:23.020 --> 03:28.540
having these bad experiences on social media. And I've had social media for a while now.

03:28.540 --> 03:34.300
And honestly, the only scary thing on my Instagram is when I look at my archived posts and see

03:34.300 --> 03:40.380
what I used to post in middle school. But other than that, it's been a pretty positive

03:40.420 --> 03:47.420
experience. So what's my secret? How do I keep my social media this positive, uplifting place?

03:48.420 --> 03:55.420
Well, there's four groups of people you should be following. The first, friends, family, and

03:55.420 --> 04:02.820
positive acquaintances. Now, I truly mean positive because so often I'll hear someone say, I don't

04:02.820 --> 04:06.140
like this person. They're so mean to me. But then you'll go on their Instagram and guess who

04:06.180 --> 04:12.580
they're following. That person who's so mean to them. Why surround yourself with that toxic energy

04:12.580 --> 04:22.300
if you have the choice to simply not? The second group, people who align with your goals. Now, for

04:22.300 --> 04:27.380
me, my future goal is to create my own business one day. So the types of people I follow are people

04:27.380 --> 04:31.980
who have started their own businesses, people who give financial advice or investing advice, or

04:31.980 --> 04:39.300
just business in general. Because the easiest way to achieve your goal is to ask someone or watch

04:39.300 --> 04:46.380
someone who's already done it. The third group, people who inspire you. Now, this is different

04:46.380 --> 04:52.460
from people who align with your goals. I was a gymnast off and on for about 12 years. I wanted to go

04:52.460 --> 04:56.940
to the Olympics. I truly thought I was going to go to the Olympics. In fact, I used to write Dear

04:56.940 --> 05:01.300
Future Me's to myself and I was reading them a few weeks ago and all of them started with Dear

05:01.340 --> 05:08.820
Future Me. Are you in the Olympics yet? Unfortunately not. But my point is, at the time, going to the

05:08.820 --> 05:13.700
Olympics was my goal. So the types of people I would follow were people like Simone Biles, Ali

05:13.700 --> 05:19.620
Razeman, Gabby Douglas. However, going to the Olympics is no longer my goal. Yet I never unfollowed

05:19.620 --> 05:27.740
those people because they still inspire me. The fourth group, entertainers. Now, of course,

05:27.740 --> 05:32.500
social media is an entertainment platform and I'm not telling you not to use it as one. I'm just

05:32.500 --> 05:37.460
telling you to be mindful of the types of entertainment you're consuming. A great example of

05:37.460 --> 05:42.820
positive entertainment are your favorite artists. People like Shawn Mendes, Selena Gomez, Taylor

05:42.820 --> 05:49.020
Swift, whoever it may be, as long as what they're posting makes you feel good about yourself. See,

05:49.020 --> 05:54.340
when you start to categorize your following into these four groups, not only are you going to be

05:54.380 --> 06:00.780
happier, but opportunities are also going to start to come to you. Back in May, I came across this

06:00.780 --> 06:06.900
ad on Instagram. It was for this program called BetaCamp. BetaCamp advertised themselves to be

06:06.900 --> 06:11.380
the six-week program where they challenged teens to create a revenue-generating startup with the

06:11.380 --> 06:16.900
help of business mentors. Now, this sounded perfect for me. But of course, at first, I was skeptical

06:16.900 --> 06:21.300
as you should be with ads you see on social media because a lot of the time they're going to be

06:21.300 --> 06:26.020
fake. But I was safe about it. I looked at their Instagram, I looked at their website, and turns

06:26.020 --> 06:32.140
out it was real. And I successfully created a revenue-generating startup in just six weeks. Now,

06:32.140 --> 06:41.300
was it good? Absolutely not. Did I make money? Yes, so I'd call that a win. But through that program,

06:41.300 --> 06:46.700
I was then offered a fellowship to continue this journey throughout the school year. Through that

06:46.740 --> 06:51.380
fellowship, I was able to take two additional classes, one about creating a platform, and one

06:51.380 --> 06:59.180
about investing. So my point is, just because my social media reflects my goals, I was given

06:59.180 --> 07:06.060
opportunities that align with those goals. Now, how does this work? Well, TikTok, Facebook,

07:06.060 --> 07:11.580
Instagram, whatever it may be, all these social medias love making money. How do they do this? They

07:11.580 --> 07:16.260
put things on your feed based on what you've interacted with in the past or based on the people

07:16.300 --> 07:23.860
you follow. So follow positive people, follow people who align with your goals. Now, before you all

07:23.860 --> 07:29.820
leave today, I have two asks. My first ask is to start being mindful of the types of content you're

07:29.820 --> 07:36.780
consuming. Start welcoming the positivity and blocking out the negativity. And my second ask,

07:36.780 --> 07:42.740
stop participating and spreading this idea that social media is this horrible thing. Instead,

07:43.220 --> 07:49.220
educate on the dangers while encouraging people to use it in a positive way. Now, I've said a lot

07:49.220 --> 07:55.460
today. So to sum up everything I've said, I leave you all with one of my favorite quotes. Goes a

07:55.460 --> 08:04.100
little like this. Nothing of me is original. I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known. Now,

08:04.100 --> 08:10.620
that's a beautiful quote, but I'd like to add on to it. I'd like to say, nothing of me is original.

08:11.340 --> 08:17.620
I'm a combined effort of everyone I've ever known and the content I've surrounded myself with. Thank

08:17.620 --> 08:17.940
you.
