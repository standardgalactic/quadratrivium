00:00.000 --> 00:12.340
Hi, everyone.

00:12.340 --> 00:21.160
I stand here with a simple offer, an offer that, if accepted, yields instantaneous results

00:21.160 --> 00:25.120
and inevitable positive consequences.

00:25.120 --> 00:33.780
My offer is this, the chance to purge yourself of social media and reclaim your personal identity.

00:33.780 --> 00:41.120
I challenge everyone to try going one week without social media, and I guarantee it will

00:41.120 --> 00:43.200
change your life.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.760
I can attest to this because I personally have been without any social media for almost

00:48.760 --> 00:55.920
a year, and it's completely changed the way I view the world.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.840
I'm not saying that all social media is bad.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.840
Social media can be used for marketing or to spread a positive message to the world.

01:05.840 --> 01:16.320
However, apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat are taking over our lives.

01:16.320 --> 01:22.280
They're taking us out of the present moment and causing us to exist only in a virtual

01:22.280 --> 01:27.240
world, and nobody should live like that.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.800
Social media has taken over astonishingly quickly.

01:31.800 --> 01:37.040
If you think about it, when we meet a new person, the norm is no longer to ask them for

01:37.040 --> 01:38.920
their phone number.

01:38.920 --> 01:46.000
The norm is to friend them on Facebook or ask for their Snapchat or Twitter username.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.000
In 2008, only 24% of the US population had a social media profile.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.760
Now 81% has one.

01:55.760 --> 02:03.080
This astronomical growth is because social media is seen as a do-it-all platform.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.760
It's widely replaced texting and email in a lot of cases, and it's used as our main

02:08.760 --> 02:11.280
source of news.

02:11.280 --> 02:19.400
This leads to people spending hours a day with their noses just glued to their phones.

02:19.400 --> 02:25.040
Psychologists at Trent Nottingham University found that we spend twice as much time on

02:25.040 --> 02:34.280
our phones as we think we do, and that amount of time is five hours a day, nearly a third

02:34.280 --> 02:37.880
of our entire waking lives.

02:37.880 --> 02:44.680
I'm sure you're familiar with this site.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.040
That used to be me.

02:46.040 --> 02:51.440
In fact, I would wake up every morning and immediately reach for my phone.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.800
The amount of notifications I had would determine how good my morning was.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.300
Yay!

02:58.300 --> 03:00.680
People want to talk to me!

03:00.680 --> 03:06.360
I would spend one to two hours thoughtlessly scrolling through all my social media profiles

03:06.680 --> 03:08.760
before even getting out of bed.

03:08.760 --> 03:15.520
I would check Twitter, then Snapchat, then Instagram, then go back to Twitter to see

03:15.520 --> 03:20.600
if anything new had been posted just in the last 30 minutes.

03:20.600 --> 03:27.960
I was an addict wasting my time, and the time that I was wasting was being spent looking

03:27.960 --> 03:34.200
at other people's posts and seeing how I thought other people lived.

03:34.200 --> 03:41.240
This influenced me to shape my life in a similar way, and I took on the values of what

03:41.240 --> 03:44.720
I saw online.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.040
In hindsight, I wasn't living my life at all.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.380
I was living society's life.

03:52.380 --> 03:56.000
This is one of the biggest problems with social media.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.360
It causes people to live their life based on some societal standard.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.520
This has always had an instinct to fit in.

04:05.520 --> 04:10.760
Collaboration and cooperation were necessary for our species to survive.

04:10.760 --> 04:17.180
Because of this, a sense of belonging is one of the most sought after and rewarding feelings

04:17.180 --> 04:19.880
anyone can experience.

04:19.880 --> 04:26.400
Think of the feeling of your favorite sports team winning the big game, or finally finishing

04:26.400 --> 04:32.120
a group project where each member of the group knew their role and carried it out perfectly.

04:33.040 --> 04:39.360
Successful group interaction triggers a firing of the pleasure centers in the brain, and releases

04:39.360 --> 04:45.000
amounts of dopamine synonymous with drug use.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.400
A feeling of belonging is sought in humans like drug addicts seek their next fix.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.280
And social media is designed to exploit this.

04:57.280 --> 05:03.720
All the little features, like comments, likes, and being able to share posts, are just gimmicks

05:03.720 --> 05:07.720
designed to get us hooked by causing dopamine to be released.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.440
I was guiltier of just posting what I thought everyone wanted to see than anyone.

05:20.440 --> 05:27.080
I knew that on social media, I was simply crafting an image of myself.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.480
But I didn't care.

05:29.480 --> 05:38.000
I loved attention, and I loved the ability to portray myself any way I wanted.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.760
It wasn't me.

05:39.760 --> 05:45.120
I was losing touch with my authentic self.

05:45.120 --> 05:52.480
And this problem manifests mainly in my generation, as teenagers have grown up with the internet.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.440
We've spent our whole lives interacting with our peers online.

05:57.440 --> 06:02.960
We're more comfortable on our phones than in a face-to-face interaction.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.760
And this has catastrophic consequences on our mental health.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.160
Studies have shown that kids who spend more time on their phones have less developed frontal

06:13.160 --> 06:14.880
cortexes.

06:14.880 --> 06:22.320
And we need our frontal cortex to plan for the future, think rationally, and solve problems.

06:22.320 --> 06:34.520
My generation is losing those abilities because we can't focus on anything besides our phones.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.200
Combine that with the fact that social media is our main source of forming connections with

06:39.200 --> 06:41.320
other people.

06:41.320 --> 06:50.760
And it's easy to see why teen depression has skyrocketed 33 percent just since 2010.

06:50.760 --> 06:56.680
And teen suicides have gone up 31 percent in the same period.

06:56.680 --> 07:01.400
We are killing ourselves just to fit in.

07:01.400 --> 07:06.360
Yet, everyone around me somehow thinks they're better than social media.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.720
They tell me, oh, I only use it to look at memes.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.760
Or, I just like to keep up with my friends that I can't see every day.

07:13.760 --> 07:20.520
Yet, the conversation that I constantly hear is gossip and judgment.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.680
Did you see my post?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.360
Did you like it?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.080
Did you see her post?

07:26.080 --> 07:28.960
Why was she hanging out with him?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.120
Why did he say that?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.840
He's so creepy.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.760
Why did she post that?

07:34.760 --> 07:38.120
She has no self-respect.

07:38.120 --> 07:44.160
The people around me are addicted to stalking other people.

07:45.160 --> 07:52.440
Yet, maintain the assertion that they're somehow above it all.

07:52.440 --> 07:58.320
And all the features that I talked about earlier, the gimmicks, they can't replace real life

07:58.320 --> 07:59.320
interaction.

07:59.320 --> 08:05.960
A like can't replace a smile or a compliment.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.240
But we treat it as if it can.

08:09.240 --> 08:15.440
We allow ourselves to become less social and lose touch with the face-to-face interactions

08:15.440 --> 08:18.360
that really matter.

08:18.360 --> 08:24.600
In a study by Pew Research Center, 55% of participants said they interact with their

08:24.600 --> 08:28.040
friends online on a daily basis.

08:28.040 --> 08:34.920
Only 33% said they interact with their friends face-to-face on a daily basis.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.880
Think about this.

08:36.880 --> 08:43.120
How many of you have ever pulled out your phone and stared at it just to avoid an awkward

08:43.120 --> 08:45.640
social situation?

08:45.640 --> 08:49.200
I know I see that every day in school.

08:49.200 --> 08:57.680
How many of you have ever taken a long video at a sporting event or concert so you can

08:57.680 --> 09:04.240
relive the moment later or share it with your friends instead of actually making sure that

09:04.240 --> 09:11.280
you're living in the moment and enjoying life as it happens?

09:11.280 --> 09:15.520
Last winter, I was at a crossroads in my life.

09:15.520 --> 09:21.040
I've always been driven, but I really had no idea what I wanted to do.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.640
Track has always been my main sport, but I didn't really think I wanted to run in college.

09:25.640 --> 09:31.240
I've also always had dreams of attending a top-level academic school.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.800
But schools like that required true excellence.

09:34.800 --> 09:42.680
I had no motivating force and nothing that separated me from the people around me.

09:42.680 --> 09:49.680
I cared more about creating the image that I wanted of myself online than working to

09:49.680 --> 09:53.560
secure the future that I wanted.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.120
Everybody has dreams of greatness when they're a kid.

09:57.120 --> 10:03.960
Everybody wants to live an average and unfulfilling life, yet so few people are willing to put

10:03.960 --> 10:11.400
in the work to developing themselves and unlocking their full potential.

10:11.400 --> 10:17.800
I realized that if I devoted myself to improving on the track, I would have a way of standing

10:17.800 --> 10:22.680
out from other applicants and maybe reaching one of my dream schools.

10:22.680 --> 10:27.720
So I began dedicating myself to track more and attempting to spend less time on social

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
media.

10:28.720 --> 10:35.720
However, about two weeks into this new routine, I realized that while I was training for track

10:35.720 --> 10:41.960
more, I was spending about the same amount of time on social media.

10:41.960 --> 10:48.640
I was simply shirking my academic duties and losing some sleep.

10:48.640 --> 10:56.080
I had to decide if running track in college and my future was more important to me than

10:56.080 --> 10:59.000
trying to fit in.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.080
And it was.

11:01.080 --> 11:08.240
Slowly but surely, I became disgusted with who I was and I wondered how I had let myself

11:08.240 --> 11:15.040
become so addicted to something that had no value in the long run.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.880
I decided to quit social media cold turkey.

11:18.880 --> 11:26.120
Instantly it was as if a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.400
I began to see the beauty and the world around me.

11:29.400 --> 11:36.800
I discovered my passion for life and I found a sense of individuality and contentment with

11:36.800 --> 11:40.480
who I was.

11:40.480 --> 11:46.440
And the week after I deleted social media, I changed more than I have at any other point

11:46.440 --> 11:47.720
in my life.

11:47.720 --> 11:55.200
I re-evaluated not only my actions, but my mindset, my goals, and my overall attitude

11:55.200 --> 11:57.100
towards life.

11:57.100 --> 12:04.000
I realized that at any given moment, I can be doing anything I want to in the world.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.200
I simply have to choose to do what's best for myself.

12:09.600 --> 12:17.000
Because of this, I'm on my own path now and I'm my own person.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.240
I'm not standing up here proclaiming that I'm a perfect person, devoid of weakness just

12:23.240 --> 12:25.880
because I deleted social media.

12:25.880 --> 12:33.720
But I am claiming that I'm in control of my own happiness and satisfaction with life.

12:33.720 --> 12:39.360
I'm also not claiming that by deleting social media, you will immediately become a better

12:39.360 --> 12:44.280
person, find happiness, and reach your goals.

12:44.280 --> 12:49.680
Deleting social media in itself doesn't bring anything of a direct value to your life.

12:49.680 --> 12:56.160
It's simply an avenue towards individual thought and freedom.

12:56.160 --> 13:03.320
Everybody spends their life searching for happiness and yearning for fulfillment, yet most people

13:03.320 --> 13:10.760
spend so much of it looking at other people's lives online.

13:10.760 --> 13:16.260
If you have the superpower to be present in the moment, and you aren't so preoccupied

13:16.260 --> 13:23.000
with what everyone else is doing, you'll find that life is a little easier.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.200
Happiness is always at hand.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.920
It's easier to treat the people around you with kindness and have straightforward but

13:30.920 --> 13:33.640
profound relationships.

13:33.640 --> 13:39.440
I think the world would be a better place if everyone possessed this skill.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.440
Thank you.

13:40.440 --> 13:40.940
Thank you.
