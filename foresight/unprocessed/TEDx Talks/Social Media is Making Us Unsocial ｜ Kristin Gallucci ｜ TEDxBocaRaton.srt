00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Weir is about to start time for another round of applause.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,380
Please welcome Ms.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:27,180
Pala and Ms.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:47,420
Just a moment, I'm posting this.

5
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,780
A few years ago, I attended a social media event.

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,340
This is an event where people gather and share their ideas with an audience.

7
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,980
Many of these influencers had spent years creating videos and sharing their stories

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:14,460
and encouraging others to build authentic relationships.

9
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:21,940
I watched with enthusiasm each one walk into the conference and write on by,

10
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,820
headed for the most Instagram worthy location in the conference hall.

11
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,940
With each attempt to introduce myself, I was ignored or brushed off.

12
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:45,740
You see, they chose to connect online rather than to connect with a human being.

13
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:55,580
They chose social media over the potential of a real relationship right in front of them.

14
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,820
That was the moment, the moment that changed my perspective.

15
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,860
Social media is making us unsocial.

16
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,300
Social media is killing relationships.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:23,900
Social media is replacing experiences.

18
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,220
Look familiar?

19
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,140
Or this?

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:42,220
How about this?

21
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,820
Social media has changed the way we live our lives,

22
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,260
from the way we get news to the way we interact with loved ones.

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
It's everywhere.

24
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,460
It's powerful.

25
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,020
And it's growing.

26
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:10,780
According to the Global Web Index, we spend on average two hours a day on social media,

27
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,660
and it's increasing at a rate of two minutes per day.

28
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:27,420
Over the course of a lifetime, that's five years and four months on social media.

29
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:35,980
That's over 40,000 hours.

30
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:44,580
The experience of art and history are being replaced with a digital representation of those things.

31
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,420
Rather than visit a museum or art gallery,

32
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,380
we take to Instagram to view the works of artists like Banksy.

33
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,340
Social media is impacting social issues too.

34
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,660
Have you heard the term slacktivism?

35
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,340
While social media activism brings awareness to societal issues,

36
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,380
the awareness isn't translating into real change.

37
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,060
It's a shift to devices.

38
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:34,780
People are pressing a like button rather than actively engaging with campaigns in real life.

39
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:43,460
We care more about how other people perceive our adventures than actually having them.

40
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:51,100
The urge to check social media is stronger than the urge for sex.

41
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,500
Yet both are driven by a need to connect.

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Many relationships have been jeopardized or ruined because of micro-cheating,

43
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,860
pushing the boundaries of fidelity through social media.

44
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,820
We know that the world is changing with every passing moment

45
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,140
because of technological inventions and rapid adoption of the technology.

46
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,540
But technology is not the problem.

47
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,140
We are.

48
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,460
And the reality is we are slowly becoming addicted.

49
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380
How do I know?

50
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm on the inside.

51
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,660
For the past 20 years, I've been in marketing.

52
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:55,580
And as long as there are advertisers looking to capture your attention and get you hooked,

53
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,060
there will be new social platforms.

54
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,460
There will be new social channels.

55
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:10,220
For the last few years, I had been creating content on social, specifically on LinkedIn.

56
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,340
And I was named a top voice on the platform.

57
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,980
But what I realized was the more I was creating online and building relationships online,

58
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:28,260
I was losing touch with people in real life.

59
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:36,060
After food and shelter, our need to belong and feel positively connected

60
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:49,580
is arguably the number one predictor of health, happiness, well-being, and even longevity.

61
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,740
Human connection brings complex value to our lives.

62
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,900
It's the interactive exchange that defines us.

63
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,180
We need to use social media as a support to building real relationships,

64
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,700
not a catalyst to losing them.

65
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Remember, some of the most brilliant minds in the world, think Silicon Valley tech,

66
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:31,660
have dedicated their lives to making social media more addictive.

67
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
We need to get aggressive to get our focus back.

68
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,300
We can do it.

69
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
Here's how.

70
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,860
Turn notifications off.

71
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,340
Delete social media apps from your phone.

72
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:55,980
Educate others and help our children understand how to manage their usage.

73
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:04,660
Use social media to build relationships and take it offline.

74
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:20,260
We already know the risks, anxiety, isolation, depression, cyberbullying, low self-worth.

75
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,500
We can do it.

76
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,180
Let's disconnect to connect.

77
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
Thank you.
