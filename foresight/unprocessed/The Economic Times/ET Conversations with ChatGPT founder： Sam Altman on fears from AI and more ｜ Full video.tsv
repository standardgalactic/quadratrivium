0	3680	I want to ask Sam some questions myself and then after that we'll open it up to a broader
3680	7200	set of people so everyone can have some time.
7200	12160	You know Sam, just before we start, I want everyone to understand your story because
12160	16560	you have such an interesting background in the tech ecosystem, you know, help us walk
16560	21960	us through from graduating, not graduating, joining Stanford, dropping out, running Y
21960	27040	Combinator, running a different startup before that, and now running OpenAI and a number
27040	28040	of things.
28040	30720	Just help us understand how you came to where you are right now.
30720	39240	Yeah, so I started at Stanford where we met and I was already in love with computer science
39240	42080	but I really fell in love with it once I got there.
42080	46000	I actually went to study AI but at the time AI was really not working at all.
46000	50880	In fact, very memorably one of my professors said the only sure way to have a bad career
50880	53000	in AI is to work on neural networks.
53000	56200	We've decided those don't work.
56200	59200	And so I got kind of discouraged and I started a company.
59200	60200	That was a great experience.
60200	65400	The company didn't work out that well but I kind of like learned about startups and
65400	68600	thought they were a very powerful force and something I was very excited about.
68600	74920	So I then ran YC for a while and while I was doing that, I got newly excited about the
74920	79600	idea of startups that take on hard technical challenges.
79600	84400	And I sort of thought it was curious to me more people weren't doing that.
84400	86920	It seemed like a really valuable opportunity.
86920	90000	With some other people, started OpenAI is one of those examples and many other things
90000	95000	which have gone on to be pretty exciting but really fell in love with OpenAI.
95000	100880	Once it seemed clear that we were really going to have a chance at making true general purpose
100880	105960	AI like a system that could do what a human can do and contribute new knowledge to society,
105960	109840	I got really excited and wanted to go work on that.
109840	114360	And so stop being an investor and now I do that.
114360	116920	So first of all, what is OpenAI?
116920	118520	Is it just chat GPT?
118520	119520	Are they the same thing?
119520	120520	Are they different?
120520	123200	Just help us understand what the company does.
123200	128560	We are a company that is doing research and deployment to try to figure out how to build
128560	133480	AGI and how to responsibly deploy that into the world for maximum benefit.
133480	136840	So this is unlike other technologies.
136840	140480	Other technologies are like this too but this is a strong case of a technology that
140600	144800	on the one hand is the most exciting, most promising, coolest thing.
144800	147680	I think that humanity will have yet built.
147680	152680	We can cure all disease, we can give everybody a great education, better healthcare, massively
152680	157320	increased productivity, huge scientific discovery, all of these wonderful things and we want
157320	161880	to make sure that people get that benefit, that benefit is distributed equitably.
161880	167280	And on the other hand, there are the obvious concerns about the power of this technology
167280	169880	used in a negative direction.
170000	176080	So we want to be a force to help manage those risks so that we all get to enjoy the benefits.
176080	179960	Chat GPT is definitely what we are best known for so I guess there is sort of synonymous
179960	183800	at this point but OpenAI is really about this quest for AGI.
183800	186240	Interesting.
186240	189360	So help us understand, I mean all of us have played with it, right?
189360	193720	We have poems getting written by it, we have all asked it fun trivia questions, teller
193720	199440	and answers but help us understand, you without a doubt have a better understanding of how
199520	204080	it's getting used all around the world and all sorts of different industries, vocations,
204080	205840	reasons.
205840	209880	Talk to us a little bit about some of the most interesting things that you've seen.
209880	213960	For example, what's the most surprising use case of some of the technologies that you
213960	217440	guys have built that you've seen recently?
217440	221840	So the main thing I would say that's interesting about it is its generality.
221840	225080	There's a lot of other systems that can go do this thing well or that thing well or this
225080	228120	thing and in many cases better than Chat GPT.
228560	233880	There's probably not an AI that can write a better poem or whatever but other categories
233880	237880	you could find something that's maybe better but the fact that this one system is truly
237880	242600	general purpose and can do so many things means that people are integrating it into
242600	248000	their workflow as a very powerful tool and so the same thing that can help you write
248000	253600	computer code, one of the areas that we've seen the biggest impact is what coders are
253600	257920	using this for, doubling, tripling their productivity.
257920	262400	There was a paper that just came out that when Italy temporarily banned Chat GPT developer
262400	270200	productivity fell in half on a fairly big study but it can do that, it can also help
270200	275120	you find information, it can help you write a poem, it can help you summarize documents,
275120	280440	it can translate things and people are using this which we hoped would happen as this sort
280440	284960	of super assistant that just makes them more and more productive and it's that generality
284960	288280	that I think is the coolest part.
288280	293200	So with so much ability that maybe even you guys haven't even thought about how people
293200	298360	are using it when you developed it and launched it, I'm sure you've seen a lot of interesting
298360	301360	use cases right here out of India itself.
301360	304280	Can you tell us something or just give us an example of something you've seen that's
304280	308480	really inspired you that you've seen come out of the Indian market?
308480	314000	So India has been a country that has really truly embraced Chat GPT in a way, maybe you
314000	317080	can tell me why, I'm sort of curious, I'm hoping to learn while I'm here, we're very
317080	324880	delighted but there has been a lot of early adoption and real enthusiasm from the users.
324880	330920	One of the very earliest things like in the first weeks of launching Chat GPT, we heard
330920	337120	about a farmer in India who wasn't able to access government services and via like Chat
337120	341680	GPT hooked up to WhatsApp in some sort of complicated way, was then able to.
341680	344600	And that was like one of the early things where we're like, huh, we did not think that
344600	346800	was going to happen.
346800	352640	And just to expand on it, so what I've understood about OpenAI is Chat GPT is one implementation
352640	359720	of the things you've built but you have capabilities to real time translate, to transcribe audio
359720	365360	and detects and are you seeing people use these in combination in ways that are surprising?
365600	370240	Well, we recently launched an iPhone app that has speech recognition in it, which is that's
370240	372640	hooking up two of our models together and people love that.
372640	379440	But the main point that I would like to get across is none of the current systems really
379440	380440	matter.
380440	384680	Like, we're going to look back at GPT4 and you know, I don't know if any of you have
384680	390320	like picked up an iPhone, original iPhone in recent years but it's like, wow, I cannot
390320	392160	believe we're excited about this.
392160	398960	Each pixel is like that big, it just feels like this incredibly antiquated thing.
398960	403880	The curve here is going to be much, much steeper and what the systems are going to be capable
403880	408800	of in the not distant future, we think, is going to be very dramatically different.
408800	414760	So this is like a system that, I don't even know what the right, this is like the old
414760	419960	first like grayscale Nokia phone that looked like a little candy bar and the iPhone 14
419960	422560	is coming.
422560	428360	So what I would say is, it's a mistake to get too focused on the current systems, their
428360	432400	limitations, their capabilities, the impact they're having.
432400	437920	The thing that matters here is we are on an exponential curve, truly, two big miracles
437920	439480	I think in the field.
439480	445720	Number one, we have an algorithm that can genuinely, truly like no tricks learn and number two,
445720	449440	it gets predictably better with scale.
449440	455400	And that, we're going to look back, I think, on those two realizations as a turning point
455400	459640	in human history when you put them together, but what it means is that the rate of progress
459640	462400	in the coming years, the capabilities are going to be significant.
462400	468720	So it's totally cool that chatGVT can write that poem when a future system can like cure
468720	475480	all disease or help us address climate change or radically improve education or make us
475480	478520	all like 10 or 100 times more productive than what we do.
478520	479840	That's quite impactful.
479840	482040	It's amazing.
482040	487080	Now let's flip to the other side of this because there's no doubt there's incredible power
487080	491440	in this technology and with that comes challenges.
491440	495280	I want to play a clip, maybe you guys can put on a clip of something I recently heard
495280	498760	Sam speak somewhere and we can talk about it a bit.
498760	500280	Could you play the clip please?
500280	503880	Hi, my name is Sam and I'm happy to be here today.
503880	505880	Thank you all for joining.
505880	510400	I also wanted to say that the gentleman on stage with me is incredibly good looking and
510400	514440	I also want to say that you should be very careful with videos generated with artificial
514440	516400	intelligence technology.
516400	522120	Okay, so you didn't say that recently, clearly that was just a ploy here and thank you by
522120	523120	the way.
523120	526120	Totally agree with that one.
526120	531240	But nonetheless, I think it raises a real question, right, when this video, if you look
531240	534560	closely you can see the lips aren't perfectly synced, but like you said this stuff is only
534600	538280	going to get better and exponentially better.
538280	542120	Fundamental questions are on authenticity, what's real and what's fake, how do we handle
542120	543120	that?
543120	547680	Yeah, so that was like deeply in the uncanny valley, it's very strange to watch, but we're
547680	554600	not that far away from something that looks perfect and there's a lot of fear right now
554600	559520	about the impact this is going to have on elections and on our society and how we ever
559520	562280	trust media that we see.
562320	565920	I have some fear there, but I think we're actually going to, when it comes to like a
565920	569880	video like that, I think as a society we're going to rise to the occasion.
569880	575360	We're going to learn very quickly that we don't trust videos unless we trust the sort
575360	576800	of provenance.
576800	581200	We'll have techniques like watermarking detectors, more than that I suspect at some point if people
581200	585800	are saying something really important they'll cryptographically sign it and you know web
585800	592240	browsers or phones or whatever will build in some ability to say okay this is authentic.
592280	598080	But that part we can all adapt to, like we did this with Photoshop, there was a period
598080	602040	of time where people thought if you see an image it's got to be real, we learned, we're
602040	607600	like okay you know that thing is Photoshopped, it happened quickly, videos like that, society
607600	612040	will build antibodies quickly, but there's a related thing that I think is getting discussed
612040	618800	less which is not the ability to generate mass media like that, but customized one-on-one
618840	624400	interactive persuasion and I think people are going to be able to create AIs that are
624400	629880	very good at this, so I won't just be like you know I'm watching a video of you, but
629880	634360	it'll be like I'm chatting with you back and forth and it's like the most interesting
634360	638320	compelling conversation that I've ever had that's like affecting me in ways I don't know
638320	644520	about and that's a new thing that's different than just generated media, again I think we'll
644560	649120	find a way to build societal antibodies to it, but I don't think it's discussed as much
649120	651040	and it's going to be a challenge.
651040	659240	I also want to talk about jobs because the natural fears AI is going to make us redundant,
659240	663880	particularly in markets like India where we have so much of a workforce and a lot of
663880	669080	it is often times doing somewhat rote work, should we be worried about this, I mean does
669080	673640	this affect societal disruption on employment and capitalism and all the things in how we've
673640	674640	been running?
674640	680760	I mean to some extent yes, every technological revolution leads to job change and this will
680760	688760	be no exception, I guess three thoughts, number one job change itself is fine, you know if
688760	693320	you kind of look at the history of this, in two generations we can kind of adapt to any
693320	698040	amount of labor market change and there's new jobs and the new jobs are usually better
698040	703720	and that's going to happen here too, some jobs will go away, there will be new better
703720	707360	jobs, they're difficult to imagine as we sit here and dream about the future is going
707360	712280	to look like, the thing that might be different about this is the speed with which it could
712280	717800	happen and I think it will require a change to the socioeconomic contract and the way
717800	722560	governments think about this if it happens at a very fast pace.
722560	728400	The second thing is it's not going the way people predicted so far and I don't think
728400	734240	it will in the future, so the current systems are actually not very good at all at doing
734240	739840	whole jobs, they're very good at doing tasks and so the nature of the job, if you're say
739840	745280	a computer programmer to stick with that example, shifts to you kind of like manage a team of
745280	751280	extremely, extremely junior developers that can only do one minute task at a time and
751280	755760	then they'll do 10 minute tasks and then they'll do an hour task but you'll still have to think
755760	759520	of like how is this all going to fit together, what I want to build and you know maybe eventually
759520	765760	it learns that too but this idea that instead of replacing jobs it's making people dramatically
765760	771120	more efficient and there is such a demand overhang in most places, you know if we can
771120	775760	overnight make the world create 3x more software because we make every software developer three
775760	780600	times more efficient, that is not nearly enough, that does not nearly fulfill the demand the
780600	784920	world has for software and I think we'll see that in many other places.
784920	792080	So another example of this is that the consensus, not the consensus, the like absolute belief
792080	797440	of experts around the world 10 years ago, first AI is going to come replace the physical
797440	802840	labor jobs so truck drivers, farmers, factory workers, real trouble then it will come for
802840	809640	the sort of easier kinds of cognitive labor then maybe eventually like computer programmers
809680	814920	even a mathematician and then you know way in the future or maybe never because maybe
814920	820160	it's like magical and human the creative jobs and of course we can look now and say it appears
820160	825720	like it's going exactly the other direction but that was like really non-obvious certainly
825720	831720	to us we started thinking we were going to build robots and it's still in some deep sense
831720	835560	to me seems like it should be much easier to make robots than it is to make GPT-4 but
835560	842560	here we are. I think with other job impacts it's just going to be surprising but I think
843920	848360	the world will get way wealthier you'll have a productivity boom and we will find a lot
848360	850760	of new things to do.
850760	857760	You talked about robots and you know we've talked about sort of the real practical likely
858560	863680	disruption that we're going to see because of AI but we also have to talk about that
863720	868840	one percent like extinction risk or that robots are going to come and take over our
868840	873040	lives how do you think about that I mean you have actually been probably more so than the
873040	879540	average person cautious about this and for us we kind of think of it as sci-fi kind of
879540	884880	like in the in the realm of not really realistic but interesting to talk about but I think
884880	888480	you would say it's something real that we have to think about how we understand it.
888480	893440	For sure like I want to be super clear I don't think current systems are dangerous I don't
893480	899000	think there's any way that GPT-4 like causes an existential risk to the world but people
899000	906000	are very bad at thinking about exponential curves and GPT-10 may be a extremely different
907000	913200	thing. Given the importance of getting this right even if it's a one percent chance I
913200	920200	think putting a lot of effort into thinking studying like how we align an AGI how we design
920240	925800	safe systems at this kind of scale is super important and starting that early is really
925800	929880	good I think we can totally manage through it I think we're developing techniques to
929880	934080	mitigate it this is really why we started the company this was like our initial focus and
934080	939360	still is our most important focus but yeah we need to address this.
939360	943160	Is there like a power switch in the back of your office that nobody knows about where
943160	946600	you can just pull like that thing in Jurassic Park that giant yeah it has to be big and
946640	950520	dramatic but you pull this big thing and it shuts down all the systems if we need it exactly
950520	955680	like that okay good I'm glad I feel better now okay and it works even if you're traveling
955680	961360	right I mean yeah okay anyways so let's talk about regulation because again I think what's
961360	966200	really unusual is this company is a few years old but really for the for the consumer it's
966200	971960	like less than a year old because of chat GPT and yet here you are traveling the world
971960	976200	meeting leaders globally to talk about the importance of regulation and not only are
976200	981320	you doing that you are probably one of the most vocal people saying we need it and not
981320	985040	one of those you know we'll regulate ourselves leave us alone type of things you are saying
985040	990800	governments need to step up understand this and get involved this is very weird this is
990800	995800	not like how most startups operate what's going on well again we started the company
995800	1000320	because we were nervous about AGI risk before you were really before people even talked
1000360	1005360	about AGI and now I think part of the reason we deploy systems is so that people confront
1008480	1013760	the technology feel it understand the risks the benefits and now a lot of other people
1013760	1019280	are also very excited but sharing the concern I think this is a special moment where the
1019280	1022360	globe can come together and kind of get this right and we certainly would like to try to
1022360	1027360	do that let's talk a little bit more about AI in India because it's so unique for us
1027680	1031680	and there are so many interesting use cases that are very India specific you know one of
1031680	1037680	the obvious questions we think a lot about are languages right India has one of the largest
1037680	1043160	depths of languages hundreds of languages in the country now AI is by and large trained
1043160	1047880	on what's publicly available what's available on most of the internet which is you know
1047880	1052560	inevitably going to be mostly English probably a lot more Western focused in terms of just
1052560	1057120	the sheer quantity of stuff that goes into trade and that's what we're going to be doing
1057120	1062440	to training how do you think about biases how do you think about inclusivity how do
1062440	1068200	you think about multilingual countries like India and making a product that's relevant
1068200	1073560	that's useful not just for all of us fancy people sitting in Bombay and Delhi but for
1073560	1079120	you know everyone in the mass of the country yeah it's super important to us we had a big
1079120	1085880	step forward from GPT 3.5 to 4 at non English languages so GPT 4 is pretty good at say the
1085880	1090220	top 20 languages and okay it may be the top hundred we will be able to push this much
1090220	1097200	further you know it's challenging for us for very small languages spoken by you know only
1097200	1101640	a few tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that that's difficult but the systems
1101640	1106120	are fundamentally going to be very good at this I think and it's important for us to
1106120	1110880	do now as you were saying it's not just the language it's also the history the culture
1110960	1117520	the values and we want the entire world represented in here there will be some areas where the
1117520	1122360	world's got to agree on like here the sort of global bounds of the system but mostly
1122360	1127240	if you want to use it in the US or in India that can be under a different legal framework
1127240	1131560	and then in different parts of the culture in each place it'll be very different and
1131560	1135240	I think that should all be represented in there we recently launched a new program to
1135240	1139840	give out grants for people that want to run experiments of the ways we can do this the
1139840	1146840	way we can collect this but we really really want to you know India has been particularly
1146840	1153280	unique and successful globally at building a lot of the underlying technology stacks
1153280	1160080	to support new innovation and digital with India stack UPI other things like this do
1160080	1167080	you think India should build its own LLM AGI AI engine you know in some sense should we
1167080	1171120	think of this a little bit like nuclear technology where every country should be building its
1171120	1175160	own capabilities and you know a little bit more nationalist in the way we think about
1175160	1180000	this I mean how do you think as a country we should think about AI as something in a
1180000	1185960	sovereign sense first of all it's super impressive to see what India has done I think in a way
1185960	1191200	that really no other country has with these sort of saying we're going to do national
1191240	1198240	technology really well and like make it a really like a national asset in terms of AI
1198520	1203360	strategy I think there's like a lot of things that can work I think this question of sort
1203360	1208520	of AI sovereignty none of us have an answer to yet feels like it's going to be at least
1208520	1214440	somewhat important but the main thing that I think is important is figuring out how to
1214440	1221440	integrate these technologies into other services and that is an area that I think governments
1221440	1228440	are behind on and don't have the answers to yet but you know I think like hopefully we
1229720	1235720	all start to use LLMs to make government services way better both from like how do I enroll
1235720	1239720	in this program to like how do I get better healthcare but if you're in the Indian government
1239720	1245080	should you be like we need to set up a team of crack engineers to build our own open AI
1245080	1249440	I mean is there a concern for us to say are we depending on like for fundamental infrastructure
1249440	1254560	are we depending on something that's not owned by our country yeah I think it is good to have
1254560	1258960	certainly some sort of AI research effort what exactly that should do you know should
1258960	1264720	that be training ground up LLMs should that be pursuing new research directions should
1264720	1268800	that be focused on fine tuning open source projects I think there's a lot of options
1268800	1275800	there and there's I don't yet like have conviction on the right answer but some you know nationally
1276400	1283320	funded AI effort feels like a good idea. One of the things that I think is so interesting
1283320	1289840	is that open AI straddles this line of being a non-profit and a for-profit and I don't know
1289840	1293400	how I don't know if I fully understand it I don't know if many people do I know you've
1293400	1300400	raised money from investors and Microsoft is definitely one of your shareholders when
1300440	1305440	we think about it is it do we think of open AI as something that's here for society to
1305440	1310480	do societal good is it here to make money for its shareholders is it both what happens
1310480	1314320	if those conflict how do we think about that. If they conflict we're definitely here for
1314320	1319040	the societal good like that's super clear and that's why we put up with all this complication
1319040	1321920	in our structure. So what is the structure can you help us understand what exactly does
1322000	1325560	it look like. Yeah so there's like a non-profit that has a board that governs this thing that
1325560	1331760	we call a cap profit where our investors can make a certain return but if we ever need
1331760	1336640	to make a decision that is in favor of societal good but not in favor of shareholders we're
1336640	1343640	set up to do that. And one of the most controversial things I heard was that you don't own equity
1343640	1351120	in open AI why is that what's going on. I mean it started just as like sort of this
1351240	1354800	work of our structure where we needed non-conflicted people on the board who didn't have equity
1354800	1361240	a certain number of them certain percentage. And then I kind of just like never got like
1361240	1366240	I forget about it until it comes up and something like this but it's I don't think it's like
1366240	1371520	a particularly noteworthy thing like I made a ton of money early in my career I actively
1371520	1376760	invest so I expect to make a ton more. I get far more value from even like personally
1376760	1382600	selfishly speaking I get far more value from like all of the other sort of benefits that
1382600	1387840	come from running open AI a very interesting life than I would for more money. But most
1387840	1392480	of all like I just believe that this is going to be the most important project of our time
1392480	1397160	and I'm super grateful to work on it. If you need me to like send you reminders to
1397160	1402000	keep up on it I'm happy to do that just let me know. So look a lot of people have flown
1402000	1405840	in here from all around the country to come hear you and while understanding all this
1405920	1411640	theory about AI is cool help us do our jobs better. I want to put you in a couple roles
1411640	1418440	and tell me OK you are now the CEO of a hospital in India. What should you do and not theoretical
1418440	1423560	go hire a couple people like tell like help me do my job better be my AI for a second.
1423560	1429000	One of the things that we have heard from a lot of doctors is that they're using chat
1429000	1436600	GPT with GPT for to help come up with new ideas for tricky cases. So you know input the symptoms
1436600	1440840	maybe the test results say I can't figure this out. What are some ideas for the differential
1440840	1446320	diagnosis and in many cases getting great results back. Now let's say you're running
1446320	1452720	a bank. What do you do. This is like rapid fire. We're all taking notes to do our jobs
1452720	1457160	better here like a sort of traditional like bank branch on the street that kind of bank
1457240	1461680	not like an investment. Yeah like a bank like a traditional bank that issues credit cards
1461680	1473080	and checking accounts and all that stuff. I think I would try to just like on a very brief
1473080	1478280	little side journey of my career I once like helped build a mobile banking app and on the
1478280	1484600	side. No no it was like OK yeah whatever. I still think the consumer experience of banking
1484600	1490440	is terrible and could be a lot of it could be replaced by like chatting with an LLM. It's
1490440	1495200	interesting. Let's say you're running a university. You're a you're a chancellor. I mean we've all
1495200	1499320	seen how chat GPT can definitely affect the education experience. Now let's say you're
1499320	1502680	running a university. Yeah that one I think is pretty clear. I would just like go redesign
1502680	1506680	the education experience. I would have the equivalent of like personalized tutoring
1506680	1513600	interactive textbooks. I would like I would integrate it into like all parts of the learning
1513600	1519480	process. Now just totally theoretically let's say you're running like a large news media
1519480	1526200	company in like a market like India like just as an example. What would you do. Let me just
1526200	1532800	get my pen real quick. But what would you do. Just tell me. One of the things that you know
1532800	1536600	there's been a lot of controversy about whether this is going to be good or bad for the publishing
1536600	1542640	industry and news in particular. One of the things that we've heard from journalists and
1542640	1548200	reporters who are actually using the the product is that it helps them do the boring parts
1548200	1553040	of their jobs better and they get to spend more time reporting talking to sources thinking
1553040	1560000	of ideas. And so I think I would just like encourage everyone to just start using it.
1560000	1566400	And now let's say you are the ministry in India responsible for overseeing technology
1566560	1573600	A.I. etc. You know what what would you do in that situation. Like what would you be doing
1573600	1579080	today as a regulator. I would say you know we have the G 20 coming up. India can play
1579080	1585120	like a huge role here in global conversation about what this sort of international regulatory
1585120	1588880	thing might look like. And we are going to really focus on that between now and September
1588880	1595800	and make sure we prioritize that. Can you tell us something that you haven't
1595840	1600480	told other people about what's coming from open A.I. like maybe just some insider information
1600480	1604280	that we could use in some form. You know we kind of tell people what we're working on
1604280	1608520	like it's going to get smarter. It's going to get multimodal. We're going to try to like
1608520	1613880	teach it to generate new ideas come up and help us like discover more new science. We're
1613880	1620760	going to reduce hallucinations and give users like more control so no one feels like it's
1620760	1624960	biased or at least it's biased in the way you want us to be biased. We don't have like
1625000	1631000	a lot of secret plans here. I think always as a company to our strength and weakness we
1631000	1636360	just sort of say what we think and what we're going to try to do. It's amazing. Now one
1636360	1641120	of the most amazing things about you Sam is that you are running what is going to be one
1641120	1646360	of the most impactful companies in history. Whenever people say impactful they leave out
1646360	1650240	whether it's going to be a good or a bad impact. That is a very purposeful leave out because
1650280	1655240	we don't know right. But you're going to shape the world with this. We know that. And this
1655240	1659600	isn't your only job as I understand or maybe it's my only like operating. It's the only
1659600	1663920	thing that I'm like in the trenches. Can you tell us what else you're doing that's like
1663920	1669960	exciting you or motivating you outside of open AI. Your side hustles if we put it that way.
1669960	1675960	I think we're going to get nuclear fusion to work in the next few years at and importantly
1676000	1682000	not just as a scientific demonstration but as incredibly cheap energy and at global skill.
1683240	1689040	So I think other than AI if you could do one thing that would like really help the world
1689040	1693400	get richer increase the quality of life. It's very cheap energy. I think there's like a huge
1693400	1699880	historical correlation there. And I think we've all like lost sight of the appropriate ambition
1699880	1705040	level here of how how much of an impact we could make. But if we can get fusion to work and if
1705040	1710040	we can make enough of it for the world then if it can like cut the energy cost 10 X plus that's
1710040	1717480	pretty great. I'll pick that one. So your side gig is nuclear fusion. I don't. I am an investor and
1717480	1723240	sort of like helper of that one. It's amazing. So just so I understand you're you're revolutionizing
1723240	1730000	artificial intelligence and energy. Not you specifically. I think those are like those are
1730000	1736560	the two. My basic model of the world is that the cost of intelligence and the cost of energy are
1736560	1743000	kind of what compounded everything else. And if we want a radically better future those are the
1743000	1751760	two things we should focus on trying to like make abundant. It's incredible. So my last question for
1751760	1759480	you is what is the most exciting thing that you are seeing globally in your own company. Like what
1759520	1764680	is the thing that outside of everything we are all talking about and seeing that excites you about
1764680	1770000	where open AI or even not just AI in general. What's the most exciting thing ahead.
1775400	1782120	I mean I think it's this generation of new scientific progress. If these systems can really
1782120	1789560	contribute additional understanding of the world better technology better science that that is like
1789560	1793880	the sustainable way that the world actually gets better and that the quality of life increases.
1794880	1798920	We're not there yet. It might be soon it might take a while but I believe we are going to get there
1799600	1808280	and that will I think we all underestimate that. It's amazing. Sam thank you so much. Thank you to be
1808280	1813600	clear. Sam asked me to talk less and to open it up for you all to ask more.
