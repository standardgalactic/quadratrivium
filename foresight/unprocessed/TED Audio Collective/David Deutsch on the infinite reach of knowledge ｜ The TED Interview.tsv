0	7000	Welcome to the TED interview. I'm Chris Anderson.
7000	11000	This is the podcast series where I sit down with a TED speaker,
11000	16000	and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas and was possible during their TED talk.
16000	21000	Today's guest is something of a personal hero.
21000	24000	David Deutch. He's a physicist and author.
24000	28000	He has a reputation of being something of a reclusive genius.
28000	32000	He lives by himself in a home in Oxford, working late into the night,
32000	37000	trying to unpack really the deepest mysteries of the cosmos.
37000	41000	His thinking has really had a dramatic impact on how I see the world.
41000	49000	Here's the thing. Most scientists would tell you that human beings are just that significant.
49000	55000	We are just this little speck of dust and a random planet in an obscure part of the universe.
55000	60000	David Deutch says that's wrong. He actually says people matter,
60000	65000	and the reason they matter is that they are incubating something â€“ knowledge.
65000	72000	In David's view, knowledge is a force of almost unlimited power in the universe,
72000	75000	and also a force that will determine our future.
75000	80000	We can survive, and we can fail to survive.
80000	87000	But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
87000	93000	The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.
93000	97000	And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically,
97000	105000	our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and our civilization
105000	115000	from all the others, namely our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge, to be a hub of existence.
115000	119000	David's thinking about knowledge has had a huge impact on me personally.
119000	125000	In a book called The Fabric of Reality, David argued that the way in which we think of knowledge
125000	128000	as broken up into all these different fields is misguided.
128000	134000	Actually, all of knowledge is connected, and if we spent a bit more time understanding those connections,
134000	139000	understanding the context of what we know, that is where real understanding comes from,
139000	141000	where the real breakthroughs come from.
141000	146000	Believe it or not, I honestly think it was reading that book that finally gave me the courage 18 years ago
146000	150000	to leave my company and take over leadership of TED,
150000	154000	which back then was an annual conference in California
154000	158000	devoted to bringing together technology, entertainment, and design.
158000	164000	You see, if Deutsch was right, the sharing of accessible knowledge between different disciplines
164000	169000	wasn't just a short-term fad and wasn't just limited to those three subjects.
169000	172000	It was something the world would always need.
172000	175000	So he inspired me to take the leap, and here we are.
175000	179000	And honestly, David, it's an honor to be speaking with you today. Welcome.
179000	184000	Well, it's very nice to be here, and thanks for the dramatic introduction.
184000	187000	I'm very glad to hear it.
187000	194000	So, David, in the first TED talk you gave, you had this phrase that you quoted really from Stephen Hawking.
194000	202000	Stephen Hawking referred to humans as basically chemical scum on the surface of an obscure planet.
202000	209000	And that's actually quite a common view of how science is thought of as treating humans.
209000	213000	We started thinking we were the center of everything, and then we gradually discovered that no,
213000	218000	we're just a planet revolving around a star, and then that star is just one of a hundred billion in a galaxy,
218000	221000	and that galaxy is one of hundreds of billions of other galaxies.
221000	227000	And goodness knows, we become very quickly, completely insignificant.
227000	231000	You, I think, disagree with that characterization. Explain why.
231000	237000	I do, and you're right that that's the prevailing view, because that's the view that's kind of forced on us
237000	241000	by a narrow conception of what science is.
241000	252000	According to that view, you classify things in the universe in a sort of hierarchy of more massive and powerful verses,
252000	254000	less massive and so on.
254000	263000	And so we're used to the fact that the big objects like the supermassive black holes in the center of a galaxy
263000	272000	affect a star, can rip a star to pieces, but the star being ripped to pieces hardly affects the supermassive black hole.
272000	278000	And it's the same with the sun and the solar system, you know, the sun affects the earth,
278000	281000	but the earth barely affects the sun and so on.
281000	289000	But the funny thing is, on earth, on the surface of the earth, everything's the other way around.
289000	295000	Everywhere you look, you see the effects of life on earth and life.
295000	304000	Every living thing that you see is the result of the action of a single molecule or two molecules or something,
304000	308000	depending on what kind of organism it is.
308000	315000	So this submicroscopic entity commands vast resources.
315000	323000	Now, humans take this to a wholly different level where we are capable of becoming cosmically significant,
323000	330000	not just dominating the surface of a planet, but dominating the galaxy and further out.
330000	336000	Well, how so? You mean by kind of star trek like exploration or something else?
336000	340000	Yes, star trek or rather colonization.
340000	343000	It's what we do.
343000	357000	Humans evolved, unlike all other existing organisms, to find new environments which are initially lethal to them
357000	361000	and to change the environment such that they can live comfortably there.
361000	369000	Here I am sitting in Oxford and if it weren't for technology, I would die within hours
369000	377000	because without clothes, without shelter, without medical attention, without sources of food from far away,
377000	381000	I would be very hard put to it to forage.
381000	388000	And the territory here supported only a tiny number of people in the early days of our species,
388000	391000	whereas now it supports tens of millions.
391000	399000	And so the difference between your survival and otherwise is human knowledge turned into technology
399000	406000	which has built the house, the central heating, the clothes and so forth that keep you alive.
406000	408000	Yes, fundamentally it's knowledge.
408000	417000	I mean, when you talk about that humans can have indefinite impact on the universe through star trek like expansion out,
417000	419000	like at first glance a lot of people listening to that will say,
419000	426000	well, already that's sounding a little silly, that's science fiction in any way and how can that possibly mean much.
426000	434000	But your whole second book, this idea of the beginning of infinity is arguing that knowledge in principle has infinite reach
434000	441000	and therefore if you don't include that in your worldview, you are missing out on something fundamentally important.
441000	447000	So talk a bit more about how we could think of that reach of knowledge.
447000	451000	Perhaps it's more illuminating to think of this the other way around.
451000	456000	So suppose there were some extraterrestrial beings, intelligent beings,
456000	462000	looking around at the stars from let's say a hundred light years away or something in the galaxy
462000	469000	and they would see various stars and they might use astrophysics to predict what these stars will do.
469000	474000	But on Earth they would detect something.
474000	481000	For example, the fact that there's oxygen in the atmosphere which tells them that there's life here.
481000	485000	And then they would detect if they kept watching the Earth for a while.
485000	489000	I mean, I'm kind of imagining them with technology similar to ours.
489000	491000	They could detect more if they had better technology.
491000	495000	But if they watched the Earth for a couple of decades,
495000	501000	they would see that the mean temperature of the planet is changing faster than it possibly could.
501000	508000	Only artificial intervention can change the temperature of the Earth as fast as it has been changing.
508000	513000	This is inexplicable without the presence of intelligent beings.
513000	520000	And if they then ask themselves, well, this influence, the influence that affected the atmosphere of that planet,
520000	523000	could it possibly affect us?
523000	534000	And the answer is yes, because the issue of whether a spaceship can get there is a matter of what we decide to do.
534000	537000	And it's also a matter of the laws of physics.
537000	544000	So David, I think it's important almost in having this conversation to bear in mind that the way you think,
544000	552000	by thinking in sort of theoretical terms about what knowledge might in principle one day do,
552000	560000	that has implications for how we should think of human beings and our role in the world.
560000	565000	And so when we talk about aliens and we talk about the potential for exploration,
565000	568000	you're not saying that, hey, this is going to happen anytime soon.
568000	579000	What you're saying is it is in principle possible for this species that has evolved on Earth to have a future that is imaginable.
579000	587000	It may not happen, but it is imaginable where it can become indefinitely more influential in our solar system,
587000	590000	eventually maybe our galaxy, and maybe beyond that.
590000	595000	And so it's that fact that that is possible in principle,
595000	604000	which creates this anchor, this fundamental idea that knowledge, there's no limit to how powerful an influence it can eventually have,
604000	609000	starting with Oxford and central heating and moving out in theory indefinitely beyond.
609000	613000	And that is a remarkable fact that needs explaining.
613000	617000	Yes, you asked about the cosmic significance.
617000	623000	So the answer that I give to explain it in some sense must involve things beyond everyday life.
623000	630000	But everyday life as we see it would have been regarded as completely magical even a few centuries ago,
630000	634000	let alone for the most of the period of the human species.
634000	641000	For example, you know, I can sit in Oxford and look a bit beyond my house and look up in the sky and I see an airplane there.
641000	650000	Now the fact that a metallic object weighing 100 tons is flying there 500 miles an hour and has come from another continent.
650000	663000	That is as much of a jump from natural human beings as what we're discussing this kind of space travel space exploration is from where we are now.
664000	674000	In fact, I think comparing those two, I guess we have already come further in terms of knowledge than what lies between us and space exploration.
674000	681000	I'm not saying exploring the galaxy that would require more knowledge, but that's all it requires.
681000	687000	If you're a scientist and you're asked is so and so possible, you have to use laws of nature.
687000	691000	You can't say, well, my intuition is that that will never happen.
691000	705000	Because our knowledge of the laws of nature is far superior to our intuition, which after all was formed in the past and was formed in a very narrow set of circumstances.
705000	720000	And so this is really a radical counter view to what I would say is even a traditional biologist view, which is that we should be more humble as a species.
720000	727000	Yes, we have our extraordinary skills, but frankly, every species has its extraordinary skills.
727000	730000	We're good at language and we can build these amazing things.
730000	739000	But an elephant has thousands of muscles in its trunk and the exquisite way in which it can manipulate that, that's like nothing else we can do.
739000	743000	Ants and bees have these extraordinary social lives.
743000	753000	Every species is actually, in a very real sense, equally evolved as we are because it's been evolving for exactly as long from the original source of life on Earth.
753000	763000	So there is no special status in biology to humans and we should come off our high horse.
763000	783000	Now, the implication of what you're saying is actually that's not quite right, that knowledge which somehow became part of the human evolutionary story at some point is special and allows this particular species to do things that are not just a different kind of thing from others, but different in principle.
783000	784000	Yes.
785000	795000	First of all, what gives living things their miraculous power, compared with non-living things, compared with most of the things in the universe, is likewise just knowledge.
795000	801000	Knowledge is encoded in what is really a computer program in the DNA molecule.
801000	810000	Ah, so in your articulation of it, knowledge is something much broader than a worldview that is encoded in a human mind.
810000	816000	That's right, knowledge isn't just a matter of belief and it's not just a matter of human psychology.
816000	821000	It is information that has causal power.
821000	824000	Knowledge is information that has a causal power.
824000	827000	That's a beautifully crisp definition.
827000	835000	I've gone through about three or four definitions of knowledge in my thinking about this and that's my present one.
835000	844000	I get this more general concept of knowledge from the philosopher Karl Popper, who spoke of knowledge without a knowing subject.
844000	862000	And the two main types of knowledge that he was interested in was scientific knowledge in human minds, on the one hand, and knowledge in the form of adaptations in genes of living organisms, on the other hand.
862000	877000	Now, that second type of knowledge is not knowledge in a knowing subject, but nevertheless, it's information that is spectacularly honed for its ability to cause physical effects.
877000	891000	So the genes for the eye can cause physical effects of focusing, which can then change the trajectory of the animal, which can then make it kill another animal or escape from another animal and so on.
892000	899000	And the program in DNA has punched above its weight by a vast factor.
899000	904000	Now, humans can transcend that in at least two ways.
904000	914000	One is that the amount of information in our brains is vastly more than the amount in our DNA.
914000	924000	So the DNA has built up knowledge by evolution and so on, but we have added to that both by culture and by individual thinking.
924000	929000	And the brain simply holds more bits of information than DNA does.
929000	941000	And the other thing is, which is more important, that humans have a different kind of knowledge, namely humans have explanatory knowledge, humans have understanding.
941000	949000	And I argue in my second book that explanatory knowledge is the stuff that has infinite reach.
949000	960000	It seems unlikely that biological evolution could ever, let's say, move an animal to the moon and back.
960000	965000	But we know that human type knowledge, explanatory knowledge, can do that.
965000	967000	So that's really powerful.
967000	976000	So what happened at some point along the evolutionary chain, these minds were created that were capable of a different, more powerful kind of knowledge, explanatory knowledge.
976000	983000	So this seems to me to come right then to the heart of why you believe we are not just chemical scum.
983000	990000	And to me, it's a profoundly inspiring view in many ways of how we can think of who we are.
991000	1001000	For whatever reason, we have found ourselves in this moment in history where we have embarked on a journey that has potentially unlimited reach.
1001000	1004000	It could lead us to literally anywhere.
1004000	1011000	There is no dream that, in principle, humans couldn't dream of being part of.
1011000	1023000	And it may be it's not us in the end, it's some successor species, but we are part of a liftoff that has no limit in principle.
1023000	1026000	Well, it has the limits of the laws of physics.
1026000	1027000	Other than the laws of physics.
1027000	1029000	I think it's a very striking view.
1029000	1039000	Humans evolved the ability to do what you've just said at least 100,000 years ago, but for various reasons didn't use it.
1039000	1055000	Now, in much the same way, the whole universe, starting 14 points something billion years ago, for the first billion years or so, all sorts of new things were happening.
1055000	1064000	Supermassive black holes were forming, galaxies were forming, hydrogen was ionized and deionized and then new elements were formed and so on.
1065000	1074000	After about a billion, I think it's about a billion years, I could be wrong, something like that, nothing new happened in the cosmos.
1074000	1087000	Stars were formed, they exploded, planetary systems were formed, the same new elements were spewed into the interplanetary gas again and again and again.
1087000	1102000	And it was just boring for about 13 billion years and then creativity happened and we are at the phase change where things are from now on.
1102000	1108000	And that is if we play our cards right, if it might not happen or someone else might do it.
1108000	1112000	But this phase change changes the whole nature of the cosmos.
1112000	1123000	For example, in the first 14 billion years, the rule was that big things affect small things and small things do not affect big things much.
1124000	1129000	After the phase change, everything is determined by small things.
1129000	1139000	Small things affect large things and what is the determining factor is not mass or power or energy, but information.
1139000	1146000	And specifically the kind of information that has physical effects, namely knowledge.
1146000	1150000	Well, that's the most thrilling history of the universe I've actually ever heard.
1150000	1153000	But you used a word in there that I need you to explain now.
1153000	1158000	You said 13 billion years, 12 billion of those were boring, then creativity happened.
1158000	1161000	So what was creativity and how did it happen?
1161000	1178000	Well, human type creativity is different from the creativity of the biosphere in that human creativity can form models of the world that say not only what will happen but why.
1178000	1186000	So an explanation, for example, is something that captures an aspect of the world that is unseen.
1186000	1191000	So explanations explain the scene in terms of the unseen.
1191000	1195000	Whereas biological knowledge, it's only what works.
1195000	1206000	The eye is like a camera because it gradually moved towards that shape because the animals that had a worse shape didn't survive as well.
1206000	1210000	But a camera is shaped by the laws of optics.
1210000	1227000	Okay, so the reason for the existence of a camera is because some human somewhere had this explanatory theory based on these ideas about the invisible, these ideas about optics, about physics, about how light works.
1227000	1234000	And by using that pattern of ideas that allowed them to build cameras and then a lot more beyond that.
1234000	1235000	That's right.
1235000	1242000	That is what allows human type knowledge to have this universal reach.
1242000	1250000	Whereas biological knowledge, although it has enormous reach, as you said, it can make elephants trunks and giraffes necks and so on.
1250000	1255000	It is actually limited because of the type of knowledge that it is.
1256000	1268000	For example, to evolve from one animal to another over, let's say, a thousand generations, every single generation must be viable as an animal.
1268000	1274000	Because the DNA strands have to be able to just replicate in every single generation.
1274000	1279000	And if one of them fails, if one of them doesn't work, then the species will go extinct.
1279000	1287000	Whereas humans, as the philosopher Karl Popper said, we can let our ideas die in our place.
1287000	1299000	And that means that we can go through a whole bunch of sequence of ideas that aren't viable on the way from one viable idea to the next.
1299000	1301000	We don't have to die when they're wrong.
1302000	1310000	What was the key thing that happened, though, in human history or in human evolution that allowed this type of explanatory knowledge to take off?
1310000	1315000	Almost certainly this dates back to our ancestor species.
1315000	1325000	Species before humans also had the capacity for explanatory knowledge, I believe, and also our cousin species, like Neanderthals.
1326000	1331000	And I have a rather heterodox theory of why we have this ability.
1331000	1336000	Namely, it's needed to pass on cultural knowledge.
1336000	1339000	This is what Richard Dawkins calls memes.
1339000	1348000	We evolve cultural knowledge, which is memes instead of genes, and they can evolve thousands of times faster.
1348000	1358000	So what happened at some point hundreds of thousands of years ago was that hominid minds evolved the ability to mimic each other.
1358000	1367000	You would see a pattern in another mind, and you would copy it, and that created a replication process that was massively faster than traditional reproduction,
1367000	1371000	and it allowed multiple things to be explored, essentially, and some of those started to work.
1371000	1380000	The first thing that happened, even before that, there are some species still today, like chimpanzees and so on, that have memes,
1380000	1387000	and they replicate the meme from one individual to another by literally by blind replication.
1387000	1396000	They have mirror neurons and that kind of infrastructure in their brain, which allows them to mimic what another chimpanzee is doing.
1396000	1407000	Now, our ancestors somehow latched onto the evolutionary advantage of having memes, but they both vastly increased the memory,
1407000	1419000	but then they also evolved creativity, because humans copy other humans by a completely different method to what's used by, say, chimpanzees.
1420000	1425000	Humans don't copy the behavior, they copy the meaning of the behavior.
1425000	1436000	So you can watch someone doing something, let's say opening, you know, you're a safe cracker and you're secretly watching someone opening their safe,
1436000	1441000	and you look at the combination that they enter and then they turn one wheel and another wheel.
1441000	1449000	Now, you might go there and do the same thing, or you might open the safe by a different method.
1449000	1459000	You know, you might be lowered in, like in some of those films, you might be lowered in from the skylight and have to turn the knobs with your feet.
1459000	1466000	Now, a chimpanzee could not do that, because that's not copying the behavior, that's just copying the meaning of the behavior.
1466000	1470000	But to humans, it's second nature to copy the meaning.
1470000	1480000	In fact, if you go to a lecture and you understand what's in the lecture, you might go and tell someone else,
1480000	1488000	but almost certainly not in the same words that the lecturer used, you would explain it in your own words if you understood it.
1488000	1493000	And if you didn't understand it, then you might explain it in the same words that the lecturer used.
1493000	1497000	You might say, well, the lecturer said so and so, but I don't know what the hell he was talking about.
1497000	1498000	Can you tell me?
1498000	1499000	Got it.
1499000	1502000	So let me put this together and see if I've got this right.
1502000	1506000	So some of our ancestor species developed this ability to copy memes.
1506000	1514000	Memes, by the way, like the term is now used often just to mean sort of internet images or animations that take off in a spread virally,
1514000	1518000	which is a very narrow interpretation of Richard Dawkins' original intention,
1518000	1526000	which is a meme is anything that can be copied from brain to brain, whether it's an idea or a phrase, a poem, a piece of music,
1526000	1528000	anything that can be copied is a meme.
1528000	1533000	And so this took off as a sort of biological ability in our ancestors.
1533000	1538000	And then at some point it shifted to a whole gear where it wasn't direct copy of behavior,
1538000	1544000	the meaning of what was underlay some of these activities started to get copied.
1544000	1553000	And that's the moment when I guess you would say that understanding comes into the equation that someone is understanding someone else's intent or action
1553000	1556000	and doing something based on that understanding.
1556000	1560000	And understanding is I think everything almost in your view of the world.
1560000	1563000	Say a bit more about what it is to understand something.
1563000	1568000	I use the term understanding and explanation almost interchangeably.
1568000	1574000	And explanation is something that explains what you see in terms of what you don't see.
1574000	1581000	It explains what might happen in terms of general ideas about what can happen.
1581000	1587000	So understanding transcends the initial application of what it's for.
1587000	1597000	Let's say you initially learn how to throw a ball from one person to another for fun or you throw it as a weapon or something like that.
1597000	1602000	Then later someone can ask what path does the ball take.
1602000	1612000	And then that may allow them to construct a better weapon or a better defense or a million other things in future generations,
1612000	1618000	which all depend on the meaning and may have nothing to do with the original application.
1618000	1634000	But I should add that this initial burst of understanding or creativity into the world was blighted by the fact that memes tend to evolve like genes.
1634000	1637000	Memes tend to evolve to breed true.
1637000	1646000	That is memes which can get themselves faithfully copied are preferred to ones which can't.
1646000	1648000	Regardless of whether they're true or not.
1648000	1651000	Regardless, right. That's their tendency.
1651000	1654000	That's what they tend to do.
1654000	1661000	And so initially creativity was used only for copying ideas faithfully,
1661000	1671000	which is almost the opposite use of what we consider creativity to be used for today, which is to improve upon ideas.
1671000	1683000	This is why our ancestors spent 100,000 years basically doing nothing before very, very slowly they changed their lifestyle.
1683000	1688000	First, better tools and so on and then agriculture and civilization and so on.
1688000	1700000	But still improvements were extremely rare so that most people, most humans did not experience any improvement in their lifetime.
1700000	1712000	And so what's an example of a meme that could be reproduced but is basically not true, does not conform with, you know, it doesn't give any value to helping someone understand the world better.
1712000	1720000	Oh, well, I mean, the Richard Dawkins favorite example of this and maybe the reason why he introduced the concept is religions.
1720000	1729000	I mean, you don't have to be an atheist to understand that most religions are memes and that they are false.
1729000	1736000	So it could be that there's, you know, let me concede that there could be one religion that's true, but that would mean that the others are false.
1736000	1746000	But also much more prosaically and I guess importantly, we don't expect any of our knowledge to be completely true.
1746000	1755000	Newton's laws were thought to be the last word in mechanics and gravity and dynamics and so on for hundreds of years.
1755000	1762000	And then they were overturned in quick succession by Einstein's relativity and by quantum theory.
1762000	1764000	And now we know that they are false.
1764000	1766000	Now they are still knowledge.
1766000	1768000	Knowledge doesn't have to be true.
1768000	1771000	It just has to contain some truth enough to be useful.
1771000	1783000	And so the key, one of the key contributors then to this takeoff was the development of processes that could distinguish between memes that were just reproducing
1783000	1786000	and memes that actually were closer to the truth.
1786000	1792000	In other words, there was this error correcting mechanism started to take off.
1792000	1793000	Yes.
1793000	1800000	So there we have, we have to jump forward like a hundred thousand years or some hundreds of thousands of years to the scientific revolution.
1800000	1806000	It's rather arbitrary where you date it to some, some people might say the Renaissance was the beginning of it.
1806000	1818000	And, and I think that this Renaissance or revolution or enlightenment, as I call it, tried to happen several times in human history, right back to antiquity.
1818000	1830000	And in each case, the static type memes, which prevent innovation, won the battle.
1830000	1836000	And sometimes it lasted one generation, sometimes it lasted two generations, like in ancient Athens or something.
1836000	1849000	And then with the scientific revolution, it took hold and it has now been around for, depending on how you count it, it's been around for 300 years, 400 years, something like that.
1849000	1853000	And has been exponentially improving ever since.
1853000	1855000	So this is really interesting to me.
1855000	1865000	I think it's easy to see just how big a deal this is that in a way you had a species that for hundreds of thousands of years had developed this extraordinary ability to have a mental life.
1865000	1877000	But it was effectively running around in random directions, not making real progress because there was no way of saying, this is actually the way forward.
1877000	1889000	And what you're describing is what science did was it said it found a way of gradually cutting out the negative signals where someone was running into a brick wall or running backwards and saying, no, no, cut that out, move.
1889000	1899000	And so that creates this process whereby we gradually start to get closer to an understanding of, quote, reality, unquote.
1899000	1900000	I mean,
1900000	1901000	Even without the quotes.
1901000	1902000	Even without the quotes.
1902000	1904000	It really is an understanding of reality.
1904000	1906000	There really is a reality out there.
1906000	1913000	And it matters that we slowly start to model it in some ways in our minds.
1913000	1914000	Yes.
1914000	1919000	Now, error correction is an extremely simple concept, although very profound.
1919000	1926000	I mean, absolutely everything depends on it since everything depends on knowledge and knowledge doesn't come to us on a silver platter.
1926000	1928000	So everything depends on error correction.
1928000	1934000	But although that's a simple fact, arranging for that to happen is not at all simple.
1934000	1936000	It's incredibly sophisticated.
1936000	1938000	We do not understand it.
1938000	1946000	So we don't understand it either on the level of how creativity works in a single human mind.
1946000	1957000	And we also don't understand what it takes in a culture for the culture to support error correction because it's almost paradoxical.
1958000	1968000	What we want is a system for correcting traditional knowledge, but tradition by definition is something that stays the same over generations.
1968000	1973000	And so Karl Popper coined the phrase, a tradition of criticism.
1973000	1978000	This is an extremely unusual form of tradition.
1978000	1981000	It's happened very rarely in human history.
1981000	1987000	And the one we call the scientific revolution is the is the ancestor of everything good we have today.
1987000	1995000	But we don't know what it takes for a culture to have a tradition of criticism in it.
1995000	2003000	Now, we are very lucky and we take for granted that we have things like the scientific community, the scientific tradition.
2003000	2017000	We take for granted that if a professor is asked a question in a seminar and says, you're not allowed to ask that, just trust me, I'm the professor, he will be laughed at.
2017000	2030000	Although there are many areas of life where he wouldn't be laughed at, but science is one where it's taken for granted that criticism is part of the culture.
2030000	2033000	It's part of the tradition that's passed on.
2033000	2039000	And so in many ways, it's a miracle that this ever happened and there's a sort of fragility to it.
2039000	2050000	I mean, I think it's your view that this type of knowledge lift off almost happened or started to happen at other times in human history, perhaps during the Greek civilization.
2050000	2053000	And then we lost it.
2053000	2058000	How fragile is what we have right now?
2058000	2065000	We can't know because our enlightenment is the first one that's lasted for more than two or three generations.
2065000	2067000	I don't think it got to where it is by accident.
2067000	2069000	I think there is some stability to it.
2069000	2074000	It didn't get to where it is today by not being stable.
2074000	2077000	On the other hand, there definitely is no guarantee.
2077000	2080000	We could choose to end it.
2080000	2084000	We could do the wrong thing repeatedly and end it.
2084000	2099000	Just one thing, though, I would like to say that when people compare our civilization to other civilizations that have lasted for centuries or whatever and then collapsed and they compare ours with theirs,
2099000	2105000	like, you know, it was caused by losing self confidence and then the barbarians at the gates and that kind of thing.
2106000	2117000	I think that's wrong because none of the other long lived civilizations in history has had a tradition of Christism.
2117000	2120000	So it's obvious that they were fragile.
2120000	2127000	They were fragile precisely because they couldn't create the knowledge to cope with unforeseen challenges.
2127000	2137000	But when you look at the world today, David, there's people like you and many others in the scientific and other communities who are really driven by respect for science, respect for knowledge.
2137000	2141000	There are many others and including people in power who are not.
2141000	2154000	And it can seem that we may forget the importance of our knowledge and ignore it and let go or blow up or destroy much of the preciousness of what we've built.
2154000	2159000	Is that a lens that you have? What would you, what are you most concerned about as you look out at the world right now?
2159000	2167000	Well, I think it has always been true since the Renaissance, since the scientific revolution, wherever you count the beginning of our enlightenment to be.
2167000	2171000	It's always been true that most people haven't appreciated it.
2171000	2174000	Most people have values that kind of contradict it.
2174000	2176000	Most people resent it a bit.
2176000	2180000	So it has survived by being stable in its own terms.
2181000	2198000	And when you start referring to the political side of it, there, the equivalent of the scientific revolution is liberal democracy or whatever you want to call the values that underlie the western political system.
2198000	2205000	And this does seem, especially the Anglosphere part of it, does seem to be incredibly stable.
2205000	2215000	If you look at the early to mid 20th century, the age of the great dictators, totalitarian ideologies were sweeping the world.
2215000	2219000	All the intellectuals in the world were either fascists or communists.
2219000	2222000	Well, I'm exaggerating, but many of them were.
2222000	2229000	And in many countries, fascists and communists took over the government and caused all sorts of damage.
2229000	2236000	And if they had one, they could easily have ended civilization.
2236000	2246000	But it's, I think it's extremely significant that not one of the Anglosphere countries fell to a dictatorship.
2246000	2255000	And when you say that democracy is the kind of the political equivalent of the scientific revolution, liberal democracy is.
2256000	2261000	I guess the key point you're making there is that you can think of a democracy, a liberal democracy as an error correcting system.
2261000	2265000	That is actually the most fundamental way to think of it.
2265000	2270000	It's not that it automatically, it doesn't automatically create good.
2270000	2275000	What it does is it weeds it eventually, eventually weeds out the bad.
2275000	2284000	And so if you imagine human political endeavor, human endeavor generally as this sort of a thousand flowers flourishing and trying to grow in different directions.
2284000	2291000	When some of them start to grow in the wrong direction, a democratic system will reign that and say, sorry, you've had your turn.
2291000	2294000	You're out. Let's put someone else in and try and grow differently.
2294000	2296000	Yes, peacefully.
2296000	2303000	That's the thing, because if it's not done peacefully, then knowledge is destroyed in the war or in the civil war or whatever.
2303000	2307000	Or in the coup that overturns the previous regime.
2307000	2316000	The political tradition is judged by whether it can remove bad policies and bad leaders peacefully.
2316000	2328000	So when people worry today about a rise in demagoguery, for example, you're reasonably confident that the system's error correction mechanism is all kicking to gear?
2328000	2337000	Yes, I mean, I can't say how little I'm concerned about that danger.
2337000	2347000	If civilization is going to be destroyed, it's not going to be destroyed by some government taking power and then not relinquishing it.
2347000	2349000	That's not going to happen.
2349000	2354000	Well, that's definitely encouraging and I think a lot of people will be sitting there crossing fingers hoping you're right on that one.
2354000	2363000	I mean, I think you think of the realm of the total amount of knowledge and understanding out there as essentially infinite, right?
2363000	2374000	It's not like we'll discover the grand equation and suddenly we'll know all of science, that we should rather think of knowledge almost as this growing sphere against the unknown.
2374000	2377000	And the more we know, the more we know we don't know.
2377000	2379000	Is that the right way to think of it?
2379000	2380000	Yes, yes.
2380000	2390000	So as again, Karl Popper put it, solving problems creates new problems and therefore in our infinite ignorance, we are all alike.
2390000	2413000	And maybe the reason why knowledge of the human type has this infinite scope and could take us across the galaxy or whatever and also down to nanotechnology and all that is because of the special relationship that human minds have with the laws of physics.
2413000	2421000	It's this explanatory knowledge that human minds are capable of that can see beyond the visible.
2421000	2429000	So we can look up in the sky and see a cold, tiny dot of what looks like cold white light.
2429000	2443000	And we know that that is actually a star, which means it's actually a million miles across and it's at 25 million degrees in its interior and 6000 degrees on its surface.
2443000	2453000	And if we went there, we'd be fried to a crisp so we can never experience it, at least not without special technology.
2453000	2455000	And yet we can know about it.
2455000	2461000	We can sit here and know about it in enormous detail and in ever increasing detail.
2461000	2472000	The reason that this is possible, as I said, is because human minds and explanatory knowledge has a special relationship with the laws of nature.
2472000	2476000	So this seems implausible to a lot of people.
2476000	2484000	A lot of people would say, look, every species knows something, a dog knows that a bone tastes delicious, but it doesn't know scientific theory.
2484000	2497000	We know a certain amount of scientific theory, but it's ridiculous to imagine that there must be a whole world of things out there that we are never even in principle capable of understanding.
2498000	2500000	And you dispute that.
2500000	2501000	Why?
2501000	2502000	Yes.
2502000	2503000	Why?
2503000	2505000	There are two sides to that comparison.
2505000	2514000	First, you compare the dog with a human and then you compare with a human to the putative, unknowable things that there might be out there.
2514000	2516000	So there are two steps there.
2516000	2519000	I've already explained why the dog is inherently different from us.
2519000	2529000	It's because the dog knows that the bone tastes good because it's some of its ancestors who didn't know that died and the dog doesn't actually know anything.
2529000	2531000	It's genes know that.
2531000	2545000	And there are certain types of things that can become known that way, but the vast majority of things in the world, in the universe, cannot become known that way because the dog cannot try to eat the sun and be burned and that kind of thing.
2545000	2549000	No one could gain the knowledge of the sun by that same method.
2549000	2556000	Now, the other thing, what if there was knowledge out there, what the things out there that we couldn't possibly understand?
2556000	2564000	Well, as a logical possibility, of course, it's always possible that there are incomprehensible things in the universe.
2564000	2576000	But I have argued that taking that seriously is exactly the same as a belief in the supernatural because you could never have an explanation of the form.
2576000	2588000	This thing that can have an effect on us can never be understood because if it can have an effect, we can theorize about what causes the effect and we can do an experiment to test the theory.
2588000	2600000	And it's your belief that the type of experiential knowledge that we have can wrap around any imaginable explanation that could be out there.
2600000	2611000	It's not like there is sort of human knowledge and then there might be some knowledge that gods or fairies or whatever have that is fundamentally different and more profound or other aliens could have.
2612000	2620000	So this makes me wonder whether in your worldview, there are similar liftoffs happening on other planets out there?
2620000	2634000	We don't know. As you know, there's this problem of if there is intelligent life on other planets in the galaxy, there are many arguments that say we should have seen them by now.
2634000	2642000	This is called the Fermi paradox, although I would rather call it the Fermi problem because I don't see anything paradoxical about it.
2642000	2661000	Suppose there are just two explanatory species in the galaxy, then having reached the explanatory takeoff like the scientific revolution, in the twinkling of an eye on the cosmic scale, we will have settled the whole galaxy.
2661000	2666000	And the galaxy exists on time scales of billions of years.
2666000	2678000	So compared with the age of the galaxy, the moment from when humans first evolved to when humans have settled the whole galaxy is just a blink of an eye.
2678000	2688000	And therefore, the chances that two civilizations emerge at the same time is infinitesimal.
2688000	2692000	So that means that if they exist, they must be millions of years ahead of us.
2692000	2696000	And if they're millions of years ahead of us, why aren't they here already?
2696000	2699000	Because the argument said that they would be here already.
2699000	2702000	Now, why would they not be here?
2702000	2709000	Well, there are lots of reasons that, first of all, one solution to the Fermi problem might be that we are the first.
2709000	2714000	People kind of reject that because it's kind of boring.
2714000	2717000	And why should we be so special?
2717000	2724000	Well, someone had to be and we kind of reject that as a possibility because there's no structure in that idea.
2724000	2730000	There's nothing further to say, but it could be true like a load of other things.
2730000	2738000	So the next possibility is, yes, the galaxy is full of a civilization and they're going to be here soon.
2738000	2744000	But I mean, you believe that human creativity is the fundamental part of the whole knowledge lift off.
2744000	2749000	And the aesthetic expression of that is certainly a big part of who we are.
2749000	2753000	To me, one of the puzzles is not that we don't see spaceships coming.
2753000	2758000	It's that we don't see any evidence of the galaxy having been engineered.
2758000	2767000	If dolphins were to make a breakthrough and start developing periscopes that could look up and examine the world around them
2767000	2770000	and they poked them up and looked at the surface of the earth,
2770000	2780000	they would see buildings and astonishing structures that seem to cry out for an explanation that looked like they were the objects of intentional construction.
2780000	2783000	We look out at the galaxy and see nothing.
2783000	2790000	You think at the very least you'd see some sort of, you know, some stars had been converted into spectacular artistic displays
2790000	2793000	or there'd be some evidence of engineering.
2793000	2799000	The fact that there's no evidence of engineering suggests that the main game in town out there is still
2799000	2805000	the same old physical processes that filled the prior 13 billion boring years.
2805000	2808000	So first of all, we haven't looked very carefully yet.
2808000	2815000	I mean, this kind of thing looking out for evidence of technology in other star systems is only just beginning now.
2815000	2819000	And we can only detect very powerful things.
2819000	2823000	And I don't think we should take for granted that these type...
2823000	2832000	Although I think we should take for granted that if an intelligent species exists, it will colonize the galaxy very quickly.
2832000	2839000	I don't think we should take for granted that it will enter this phase of type one, type two, type three civilizations.
2839000	2845000	For the simple reason that once you're type three civilization, what are you going to do next?
2845000	2848000	And certainly they will be capable of doing that.
2848000	2853000	But again, like us, they will have to decide what to do.
2853000	2860000	There would have to be a reason why they go for, for example, enormously increased power consumption.
2860000	2861000	They might not want that.
2861000	2867000	I think the chances are they won't want it because they will be information based.
2867000	2874000	They will be entirely in virtual reality, except when they want to go out into the physical world for some purpose.
2874000	2880000	And they may not want to go very far from each other because of the communication difficulty.
2880000	2883000	Unless, again, unless there's a strong reason for it.
2883000	2887000	So that strikes me as a really compelling solution to the problem, if you like.
2887000	2893000	Because based on your view, what matters when you have a knowledge lift off is knowledge.
2893000	2903000	And knowledge can be encapsulated in many forms, often which can be vastly smaller even than the biological forms in which we are now.
2903000	2914000	And to me, it's possible to imagine an alien species developing ever more rich forms of creativity in ever smaller spaces.
2914000	2923000	That the whole notion of physical conquest would become just an absurdly old fashioned notion of what made life interesting.
2923000	2932000	It's like, why bother to do that when you have infinite control over a much smaller structure of information space that you can pattern in any way you want?
2932000	2940000	And so there's that sort of almost that conversion of the material into the virtual that allows infinite possibility right there.
2940000	2945000	Yes, as Feynman said, there's plenty of room at the bottom.
2945000	2955000	There are more orders of magnitude to explore on the microscopic world than there are in the macroscopic world, say, across the galaxy.
2955000	2969000	And once you have a civilization that is capable of interstellar travel and extending down to the microscopic, it's not obvious what they will think best from their point of view.
2969000	2977000	The great disadvantage of living in the galaxy is not the size of it, it's the time.
2977000	2986000	It's the fact that you can't have a coherent culture where the parts of it are a hundred light years from each other.
2986000	2993000	Right, so right there, that's a good reason to theorize why growing intelligence would want to actually go smaller, not bigger.
2993000	3001000	So it's possible that you're still so taken with your history of the universe of 12 billion years of boring.
3001000	3006000	Presumably, it's compatible with what you just said, that it might turn out not to be 12 billion years of boring.
3006000	3017000	There might be all these spectacular takeoffs of intelligence understanding knowledge in different pockets of the galaxy or of the universe, but just that we don't yet see that.
3017000	3020000	We're not yet exposed to any of that of that history.
3020000	3022000	Yes, there might be.
3022000	3031000	I myself hope that part of the morality of any advanced civilization would be that they would come and rescue us as soon as they found out we exist.
3031000	3044000	But here's another narrative that is compatible with what we see, which is that as a species takes off and starts developing knowledge that inevitably things go wrong at some point.
3044000	3048000	That we inevitably create the technologies capable of destroying us.
3048000	3062000	And it's either in the nature of the dynamics of power or in that just in the nature of the dynamics of complexity, that something horrifying eventually goes wrong and these attempts at liftoff get wiped out.
3063000	3067000	So I'm sure that's not inevitable.
3067000	3074000	And that's for exactly the same reason why unlimited progress is not inevitable.
3074000	3089000	If it were inevitable, that that means if it were true that everywhere in the universe where there's explanatory knowledge starts taking off, it will destroy itself within, you know, say a thousand years.
3089000	3092000	That would be a law of physics.
3092000	3102000	So if you're going to postulate that there's this law just in order to make your nightmares come true, you may as well just as stuck with believing in goblins and demons.
3102000	3111000	Although there is a sort of plausible way of thinking about it just on earth level, which is that as technologies get more powerful, the stakes get ever higher.
3111000	3125000	We have already invented technologies that in principle you could imagine it's not that long before a single deranged student in a lab might be able to engineer a virus that could really quickly spread and take out the human race.
3125000	3138000	But after staying invisible to people while it cultures and spreads for 30 days and then suddenly boom, it's possible to imagine that knowledge brings with it the potential for unlimited destructive power.
3138000	3146000	And that as the sort of Humpty Dumpty theory of, you know, it's easier to break things than to make things.
3146000	3155000	Yes. Of course, that's a possibility, because if it wasn't a possibility, then continued progress would be inevitable, which it isn't.
3155000	3166000	But the knowledge of how to defend civilization against existential threats is also a form of knowledge, which is unlimited.
3166000	3175000	So if we fail to create that knowledge, we're doomed. If we do create that knowledge, we're not doomed. That story is the same as with all knowledge.
3175000	3182000	So the possibility is there for us to create it for, as I put it, for the good guys to stay ahead of the bad guys.
3182000	3192000	But also there is something about the bad actors that makes them progress more slowly.
3192000	3200000	That is, they are enemies of civilization. Therefore, they are wrong, right?
3200000	3208000	And therefore, they have to be in a state of mind that can tolerate being wrong, and therefore they can't tolerate a tradition of criticism.
3208000	3217000	In fact, with the realistic ones that you perhaps have in mind, destroying the tradition of criticism is their main objective.
3217000	3228000	That's what their grievance is. So that makes them slower. That makes them inherently trail the good guys.
3228000	3239000	But that's just a tendency. It need not be so that there could be a breakthrough by some of the bad guys, and that's why I say we have a moral obligation to stay ahead of them.
3239000	3246000	I mean, that's a beautifully optimistic argument in a way that there's such a thing as a clever devil, but not as a super clever devil.
3246000	3251000	Because by being a devil, you're taking away the ability to be truly clever in the long term.
3251000	3256000	Absolutely right. I can't see any way out of that argument. It's got to be that.
3256000	3262000	Well, I love that argument. I truly hope that that one works out.
3262000	3277000	I just want to ask you this last question, David, which is if you could implant in the minds of the good majority of people on this planet a single idea, what would that idea be?
3277000	3284000	I think it's got to be the idea of optimism that all evils are due to lack of knowledge.
3285000	3291000	So you just gave a definition of optimism there that is not what most people think of as optimism.
3291000	3297000	Most people think of optimism as a feeling of hope about the future. Your definition is different. So explain that.
3297000	3305000	Well, hope that isn't based on an explanatory theory is rather, I mean, isn't that what they call a vain hope?
3305000	3311000	It's whistling in the dark. Optimism, as I define it, has to do with knowledge.
3311000	3315000	It's not a prediction of the future. It's an explanation of failure.
3315000	3335000	If you explain failure as being inevitable or due to some malevolent force, insuperable malevolent force, or just the way things are, then that's a recipe for stasis, which is a recipe for failure and eventually death.
3335000	3349000	Therefore, I think that all failure has to be explained in the form. The reason we didn't succeed is that we didn't know how to and the knowledge of how to is in principle attainable.
3349000	3354000	We don't have it now, but we could have it in the future if we do the right thing.
3355000	3364000	In fact, it follows from this whole conception of knowledge that we've been talking about all this time that optimism has to be true.
3364000	3369000	Otherwise, there would be a limitation, which would mean supernatural and all that stuff.
3369000	3377000	The arguments are watertight all the way from the scientific worldview to optimism in my view.
3377000	3386000	Here's how I would distill this David Deutsch worldview, which I have to say, David, I find quite an inspiring worldview.
3386000	3397000	Here we are, this homo sapiens. We've had this surprising moment of liftoff where we're able to create new knowledge, new understanding, but it's a fragile thing.
3397000	3400000	It's full of errors, full of mistakes.
3400000	3416000	If we could inspire everyone out there to adopt the mindset that knowledge was precious and that when things go wrong on our planet, it's not because there's some evil force there that needs punching in the gut and spitting out.
3416000	3426000	It's just because we're not understanding something and our job and our duty is to seek to understand, to look for those areas, to correct them.
3426000	3444000	If we were to adopt that mindset, then there's literally no limit to the journey that we can go on together, a journey of growing knowledge and unlimited creativity and lives of wonder and so forth.
3444000	3450000	I mean, that's what I take from you, that knowledge is not a thing for schools, libraries or whatever.
3450000	3456000	It's this superpower that humans have developed if they're willing to look at it the right way.
3456000	3462000	Well put, I agree. We must also expect to make lots of mistakes.
3462000	3468000	So it's not just knowing that the problem is to create the knowledge.
3468000	3475000	There's not an automatic way of creating it. In fact, it's conjectural. We're going to make many mistakes.
3475000	3478000	That's why we have to set up institutions that can correct them.
3478000	3485000	And so mistakes should be viewed as gifts in a way, as long as you learn from them and adjust as a result of them, they're a gift.
3485000	3493000	Yes, yes. John Wheeler said that our whole problem is to make the mistakes as fast as possible.
3493000	3498000	You look out at the world and we're certainly getting that part right.
3498000	3504000	David Deutsch has been such a delight to speak with you and I really thank you for those many, many hours.
3504000	3509000	I picture you in that home just sitting there dreaming, thinking, puzzling.
3509000	3514000	The what you have put together from that I think is really remarkable and I hope we can do the same.
3514000	3516000	David, thank you so much. I absolutely love this time.
3516000	3517000	Nice talking.
3517000	3518000	Bye bye for now.
3518000	3519000	Bye then.
3524000	3530000	This week's show was produced by Sharon Mashihi.
3530000	3534000	Our associate producer is Kim Naderfeyne-Peterser.
3534000	3536000	Special thanks to Helen Walters.
3536000	3541000	Our show is mixed by David Herman and our theme music is by Allison Layton Brown.
3541000	3549000	In our next episode, I sit down with Sam Harris to discuss whether science can answer moral questions.
3549000	3553000	The most important questions in human life are questions we have to be able to talk about
3553000	3558000	and we have a very large proportion of humanity that is saying,
3558000	3564000	okay, these most important questions, how to live, how to cause your children to live
3564000	3570000	and what to die for, these are questions that we're not willing to talk about rationally.
3572000	3578000	Now, if you enjoyed today's episode, please rate and review on Apple Podcasts or wherever you're listening
