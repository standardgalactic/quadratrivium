00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the TED interview. I'm Chris Anderson.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the podcast series where I sit down with a TED speaker,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we get to dive much deeper into their ideas and was possible during their TED talk.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today's guest is something of a personal hero.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
David Deutch. He's a physicist and author.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He has a reputation of being something of a reclusive genius.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He lives by himself in a home in Oxford, working late into the night,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
trying to unpack really the deepest mysteries of the cosmos.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
His thinking has really had a dramatic impact on how I see the world.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here's the thing. Most scientists would tell you that human beings are just that significant.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We are just this little speck of dust and a random planet in an obscure part of the universe.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
David Deutch says that's wrong. He actually says people matter,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and the reason they matter is that they are incubating something â€“ knowledge.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In David's view, knowledge is a force of almost unlimited power in the universe,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and also a force that will determine our future.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We can survive, and we can fail to survive.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically,

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and our civilization

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
from all the others, namely our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge, to be a hub of existence.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
David's thinking about knowledge has had a huge impact on me personally.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In a book called The Fabric of Reality, David argued that the way in which we think of knowledge

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
as broken up into all these different fields is misguided.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Actually, all of knowledge is connected, and if we spent a bit more time understanding those connections,

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
understanding the context of what we know, that is where real understanding comes from,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
where the real breakthroughs come from.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Believe it or not, I honestly think it was reading that book that finally gave me the courage 18 years ago

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to leave my company and take over leadership of TED,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
which back then was an annual conference in California

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
devoted to bringing together technology, entertainment, and design.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You see, if Deutsch was right, the sharing of accessible knowledge between different disciplines

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
wasn't just a short-term fad and wasn't just limited to those three subjects.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was something the world would always need.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So he inspired me to take the leap, and here we are.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And honestly, David, it's an honor to be speaking with you today. Welcome.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, it's very nice to be here, and thanks for the dramatic introduction.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm very glad to hear it.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, David, in the first TED talk you gave, you had this phrase that you quoted really from Stephen Hawking.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Stephen Hawking referred to humans as basically chemical scum on the surface of an obscure planet.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And that's actually quite a common view of how science is thought of as treating humans.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We started thinking we were the center of everything, and then we gradually discovered that no,

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we're just a planet revolving around a star, and then that star is just one of a hundred billion in a galaxy,

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and that galaxy is one of hundreds of billions of other galaxies.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And goodness knows, we become very quickly, completely insignificant.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You, I think, disagree with that characterization. Explain why.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I do, and you're right that that's the prevailing view, because that's the view that's kind of forced on us

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
by a narrow conception of what science is.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
According to that view, you classify things in the universe in a sort of hierarchy of more massive and powerful verses,

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
less massive and so on.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And so we're used to the fact that the big objects like the supermassive black holes in the center of a galaxy

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
affect a star, can rip a star to pieces, but the star being ripped to pieces hardly affects the supermassive black hole.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it's the same with the sun and the solar system, you know, the sun affects the earth,

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
but the earth barely affects the sun and so on.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But the funny thing is, on earth, on the surface of the earth, everything's the other way around.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Everywhere you look, you see the effects of life on earth and life.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Every living thing that you see is the result of the action of a single molecule or two molecules or something,

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
depending on what kind of organism it is.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So this submicroscopic entity commands vast resources.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, humans take this to a wholly different level where we are capable of becoming cosmically significant,

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
not just dominating the surface of a planet, but dominating the galaxy and further out.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, how so? You mean by kind of star trek like exploration or something else?

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, star trek or rather colonization.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's what we do.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Humans evolved, unlike all other existing organisms, to find new environments which are initially lethal to them

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and to change the environment such that they can live comfortably there.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Here I am sitting in Oxford and if it weren't for technology, I would die within hours

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because without clothes, without shelter, without medical attention, without sources of food from far away,

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I would be very hard put to it to forage.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the territory here supported only a tiny number of people in the early days of our species,

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
whereas now it supports tens of millions.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And so the difference between your survival and otherwise is human knowledge turned into technology

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
which has built the house, the central heating, the clothes and so forth that keep you alive.

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, fundamentally it's knowledge.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean, when you talk about that humans can have indefinite impact on the universe through star trek like expansion out,

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
like at first glance a lot of people listening to that will say,

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
well, already that's sounding a little silly, that's science fiction in any way and how can that possibly mean much.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But your whole second book, this idea of the beginning of infinity is arguing that knowledge in principle has infinite reach

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and therefore if you don't include that in your worldview, you are missing out on something fundamentally important.

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So talk a bit more about how we could think of that reach of knowledge.

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Perhaps it's more illuminating to think of this the other way around.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So suppose there were some extraterrestrial beings, intelligent beings,

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
looking around at the stars from let's say a hundred light years away or something in the galaxy

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and they would see various stars and they might use astrophysics to predict what these stars will do.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But on Earth they would detect something.

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
For example, the fact that there's oxygen in the atmosphere which tells them that there's life here.

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then they would detect if they kept watching the Earth for a while.

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I mean, I'm kind of imagining them with technology similar to ours.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They could detect more if they had better technology.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But if they watched the Earth for a couple of decades,

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
they would see that the mean temperature of the planet is changing faster than it possibly could.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Only artificial intervention can change the temperature of the Earth as fast as it has been changing.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is inexplicable without the presence of intelligent beings.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And if they then ask themselves, well, this influence, the influence that affected the atmosphere of that planet,

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
could it possibly affect us?

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And the answer is yes, because the issue of whether a spaceship can get there is a matter of what we decide to do.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And it's also a matter of the laws of physics.

98
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So David, I think it's important almost in having this conversation to bear in mind that the way you think,

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
by thinking in sort of theoretical terms about what knowledge might in principle one day do,

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that has implications for how we should think of human beings and our role in the world.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And so when we talk about aliens and we talk about the potential for exploration,

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you're not saying that, hey, this is going to happen anytime soon.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What you're saying is it is in principle possible for this species that has evolved on Earth to have a future that is imaginable.

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It may not happen, but it is imaginable where it can become indefinitely more influential in our solar system,

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
eventually maybe our galaxy, and maybe beyond that.

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And so it's that fact that that is possible in principle,

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which creates this anchor, this fundamental idea that knowledge, there's no limit to how powerful an influence it can eventually have,

108
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
starting with Oxford and central heating and moving out in theory indefinitely beyond.

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And that is a remarkable fact that needs explaining.

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes, you asked about the cosmic significance.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So the answer that I give to explain it in some sense must involve things beyond everyday life.

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But everyday life as we see it would have been regarded as completely magical even a few centuries ago,

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
let alone for the most of the period of the human species.

114
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
For example, you know, I can sit in Oxford and look a bit beyond my house and look up in the sky and I see an airplane there.

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now the fact that a metallic object weighing 100 tons is flying there 500 miles an hour and has come from another continent.

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That is as much of a jump from natural human beings as what we're discussing this kind of space travel space exploration is from where we are now.

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In fact, I think comparing those two, I guess we have already come further in terms of knowledge than what lies between us and space exploration.

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not saying exploring the galaxy that would require more knowledge, but that's all it requires.

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you're a scientist and you're asked is so and so possible, you have to use laws of nature.

120
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't say, well, my intuition is that that will never happen.

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because our knowledge of the laws of nature is far superior to our intuition, which after all was formed in the past and was formed in a very narrow set of circumstances.

122
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And so this is really a radical counter view to what I would say is even a traditional biologist view, which is that we should be more humble as a species.

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, we have our extraordinary skills, but frankly, every species has its extraordinary skills.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're good at language and we can build these amazing things.

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But an elephant has thousands of muscles in its trunk and the exquisite way in which it can manipulate that, that's like nothing else we can do.

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Ants and bees have these extraordinary social lives.

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Every species is actually, in a very real sense, equally evolved as we are because it's been evolving for exactly as long from the original source of life on Earth.

128
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So there is no special status in biology to humans and we should come off our high horse.

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now, the implication of what you're saying is actually that's not quite right, that knowledge which somehow became part of the human evolutionary story at some point is special and allows this particular species to do things that are not just a different kind of thing from others, but different in principle.

130
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

131
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
First of all, what gives living things their miraculous power, compared with non-living things, compared with most of the things in the universe, is likewise just knowledge.

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Knowledge is encoded in what is really a computer program in the DNA molecule.

133
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ah, so in your articulation of it, knowledge is something much broader than a worldview that is encoded in a human mind.

134
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's right, knowledge isn't just a matter of belief and it's not just a matter of human psychology.

135
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It is information that has causal power.

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Knowledge is information that has a causal power.

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's a beautifully crisp definition.

138
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I've gone through about three or four definitions of knowledge in my thinking about this and that's my present one.

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I get this more general concept of knowledge from the philosopher Karl Popper, who spoke of knowledge without a knowing subject.

140
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And the two main types of knowledge that he was interested in was scientific knowledge in human minds, on the one hand, and knowledge in the form of adaptations in genes of living organisms, on the other hand.

141
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now, that second type of knowledge is not knowledge in a knowing subject, but nevertheless, it's information that is spectacularly honed for its ability to cause physical effects.

142
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So the genes for the eye can cause physical effects of focusing, which can then change the trajectory of the animal, which can then make it kill another animal or escape from another animal and so on.

143
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And the program in DNA has punched above its weight by a vast factor.

144
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Now, humans can transcend that in at least two ways.

145
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
One is that the amount of information in our brains is vastly more than the amount in our DNA.

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So the DNA has built up knowledge by evolution and so on, but we have added to that both by culture and by individual thinking.

147
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And the brain simply holds more bits of information than DNA does.

148
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And the other thing is, which is more important, that humans have a different kind of knowledge, namely humans have explanatory knowledge, humans have understanding.

149
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I argue in my second book that explanatory knowledge is the stuff that has infinite reach.

150
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It seems unlikely that biological evolution could ever, let's say, move an animal to the moon and back.

151
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But we know that human type knowledge, explanatory knowledge, can do that.

152
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So that's really powerful.

153
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So what happened at some point along the evolutionary chain, these minds were created that were capable of a different, more powerful kind of knowledge, explanatory knowledge.

154
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So this seems to me to come right then to the heart of why you believe we are not just chemical scum.

155
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And to me, it's a profoundly inspiring view in many ways of how we can think of who we are.

156
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For whatever reason, we have found ourselves in this moment in history where we have embarked on a journey that has potentially unlimited reach.

157
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It could lead us to literally anywhere.

158
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There is no dream that, in principle, humans couldn't dream of being part of.

159
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And it may be it's not us in the end, it's some successor species, but we are part of a liftoff that has no limit in principle.

160
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, it has the limits of the laws of physics.

161
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Other than the laws of physics.

162
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I think it's a very striking view.

163
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Humans evolved the ability to do what you've just said at least 100,000 years ago, but for various reasons didn't use it.

164
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Now, in much the same way, the whole universe, starting 14 points something billion years ago, for the first billion years or so, all sorts of new things were happening.

165
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Supermassive black holes were forming, galaxies were forming, hydrogen was ionized and deionized and then new elements were formed and so on.

166
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
After about a billion, I think it's about a billion years, I could be wrong, something like that, nothing new happened in the cosmos.

167
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Stars were formed, they exploded, planetary systems were formed, the same new elements were spewed into the interplanetary gas again and again and again.

168
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And it was just boring for about 13 billion years and then creativity happened and we are at the phase change where things are from now on.

169
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And that is if we play our cards right, if it might not happen or someone else might do it.

170
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But this phase change changes the whole nature of the cosmos.

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:43,000
For example, in the first 14 billion years, the rule was that big things affect small things and small things do not affect big things much.

172
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
After the phase change, everything is determined by small things.

173
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Small things affect large things and what is the determining factor is not mass or power or energy, but information.

174
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And specifically the kind of information that has physical effects, namely knowledge.

175
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, that's the most thrilling history of the universe I've actually ever heard.

176
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But you used a word in there that I need you to explain now.

177
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You said 13 billion years, 12 billion of those were boring, then creativity happened.

178
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So what was creativity and how did it happen?

179
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, human type creativity is different from the creativity of the biosphere in that human creativity can form models of the world that say not only what will happen but why.

180
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So an explanation, for example, is something that captures an aspect of the world that is unseen.

181
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So explanations explain the scene in terms of the unseen.

182
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Whereas biological knowledge, it's only what works.

183
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The eye is like a camera because it gradually moved towards that shape because the animals that had a worse shape didn't survive as well.

184
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But a camera is shaped by the laws of optics.

185
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Okay, so the reason for the existence of a camera is because some human somewhere had this explanatory theory based on these ideas about the invisible, these ideas about optics, about physics, about how light works.

186
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And by using that pattern of ideas that allowed them to build cameras and then a lot more beyond that.

187
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's right.

188
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That is what allows human type knowledge to have this universal reach.

189
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Whereas biological knowledge, although it has enormous reach, as you said, it can make elephants trunks and giraffes necks and so on.

190
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It is actually limited because of the type of knowledge that it is.

191
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,000
For example, to evolve from one animal to another over, let's say, a thousand generations, every single generation must be viable as an animal.

192
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because the DNA strands have to be able to just replicate in every single generation.

193
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And if one of them fails, if one of them doesn't work, then the species will go extinct.

194
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Whereas humans, as the philosopher Karl Popper said, we can let our ideas die in our place.

195
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And that means that we can go through a whole bunch of sequence of ideas that aren't viable on the way from one viable idea to the next.

196
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We don't have to die when they're wrong.

197
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What was the key thing that happened, though, in human history or in human evolution that allowed this type of explanatory knowledge to take off?

198
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Almost certainly this dates back to our ancestor species.

199
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Species before humans also had the capacity for explanatory knowledge, I believe, and also our cousin species, like Neanderthals.

200
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I have a rather heterodox theory of why we have this ability.

201
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Namely, it's needed to pass on cultural knowledge.

202
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is what Richard Dawkins calls memes.

203
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We evolve cultural knowledge, which is memes instead of genes, and they can evolve thousands of times faster.

204
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So what happened at some point hundreds of thousands of years ago was that hominid minds evolved the ability to mimic each other.

205
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You would see a pattern in another mind, and you would copy it, and that created a replication process that was massively faster than traditional reproduction,

206
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and it allowed multiple things to be explored, essentially, and some of those started to work.

207
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The first thing that happened, even before that, there are some species still today, like chimpanzees and so on, that have memes,

208
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and they replicate the meme from one individual to another by literally by blind replication.

209
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They have mirror neurons and that kind of infrastructure in their brain, which allows them to mimic what another chimpanzee is doing.

210
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Now, our ancestors somehow latched onto the evolutionary advantage of having memes, but they both vastly increased the memory,

211
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:39,000
but then they also evolved creativity, because humans copy other humans by a completely different method to what's used by, say, chimpanzees.

212
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Humans don't copy the behavior, they copy the meaning of the behavior.

213
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So you can watch someone doing something, let's say opening, you know, you're a safe cracker and you're secretly watching someone opening their safe,

214
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and you look at the combination that they enter and then they turn one wheel and another wheel.

215
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Now, you might go there and do the same thing, or you might open the safe by a different method.

216
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You know, you might be lowered in, like in some of those films, you might be lowered in from the skylight and have to turn the knobs with your feet.

217
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now, a chimpanzee could not do that, because that's not copying the behavior, that's just copying the meaning of the behavior.

218
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But to humans, it's second nature to copy the meaning.

219
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In fact, if you go to a lecture and you understand what's in the lecture, you might go and tell someone else,

220
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but almost certainly not in the same words that the lecturer used, you would explain it in your own words if you understood it.

221
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And if you didn't understand it, then you might explain it in the same words that the lecturer used.

222
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You might say, well, the lecturer said so and so, but I don't know what the hell he was talking about.

223
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Can you tell me?

224
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Got it.

225
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So let me put this together and see if I've got this right.

226
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So some of our ancestor species developed this ability to copy memes.

227
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Memes, by the way, like the term is now used often just to mean sort of internet images or animations that take off in a spread virally,

228
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
which is a very narrow interpretation of Richard Dawkins' original intention,

229
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
which is a meme is anything that can be copied from brain to brain, whether it's an idea or a phrase, a poem, a piece of music,

230
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
anything that can be copied is a meme.

231
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And so this took off as a sort of biological ability in our ancestors.

232
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And then at some point it shifted to a whole gear where it wasn't direct copy of behavior,

233
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
the meaning of what was underlay some of these activities started to get copied.

234
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And that's the moment when I guess you would say that understanding comes into the equation that someone is understanding someone else's intent or action

235
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and doing something based on that understanding.

236
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And understanding is I think everything almost in your view of the world.

237
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Say a bit more about what it is to understand something.

238
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I use the term understanding and explanation almost interchangeably.

239
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And explanation is something that explains what you see in terms of what you don't see.

240
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It explains what might happen in terms of general ideas about what can happen.

241
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So understanding transcends the initial application of what it's for.

242
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Let's say you initially learn how to throw a ball from one person to another for fun or you throw it as a weapon or something like that.

243
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Then later someone can ask what path does the ball take.

244
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then that may allow them to construct a better weapon or a better defense or a million other things in future generations,

245
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which all depend on the meaning and may have nothing to do with the original application.

246
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But I should add that this initial burst of understanding or creativity into the world was blighted by the fact that memes tend to evolve like genes.

247
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Memes tend to evolve to breed true.

248
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That is memes which can get themselves faithfully copied are preferred to ones which can't.

249
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Regardless of whether they're true or not.

250
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Regardless, right. That's their tendency.

251
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's what they tend to do.

252
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And so initially creativity was used only for copying ideas faithfully,

253
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:51,000
which is almost the opposite use of what we consider creativity to be used for today, which is to improve upon ideas.

254
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:03,000
This is why our ancestors spent 100,000 years basically doing nothing before very, very slowly they changed their lifestyle.

255
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
First, better tools and so on and then agriculture and civilization and so on.

256
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But still improvements were extremely rare so that most people, most humans did not experience any improvement in their lifetime.

257
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And so what's an example of a meme that could be reproduced but is basically not true, does not conform with, you know, it doesn't give any value to helping someone understand the world better.

258
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, well, I mean, the Richard Dawkins favorite example of this and maybe the reason why he introduced the concept is religions.

259
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I mean, you don't have to be an atheist to understand that most religions are memes and that they are false.

260
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So it could be that there's, you know, let me concede that there could be one religion that's true, but that would mean that the others are false.

261
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But also much more prosaically and I guess importantly, we don't expect any of our knowledge to be completely true.

262
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Newton's laws were thought to be the last word in mechanics and gravity and dynamics and so on for hundreds of years.

263
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then they were overturned in quick succession by Einstein's relativity and by quantum theory.

264
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And now we know that they are false.

265
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Now they are still knowledge.

266
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Knowledge doesn't have to be true.

267
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It just has to contain some truth enough to be useful.

268
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And so the key, one of the key contributors then to this takeoff was the development of processes that could distinguish between memes that were just reproducing

269
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and memes that actually were closer to the truth.

270
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
In other words, there was this error correcting mechanism started to take off.

271
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes.

272
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So there we have, we have to jump forward like a hundred thousand years or some hundreds of thousands of years to the scientific revolution.

273
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's rather arbitrary where you date it to some, some people might say the Renaissance was the beginning of it.

274
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And, and I think that this Renaissance or revolution or enlightenment, as I call it, tried to happen several times in human history, right back to antiquity.

275
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And in each case, the static type memes, which prevent innovation, won the battle.

276
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And sometimes it lasted one generation, sometimes it lasted two generations, like in ancient Athens or something.

277
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then with the scientific revolution, it took hold and it has now been around for, depending on how you count it, it's been around for 300 years, 400 years, something like that.

278
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And has been exponentially improving ever since.

279
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So this is really interesting to me.

280
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I think it's easy to see just how big a deal this is that in a way you had a species that for hundreds of thousands of years had developed this extraordinary ability to have a mental life.

281
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But it was effectively running around in random directions, not making real progress because there was no way of saying, this is actually the way forward.

282
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And what you're describing is what science did was it said it found a way of gradually cutting out the negative signals where someone was running into a brick wall or running backwards and saying, no, no, cut that out, move.

283
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And so that creates this process whereby we gradually start to get closer to an understanding of, quote, reality, unquote.

284
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I mean,

285
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Even without the quotes.

286
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Even without the quotes.

287
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It really is an understanding of reality.

288
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
There really is a reality out there.

289
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And it matters that we slowly start to model it in some ways in our minds.

290
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes.

291
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Now, error correction is an extremely simple concept, although very profound.

292
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I mean, absolutely everything depends on it since everything depends on knowledge and knowledge doesn't come to us on a silver platter.

293
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So everything depends on error correction.

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But although that's a simple fact, arranging for that to happen is not at all simple.

295
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's incredibly sophisticated.

296
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We do not understand it.

297
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So we don't understand it either on the level of how creativity works in a single human mind.

298
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And we also don't understand what it takes in a culture for the culture to support error correction because it's almost paradoxical.

299
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What we want is a system for correcting traditional knowledge, but tradition by definition is something that stays the same over generations.

300
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And so Karl Popper coined the phrase, a tradition of criticism.

301
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
This is an extremely unusual form of tradition.

302
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's happened very rarely in human history.

303
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And the one we call the scientific revolution is the is the ancestor of everything good we have today.

304
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But we don't know what it takes for a culture to have a tradition of criticism in it.

305
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Now, we are very lucky and we take for granted that we have things like the scientific community, the scientific tradition.

306
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We take for granted that if a professor is asked a question in a seminar and says, you're not allowed to ask that, just trust me, I'm the professor, he will be laughed at.

307
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Although there are many areas of life where he wouldn't be laughed at, but science is one where it's taken for granted that criticism is part of the culture.

308
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's part of the tradition that's passed on.

309
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And so in many ways, it's a miracle that this ever happened and there's a sort of fragility to it.

310
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I mean, I think it's your view that this type of knowledge lift off almost happened or started to happen at other times in human history, perhaps during the Greek civilization.

311
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And then we lost it.

312
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
How fragile is what we have right now?

313
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We can't know because our enlightenment is the first one that's lasted for more than two or three generations.

314
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I don't think it got to where it is by accident.

315
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I think there is some stability to it.

316
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It didn't get to where it is today by not being stable.

317
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
On the other hand, there definitely is no guarantee.

318
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We could choose to end it.

319
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We could do the wrong thing repeatedly and end it.

320
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Just one thing, though, I would like to say that when people compare our civilization to other civilizations that have lasted for centuries or whatever and then collapsed and they compare ours with theirs,

321
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
like, you know, it was caused by losing self confidence and then the barbarians at the gates and that kind of thing.

322
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I think that's wrong because none of the other long lived civilizations in history has had a tradition of Christism.

323
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So it's obvious that they were fragile.

324
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
They were fragile precisely because they couldn't create the knowledge to cope with unforeseen challenges.

325
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But when you look at the world today, David, there's people like you and many others in the scientific and other communities who are really driven by respect for science, respect for knowledge.

326
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
There are many others and including people in power who are not.

327
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And it can seem that we may forget the importance of our knowledge and ignore it and let go or blow up or destroy much of the preciousness of what we've built.

328
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Is that a lens that you have? What would you, what are you most concerned about as you look out at the world right now?

329
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Well, I think it has always been true since the Renaissance, since the scientific revolution, wherever you count the beginning of our enlightenment to be.

330
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's always been true that most people haven't appreciated it.

331
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Most people have values that kind of contradict it.

332
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Most people resent it a bit.

333
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So it has survived by being stable in its own terms.

334
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And when you start referring to the political side of it, there, the equivalent of the scientific revolution is liberal democracy or whatever you want to call the values that underlie the western political system.

335
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And this does seem, especially the Anglosphere part of it, does seem to be incredibly stable.

336
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you look at the early to mid 20th century, the age of the great dictators, totalitarian ideologies were sweeping the world.

337
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
All the intellectuals in the world were either fascists or communists.

338
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Well, I'm exaggerating, but many of them were.

339
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And in many countries, fascists and communists took over the government and caused all sorts of damage.

340
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And if they had one, they could easily have ended civilization.

341
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But it's, I think it's extremely significant that not one of the Anglosphere countries fell to a dictatorship.

342
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And when you say that democracy is the kind of the political equivalent of the scientific revolution, liberal democracy is.

343
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I guess the key point you're making there is that you can think of a democracy, a liberal democracy as an error correcting system.

344
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That is actually the most fundamental way to think of it.

345
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's not that it automatically, it doesn't automatically create good.

346
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
What it does is it weeds it eventually, eventually weeds out the bad.

347
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And so if you imagine human political endeavor, human endeavor generally as this sort of a thousand flowers flourishing and trying to grow in different directions.

348
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
When some of them start to grow in the wrong direction, a democratic system will reign that and say, sorry, you've had your turn.

349
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You're out. Let's put someone else in and try and grow differently.

350
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yes, peacefully.

351
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's the thing, because if it's not done peacefully, then knowledge is destroyed in the war or in the civil war or whatever.

352
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Or in the coup that overturns the previous regime.

353
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The political tradition is judged by whether it can remove bad policies and bad leaders peacefully.

354
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So when people worry today about a rise in demagoguery, for example, you're reasonably confident that the system's error correction mechanism is all kicking to gear?

355
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, I mean, I can't say how little I'm concerned about that danger.

356
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:07,000
If civilization is going to be destroyed, it's not going to be destroyed by some government taking power and then not relinquishing it.

357
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's not going to happen.

358
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, that's definitely encouraging and I think a lot of people will be sitting there crossing fingers hoping you're right on that one.

359
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I mean, I think you think of the realm of the total amount of knowledge and understanding out there as essentially infinite, right?

360
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's not like we'll discover the grand equation and suddenly we'll know all of science, that we should rather think of knowledge almost as this growing sphere against the unknown.

361
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And the more we know, the more we know we don't know.

362
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Is that the right way to think of it?

363
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes, yes.

364
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So as again, Karl Popper put it, solving problems creates new problems and therefore in our infinite ignorance, we are all alike.

365
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And maybe the reason why knowledge of the human type has this infinite scope and could take us across the galaxy or whatever and also down to nanotechnology and all that is because of the special relationship that human minds have with the laws of physics.

366
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's this explanatory knowledge that human minds are capable of that can see beyond the visible.

367
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So we can look up in the sky and see a cold, tiny dot of what looks like cold white light.

368
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And we know that that is actually a star, which means it's actually a million miles across and it's at 25 million degrees in its interior and 6000 degrees on its surface.

369
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And if we went there, we'd be fried to a crisp so we can never experience it, at least not without special technology.

370
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And yet we can know about it.

371
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We can sit here and know about it in enormous detail and in ever increasing detail.

372
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The reason that this is possible, as I said, is because human minds and explanatory knowledge has a special relationship with the laws of nature.

373
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So this seems implausible to a lot of people.

374
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
A lot of people would say, look, every species knows something, a dog knows that a bone tastes delicious, but it doesn't know scientific theory.

375
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We know a certain amount of scientific theory, but it's ridiculous to imagine that there must be a whole world of things out there that we are never even in principle capable of understanding.

376
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And you dispute that.

377
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Why?

378
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes.

379
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Why?

380
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
There are two sides to that comparison.

381
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:54,000
First, you compare the dog with a human and then you compare with a human to the putative, unknowable things that there might be out there.

382
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So there are two steps there.

383
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I've already explained why the dog is inherently different from us.

384
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's because the dog knows that the bone tastes good because it's some of its ancestors who didn't know that died and the dog doesn't actually know anything.

385
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's genes know that.

386
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And there are certain types of things that can become known that way, but the vast majority of things in the world, in the universe, cannot become known that way because the dog cannot try to eat the sun and be burned and that kind of thing.

387
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
No one could gain the knowledge of the sun by that same method.

388
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Now, the other thing, what if there was knowledge out there, what the things out there that we couldn't possibly understand?

389
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Well, as a logical possibility, of course, it's always possible that there are incomprehensible things in the universe.

390
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But I have argued that taking that seriously is exactly the same as a belief in the supernatural because you could never have an explanation of the form.

391
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:08,000
This thing that can have an effect on us can never be understood because if it can have an effect, we can theorize about what causes the effect and we can do an experiment to test the theory.

392
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And it's your belief that the type of experiential knowledge that we have can wrap around any imaginable explanation that could be out there.

393
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's not like there is sort of human knowledge and then there might be some knowledge that gods or fairies or whatever have that is fundamentally different and more profound or other aliens could have.

394
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So this makes me wonder whether in your worldview, there are similar liftoffs happening on other planets out there?

395
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We don't know. As you know, there's this problem of if there is intelligent life on other planets in the galaxy, there are many arguments that say we should have seen them by now.

396
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
This is called the Fermi paradox, although I would rather call it the Fermi problem because I don't see anything paradoxical about it.

397
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Suppose there are just two explanatory species in the galaxy, then having reached the explanatory takeoff like the scientific revolution, in the twinkling of an eye on the cosmic scale, we will have settled the whole galaxy.

398
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And the galaxy exists on time scales of billions of years.

399
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So compared with the age of the galaxy, the moment from when humans first evolved to when humans have settled the whole galaxy is just a blink of an eye.

400
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And therefore, the chances that two civilizations emerge at the same time is infinitesimal.

401
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So that means that if they exist, they must be millions of years ahead of us.

402
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And if they're millions of years ahead of us, why aren't they here already?

403
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because the argument said that they would be here already.

404
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Now, why would they not be here?

405
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Well, there are lots of reasons that, first of all, one solution to the Fermi problem might be that we are the first.

406
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
People kind of reject that because it's kind of boring.

407
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And why should we be so special?

408
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Well, someone had to be and we kind of reject that as a possibility because there's no structure in that idea.

409
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
There's nothing further to say, but it could be true like a load of other things.

410
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So the next possibility is, yes, the galaxy is full of a civilization and they're going to be here soon.

411
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But I mean, you believe that human creativity is the fundamental part of the whole knowledge lift off.

412
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And the aesthetic expression of that is certainly a big part of who we are.

413
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
To me, one of the puzzles is not that we don't see spaceships coming.

414
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's that we don't see any evidence of the galaxy having been engineered.

415
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:07,000
If dolphins were to make a breakthrough and start developing periscopes that could look up and examine the world around them

416
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and they poked them up and looked at the surface of the earth,

417
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
they would see buildings and astonishing structures that seem to cry out for an explanation that looked like they were the objects of intentional construction.

418
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We look out at the galaxy and see nothing.

419
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You think at the very least you'd see some sort of, you know, some stars had been converted into spectacular artistic displays

420
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
or there'd be some evidence of engineering.

421
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The fact that there's no evidence of engineering suggests that the main game in town out there is still

422
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
the same old physical processes that filled the prior 13 billion boring years.

423
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So first of all, we haven't looked very carefully yet.

424
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I mean, this kind of thing looking out for evidence of technology in other star systems is only just beginning now.

425
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And we can only detect very powerful things.

426
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I don't think we should take for granted that these type...

427
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Although I think we should take for granted that if an intelligent species exists, it will colonize the galaxy very quickly.

428
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't think we should take for granted that it will enter this phase of type one, type two, type three civilizations.

429
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
For the simple reason that once you're type three civilization, what are you going to do next?

430
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And certainly they will be capable of doing that.

431
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But again, like us, they will have to decide what to do.

432
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
There would have to be a reason why they go for, for example, enormously increased power consumption.

433
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
They might not want that.

434
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I think the chances are they won't want it because they will be information based.

435
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
They will be entirely in virtual reality, except when they want to go out into the physical world for some purpose.

436
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And they may not want to go very far from each other because of the communication difficulty.

437
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Unless, again, unless there's a strong reason for it.

438
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So that strikes me as a really compelling solution to the problem, if you like.

439
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Because based on your view, what matters when you have a knowledge lift off is knowledge.

440
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And knowledge can be encapsulated in many forms, often which can be vastly smaller even than the biological forms in which we are now.

441
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And to me, it's possible to imagine an alien species developing ever more rich forms of creativity in ever smaller spaces.

442
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That the whole notion of physical conquest would become just an absurdly old fashioned notion of what made life interesting.

443
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's like, why bother to do that when you have infinite control over a much smaller structure of information space that you can pattern in any way you want?

444
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And so there's that sort of almost that conversion of the material into the virtual that allows infinite possibility right there.

445
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes, as Feynman said, there's plenty of room at the bottom.

446
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:15,000
There are more orders of magnitude to explore on the microscopic world than there are in the macroscopic world, say, across the galaxy.

447
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And once you have a civilization that is capable of interstellar travel and extending down to the microscopic, it's not obvious what they will think best from their point of view.

448
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The great disadvantage of living in the galaxy is not the size of it, it's the time.

449
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's the fact that you can't have a coherent culture where the parts of it are a hundred light years from each other.

450
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Right, so right there, that's a good reason to theorize why growing intelligence would want to actually go smaller, not bigger.

451
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So it's possible that you're still so taken with your history of the universe of 12 billion years of boring.

452
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Presumably, it's compatible with what you just said, that it might turn out not to be 12 billion years of boring.

453
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There might be all these spectacular takeoffs of intelligence understanding knowledge in different pockets of the galaxy or of the universe, but just that we don't yet see that.

454
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We're not yet exposed to any of that of that history.

455
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yes, there might be.

456
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I myself hope that part of the morality of any advanced civilization would be that they would come and rescue us as soon as they found out we exist.

457
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But here's another narrative that is compatible with what we see, which is that as a species takes off and starts developing knowledge that inevitably things go wrong at some point.

458
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
That we inevitably create the technologies capable of destroying us.

459
00:50:48,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And it's either in the nature of the dynamics of power or in that just in the nature of the dynamics of complexity, that something horrifying eventually goes wrong and these attempts at liftoff get wiped out.

460
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So I'm sure that's not inevitable.

461
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And that's for exactly the same reason why unlimited progress is not inevitable.

462
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:29,000
If it were inevitable, that that means if it were true that everywhere in the universe where there's explanatory knowledge starts taking off, it will destroy itself within, you know, say a thousand years.

463
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
That would be a law of physics.

464
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So if you're going to postulate that there's this law just in order to make your nightmares come true, you may as well just as stuck with believing in goblins and demons.

465
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Although there is a sort of plausible way of thinking about it just on earth level, which is that as technologies get more powerful, the stakes get ever higher.

466
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We have already invented technologies that in principle you could imagine it's not that long before a single deranged student in a lab might be able to engineer a virus that could really quickly spread and take out the human race.

467
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But after staying invisible to people while it cultures and spreads for 30 days and then suddenly boom, it's possible to imagine that knowledge brings with it the potential for unlimited destructive power.

468
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And that as the sort of Humpty Dumpty theory of, you know, it's easier to break things than to make things.

469
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yes. Of course, that's a possibility, because if it wasn't a possibility, then continued progress would be inevitable, which it isn't.

470
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But the knowledge of how to defend civilization against existential threats is also a form of knowledge, which is unlimited.

471
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So if we fail to create that knowledge, we're doomed. If we do create that knowledge, we're not doomed. That story is the same as with all knowledge.

472
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So the possibility is there for us to create it for, as I put it, for the good guys to stay ahead of the bad guys.

473
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But also there is something about the bad actors that makes them progress more slowly.

474
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That is, they are enemies of civilization. Therefore, they are wrong, right?

475
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And therefore, they have to be in a state of mind that can tolerate being wrong, and therefore they can't tolerate a tradition of criticism.

476
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:37,000
In fact, with the realistic ones that you perhaps have in mind, destroying the tradition of criticism is their main objective.

477
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That's what their grievance is. So that makes them slower. That makes them inherently trail the good guys.

478
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But that's just a tendency. It need not be so that there could be a breakthrough by some of the bad guys, and that's why I say we have a moral obligation to stay ahead of them.

479
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I mean, that's a beautifully optimistic argument in a way that there's such a thing as a clever devil, but not as a super clever devil.

480
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Because by being a devil, you're taking away the ability to be truly clever in the long term.

481
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Absolutely right. I can't see any way out of that argument. It's got to be that.

482
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Well, I love that argument. I truly hope that that one works out.

483
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I just want to ask you this last question, David, which is if you could implant in the minds of the good majority of people on this planet a single idea, what would that idea be?

484
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I think it's got to be the idea of optimism that all evils are due to lack of knowledge.

485
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So you just gave a definition of optimism there that is not what most people think of as optimism.

486
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Most people think of optimism as a feeling of hope about the future. Your definition is different. So explain that.

487
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, hope that isn't based on an explanatory theory is rather, I mean, isn't that what they call a vain hope?

488
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It's whistling in the dark. Optimism, as I define it, has to do with knowledge.

489
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's not a prediction of the future. It's an explanation of failure.

490
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:35,000
If you explain failure as being inevitable or due to some malevolent force, insuperable malevolent force, or just the way things are, then that's a recipe for stasis, which is a recipe for failure and eventually death.

491
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Therefore, I think that all failure has to be explained in the form. The reason we didn't succeed is that we didn't know how to and the knowledge of how to is in principle attainable.

492
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We don't have it now, but we could have it in the future if we do the right thing.

493
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:04,000
In fact, it follows from this whole conception of knowledge that we've been talking about all this time that optimism has to be true.

494
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Otherwise, there would be a limitation, which would mean supernatural and all that stuff.

495
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:17,000
The arguments are watertight all the way from the scientific worldview to optimism in my view.

496
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Here's how I would distill this David Deutsch worldview, which I have to say, David, I find quite an inspiring worldview.

497
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Here we are, this homo sapiens. We've had this surprising moment of liftoff where we're able to create new knowledge, new understanding, but it's a fragile thing.

498
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's full of errors, full of mistakes.

499
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:56,000
If we could inspire everyone out there to adopt the mindset that knowledge was precious and that when things go wrong on our planet, it's not because there's some evil force there that needs punching in the gut and spitting out.

500
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's just because we're not understanding something and our job and our duty is to seek to understand, to look for those areas, to correct them.

501
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:24,000
If we were to adopt that mindset, then there's literally no limit to the journey that we can go on together, a journey of growing knowledge and unlimited creativity and lives of wonder and so forth.

502
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I mean, that's what I take from you, that knowledge is not a thing for schools, libraries or whatever.

503
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's this superpower that humans have developed if they're willing to look at it the right way.

504
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well put, I agree. We must also expect to make lots of mistakes.

505
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So it's not just knowing that the problem is to create the knowledge.

506
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There's not an automatic way of creating it. In fact, it's conjectural. We're going to make many mistakes.

507
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's why we have to set up institutions that can correct them.

508
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And so mistakes should be viewed as gifts in a way, as long as you learn from them and adjust as a result of them, they're a gift.

509
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yes, yes. John Wheeler said that our whole problem is to make the mistakes as fast as possible.

510
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You look out at the world and we're certainly getting that part right.

511
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
David Deutsch has been such a delight to speak with you and I really thank you for those many, many hours.

512
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I picture you in that home just sitting there dreaming, thinking, puzzling.

513
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
The what you have put together from that I think is really remarkable and I hope we can do the same.

514
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
David, thank you so much. I absolutely love this time.

515
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Nice talking.

516
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Bye bye for now.

517
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Bye then.

518
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This week's show was produced by Sharon Mashihi.

519
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Our associate producer is Kim Naderfeyne-Peterser.

520
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Special thanks to Helen Walters.

521
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Our show is mixed by David Herman and our theme music is by Allison Layton Brown.

522
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:09,000
In our next episode, I sit down with Sam Harris to discuss whether science can answer moral questions.

523
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
The most important questions in human life are questions we have to be able to talk about

524
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and we have a very large proportion of humanity that is saying,

525
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
okay, these most important questions, how to live, how to cause your children to live

526
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and what to die for, these are questions that we're not willing to talk about rationally.

527
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
