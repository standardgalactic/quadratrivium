00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello, everybody, and

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,800
welcome to another YouTube

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,840
video. In this video, I'm

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,560
going to be showing you

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,640
how to make a planet

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,120
simulation using

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,680
Python. Now, the goal of

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,400
this is going to be to

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,560
simulate the orbits of

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,280
different planets

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,560
around the sun. We're

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,440
going to use real

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,840
astronomical values. So

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,680
the real mass of the

15
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
sun, the real distance

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,760
from Earth to the sun,

17
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,920
all of that type of

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
stuff. And we're going

19
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,960
to apply the force of

20
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,200
gravity between all of

21
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,080
the different planets.

22
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,960
So we actually get an

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
accurate elliptical

24
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,800
orbit. Now here it does

25
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,880
look like the orbit is

26
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,400
circular. It is not. You

27
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,200
can see I'm actually

28
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,520
writing the distance of

29
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,320
the planet to the sun on

30
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,080
each planet. So it's

31
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,960
changing as we go

32
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,160
around the orbit. Well,

33
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,080
this is really cool.

34
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,960
We're kind of mixing a

35
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,040
bit of physics with

36
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,600
Python and looking at a

37
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
cool simulation. Now, I

38
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,080
will mention that this

39
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,400
tutorial is not designed

40
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
for complete beginners.

41
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,480
You should have some

42
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,560
knowledge of Python.

43
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,440
However, if you don't

44
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,000
know anything about

45
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,120
physics, don't worry.

46
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,000
I will teach you the

47
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
different physics we need

48
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,400
to know to actually, I

49
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,280
guess, perform this

50
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
simulation. It's not

51
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,640
very complicated. I

52
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
myself am not a physics

53
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,600
major or a physics guy.

54
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
And I was able to figure

55
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,400
it out pretty quickly.

56
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,600
Anyways, with that said,

57
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,360
let's go ahead and get

58
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,480
into the code after a

59
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,600
quick word from our

60
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,640
sponsor. Thanks to

61
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
Backtrace for sponsoring

62
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,480
this video. Backtrace

63
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,600
provides application

64
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520

error and crash reporting

66
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,320
for games. We've all

67
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,240
been there excited to

68
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,160
launch a brand new

69
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
video game just to be

70
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,640
tormented by crashes,

71
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,320
bugs and an overall bad

72
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
user experience. Backtrace

73
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
wants to help limit that

74
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
by providing a platform

75
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,600
that gives game developers

76
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
the best error and crash

77
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,240
reporting with the most

78
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,360

and thanks again to

104
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Backtrace for sponsoring

105
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
this video. All right.

106
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,920
So let's go ahead and

107
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,240
get started. Now, I will

108
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
mention that right here,

109
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm not simulating every

110
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
single planet. You can

111
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
easily adjust the

112
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
simulation to add as

113
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,520
many planets as you

114
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
would like. You can even

115
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,520
put something like stars

116
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
or satellites, whatever.

117
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
You can put any of that

118
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
here because of the

119
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,440
way we're going to set

120
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
this up. However, the

121
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,760
planets I'm simulating

122
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
right now are just the

123
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
four closest to the sun.

124
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
So we have Earth, Mars,

125
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,040
Venus and Mercury.

126
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,080
We're just doing that.

127
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
So we get a nice visual

128
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,120
and we can see

129
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
everything nice and large.

130
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
If you were to simulate

131
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,200
the planets that are

132
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
much further away from

133
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
the sun, then you're

134
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
going to see all of

135
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,680
these plants kind of

136
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
smushed really close to

137
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
the sun and then the

138
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,640
huge orbits around the

139
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,600
sun from the larger

140
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,440
planets, if that makes

141
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
sense. And the planets

142
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,040
that are much further

143
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,960
away. So this is just

144
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
a nice visualization.

145
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,240
Again, you can adjust

146
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
this however you like,

147
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
and I'll show you how to

148
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,160
do that. So with that

149
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,280
said, let's dive into

150
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,840
this. I'm going to

151
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
close this and just

152
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
open up a new window

153
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
here and we'll start

154
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,560
writing some code. Now,

155
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,240
the first thing we do

156
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,920
actually need to do is

157
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
install Pi game. So if

158
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,080
you don't already have

159
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
Pi game installed, then

160
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
just open up your

161
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
terminal or command

162
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
prompt, depending on

163
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
your operating system

164
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
and type in the

165
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
following command, PIP

166
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,840
install Pi game. That

167
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
doesn't work for you.

168
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
Try PIP three install

169
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
Pi game. If that

170
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,640
doesn't work for you,

171
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,880
try Python hyphen M and

172
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
then PIP install Pi game.

173
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,360
If that doesn't work,

174
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,920
try Python three hyphen M

175
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
PIP install Pi game.

176
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,920
And if none of those

177
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,680
commands work, I have

178
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,480
two videos that I'll

179
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,280
put on the screen that

180
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,360
show you how to fix

181
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
your PIP command.

182
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
Anyways, I'm going to

183
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,880
assume that you have

184
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Pi game installed.

185
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,880
This is just a 2D

186
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,960
graphics library that

187
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
we're going to use for

188
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
the simulation. If you

189
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
don't know Pi game,

190
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,680
don't worry, we're going

191
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,600
to use very limited

192
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
features from it. And

193
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,560
I'll talk about how all

194
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
of them work. So the

195
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,320
first thing I'm going

196
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,680
to do here is just

197
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,040
import Pi game. And

198
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,600
then I'm going to say

199
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,120
Pi game dot a knit

200
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
just to initialize the

201
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,640
module. I'm also going

202
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,560
to import the math

203
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,240
module because we're

204
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,880
going to have to use

205
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,640
that in this code.

206
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Okay. So continuing

207
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
since I'm using Pi game,

208
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,720
the first thing I want

209
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,480
to do is set up my

210
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
Pi game window. Now to

211
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,520
do this, we need to

212
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,720
pick a width and height

213
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
in pixels for our

214
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,080
window. So I'm going to

215
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,840
say the width comma the

216
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
height in all capitals

217
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,840
because this is a

218
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,320
constant is going to be

219
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,520
800 800 can make this

220
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,200
whatever width and

221
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,920
height you want, but I

222
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,840
recommend you make it

223
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,040
square. And then we're

224
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,600
going to set up a

225
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,960
window. So I'm going to

226
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,680
say when is equal to

227
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,400
Pi game dot display

228
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
dot set underscore

229
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,920
mode. Now this is just

230
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,680
going to take in the

231
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,440
coordinates for the

232
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
size of our window. So

233
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
we're going to pass as

234
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
a couple here, the

235
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
width and the height.

236
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,880
This is going to give

237
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,520
us what's known as a

238
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
Pi game surface. We're

239
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,640
going to call it the

240
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
window because it's the

241
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
main window that we're

242
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,560
going to draw onto. And

243
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
we need to have access

244
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
to this surface to be

245
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,200
able to put something

246
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,760
on the screen and

247
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,680
actually see something

248
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,080
moving around. Now what

249
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm also going to do is

250
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
just set a caption for

251
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,080
this window. So Pi game

252
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
dot display dot set

253
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,400
underscore caption. Now

254
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,160
the caption is just

255
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,880
going to be kind of the

256
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
title of the window. I'll

257
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
show you what it looks

258
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,480
like in one second. And

259
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
for this, we'll just do

260
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
planet simulation. Okay,

261
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
perfect. So now that we

262
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
have this, what I want to

263
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,440
do is create something

264
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
known as the Pi game

265
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,760
event loop. Now this is

266
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,800
essentially an infinite

267
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
loop that's going to run

268
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
the entire time that

269
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,080
the simulation is going.

270
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,000
Whenever you're working

271
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
with some type of game,

272
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,800
you need some type of

273
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
loop that's constantly

274
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
running. They can keep

275
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,720
track of the different

276
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,800
events that are occurring.

277
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,920
In this case, the only

278
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,840
event is going to be

279
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,640
moving the different

280
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,760
planets, but we need to

281
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,720
have some type of loops

282
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,360
that the window doesn't

283
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
just open and instantly

284
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
close. We need something

285
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
keeping the program

286
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
running. So I'm going to

287
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
make a function here and

288
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm going to call this

289
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
main and inside of here,

290
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm going to make a

291
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,040
variable. I'm going to

292
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,120
say run is equal to

293
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,280
true. Then we're going

294
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,840
to say, well, run like

295
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
this and this loop will

296
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
run while this variable

297
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,920
run is true. Now inside

298
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
of here, I'm going to

299
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
get the different

300
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,840
events that are occurring

301
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,920
in Pi game. So I'm going

302
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
to say for event in Pi

303
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
game dot event dot get.

304
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,720
Now this is going to give

305
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
us a list of all of the

306
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,640
different events that

307
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
occur. So key presses,

308
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,480
mouse movements,

309
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
whatever. Now when you're

310
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,400
coding a more complex

311
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,880
game, you're going to

312
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
handle those different

313
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
events. However, the

314
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,240
only event that we want

315
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,400
to handle is when the

316
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
user presses the X

317
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
button to close the

318
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,040
window. Now that event

319
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
is the following. I'm

320
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,040
going to say if event

321
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,520
dot type is equal to

322
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
Pi game dot quit in

323
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,480
all capitals, then all

324
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,000
we're going to do is

325
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,960
say run is equal to

326
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
false. And then outside

327
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,320
of our wall loop, we're

328
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
going to say Pi game dot

329
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
quit. So this is

330
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
literally all we need

331
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,400
for the event loop,

332
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
at least for right now,

333
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,400
what's going to happen

334
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,800
is we're going to

335
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,840
continually run, we're

336
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,600
going to get all of the

337
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
events. If one of the

338
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,680
events that occurred

339
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
was we hit the X

340
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,880
button in the window,

341
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,040
then we are going to

342
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
close the window by

343
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
making run equal to

344
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
false. Since that's

345
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
going to exit our loop,

346
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,480
we're going to quit

347
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Pi game and then we'll

348
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,080
be done. Perfect. So

349
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,880
all we need to do here

350
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,080
is just call this main

351
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,200
function. And now that

352
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
we do this, we should

353
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
see a Pi game window

354
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
pop up and then we can

355
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,400
close it and get out of

356
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,120
the program safely. So

357
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
let's try this. And

358
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,080
there we go. We get

359
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
planet simulation.

360
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,000
This is the caption I

361
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,600
was talking about. You

362
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,280
could see it kind of

363
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
right here beside the

364
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
little Pi game logo.

365
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Then if I click the X

366
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,200
button, we're going to

367
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
close and we are all

368
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,200
okay. We have set up

369
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
our event loop. Nice.

370
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
So now that we have

371
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,040
done that, I just want

372
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
to show you how we can

373
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,040
draw something onto

374
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
the screen and kind of

375
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,720
update the screen. So

376
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
let's do that. So at

377
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
the top of this loop

378
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,760
here, I'm actually

379
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,200
going to set up

380
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,920
something called a

381
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,760
clock. Now a clock

382
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
is essentially going

383
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,360
to make it so that the

384
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,760
frame rate of our game

385
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,080
won't go past a certain

386
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
value. I'll talk about

387
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
why we need this, but

388
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
the idea here is that

389
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,920
if we don't implement

390
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
some type of clock, so

391
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,320
some way to synchronize

392
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,280
our game, essentially,

393
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
you're going to run

394
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
the simulation at the

395
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
speed of your computer.

396
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
Now, some people want

397
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,880
that to happen. They

398
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
want it to run super

399
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,360
fast. If you're on a

400
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
super fast computer and

401
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
then super slow, if

402
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,120
you're on a super

403
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,480
slow one, but ideally

404
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,600
for me, I don't care

405
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,240
about what type of

406
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,640
processor you have. I

407
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,400
just want you to run

408
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,160
the simulation at the

409
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,040
same speed. So it

410
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
looks normal. Hopefully

411
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,720
that makes a bit of

412
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,240
sense, but we can

413
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,120
kind of regulate the

414
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,960
frame rate and how

415
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,080
many times our game is

416
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,360
refreshing. So the way

417
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
we do that is we say

418
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,160
clock is equal to

419
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
pie game dot time

420
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,280
dot clock. And then

421
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,160
we go here and we say

422
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,720
clock dot tick. And

423
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,320
then we put in the

424
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
number of times that

425
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,520
we want this to update

426
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
per second. Now, this

427
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,600
does not mean you're

428
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
always going to update

429
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
at, in this case, 60

430
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
frames per second.

431
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
However, this is the

432
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
maximum that you will

433
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
be able to update at.

434
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,040
So we're saying clock

435
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
dot tick 60. That

436
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,520
means we're going to

437
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
update this loop or

438
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
run this loop a maximum

439
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,400
of 60 times per second

440
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
to ensure our games

441
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,320
not going too fast.

442
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,400
Okay. So now we have

443
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
our clock. And as I

444
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,240
was saying, we want to

445
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,280
draw something on the

446
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,720
screen. So to draw

447
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
something, I'm going to

448
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,760
use my window right

449
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
here. And I'm going to

450
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,960
say win dot fill. And

451
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,880
then I need to pass an

452
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,520
RGB color here that's

453
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
going to be the color

454
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
that I want to fill the

455
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
entire window with on

456
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,840
the screen. So I'm just

457
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,440
going to define a

458
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
color. Let's just go

459
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,760
with white for now. And

460
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,800
white will be equal to

461
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,080
255, 255, 255. Okay.

462
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
So that's our RGB value

463
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,920
for white. And then I'm

464
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
going to pass white

465
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,280
inside of here. And we

466
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,560
should see in a second

467
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,160
that we're going to get

468
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,920
the screen actually

469
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,760
updating. And now it's

470
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
going to have a white

471
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
background rather than a

472
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,120
black. However, I will

473
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
show you if I currently

474
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,640
run the code, we

475
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,680
actually don't get any

476
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,080
white on the screen. And

477
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,880
the reason we don't get

478
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,800
any white on the screen

479
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,440
is because we're not

480
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,040
updating the display. So

481
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,960
what I need to do is say

482
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
pie game dot display dot

483
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,640
update, not clear. And

484
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
what this does is

485
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,640
actually take all of the

486
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
drawing actions that

487
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
we've done since the

488
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,400
last update and then

489
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,320
kind of paste them and

490
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
draws them onto the

491
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,240
screen. So what I'm

492
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
doing is every loop, I'm

493
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
going to fill the

494
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,240
background with white

495
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,840
and then I'm going to

496
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,160
update the display. Okay.

497
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,280
So now if I run this,

498
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
you're going to see that

499
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
we get a white back. Now

500
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,680
we don't actually want

501
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,320
a white background. I

502
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
want a black one. So

503
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm going to get rid of

504
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,800
this. I just wanted to

505
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,920
show you how we fill the

506
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
screen. Okay. So let's

507
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,680
comment these out for

508
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,520
right now. Perfect. So

509
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
now that we've done this,

510
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
let's start implementing

511
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,920
a plan because obviously

512
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,440
we want to put some

513
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
planets on the screen.

514
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,360
And to do this, I'm

515
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
going to make a class.

516
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
So I'm going to say class

517
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
planet. And inside of

518
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,040
here, I'm going to define

519
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,760
an initialization. I'm

520
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
going to say define a

521
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
knit. I'm going to say

522
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,200
self. We need an X and a

523
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
Y. Now the X and the Y

524
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,000
is going to be the

525
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
position that we want

526
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
this planet to be on

527
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
the screen. We also

528
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,360
are going to need a

529
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,640
radius. We're going to

530
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
need a color. And then

531
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,200
let me just check if we

532
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,960
want to take anything

533
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,560
else. We're also going

534
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
to need a mass for the

535
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,520
planet. Okay. So these

536
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,920
are kind of the

537
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,000
initialization values

538
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
that we have. So I'm

539
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,240
going to say self dot

540
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
X is equal to X self

541
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,960
dot Y is equal to Y

542
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,840
self dot radius is

543
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
equal to radius.

544
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Obviously we're going

545
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,760
to have circular

546
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
planets, self dot

547
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
color is equal to

548
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,480
color. We might want to

549
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,400
make our planets more

550
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,120
detailed and have

551
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
multiple colors, but

552
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,640
for now we're just

553
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,040
going to go with a

554
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,440
single color. And then

555
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,400
the mass is going to

556
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,360
be the mass in

557
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
kilograms of this

558
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,360
planet. We're going to

559
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
have to use that mass

560
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
to calculate the

561
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,160
attraction between the

562
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,920
different planets and

563
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,640
then generate the

564
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,000
actual circular orbit,

565
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,120
which we'll get to when

566
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,960
we start talking about

567
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
the physics. Now there's

568
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,920
a few other things that

569
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
we want our planets to

570
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,800
have. They're going to

571
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,880
have to have an X

572
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
velocity as well as a

573
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
Y velocity. So I'm

574
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
going to say self dot

575
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,360
underscore X, well, is

576
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
equal to zero and

577
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
self dot Y, well, is

578
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,800
equal to zero. Now

579
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,520
I'll explain how all

580
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,400
of these concepts work

581
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
in a second, but the

582
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,120
idea is we're going to

583
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
be moving our planet

584
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
in a circle. And in

585
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,720
order to move in a

586
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
circle, we have a

587
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
velocity in multiple

588
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
directions. So we're

589
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
going to have it in the

590
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
X direction, which is

591
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,160
the horizontal

592
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
direction and then in

593
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
the Y direction. And by

594
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,520
moving in two

595
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
directions at the same

596
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,280
time, we're able to

597
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
generate a circle and

598
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
have kind of, I don't

599
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
want to call it

600
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,000
centripetal force or

601
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,960
some, some tripetal

602
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,760
motion, but something

603
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,640
along those lines, right?

604
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,120
Well, we're actually

605
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,440
moving in a circle

606
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
around an object at a

607
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
constant speed. Okay.

608
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,280
Hopefully this is

609
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,400
making sense so far.

610
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,400
Another thing that I

611
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
want to do here is I

612
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
want to have something

613
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,600
that says self that

614
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,280
sun is equal to false.

615
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:25,960
Now this is going to

616
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
tell us if the planet

617
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,640
is the sun. The reason

618
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,680
we want that is because

619
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,640
we're going to draw the

620
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,840
orbit of the planet

621
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,080
moving around. And I

622
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,920
don't want to draw the

623
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,880
orbit for the sun. So I

624
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,560
need to know if it's a

625
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
sun to either draw it

626
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
or to not draw it. And

627
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,840
then I'm going to have

628
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
the self.distance to

629
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
the sun. I'm just going

630
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,600
to make this equal to

631
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
zero right now. And

632
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,560
we're going to update

633
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,160
this value for every

634
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,000
single planet that we

635
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,480
have so that we know

636
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
what its distances and

637
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,200
we can then draw that

638
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
on the screen. And then

639
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,200
the last thing that I

640
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,960
want is self.orbit is

641
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,160
equal to an empty list.

642
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
We're going to use this

643
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
to keep track of all of

644
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,680
the points that this

645
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,800
planet has traveled

646
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
along so we can draw a

647
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
circular orbit

648
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,280
representing well, the

649
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,200
orbit of the planet.

650
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,360
Okay. Again, all this

651
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,080
will start to make sense

652
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,960
as we get into more of

653
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,800
these concepts. I'm just

654
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
kind of setting up all

655
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,640
of the initialization

656
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,320
values. Now, a few

657
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,840
other things that I

658
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
want to do here is

659
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
just write out a few

660
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,160
constants that we're

661
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,640
going to use for our

662
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
simulation. Now, the

663
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,040
first constant we're

664
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,000
going to do as a class

665
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,160
variable in the planet

666
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
class. And this is

667
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,280
going to be a you. Now,

668
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
a you is astronomical

669
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
units. And this is

670
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,960
approximately equal to

671
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
the distance of the

672
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,280
earth to the sun. Now,

673
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,360
I want to use a you

674
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,960
because it's going to

675
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,280
simplify the math that

676
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,440
we need to do to

677
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,480
calculate the distance

678
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,240
between the current

679
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
planet and the sun and

680
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,280
allow us to initialize

681
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,200
our planets at the

682
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
correct a you from the

683
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,600
sun. So they're kind of

684
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
the correct distance

685
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,720
away. Hopefully that

686
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
makes a bit of sense,

687
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,320
but one a you is equal

688
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,000
to. And I just have to

689
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,920
copy this from my other

690
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
screen. One point four

691
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,520
nine dot six to the

692
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,600
exponent six, which is

693
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,840
what this E six stands

694
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,800
for, and then

695
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
multiplied by a

696
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
thousand. And I don't

697
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,560
actually need these

698
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,280
in parentheses. So I

699
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,040
don't know why I had it

700
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,920
there. Okay. So what

701
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,960
this is saying is we

702
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
are one hundred and

703
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,920
forty nine thousand. I

704
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,840
guess this is sorry,

705
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
one hundred forty nine

706
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
million and then six

707
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
hundred thousand

708
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,320
kilometers. That's what

709
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
this stands for right

710
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,400
here, but we want this

711
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
to be in meters. So I'm

712
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
going to multiply it by

713
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,480
a thousand to get the

714
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
distance from the sun

715
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
in meters. One a you

716
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,160
that that's what this

717
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,840
is. Hopefully that makes

718
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,520
sense. Again, want to

719
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,440
use the distance from

720
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
the earth to the sun

721
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,400
approximately. And here

722
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
we're converting this

723
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,320
from kilometers to

724
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,400
meters by multiplying

725
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,280
it by a thousand. Okay.

726
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,440
Now, we also want the

727
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
gravitational constant

728
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,920
now. This is not

729
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,080
negative nine point eight.

730
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,640
That's the acceleration

731
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,560
of gravity. I actually

732
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,240
yeah, I think it's

733
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,960
the acceleration of

734
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,040
gravity. I might be

735
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
messing that up, but

736
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,160
it's something to do

737
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,800
with gravity, but the

738
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,120
gravitational constant

739
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,640
is used in finding the

740
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,600
force of attraction

741
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,640
between objects, which

742
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,520
is what we want to do.

743
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,280
And G is different than

744
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
the regular gravity one.

745
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,480
It is six point six seven

746
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
and actually is four

747
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
point two eight either

748
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,520
the negative eleven.

749
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,400
Okay. That's great. My

750
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
autocomplete is working

751
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,000
very well there. Nice.

752
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,240
Now, the last two

753
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,160
things we want here is

754
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
a scale. Since we're

755
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,320
actually going to be

756
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,400
simulating the real

757
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,960
values here for the

758
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,320
orbits, we can't draw

759
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
them at the position

760
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
that we have them at.

761
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,200
I know that's probably

762
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,280
a confusing line, but

763
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,720
the idea is if our

764
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
planet is moving at,

765
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,040
you know, something

766
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,080
kilometers per second,

767
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
seven kilometers per

768
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,280
second, 29 kilometers

769
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,400
per second, I can't

770
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
draw my planet at a

771
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
million kilometers in

772
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,160
my pie game window.

773
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
I need to draw it in

774
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
a kind of appropriate

775
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,560
scale, right? So I'm

776
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
going to have to figure

777
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
out what one meter

778
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,720
represents in terms of

779
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
pixels in my pie game

780
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
scale here, because I'm

781
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
only working with 800

782
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
pixels high and 800

783
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,680
pixels wide. Hopefully

784
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
this is making a little

785
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
bit of sense. What I'm

786
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,280
going to do here is say

787
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,480
250 divided by A.U. is

788
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,680
the scale. Now, this

789
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
scale essentially says

790
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,840
that one astronomical

791
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,680
unit is going to be

792
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,120
about 100 pixels in my

793
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
pie game program. You

794
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,400
can look at the math to

795
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,040
figure out how that

796
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,120
works. But for now, I'll

797
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,920
leave a comment. We're

798
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,640
going to say one A.U. is

799
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
equal to 100 pixels.

800
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
OK, that's kind of the

801
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,840
scale that we're going

802
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
with here. So we can

803
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,760
draw things to scale in

804
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,200
the window. And then the

805
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,840
last thing I want is the

806
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,520
time step. And this is

807
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,120
going to represent how

808
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,720
much of time I want to

809
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,480
represent in my

810
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
simulation or that I

811
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,360
want to simulate is

812
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
being a lapse. So the

813
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
idea here is every time

814
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,720
I update the frame, I'm

815
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,320
going to pass a certain

816
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
time step and say, OK, I

817
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
want to look at one hour

818
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
of this planet's movement

819
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,040
at a time or one day of

820
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
this planet's movement at

821
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,520
a time, because I don't

822
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,120
want to look at one

823
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,720
second. It's going to

824
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,520
take a really, really

825
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,680
long time to simulate.

826
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Instead, I want to look

827
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,800
at a larger time step.

828
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,800
So what I'm going to do

829
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,440
is say 3600, which is

830
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,920
the number of seconds in

831
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,160
a what is this in an

832
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,080
hour? Yeah, I think

833
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,960
this number of seconds

834
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,280
in an hour. And then I'm

835
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
going to multiply this

836
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
by 24. And that's going

837
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,280
to give me one day. OK,

838
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,360
so this is representing

839
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
one day. I think that's

840
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,680
correct. Yeah, OK, I'm

841
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
pretty certain that is

842
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,600
correct. This would be

843
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
the number of seconds in

844
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,280
an hour, right? If you

845
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,600
go 60 times 60, I think

846
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
that gives you 3600.

847
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,080
And then multiply that by

848
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,240
24. And that is the

849
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
time step that we're

850
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
going to be doing the

851
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,400
simulation on. So kind

852
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,320
of one day at a time

853
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,080
will be updating the

854
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,640
planet. All right.

855
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,560
Hopefully I'm not

856
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
confusing you guys too

857
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,200
much. I do understand

858
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,800
this is a lot. We've

859
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,280
got to go through a

860
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,080
bunch of physics and

861
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,920
stuff here to make this

862
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,160
work. But there you go.

863
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,160
That is a planet. Now,

864
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,960
the next thing I want to

865
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,120
do is implement a draw

866
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
method. Now, this draw

867
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,880
method just going to

868
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
draw the planet on the

869
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
screen. So what I'm

870
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,640
going to do is say

871
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,880
self and I'm going to

872
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
take a window that I

873
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,640
need to draw this

874
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
planet on. So the X and Y

875
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,720
for my planet, as well

876
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
as the X velocity and

877
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,920
the Y velocity for my

878
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,040
planet is going to be

879
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
in meters. So the

880
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
number of meters that

881
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,520
I am away from the sun,

882
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,640
that's what X and Y is

883
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,880
going to represent. So

884
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,760
I need to take those

885
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,280
values and then draw

886
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,600
them to scale, right?

887
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,320
Because I again, I

888
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,440
can't draw like

889
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
something million

890
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,560
kilometers or million

891
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,640
meters away. I need to

892
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,520
draw it in accurate

893
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
scale in pie game. So

894
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,480
this is where the

895
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,360
scale is going to come

896
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,320
in. I'm going to say

897
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,160
that my X is equal to

898
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,960
and then this is

899
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,880
going to be the self

900
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,080
dot X multiplied by

901
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
my scale. OK, so it's

902
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,800
going to be self

903
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
dot scale and self

904
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,720
that scale is going to

905
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,440
be a really, really

906
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,400
tiny number that will

907
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,360
now take this number

908
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,200
and bring it to scale.

909
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,360
And I'm going to say

910
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,440
Y is equal to self

911
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,720
dot Y and I'm going to

912
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,280
multiply that by self

913
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
dot scale. OK, nice.

914
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,960
Now, one other thing

915
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I need to do is make

916
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,760
sure that I'm drawing

917
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,480
all of this in the

918
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,040
center of my screen

919
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,920
because I haven't

920
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,760
mentioned yet when

921
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,520
we're talking about

922
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,200
pie game, zero, zero

923
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,080
is actually the top

924
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,920
left hand corner.

925
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,320
So let me just

926
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,920
quickly open the

927
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,280
window here, right

928
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
here where my mouse is.

929
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,360
So top left hand corner.

930
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,400
This is zero, zero.

931
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,720
If I go all the way

932
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,840
to the right, this would

933
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,280
be eight hundred zero.

934
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,160
If I go all the way

935
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,800
to the bottom right

936
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,480
hand corner, this would

937
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
be eight hundred, eight

938
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,600
hundred. So rather than

939
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,640
having zero zero in the

940
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,320
middle, which you might

941
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,960
be used to, it's the

942
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,280
top left. So I don't

943
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,080
want to draw my stuff

944
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,800
in the top left.

945
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
I want to draw it in

946
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,800
the center. So that

947
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,720
means I need to take

948
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,920
every single value I

949
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,560
have. I need to offset

950
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,400
it by the center of

951
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,680
the screen so that we

952
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,760
draw stuff in the

953
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,920
middle. Hopefully that

954
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
makes a tiny bit of

955
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,280
sense. But the way we

956
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,920
do this is we say plus

957
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,080
and then this is going

958
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,240
to be width over two,

959
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,600
and then this is going

960
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
to be plus. And then

961
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,200
this is going to be

962
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
height over two. And

963
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,200
those values are

964
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,960
right here. OK, so the

965
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,600
width and the height.

966
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
We could just write

967
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
four hundred, but I'm

968
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
going to do width and

969
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,240
height. So that if we

970
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,960
change the width and

971
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,520
the height, this is

972
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,240
going to update

973
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,920
automatically. OK, so

974
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,080
now we have our X and Y

975
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,120
and now I can actually

976
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,920
draw this onto the

977
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,440
screen. So I'm going to

978
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,800
say pie game dot draw

979
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,040
dot circle. And I'm

980
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,680
going to pass the

981
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,760
window, which is where

982
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,520
we want to draw this

983
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,480
circle. I'm going to

984
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,680
pass the color that I

985
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
want to draw the

986
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
circle in. So this is

987
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,080
going to be self

988
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,520
color. I'm going to

989
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,600
pass the position that

990
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,280
I want to draw it in,

991
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,920
which is going to be

992
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,880
X, Y. That's the

993
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,040
center of the circle.

994
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
And then lastly, I'm

995
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,720
going to pass the

996
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
radius. So self dot

997
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,120
radius. OK, so now

998
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,560
we're actually going

999
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
to draw the circle on

1000
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,480
the screen when we

1001
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
call this draw method.

1002
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
OK, hopefully this is

1003
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,320
all making a bit of

1004
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,400
sense. And let's now

1005
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,440
go and actually draw a

1006
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,840
few planets and

1007
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,640
initialize some of

1008
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,000
their constants. So the

1009
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,800
first planet we probably

1010
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,400
want to draw is the

1011
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,040
sun. Can you call the

1012
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,960
sun a planet? I guess

1013
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,520
it's a star. Again, not

1014
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
a big physics guy, but

1015
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,320
the first thing we

1016
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
want to draw is the

1017
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
sun. OK, so I'm going

1018
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,120
to say sun is equal to

1019
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,560
planet. And we're

1020
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,160
going to pass zero, zero

1021
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,440
for its X, Y. OK, so

1022
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,360
zero, zero right here

1023
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
for the radius of the

1024
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,880
sun. We can kind of

1025
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
pick whatever value we

1026
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,160
want here. We're just

1027
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,720
going to be kind of

1028
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,560
randomly picking the

1029
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,920
radius is based on

1030
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,040
the relative mass of

1031
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
the planets. So we

1032
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
want the sun to be the

1033
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,760
biggest. And what I

1034
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,480
have in my other

1035
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
program here is 30 for

1036
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
the radius. So we'll go

1037
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,920
with that. And for the

1038
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,840
color, I want this to

1039
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,960
be yellow. So just

1040
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
make this a bit easier

1041
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,920
to read. I'm going to

1042
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160
define yellow up here

1043
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,800
and yellow. Actually,

1044
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,600
how do you even make

1045
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,640
yellow? Let's look at

1046
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,520
this. Yellow is going

1047
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
to be 255, 255 and

1048
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,800
zero. OK, so that's

1049
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,880
the RGB value for

1050
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,960
yellow. Obviously,

1051
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,560
that's the color we

1052
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,760
want the sun. So let's

1053
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,440
now put the color as

1054
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
yellow. And then the

1055
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
last thing we need to

1056
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,960
pass is the mass and

1057
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,760
the mass. I need to

1058
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,680
look at my cheat sheet

1059
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,160
here because,

1060
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,920
unfortunately, I don't

1061
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
have this memorized

1062
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,880
is going to be the

1063
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,520
following. Let me

1064
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,560
paste this in 1.9 8 8 9

1065
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
2 times 10 to the

1066
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,440
exponent 30. And in

1067
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
case you're wondering

1068
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
this is in kilograms.

1069
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,640
Again, we're going to

1070
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,920
use the accurate masses

1071
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,360
on astronomical units

1072
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,160
and stuff for all of

1073
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,400
these planets. OK, so

1074
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,240
that is the sun. And

1075
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,080
for the sun, we're just

1076
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,960
going to say sun dot

1077
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,760
sun is equal to true.

1078
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,920
Because remember, we

1079
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,840
have this property

1080
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
here that says sun. And

1081
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,720
we're going to make

1082
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
this true so that we

1083
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,920
don't draw the distance

1084
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,040
to the sun from the

1085
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,840
sun and we don't draw

1086
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
the orbit for the sun,

1087
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,240
which we don't need.

1088
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,120
OK, so now that we

1089
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,840
have this, let's just

1090
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,600
see if we can draw this

1091
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,040
on the screen. So

1092
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,080
let's go. Planets is

1093
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,880
equal to and let's

1094
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,680
make a list of all of

1095
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,320
the planets, because

1096
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,760
we're going to add a

1097
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
few more. And then

1098
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
inside of our loop

1099
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,960
here, we're going to

1100
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,480
say for planet in

1101
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,560
planets. And we're

1102
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,320
going to say planet

1103
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,280
dot draw. And we're

1104
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,800
going to pass the

1105
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,520
window that we want to

1106
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
draw it on, which is

1107
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,160
win in all capitals.

1108
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,880
OK. Nice. And we

1109
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,520
also need to make sure

1110
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,160
that we're updating

1111
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,960
this place. So let's

1112
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,680
steal this here. And

1113
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
let's put it down

1114
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,400
there. OK. Nice. So

1115
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,120
we're saying for planet

1116
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
and planet plan to draw

1117
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
by game display

1118
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,640
dot update. Let's see

1119
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,800
if this works. Fingers

1120
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,600
crossed. Let's run the

1121
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,760
code. OK. There we go.

1122
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,600
We get a sun in the

1123
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
middle of the screen.

1124
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
Very nice. That is

1125
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,520
exactly what we want.

1126
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,200
All right. Now, the

1127
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,920
next thing we want to

1128
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,800
do is draw a few more

1129
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,080
plans, right? So let's

1130
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,360
create earth, mercury,

1131
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,600
all of those. OK. So

1132
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,000
we're going to start

1133
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,720
with earth. I'm going

1134
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,640
to say earth is equal

1135
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,320
to planet. Now, the

1136
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,040
earth is actually

1137
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
going to be negative

1138
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,080
one multiplied by

1139
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
planet with an all

1140
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,360
capital dot a U. This

1141
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,840
is going to be the

1142
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,080
distance from the sun.

1143
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,560
So we're going to put

1144
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,480
that as the X

1145
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,920
coordinate. And for the

1146
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,640
Y coordinate, we're

1147
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,200
just going to make it

1148
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,160
zero for right now.

1149
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,840
The color of the earth

1150
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,800
is going to be blue.

1151
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
We'll write that RGB

1152
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,360
variable in a second.

1153
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,760
And then the mass of

1154
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,560
the earth. Actually,

1155
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,120
sorry, we need the

1156
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,000
radius as well. Let's

1157
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,760
put the radius first.

1158
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,400
What was the radius

1159
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,920
of the earth? I had

1160
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,800
60 in here as the

1161
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
radius. And then the

1162
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,280
mass of the earth is

1163
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,840
this number. Let me

1164
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,600
copy it in 5.9742

1165
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,040
times 10 to the

1166
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,680
exponent 24. OK. That's

1167
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,360
a mass of the earth.

1168
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,840
Now, I will actually

1169
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,560
mention here before I

1170
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,600
continue that there

1171
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,840
isn't a great article.

1172
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm going to open it up

1173
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,840
so I can show it to you

1174
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
guys. Let me get it on

1175
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
my Google Chrome here

1176
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,800
that I'm actually

1177
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,960
inspired by making

1178
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,040
this program that has

1179
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,000
all of these values

1180
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
already. So this is

1181
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,840
the article. Leave it

1182
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,920
in the description, but

1183
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,480
it essentially

1184
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,320
implements the same

1185
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,920
thing we're going to

1186
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
implement here in

1187
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,920
turtle. Now, I didn't

1188
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,800
want to do it in turtle

1189
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,560
because pie game is a

1190
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,280
lot better and it's a

1191
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
lot faster. But if you

1192
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,640
look here, all the

1193
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,560
values that I'm using

1194
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,200
are just coming from

1195
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,960
here. Right. So like

1196
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,840
the earth mass, the

1197
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,000
earth distance, negative

1198
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
one times a you, the

1199
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,600
sun mass, just wanted

1200
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,400
to give credit to this

1201
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,320
article. I'll leave it

1202
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,000
in the description.

1203
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,560
Anyways, enough of that.

1204
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,600
We have the distance to

1205
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,520
the sun, which is this.

1206
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,640
We have zero, 16 blue.

1207
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
This is the mass. And I

1208
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,760
think that's all we need

1209
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,880
for the earth right now.

1210
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,520
Let's now put earth

1211
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,640
inside of here and see

1212
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,880
if when we draw it, we

1213
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
get it in an accurate

1214
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
position. OK, so let's

1215
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,920
run this. And we get

1216
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,800
blue is not fine. OK, I

1217
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,400
forgot to do that.

1218
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,240
Let's define the color

1219
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,960
blue. Blue is going to

1220
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,600
be equal to. And then I

1221
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
want kind of a nice

1222
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,120
light blue. So I just

1223
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
picked one of these

1224
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,560
before. It's going to be

1225
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,880
100 149 237. This is

1226
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,040
the RGB value for kind

1227
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
of a lighter blue. If

1228
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,160
you just wanted to be

1229
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,080
regular blue, then you

1230
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,360
could go zero, zero,

1231
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
and then 255. And I

1232
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,720
give you a nice dark

1233
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,080
blue. OK, so let's run

1234
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
this now and see if

1235
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
this works. And there

1236
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,000
we go. We get the the

1237
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
earth, which is, you

1238
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
know, one way from the

1239
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,480
sun. Hopefully that

1240
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,240
makes sense. But this

1241
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,880
is how the scales

1242
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
working. We put it at

1243
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,240
negative one, which

1244
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,800
means we're going to

1245
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,760
the left. If we put at

1246
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,280
one, we would have gone

1247
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
to the right. Doesn't

1248
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,000
really matter where we

1249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,760
started. And there we

1250
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,160
go. OK, so now we have

1251
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
the earth, the next

1252
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
planet that I want to

1253
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
do. Let's look here is

1254
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
going to be Mars. So

1255
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,600
let's say Mars is equal

1256
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,520
to a planet. Now, the

1257
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
distance for Mars is

1258
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,280
going to be this. Let

1259
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,120
me just copy it in.

1260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,840
It's going to be negative

1261
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
one point five to four

1262
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,400
times planet.au. Again,

1263
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,960
we're going to put its

1264
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Y coordinate at zero.

1265
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,880
The radius of Mars,

1266
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,160
it's much smaller than

1267
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,680
Earth. We're going to

1268
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,760
go with 12. It's going

1269
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,640
to be red, which I'll

1270
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,120
define in a second. And

1271
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
then the mass of Mars

1272
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,040
is a little bit less

1273
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,960
than Earth as well. So

1274
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,800
that's going to be six

1275
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,880
point three nine times

1276
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,920
10 to the exponent

1277
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,400
twenty three. Now, for

1278
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,680
red, we need to define

1279
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,840
this. Now, again, I

1280
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,720
want to kind of a nice

1281
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
looking red. So I

1282
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
picked a custom RGB

1283
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,760
value here, and this

1284
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,640
value is going to be

1285
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,920
one eighty eight thirty

1286
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,080
nine and fifty. OK. And

1287
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
now we have Mars. So

1288
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,800
now that we have Mars,

1289
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,600
we're going to put Mars

1290
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
inside of here, and we

1291
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
should now draw Mars

1292
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,040
at the appropriate

1293
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,000
scale. So let's look

1294
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,560
at this and we see the

1295
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Mars over here. So

1296
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
notice that Mars is

1297
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,320
kind of right by the

1298
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,760
border. I'm fine with

1299
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
that. But if you wanted

1300
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
to move everything in

1301
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,600
closer, then what you

1302
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,960
would do is reduce

1303
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
this number right here.

1304
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,800
So rather than doing

1305
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
250, you would do

1306
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
something like 200. And

1307
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,280
you're going to notice

1308
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,120
this is going to move

1309
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,800
us in a little bit

1310
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,720
closer. So that's kind

1311
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,400
of how you can mess

1312
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,640
with things. Just make

1313
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,240
the number here

1314
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,400
smaller. If you want

1315
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,960
everything to get

1316
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,840
closer to the sun. OK,

1317
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,800
so we'll go to 50

1318
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,520
AU for now. All right.

1319
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,400
So now we have Mars.

1320
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,480
Let's do our other

1321
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,800
planets. So the other

1322
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
planets we have is

1323
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,360
Mercury. This is going

1324
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
to be equal to planet

1325
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,280
this distance.

1326
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
This is the closest

1327
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,720
one to the sun.

1328
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
My understanding is at

1329
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,680
least this is going to

1330
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,880
be zero. We're going

1331
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,680
to have to make this

1332
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,440
smaller. So we're going

1333
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
to go to zero. The

1334
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,440
color is going to be

1335
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,280
dark gray, which

1336
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,120
will implement in the

1337
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
second. And then the

1338
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,880
mass. Let me just

1339
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,320
copy this in is going

1340
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,160
to be 0.3 30 times

1341
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,720
10 to the exponent 24.

1342
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,480
If you wanted to be

1343
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
consistent, we could go

1344
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,240
3.3 times 10 to the

1345
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
exponent 23. That

1346
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,560
gives us the same thing.

1347
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,560
OK, so let's implement

1348
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,080
dark gray now. So let's

1349
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,320
go up to colors.

1350
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Dark gray is equal to

1351
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
and then what did I

1352
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
have dark gray at?

1353
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,960
Let me just look here.

1354
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,000
This is going to be 80 71.

1355
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,520
No, 78 and 81.

1356
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,920
Getting a mess with these

1357
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,600
colors. If you want,

1358
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,320
I'm just picking some

1359
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,200
custom ones that look

1360
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,840
a little bit nicer.

1361
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,040
OK, so now we have

1362
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Mercury. So let's put

1363
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,360
Mercury in here and we

1364
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,400
can just go right on

1365
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,600
to Venus, which I

1366
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,800
believe is next planet.

1367
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,560
So we're going to say

1368
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
Venus is equal to

1369
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,960
planet. It's distance

1370
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,320
is going to be 0.7 to

1371
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,760
3 times planet.au.

1372
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,920
In case you're wondering

1373
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
planet.au is referencing

1374
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,440
this right here, just

1375
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,240
because it's inside of

1376
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
the planet class. OK,

1377
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,520
so planet.au, we're going

1378
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,920
to have zero. This is

1379
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
a little bit larger.

1380
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,080
So we're going to have a

1381
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
14. The color of this

1382
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
will just be a regular

1383
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,560
white. And then the mass

1384
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,480
is going to be this.

1385
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,320
Let me copy it in 4.8685

1386
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,560
times 10 to the exponent

1387
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,200
of 24. OK, let me zoom

1388
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,920
in so you guys can read

1389
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
that a little bit better.

1390
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Let's now put Venus in

1391
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,280
the list. And let me go

1392
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
ahead and run this and

1393
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,040
see if we're getting all

1394
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,760
of our plants. OK, nice.

1395
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,480
So there we go. And I've

1396
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,200
just put the plants on

1397
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
different sides. Again,

1398
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,080
you can kind of put put

1399
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,800
them wherever you want.

1400
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,440
Doesn't really matter.

1401
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
We could put them all in

1402
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,080
the same side and have

1403
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,200
them move at the same time.

1404
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm just staggering them a

1405
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,040
bit. Maybe some of you

1406
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
will have issue with that

1407
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,920
based on your physics

1408
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
knowledge. This is what

1409
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,880
we're going to do for

1410
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
right now. OK, there we

1411
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,040
go. We have all of our

1412
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,400
plants. So now that we

1413
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,440
have all of our planets,

1414
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,760
the next thing we need to

1415
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,840
do is start moving them.

1416
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,240
Now, moving them is

1417
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
complicated. But again,

1418
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
as I mentioned, we're

1419
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,040
going to be moving them

1420
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,440
by their X velocity and

1421
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
their Y velocity. But we

1422
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
need to determine what

1423
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,080
those velocities are.

1424
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,160
And those velocities are

1425
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,280
determined by the force

1426
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,760
of attraction. So

1427
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,600
essentially the force of

1428
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,760
gravity between the

1429
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,960
different planets. All

1430
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,480
right. So I'm going to

1431
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,720
start explaining the math

1432
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,600
that's going to go on here

1433
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,560
to actually move the

1434
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,200
planets around the sun.

1435
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
And before I can do that,

1436
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,280
I just want to give you a

1437
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,600
general understanding of

1438
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,320
gravity and how planets

1439
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,400
actually orbit around the

1440
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,080
sun, in case you're

1441
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,840
unfamiliar. So the reason

1442
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,320
why when we jump up, we

1443
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,080
fall down. And when we

1444
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,240
throw a ball up, it comes

1445
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,480
down is because of gravity.

1446
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
Now, we all know gravity,

1447
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,600
but gravity is relative

1448
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
to different objects. OK.

1449
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,480
So all objects are

1450
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,600
actually attracting one

1451
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
another. And the force of

1452
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,880
attraction that they have

1453
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,080
on one another is based

1454
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,320
on the mass of those

1455
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
objects. Now, this only

1456
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,080
really becomes relevant

1457
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,200
when you have very, very

1458
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
massive objects like

1459
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
planets. So when we're

1460
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,560
talking about something

1461
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,160
like Earth, this a massive

1462
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
body, right? Is something

1463
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
like, you know, six to six

1464
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,440
multiplied by 10 to the

1465
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
exponent, 24 kilograms

1466
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,960
or whatever the number is.

1467
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,200
It's a very, very massive

1468
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880
body. So relative to our

1469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,080
mass, which is maybe 60

1470
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
kilograms, 70 kilograms,

1471
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,440
80 kilograms, whatever it

1472
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,320
is, it's way, way larger.

1473
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
So it actually exerts a

1474
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,240
massive force on us that

1475
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,560
pulls us downwards

1476
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,280
towards the earth. Now,

1477
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,560
what actually determines

1478
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,680
the strength of this force

1479
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,360
is the distance from us

1480
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,960
to the center of the earth.

1481
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,120
Hence why when you go up

1482
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,160
in space, you have zero

1483
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,920
gravity because you're

1484
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
much further away from

1485
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,400
the earth. Now, all objects

1486
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,920
again, exert forces on

1487
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,600
each other. And those

1488
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,680
forces depend on the two

1489
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,920
masses of the objects, as

1490
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,120
well as the distance of

1491
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,240
the objects. But if you're

1492
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
just naively looking at

1493
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
this equation here, which

1494
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,200
is actually the force of

1495
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,440
attraction, you'll see

1496
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,760
that the distance between

1497
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,560
the center of the two

1498
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,920
objects is the most

1499
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,120
important when it comes

1500
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
to what type of the force,

1501
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,160
what type of force you're

1502
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,080
going to get, because it's

1503
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,560
R squared. So the further

1504
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
away you go, exponentially,

1505
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,520
the less gravity you're

1506
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,600
going to have the closer

1507
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
you get exponentially,

1508
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,840
the more gravity you're

1509
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,800
going to get. Now, again,

1510
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I'm not a physics major,

1511
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,840
so take everything with a

1512
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,680
grain of salt here.

1513
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,560
That's the basic

1514
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,720
understanding of gravity.

1515
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,840
Now, when we're talking

1516
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,800
about planets, we're

1517
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,320
talking about multiple

1518
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,320
massive objects that

1519
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
are moving around each

1520
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,840
other. So when we talk

1521
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,880
about an object like

1522
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
earth here, right? The

1523
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,480
earth is moving at a

1524
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
constant velocity. Well,

1525
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,920
not necessarily constant,

1526
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
but it's moving at a

1527
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,000
relatively constant

1528
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
velocity around the sun.

1529
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,680
Now, what forces it to

1530
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,520
move around the sun is

1531
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
gravity. So the earth is

1532
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,240
already on a trajectory

1533
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,040
moving in the x direction.

1534
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,400
OK, so it has some speed

1535
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,680
going in the x direction.

1536
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,360
And then there is a force

1537
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,000
pulling it towards the sun.

1538
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,760
That force is gravity or

1539
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
the attraction between

1540
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,040
the earth and the sun.

1541
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,120
Now, the reason why

1542
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,440
there's an attraction is

1543
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,840
because the sun is much,

1544
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,040
much larger than the earth.

1545
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,200
If the earth was larger

1546
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,920
than the sun, then the

1547
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,760
sun would be orbiting

1548
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,160
around it. Great example.

1549
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,120
If you think of the moon,

1550
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,040
right, the moon is much

1551
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,800
smaller than the earth.

1552
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,840
It's very close to the

1553
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,080
earth. And so it orbits

1554
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
around the earth.

1555
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,480
OK, hopefully this is

1556
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,280
making a little bit of

1557
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,640
sense. But the idea is

1558
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,840
that you have some force

1559
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
and that force,

1560
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,040
essentially, is causing

1561
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,120
the earth to move around

1562
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,200
the sun. And the reason

1563
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,080
why the earth doesn't just

1564
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,640
shoot directly towards

1565
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,480
the sun, like we shoot

1566
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,680
directly down on earth

1567
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
when we jump up is

1568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,760
because it already has

1569
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,800
momentum moving in

1570
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,600
another direction.

1571
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,880
And so there's multiple

1572
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,840
forces affecting it,

1573
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,160
causing it to go in an

1574
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,240
orbit. Again, very

1575
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,360
simplified explanation

1576
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,080
of what's going on.

1577
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,200
But hopefully that makes

1578
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,240
a bit of sense. Now, the

1579
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,160
reason I'm saying this

1580
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,080
is because we have

1581
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,360
multiple planets that

1582
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,120
are orbiting around

1583
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,680
the earth, right?

1584
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,520
Maybe we have another

1585
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
planet. I know I

1586
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,240
probably shouldn't have

1587
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
drawn it in blue.

1588
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
But the point is there's

1589
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,160
a distance between

1590
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,080
these two planets, and

1591
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,040
they also have a force

1592
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,920
of attraction on each

1593
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
other. And that's why

1594
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,520
you're going to have

1595
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,880
different orbits and

1596
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,560
different speeds based

1597
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
on the location of

1598
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,440
other planets and kind

1599
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,240
of their orbital

1600
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,600
trajectory. So if you

1601
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,760
have two planets here,

1602
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
as well as a planet

1603
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
here, well, this guy's

1604
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,560
still orbiting around

1605
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,200
the sun, because the

1606
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
sun is much larger

1607
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,240
than him, but he's going

1608
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
to be orbiting slower

1609
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
than the earth is

1610
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
because he's not as

1611
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,800
close. However, the

1612
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,520
earth is going to be

1613
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,720
attracting or having

1614
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,360
some force of

1615
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,160
attraction on this

1616
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
planet, and this

1617
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,680
planet is going to have

1618
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,800
some force of attraction

1619
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,000
on the earth. And so

1620
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,360
you need to take that

1621
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,040
into account when

1622
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,640
you're actually

1623
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,240
calculating the

1624
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,120
different orbits of

1625
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,760
the planets. All right.

1626
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,760
I know this is a lot.

1627
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,400
Very, very math and

1628
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,600
physics has heavy here,

1629
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,680
but the idea is every

1630
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
single object exhibits

1631
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,840
some force on each

1632
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
other. And we need to

1633
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,680
calculate what all of

1634
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,000
those forces are when

1635
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,840
we are actually

1636
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,000
determining the orbit

1637
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
so that we are going

1638
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,880
to be orbiting

1639
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,000
appropriate to where

1640
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,960
the other planets are.

1641
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,640
So we can't just

1642
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,400
calculate the force

1643
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
to the sun. We need to

1644
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
also calculate the

1645
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
force to the other

1646
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,000
planets, and that's

1647
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,520
going to give us a

1648
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,320
somewhat elliptical

1649
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,160
orbit as well. OK.

1650
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Hopefully this makes a

1651
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,600
little bit of sense.

1652
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,400
Now let's talk about

1653
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,760
how we actually do

1654
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,080
this. So as I kind

1655
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
of already hinted at,

1656
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
if you look to the

1657
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,400
left of my screen,

1658
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,600
you can see that I

1659
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
have the equation here

1660
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,080
for the force of

1661
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,960
attraction between

1662
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,600
two objects. Now, this

1663
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,400
force is the

1664
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,640
straight line force

1665
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
between two objects.

1666
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,320
So let me just move

1667
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
the earth a bit here.

1668
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,600
So I can explain kind

1669
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,440
of what I mean by that

1670
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
and why we need to do

1671
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,680
a little bit of

1672
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,280
trigonometry. So let's

1673
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,120
say we have the earth

1674
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,400
over here. This will

1675
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,880
say is the force of

1676
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,680
gravity or the force

1677
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
of attraction between

1678
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,240
the two objects. Now

1679
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
to calculate this is

1680
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
fairly simple. We just

1681
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,400
need to first calculate

1682
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,280
the distance between

1683
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,160
the two objects, which

1684
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,840
we can do. We then

1685
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,600
need to know the masses,

1686
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,320
which we already know

1687
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,920
and the gravitational

1688
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
constant, which we know

1689
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
as well. So let's say

1690
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,440
we know the force.

1691
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,400
Well, if we know the

1692
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,360
force, the issue is

1693
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,040
it's giving us the

1694
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,440
straight line force.

1695
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
We want to break this

1696
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,920
force into two

1697
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,400
components so that we

1698
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,920
are able to move the

1699
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,720
earth in an X direction,

1700
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,640
as well as a Y direction.

1701
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,800
So we need to kind of

1702
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,680
understand this, that

1703
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,360
it's giving us the

1704
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,240
straight line force.

1705
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
We need to break that

1706
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,600
force into X and Y

1707
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,840
components so we can

1708
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,160
actually move the earth

1709
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
around the sun in both

1710
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
the X and the Y

1711
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,720
direction. Now, this is

1712
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,400
the same way that we're

1713
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,200
going to calculate the

1714
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,720
distance. It's very

1715
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,640
easy for us to actually

1716
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,440
find the distance

1717
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,640
because we're looking

1718
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,440
for. Let me just

1719
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
redraw all of this,

1720
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,600
this right here. So

1721
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,120
this is going to be

1722
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
R. We don't know what

1723
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,800
R is, but we know what

1724
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,280
the Y distances and

1725
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,680
the X distance distances

1726
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,800
between these two points

1727
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,480
because for both these

1728
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,760
points, we have an X and

1729
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
a Y, right? So we have

1730
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,360
like X two and Y two.

1731
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,320
So if we know both of

1732
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
those points, we can

1733
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
calculate the difference

1734
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,560
in X and the difference

1735
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,600
in Y. And then to

1736
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
figure out what R is

1737
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,760
relative to our right

1738
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,080
triangle here, what

1739
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,920
equation do we use?

1740
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,840
Well, Pythagorean

1741
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,960
theorem. I know I

1742
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,800
completely butchered

1743
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
that that name, but

1744
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,280
it's going to be X squared

1745
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,560
plus Y squared. Take the

1746
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,680
root of that and that's

1747
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
going to give us R. OK,

1748
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,880
so we are able to

1749
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,840
calculate R. Then

1750
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,480
obviously we can take

1751
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,920
the square. So once we

1752
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,840
do that, we calculate

1753
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,680
the distance, then

1754
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,400
we're going to calculate

1755
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,360
the force and then we

1756
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:46,960
need to go in the

1757
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,080
opposite direction

1758
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,840
from the force back

1759
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
to the X and Y components.

1760
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,760
OK, so let's redraw this.

1761
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,000
So now let's say we know

1762
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,880
the force. OK. And again,

1763
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,760
we need to split this

1764
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,600
into X and Y. So we

1765
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
need to have, I guess,

1766
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,680
F X and F Y. Now, the

1767
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,600
way that we do this is

1768
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,440
we need to calculate

1769
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
the angle here, because

1770
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,960
if we have any two

1771
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,040
aspects of a triangle,

1772
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,840
so if we have one

1773
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
side length and an

1774
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,920
angle and it's a right

1775
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,080
angle triangle, we can

1776
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,920
calculate any other

1777
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
angle or any other

1778
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,760
side length, right?

1779
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,520
That's just a property

1780
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,280
of a right triangle.

1781
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,600
So we know F and we

1782
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,640
should know this angle.

1783
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,440
And the reason we know

1784
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,320
this angle is because

1785
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,720
we know X and we know

1786
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,040
why. So the way we

1787
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,680
calculate this angle is

1788
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,000
we take the arc tangent,

1789
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,880
so the tan inverse of

1790
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,200
Y over X. Now, to

1791
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,400
derive why this is

1792
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,120
going to give us the

1793
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,600
angle, theta, let's

1794
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,960
look at the equation

1795
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,080
of tan of theta is

1796
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,000
equal to. And then

1797
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,520
this is going to be

1798
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
the opposite over the

1799
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,240
adjacent. Now, I like

1800
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
to remember this as

1801
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,440
Toa. OK, but this is

1802
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
the equation. You know,

1803
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,840
this is a property of a

1804
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,160
right triangle. So if I

1805
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,560
have tan theta is equal

1806
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,400
to the opposite over

1807
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,120
the adjacent, and

1808
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,720
we're talking about

1809
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,880
this right here, the

1810
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,960
opposite side length is

1811
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,520
why the adjacent side

1812
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,560
length is X. And so we

1813
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,280
can kind of sub those

1814
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,480
values in, right? And we

1815
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,800
get Y and X. If we want

1816
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,080
to isolate for theta, we

1817
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
need to take the inverse

1818
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,040
tangent. So that's what

1819
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
we do. We take tan inverse

1820
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,920
of Y over X. That gives

1821
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,320
us theta. OK, so now

1822
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,400
that we know theta, we

1823
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,520
can now use theta to

1824
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,680
calculate what the F force

1825
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
component is or the X

1826
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,640
force component is as

1827
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,600
well as the Y force

1828
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,320
component. So to do

1829
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
that, we need to use

1830
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,120
some other properties.

1831
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,720
So we have a property.

1832
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,320
It is so let me write

1833
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,920
this property. So

1834
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
katoa, this is the way

1835
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,560
that I always remember

1836
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,280
these, but we can say

1837
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,680
that the sign of theta

1838
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,720
is equal to the

1839
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,080
opposite over the

1840
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,320
hypotenuse. And since

1841
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,960
we're looking for the

1842
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,520
opposite, which is F Y,

1843
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
we can say sign of the

1844
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,120
angle theta, which we

1845
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,800
know is equal to the F

1846
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,920
of Y over H. H is F.

1847
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,120
We know F and we're

1848
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
able to find what F of

1849
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,440
Y is by just isolating

1850
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,680
for F of Y. So multiplying

1851
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,360
F by sine theta. And

1852
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,280
then same thing. If we

1853
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,480
want to find what F X

1854
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,200
is, we can say F X is

1855
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,440
equal to this is going

1856
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,040
to be the coast of theta

1857
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,720
multiplied by F. That

1858
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,640
will give us the F X

1859
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,880
component. And then once

1860
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,840
we know the X and Y

1861
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,880
velocity, we can very

1862
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
easily move this around

1863
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,480
the sun. All right.

1864
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,280
Math lesson is now

1865
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,120
over. Hopefully I

1866
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,360
didn't confuse you too

1867
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,560
badly. Again, I'm trying

1868
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,480
to squeeze in what is

1869
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,640
probably taught an entire

1870
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,560
year of grade 12 physics

1871
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,360
in about 10 minutes. But

1872
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
that is the math that

1873
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
we need to understand to

1874
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,400
be able to move these

1875
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
objects around. Can't

1876
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,320
really make it much

1877
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,240
simpler than that. If

1878
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,840
you don't understand

1879
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
basic trigonometry,

1880
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
then I'm sure this was

1881
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,160
a lot, but you can

1882
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,920
kind of just trust the

1883
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,960
properties that I showed

1884
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,840
you here and I will

1885
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,400
show you how to

1886
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
implement them in code.

1887
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,240
You don't understand

1888
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,120
totally fine. You can

1889
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
still follow along and

1890
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,920
you will have a working

1891
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,080
simulation. With that

1892
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,320
said, let's go back to

1893
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,200
the code. All right. So

1894
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,680
I'm back in the code and

1895
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,200
it is time to do some

1896
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
math inside of code. Now

1897
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,280
I know we just did a

1898
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,960
lot of math, but now

1899
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,880
we're doing it in code.

1900
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,440
Hopefully that gave

1901
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,160
you an explanation of

1902
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,920
what I'm about to write

1903
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,320
here. So I'm on my

1904
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,680
planet class and I'm

1905
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,280
going to write a

1906
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,240
method that will

1907
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,520
calculate the force of

1908
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
attraction between

1909
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,400
another object and the

1910
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,560
current object. Okay.

1911
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,600
So I'm going to say

1912
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,000
define attraction like

1913
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,880
that. I'm going to

1914
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,040
take in self and I'm

1915
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,600
going to take in an

1916
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,320
other object. Now the

1917
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,960
other is going to be

1918
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,000
another planet. Okay.

1919
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,480
So the first thing I'm

1920
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,640
going to do is say that

1921
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,080
my other underscore X

1922
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
other underscore Y is

1923
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,480
equal to other dot X

1924
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,360
and other dot Y. Okay.

1925
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,880
Now, the first thing we

1926
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,800
need to do here is we

1927
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,680
need to calculate the

1928
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,120
distance between the

1929
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,280
current object and the

1930
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,680
other object. So let's

1931
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,600
do that. We're going to

1932
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
say the distance in X

1933
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
is equal to, and this is

1934
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
going to be the other

1935
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,640
X minus the self dot X.

1936
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
Okay. And then the

1937
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,640
distance in Y is going

1938
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,320
to be equal to the

1939
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,120
other Y minus the

1940
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,360
self dot Y. Now it

1941
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,120
doesn't matter if you

1942
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,160
take the self dot X and

1943
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,000
subtract it from other

1944
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,360
dot X. It doesn't matter

1945
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,080
what way you do it. It's

1946
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,800
going to give us the

1947
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,440
the magnitude, which is

1948
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,800
what we, which is what

1949
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,160
we want. Sorry, because

1950
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,880
once we take the square

1951
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,640
of both these values,

1952
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,000
we're going to get a

1953
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,840
positive value, no

1954
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,480
matter what. So I have

1955
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,200
the distance X and the

1956
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,480
distance Y. Now I'm

1957
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,120
going to say distance is

1958
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,320
equal to, and this is

1959
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,680
going to be the math dot

1960
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,240
sqrt of the distance X

1961
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,160
to the exponent to plus

1962
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,560
the distance Y to the

1963
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
exponent to. Okay. Let

1964
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,520
me just check and make

1965
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,080
sure I haven't messed

1966
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,320
this up yet. Looks

1967
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
good. We have found the

1968
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
distance. Okay. Now the

1969
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,320
first thing I'm going to

1970
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,200
do is I'm going to say

1971
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,880
if the other dot sun,

1972
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,520
then I'm going to say

1973
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,400
the self dot distance to

1974
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,880
sun is equal to distance.

1975
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,360
Now the reason I'm doing

1976
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,560
this is because if the

1977
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,360
other object that we're

1978
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,480
calculating the force of

1979
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,360
attraction with is the

1980
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,840
sun, I just calculated

1981
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,000
the distance to the sun.

1982
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,680
And I just want to

1983
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,720
update the distance to

1984
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,240
sun property here so that

1985
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,360
I can use that when I

1986
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,560
actually want to draw

1987
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
the distance to the sun

1988
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,160
on top of the plan. Again,

1989
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,840
we're just checking is

1990
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,440
the other object, the

1991
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
sun. If it is, okay, we

1992
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,400
know the distance. So

1993
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,320
let's just plug that in

1994
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,440
and save that value

1995
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,840
inside of the class. That

1996
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,240
way we're not

1997
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,320
recalculating it later

1998
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,160
on. We already have the

1999
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,560
value. Okay. So now that

2000
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,320
we've done that, we need

2001
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,480
to calculate the force

2002
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
of attraction. So we're

2003
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,160
going to say the force.

2004
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,840
Yeah. I think it's force

2005
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,520
is going to be equal to

2006
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,320
self dot G. We're going

2007
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,840
to multiply this by

2008
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,280
our self dot mass

2009
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
multiplied by the other

2010
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,240
dot mass. And then we're

2011
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,000
going to divide this by

2012
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
the distance to the

2013
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,240
exponent to why did I

2014
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
write it like that? It's

2015
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,640
going to be distance to

2016
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
the exponent to. And I

2017
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,600
think that's good. Okay.

2018
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,200
Now we don't need to do

2019
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,080
any parentheses because

2020
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,920
these have the same order

2021
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,360
of operations and

2022
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,680
exponent to the exponent

2023
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,480
to is going to happen

2024
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,920
first anyways. Okay. So

2025
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,680
this is how we calculate

2026
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,800
the force. Now remember,

2027
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,080
this is the straight line

2028
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,600
force. We need to break

2029
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,840
this force down into the

2030
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,280
X and to the Y component,

2031
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
which is why we had to do

2032
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
all of that trigonometry.

2033
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,040
So now we need to

2034
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,520
calculate the angle theta.

2035
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,200
So we're going to say

2036
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,520
theta is equal to, and

2037
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,600
then this is going to be

2038
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,360
the math dot arc tangent

2039
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,560
of, and it's actually

2040
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,320
going to be here at the

2041
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,240
distance Y over the

2042
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,280
distance X. Now, the

2043
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,800
reason I'm doing a 10 to

2044
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,680
is because this is a

2045
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,920
special function in

2046
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,160
Python that's going to

2047
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,120
take the Y over the X

2048
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,880
and then give us the

2049
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,040
angle associated with it.

2050
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,360
So make sure you use a 10

2051
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,120
to from the math library.

2052
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,600
If you just use a 10,

2053
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,240
that's not going to work.

2054
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,400
You need a 10 to. Okay.

2055
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
So math dot eight and

2056
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,280
distance X, distance Y.

2057
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,880
Now we know the angle theta.

2058
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,400
Now that we know the angle

2059
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
theta, we can calculate

2060
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,760
the X velocity and the Y

2061
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,200
velocity. So we're going to

2062
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,440
say or sorry, not the X

2063
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,000
velocity, we're going to

2064
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,040
calculate the X force and

2065
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,320
the Y force. So we're

2066
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,520
going to say the force X

2067
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,520
is equal to this is going

2068
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,320
to be math dot cosine

2069
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,760
of theta multiplied

2070
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,080
by the force.

2071
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,880
OK, and then the force

2072
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,280
underscore Y is going to

2073
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,320
be equal to the math dot

2074
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,600
sign of the theta.

2075
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,160
Multiplied by the force.

2076
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,000
OK, and then we're going to

2077
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,960
return from here the force

2078
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,800
X and the force Y.

2079
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
OK, let's break down what we

2080
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,920
did here. I understand this

2081
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,560
is probably a little bit

2082
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,280
confusing still.

2083
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,960
We first calculate the

2084
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
distance between the two

2085
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
objects. There we go.

2086
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,840
We have distance.

2087
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,280
Great. Then what we're

2088
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,120
going to do is determine

2089
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,160
if the other object is the

2090
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,200
sun. If it is, we're just

2091
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,760
going to store that

2092
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,880
distance in a property

2093
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,600
here, because we want to

2094
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,480
know what that value is.

2095
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,960
Now, after that, we want

2096
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,880
to calculate the force of

2097
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,760
attraction. So this is

2098
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,600
the force of attraction

2099
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,120
here. It's F equals M,

2100
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,280
lowercase M over

2101
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
R squared multiplied by

2102
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,920
the gravitational constant

2103
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
G. OK, so that's what

2104
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,720
we're doing. So self that

2105
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,600
G times mass multiplied

2106
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,720
by other mass over

2107
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,000
distance squared.

2108
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,960
OK, then we want to

2109
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,200
break this distance down

2110
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,240
into the two components.

2111
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,640
So the sorry, the force

2112
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,800
into the X force and the

2113
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,480
Y force. So we first need

2114
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,520
to calculate the angle.

2115
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,640
So we say the math, the

2116
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,720
arc tangent to of the

2117
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,960
distance Y over distance

2118
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,360
X gives us the angle

2119
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,480
that we want. Then we're

2120
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,680
going to say the force X

2121
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,600
is equal to the math

2122
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,000
dot cosine of theta

2123
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,880
multiplied by force and

2124
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,160
the force Y is equal to

2125
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,360
the math dot sine theta

2126
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,560
multiplied by the force.

2127
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Now, remember here that

2128
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,920
all of these distances

2129
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,400
and all of these forces

2130
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
are real distances and

2131
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,640
forces. These are

2132
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,880
actually the distances

2133
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,720
and the forces that you

2134
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,800
would see. I mean, it's

2135
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
an approximation in the

2136
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,280
real solar system. So I'm

2137
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,440
not using really small

2138
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,880
pixel values in pi game.

2139
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,320
I'm using massive, you

2140
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,640
know, meter per squared

2141
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,280
kilogram squared values,

2142
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,120
whatever the units are

2143
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,360
of these forces, I'm

2144
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,240
actually using the

2145
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,640
correct numbers, like

2146
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,840
the large two scale

2147
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,000
numbers. I just want to

2148
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,720
make that clear here

2149
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,040
because like if we were

2150
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,320
to print out what X

2151
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,600
were and print out what

2152
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,280
the force were, you

2153
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,320
would see really, really

2154
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,240
massive numbers

2155
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
because that's actually

2156
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,240
what they are in the real

2157
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,120
world because we're trying

2158
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,160
to do a simulation here.

2159
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,280
Okay. Anyway, so we have

2160
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,640
attraction. Now that we

2161
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,160
have the force of

2162
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,280
attraction, what we need

2163
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,440
to do is actually update

2164
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,600
the position of each

2165
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,080
planet based on the

2166
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,960
force of attraction

2167
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,200
between every single

2168
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
other planet, because

2169
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,560
we can't just do it from

2170
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,720
the sun. We need to look

2171
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,680
at all the other planets

2172
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,760
as I was discussing kind

2173
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,440
of in the whiteboard

2174
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,720
section. So what I'm

2175
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,080
going to do is make a

2176
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,960
method here. I'm going

2177
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,640
to say update position.

2178
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,120
And this is going to take

2179
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
in self and planets.

2180
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,160
Okay. So what we're

2181
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,760
going to do is loop

2182
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,360
through all of the

2183
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,520
planets. We're going to

2184
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,440
calculate the force of

2185
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
attraction between the

2186
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,040
current planet and all

2187
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,840
of the other planets.

2188
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,840
We're then going to

2189
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,640
calculate what the

2190
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,480
velocity needs to be

2191
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,240
for these planets. Then

2192
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,920
we're going to move them

2193
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,600
by that velocity. So

2194
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,000
we're going to say the

2195
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,280
total force in the X

2196
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,840
direction is equal to

2197
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,760
the total force in the

2198
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,800
Y direction, which is

2199
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,760
currently equal to zero.

2200
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,800
And we're going to sum

2201
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,720
all of the forces

2202
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,040
together from all of the

2203
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,280
planets. So we're going

2204
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,080
to say for planet in

2205
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,160
planets, we're going to

2206
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
pass a list of plants

2207
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,640
here. That's what we're

2208
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,040
taking in. We're going to

2209
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,360
say if self is equal to

2210
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,080
planet, then continue

2211
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,760
because we don't want to

2212
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,640
calculate the force with

2213
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,080
ourself. In fact, that

2214
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
would just give us a zero

2215
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,680
division error because

2216
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,520
the distance between

2217
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,400
ourself and ourself is

2218
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,600
zero, right? So we can't

2219
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,160
do this division with

2220
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,880
the arch tangent or

2221
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,800
sorry, with the distance

2222
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,400
squared, that would give

2223
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,680
us an issue. Anyways,

2224
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,360
continuing. Now what

2225
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,040
we're going to do is say

2226
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
that the force X force Y

2227
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,320
is equal to, and this is

2228
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,080
going to be the self

2229
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,160
dot attraction to

2230
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,720
this plant. Okay. So

2231
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,560
again, for every single

2232
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,640
planet, we're going to

2233
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,720
calculate the force X and

2234
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,520
the force Y that's

2235
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,840
exerting on this planet.

2236
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,880
We're going to say self

2237
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,000
dot attraction is equal

2238
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,720
to planet. That's what's

2239
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,600
doing the calculation

2240
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,920
here that gives us the FX

2241
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,040
and FY. Now we're just

2242
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,280
going to sum these two

2243
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,160
variables or add to

2244
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,960
these two variables. So

2245
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,800
self that X FX plus

2246
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,560
equals FX and total FY

2247
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,800
plus equals FY. Okay.

2248
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,080
So now that we know what

2249
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
the total forces that's

2250
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,200
being exerted on us and

2251
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,560
the X and the Y direction,

2252
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,480
we need to use these

2253
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,320
forces to actually

2254
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,040
calculate with the

2255
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,240
velocity of the planet's

2256
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,280
going to be. All right.

2257
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
So the way we calculate

2258
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,840
the velocity here is

2259
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,800
we're going to say that

2260
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,200
the self dot X underscore

2261
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,680
Vell is equal to the

2262
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,920
total FX divided by

2263
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,160
the self dot mass

2264
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,480
multiplied by the self

2265
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,760
dots. And then this is

2266
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,720
going to be time step.

2267
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,280
Now, I'm going to explain

2268
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,320
how this works, but this

2269
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,040
is using kind of the

2270
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,760
famous equation F equals

2271
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,960
M a case. We have this

2272
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,120
equation F equals M a

2273
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,360
and this stands for the

2274
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,480
total force is equal to

2275
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,760
the mass divided by

2276
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,360
the acceleration. Now

2277
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,480
you can use this to

2278
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,520
solve for the acceleration,

2279
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,320
which is what we're doing

2280
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,400
here. So we're saying

2281
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,360
the acceleration is equal

2282
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,760
to F over M. So I'm taking

2283
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,960
my total FX and my total

2284
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,080
mass, right? And I'm

2285
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,200
dividing those to get

2286
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,360
the acceleration. Now,

2287
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,120
the thing is I'm going to

2288
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,200
be adding to this. I'm

2289
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,760
saying self that XL plus

2290
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
equals. So the way this

2291
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,960
works is I'm increasing

2292
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,800
my velocity by my

2293
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
acceleration multiplied

2294
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,120
by the time step. Now,

2295
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,880
there's another equation

2296
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,840
that has to do with time

2297
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,640
and acceleration to

2298
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
equal velocity and all

2299
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,440
those kinds of things.

2300
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,920
Anyways, the point is

2301
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
though, since we're

2302
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,960
simulating this over a

2303
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,280
period of time, we're

2304
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,320
going to take the time

2305
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
step, which is right

2306
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,520
here, which is one day

2307
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,240
we're going to multiply

2308
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,960
that by whatever the

2309
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,360
acceleration is. Now,

2310
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,160
we're going to take that

2311
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,680
value and add that to

2312
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,280
the current velocity. Now,

2313
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,040
why this is going to

2314
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,960
give us a perfect

2315
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,920
elliptical is because as

2316
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,200
soon as we start going

2317
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,160
to the left or to the

2318
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,040
right of the planet and

2319
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,120
the distances and the

2320
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,960
angles change, our force

2321
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,920
is going to be either

2322
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,360
negative or positive,

2323
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,440
saying that we're going

2324
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,200
kind of right or we're

2325
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,800
going left or we're

2326
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,640
going up or we're going

2327
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,840
down. So by doing a

2328
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,000
total summation of all

2329
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,160
of these forces, what

2330
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,040
ends up happening is we

2331
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,320
go in a complete circle

2332
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
because by the time we

2333
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,640
get to a certain point in

2334
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,560
the orbit, the velocity

2335
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,520
is going to be changing

2336
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,000
and either getting more

2337
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,160
positive or more negative,

2338
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,080
moving us to the left

2339
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,960
or to the right. Hopefully

2340
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
that makes a tiny bit of

2341
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,720
sense. But the point is

2342
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,760
we're going to constantly

2343
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,840
add this and you'll

2344
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,680
notice that we're not

2345
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,760
going to go faster.

2346
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,440
We're just going to

2347
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,000
change in directions

2348
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,720
because what's going to

2349
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,360
happen is X velocity is

2350
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,280
going to be decreasing

2351
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,640
while the Y velocity is

2352
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,600
increasing when we're at

2353
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,480
a certain point in the

2354
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,560
circle. And then that's

2355
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,400
going to continually

2356
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,440
change and change

2357
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,880
directions as we move

2358
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,720
around. So you'll see

2359
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,480
when we start running

2360
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,800
this, but that's how

2361
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,640
this works. Now we do the

2362
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,600
exact same thing with the

2363
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,120
Y. So plus equals the

2364
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,280
total F Y over the

2365
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,600
self dot mass can then

2366
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,160
multiplied by the self

2367
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,360
dot timestamp. OK, so

2368
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,400
now that we have that,

2369
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,320
what we need to do is

2370
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,560
just increment the X and

2371
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,480
the Y because this is

2372
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,040
just the velocity. So

2373
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,960
from acceleration, you

2374
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,920
get velocity from

2375
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,600
velocity, you get

2376
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,040
displacement or distance,

2377
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,720
which is what we're now

2378
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,760
going to do. So we're

2379
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,840
going to say self dot X.

2380
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,160
And then this is going to

2381
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,280
be plus equals self dot

2382
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,920
X underscore Vell. And

2383
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,760
then we need to multiply

2384
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,920
this by the time step as

2385
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,000
well. And then we're going

2386
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,120
to say self dots Y plus

2387
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,520
equals. This needs to be

2388
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,280
self dot Y Vell multiplied

2389
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,720
by self dot timestamp. And

2390
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,520
then let's fix this to be

2391
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,240
self dot X. Well, OK, and

2392
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
then lastly here, we can

2393
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,440
actually say the self

2394
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,360
dot orbit and then dot

2395
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,360
append. And I'm going to

2396
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,680
append just a tuple

2397
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,520
here, which is going to

2398
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,600
be self dot X, self

2399
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,800
dot Y. And yeah, I think

2400
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
that's actually good for

2401
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,480
the orbit. OK, so let me

2402
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,880
break this down one more

2403
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,320
time. What we're doing is

2404
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,960
we're getting the total

2405
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,800
forces exerted on this

2406
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,920
planet from all other

2407
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,640
plants that are not

2408
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,200
itself. We are then

2409
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,840
going to figure out with

2410
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,120
the X and the Y velocity

2411
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,080
is using the equations I

2412
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,200
describe. Then we are

2413
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,440
going to update the X and

2414
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,880
Y position by using the

2415
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,720
velocity. We need to

2416
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,920
multiply by the time step

2417
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,760
to make sure we're moving

2418
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,640
in the accurate amount of

2419
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,600
time here. OK. And then

2420
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,560
we have self that orbit

2421
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:10,960
dot append and we're

2422
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,000
appending the X and Y

2423
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,640
position that we're

2424
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,760
currently at so that now

2425
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,560
we can draw the orbit

2426
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,560
forward this planet,

2427
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,760
which I'm going to do in

2428
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,360
a second. OK, so there

2429
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,040
we go. We actually have

2430
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,800
all of the hard stuff

2431
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,840
done. Now we just need

2432
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,320
to call the update

2433
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,600
position method here on

2434
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,760
all of our planets. And

2435
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,280
you'll see that they'll

2436
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,080
start moving around the

2437
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,160
screen. So I'm going to

2438
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,640
go to right before planet

2439
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,840
dot draw. And I'm going

2440
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,400
to say planet dot. And

2441
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,080
then this is going to be

2442
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,640
update position. And I'm

2443
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,560
just going to pass to it

2444
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,800
planets. OK. And that's

2445
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,440
actually all we need to

2446
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,480
start moving the planet.

2447
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,520
And let's just run this

2448
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,560
now and see if it works.

2449
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,400
OK, so let's see. And we

2450
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,480
can see that our planets

2451
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,600
are moving, but we're

2452
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,120
getting a bit of an

2453
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,680
issue. And I'm going to

2454
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,040
explain why that happens.

2455
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,840
So first of all, the

2456
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,760
reason why we were seeing

2457
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,160
our planets like thousands

2458
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,520
of times on the screen is

2459
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,520
because we need to

2460
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,360
refresh the screen by

2461
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,800
kind of redrawing a

2462
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,000
background on top of it

2463
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,160
before we draw everything

2464
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,000
again. So what's

2465
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,720
happening right now is

2466
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,400
we're continually

2467
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,200
drawing the planets,

2468
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,120
we're not drawing

2469
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,200
anything on top of the

2470
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,240
old planets. And so we

2471
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,040
keep seeing the old

2472
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,240
planets. So all I need to

2473
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,280
do here, say wind up

2474
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,640
fill. And I'm just going

2475
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,720
to put inside of here

2476
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,040
zero, zero, zero, which

2477
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,200
is just the color black.

2478
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,720
And now if I run this,

2479
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:23,960
you're going to see that

2480
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,360
the planets just zoom

2481
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,920
towards the sun. Now,

2482
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,680
the reason they're

2483
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,560
zooming towards the sun

2484
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,320
is because they don't

2485
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,680
have a velocity in the

2486
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,160
Y or sorry, in the X is

2487
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,960
the X. No, it's in the

2488
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,680
Y direction. So

2489
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,600
currently, right? If

2490
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,440
again, if I run this,

2491
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,520
you see that they just

2492
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,640
zoom right towards the

2493
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,600
sun and then keep going.

2494
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,360
The reason they're

2495
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,040
doing that is because

2496
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:42,800
we don't have another

2497
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,840
velocity. And that's

2498
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
what would happen if

2499
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,800
they weren't already

2500
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,200
moving in another

2501
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,480
direction. So we need to

2502
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,680
apply an existing

2503
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,560
velocity in the Y

2504
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,640
direction to these

2505
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,800
planets so that they

2506
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,360
will be moving around

2507
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,160
the sun, so that the

2508
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,360
force attracted them to

2509
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,640
the sun causes this

2510
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,560
kind of centripetal

2511
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,080
motion or the circular

2512
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,200
motion around the plant.

2513
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,240
I know this is like

2514
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,080
there's a lot of physics

2515
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,040
that I wasn't actually

2516
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,360
can considering how many

2517
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,120
physics I would need to

2518
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,240
explain here. But the

2519
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,280
idea is for all of these

2520
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,400
planets, they need some

2521
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,520
starting velocity in the

2522
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,040
Y direction. Otherwise,

2523
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,000
the only force being

2524
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,560
applied is directly X

2525
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,320
because of kind of where

2526
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,200
the planets are placed

2527
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,880
and the fact that we're

2528
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,600
just going straight down

2529
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,480
towards the sun. That's

2530
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,200
the only force being

2531
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,960
applied currently,

2532
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,720
because we don't have

2533
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,240
another velocity. So

2534
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,000
let's apply the other

2535
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,600
velocities. I'm just

2536
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,320
going to copy them in

2537
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,800
from my other screen. So

2538
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,480
this is the earth

2539
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,440
velocity. I'll pause so

2540
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,200
we can read them all in

2541
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,480
a second. This is the

2542
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,080
Mars velocity. This is

2543
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,400
the mercury velocity.

2544
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,840
And then this is the

2545
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,640
Venus velocity. OK, so

2546
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,200
the earth Y velocity is

2547
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,240
twenty nine point seven

2548
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,960
eight three. This is

2549
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,280
kilometers per second

2550
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,520
multiplied by a thousand,

2551
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,560
which gives us meters

2552
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,200
per second, because

2553
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,880
that's what we're using.

2554
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,640
Excuse me. The Mars

2555
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,600
velocity, twenty four

2556
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,080
point zero seven seven

2557
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,080
multiplied by a thousand

2558
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,080
again, this meters per

2559
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,160
second. So kilometers,

2560
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,120
then we convert to meters

2561
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,600
forty seven point four

2562
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,080
for mercury and then

2563
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,880
negative thirty five

2564
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,160
point oh two times a

2565
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,040
thousand for Venus. Now

2566
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,960
you'll notice that for

2567
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,000
some of these, we have

2568
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,640
positive and negative

2569
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,760
or not positive, not

2570
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,480
negative, right? Like we

2571
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,560
have a negative plant, A

2572
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,040
U moving us to the left

2573
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,840
and then we have a

2574
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,280
positive Y velocity.

2575
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,600
Then for this one,

2576
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,080
right, we have a

2577
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,840
negative and positive.

2578
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,960
And then here we have a

2579
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,960
positive and this

2580
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,760
actually needs to be

2581
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,960
negative to make sure

2582
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,560
that it's going to be

2583
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,560
moving in the correct

2584
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,720
direction. So if you

2585
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,880
have one, this positive,

2586
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,760
the other one needs to be

2587
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,760
negative so that they're

2588
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,560
all moving in the same

2589
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,280
direction vice versa.

2590
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:36,880
Hopefully that makes

2591
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,840
sense, but you'll see

2592
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,000
here when this starts

2593
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,440
running. OK, so let me

2594
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,360
actually just run this

2595
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,600
now and we should see

2596
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,640
that they orbit. So

2597
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,400
let's have a look. OK,

2598
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,120
so there we go. Now we

2599
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,400
have an orbit. Obviously

2600
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,080
doesn't look as cool.

2601
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,040
We're not drawing the

2602
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,000
orbits, but notice that

2603
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,880
they're all moving in

2604
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,760
the same direction and

2605
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,600
obviously the ones that

2606
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,680
are closer to the sun

2607
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,120
are moving faster.

2608
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,400
Perfect. So the

2609
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,880
simulation seems to be

2610
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,720
working. OK, so let's

2611
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,000
now draw the orbits

2612
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,760
around and the way that

2613
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,400
we're going to do that

2614
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:03,960
is we're going to use

2615
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,840
all of the points that

2616
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,600
we're storing in this

2617
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,480
orbit list, because

2618
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,600
every time that we call

2619
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,280
this, we're going to add

2620
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,640
a point to the orbit

2621
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,520
list and we're going

2622
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,840
to draw them. So what

2623
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,320
I'm going to do is

2624
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,440
add something here and

2625
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,760
say four point in self

2626
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,120
that orbit and I

2627
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,880
actually want to draw

2628
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,040
this. Yeah, I'll draw

2629
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,840
this before I draw the

2630
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,600
circle. I'm going to say

2631
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,040
X Y equals point. And

2632
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,760
then I'm going to say

2633
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,520
X is equal to X

2634
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,960
multiplied by self

2635
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,680
that scale. And then

2636
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,160
this is going to be

2637
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,320
plus width over two.

2638
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,880
And I'm going to say

2639
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,640
Y is equal to Y

2640
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,120
multiplied by self

2641
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,520
that scale plus height

2642
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,480
over two. And then

2643
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,720
we are going to

2644
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,560
actually store these in

2645
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,480
an updated points list.

2646
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:58,840
We're going to say

2647
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
updated points equal

2648
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,320
to this updated points

2649
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,680
dot append point. And

2650
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,240
then we're going to

2651
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,120
draw all these points

2652
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,760
as a line. So we're

2653
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,040
going to say

2654
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,160
pie game dot draw dot

2655
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,760
line. And is it lines?

2656
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,520
Let me just have a look

2657
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,240
here to see actually

2658
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,280
exactly what we need to

2659
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,040
drew to do. So this is

2660
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,560
actually going to be

2661
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,600
lines. Sorry, we're

2662
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,040
going to pass win. We're

2663
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,480
going to pass self dot

2664
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,040
color. We're going to

2665
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,160
pass false, which means

2666
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,960
this is not an

2667
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,400
enclosed line. So we're

2668
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,040
not going to draw an

2669
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,400
ending line, essentially.

2670
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,400
And then we're going to

2671
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,360
pass the updated points

2672
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,760
and we'll pass a

2673
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,400
thickness of two. OK, let

2674
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,000
me explain what I did.

2675
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,960
I understand. I kind of

2676
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,600
just went through this

2677
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,640
without any explanation.

2678
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,840
So what I'm doing is

2679
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,600
I'm getting a list of

2680
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,560
updated points, which

2681
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,240
are going to be all of

2682
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,560
the X, Y coordinates to

2683
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,480
scale, right? Because I

2684
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,600
need to get them to scale.

2685
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,760
Otherwise, I can't draw

2686
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,120
these properly. So I

2687
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,160
take them. I do what I

2688
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,880
need to do to get them

2689
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
to scale exactly what I

2690
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,120
did right here. And then

2691
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,920
I update, I make a new

2692
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,800
list here, updated

2693
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,760
points and append, sorry,

2694
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,800
not the point, the new

2695
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
X, Y that I made right

2696
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,320
here. OK, then I'm going

2697
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,760
to draw lines. Now, what

2698
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,680
this does is it takes a

2699
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,920
list of points, which is

2700
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,120
right here, and it

2701
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,480
essentially just draws a

2702
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,320
bunch of a bunch of lines

2703
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:14,960
between the different

2704
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,920
points, and it doesn't

2705
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,880
enclose them because I

2706
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,440
passed false. Now, this

2707
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,800
is the thickness that I

2708
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,560
want to draw the lines,

2709
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,320
which is going to be two

2710
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,720
pixels. Now, one thing I

2711
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,600
do need to do is just

2712
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,440
put an if statement here

2713
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,480
and say if the length of

2714
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,240
self dot points is less

2715
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,200
than two, actually less

2716
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:32,840
than or equal to two,

2717
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,720
because I believe we need

2718
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,600
at least three points,

2719
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,320
then I don't want to do

2720
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,440
any of this. So we're

2721
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,320
going to say actually

2722
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,480
the opposite. We're going

2723
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,840
to say if, yeah, if the

2724
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,400
line of points is

2725
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,360
greater than two. So

2726
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,280
meaning that it is at

2727
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,560
least three, then it

2728
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,440
will do this. Just

2729
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
confusing myself there.

2730
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,080
We need at least three

2731
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,840
points. So if the line

2732
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,480
of points greater than

2733
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,760
two, do all of this.

2734
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Otherwise, don't do it.

2735
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,960
That should give us the

2736
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,400
orbit. So let's see now

2737
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,280
if we're going to get kind

2738
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,320
of the orbital ring

2739
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,040
around. Let's run this

2740
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,560
and planet object has no

2741
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,960
actually points. Sorry,

2742
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,600
it's not points. It is

2743
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,280
orbit. And I think I did

2744
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,200
this right. Self that

2745
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,160
orbit. Yes. OK, self

2746
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,080
that. Nice. All right.

2747
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,480
Let's see. There we go.

2748
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,440
Now we get the orbits

2749
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,800
being drawn as the

2750
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,520
planets are moving around.

2751
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,560
Very nice. So I mean, you

2752
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,720
can run the simulation as

2753
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,920
long as you like and see

2754
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,560
everything working. Now

2755
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,840
what I want to do is

2756
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,120
implement the distance to

2757
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,640
the sun, just to show

2758
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,800
you that this is not a

2759
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,920
perfect circle. It is

2760
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,840
actually elliptical. I

2761
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,400
know it looks like a

2762
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,560
perfect circle, but

2763
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,320
since the scale is so, I

2764
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,600
guess, small here that

2765
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,280
we're drawing this out,

2766
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,880
you can't really see the

2767
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,120
ellipticalness of the

2768
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,200
orbits. OK, so now what

2769
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,160
I want to do is also

2770
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,320
draw that distance on

2771
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,440
top. So to do that, I

2772
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
need to initialize a

2773
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,200
font in Pygame. So I'm

2774
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,120
just going to say font

2775
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,880
is equal to Pygame dot

2776
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,120
font dot S Y S font like

2777
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,920
that. And I'm going to

2778
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,520
pass inside of here,

2779
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
comic sans as my font.

2780
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,240
And for the font size,

2781
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,640
we'll just go with

2782
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,200
something like 16. So

2783
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,080
this is the font you

2784
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:00,880
want. And this is the

2785
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,840
size. That's how you

2786
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,480
initialize the font. And

2787
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,440
then what I need to do if

2788
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,440
I want to draw the

2789
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,160
distance is I need to

2790
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,600
say, first of all, if

2791
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,840
not self dot sun and

2792
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,160
forgot working in Python.

2793
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,080
So let's use the actual

2794
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,120
not because I don't want

2795
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,840
to draw the distance

2796
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,480
between the sun and the

2797
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,240
sun, which is always

2798
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,400
going to be zero. So I'm

2799
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,560
going to say if not self

2800
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,080
dot sun, then we'll say

2801
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,000
distance underscore text

2802
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,600
is equal to font dot

2803
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,560
render. This is how you

2804
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,520
actually create a text

2805
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,680
object that you can draw.

2806
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,720
I'm going to say font

2807
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,920
render and do an F

2808
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,040
string. And this is

2809
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,480
simply going to be the

2810
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,120
self dot distance to

2811
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,600
the sun. And then this is

2812
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,840
going to be in meters. So

2813
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,640
what I can do is I can

2814
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,760
divide this value by

2815
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,880
1000 if I want to get

2816
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,880
kilometers to make it a

2817
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,200
little bit smaller. So

2818
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,440
let's do that divide by

2819
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,880
1000 in kilometers. I'm

2820
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,800
also just going to round

2821
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,920
this just so that we

2822
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,840
don't get a massive

2823
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,800
number here. So let's

2824
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,240
just round this to one

2825
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,400
decimal point, put that

2826
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,920
in kilometers. And then

2827
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,360
we want anti aliasing one,

2828
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,040
which is the next

2829
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,120
argument. And then the

2830
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,720
last argument, I believe

2831
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,080
is the color that I want

2832
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,480
to draw this in, which we

2833
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,240
can just make, I guess

2834
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:07,840
it shouldn't be self

2835
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,480
color. We'll do white.

2836
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,240
OK, perfect. So that is

2837
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,440
now the text object

2838
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,840
created. Again, you have

2839
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,280
to use a font object to

2840
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,480
create a text object,

2841
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,200
which then you can

2842
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,840
render on the screen. Now

2843
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,640
I want to draw it on the

2844
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,080
screen. So I'm going to

2845
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,880
say win dot bullet. I'm

2846
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,920
going to pass the

2847
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,840
distance text. And then

2848
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,760
the position that I want

2849
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,120
to draw this at is a

2850
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,360
little bit complicated.

2851
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,280
And also, guys, sorry, I

2852
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,680
just realized I made a

2853
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,960
little bit of a mistake

2854
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
here. Actually, no,

2855
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,280
maybe this is OK the way

2856
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,400
it is. When I define X,

2857
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,440
Y inside the for loop,

2858
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,120
this might be

2859
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,160
interfering with this,

2860
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,120
although it didn't seem

2861
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,440
like it was. So I guess

2862
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,400
we can just proceed, but

2863
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,360
I don't like having these

2864
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,240
names shadow each other.

2865
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,160
OK, we'll just proceed

2866
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,880
for now, but that's kind

2867
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,720
of what I was realizing

2868
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,520
and why I pause there.

2869
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,640
Anyways, what I'm going to

2870
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,520
do is draw this at X, Y,

2871
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,640
and we're referencing

2872
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,200
this X, Y here, which is

2873
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,960
going to be the center of

2874
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,120
the circle. Now, the

2875
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,120
issue is if I draw this

2876
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:05,760
at the center of the

2877
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,960
circle, since I start

2878
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,920
drawing the text from

2879
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,480
the top left hand corner,

2880
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,760
you'll see actually, let

2881
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,400
me just run the code

2882
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:11,840
and you'll see what

2883
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,720
happens here when I do

2884
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,240
this. So you'll notice

2885
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,640
that the actual text is

2886
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,400
kind of at the bottom

2887
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,480
right of the center.

2888
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,880
Now, that looks really

2889
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,720
ugly. Obviously don't

2890
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,560
want that to be there.

2891
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,440
So what I'm going to do

2892
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,320
instead is I'm going to

2893
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,160
make it so it's drawn

2894
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,040
directly in the center.

2895
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,200
Now, do that. I take the

2896
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,840
X and need to subtract

2897
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,920
this from the distance

2898
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,120
underscore text dot get

2899
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,400
underscore width divided

2900
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,200
by two. So if I take the

2901
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:36,920
width of the text and

2902
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,880
divide that by two and

2903
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,960
then subtract that from

2904
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,360
the X that shifts me to

2905
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,840
the left, some exactly

2906
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,160
in the middle. And then

2907
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:43,840
the same thing with the

2908
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,080
Y. So why is distance

2909
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,040
text dot get underscore

2910
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,760
height over two? Okay.

2911
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,480
Nice. Hopefully that is

2912
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,040
all clear. Now, I'm

2913
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,760
just going to take all

2914
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,960
of this and we're going

2915
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,120
to put this below when

2916
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,120
we're drawing the circle

2917
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,280
so that it gets drawn on

2918
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,280
top and we don't have

2919
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,000
any overlap or we don't

2920
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,880
have the circle kind of

2921
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,880
overlapping the text.

2922
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
OK, so let's close that.

2923
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,480
You guys can pause the

2924
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,040
video if you want to

2925
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,680
have a look at this.

2926
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:06,720
Let's run the code,

2927
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,880
though, and let's see

2928
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,920
what we get. Nice. OK,

2929
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,080
so now we actually have

2930
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,800
the text being drawn on

2931
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,960
top. And for some of

2932
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,720
the planets, given it

2933
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,760
is a bit hard to see,

2934
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,160
but that is all working.

2935
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,120
Nice. So with that said,

2936
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,120
I think I'm going to end

2937
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,160
this tutorial here.

2938
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,200
This was a lot of stuff

2939
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
to go through. I hope

2940
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,160
you guys appreciated

2941
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
this and all of the math

2942
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
and explanations.

2943
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,400
If you did, please make

2944
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,280
sure you leave a like.

2945
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,160
Obviously, you can

2946
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
extend this as much as

2947
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,800
you would like. You can

2948
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,800
mess around with the scale.

2949
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,440
You can mess around with

2950
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,200
the speed. You can

2951
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,160
change the time step.

2952
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,080
This is a really, really

2953
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,240
flexible program.

2954
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,120
And all of the hard

2955
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,400
physics and math is done.

2956
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,400
So if you want to add

2957
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,200
more planets, you can

2958
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,360
really easily do that.

2959
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,440
This is a realistic

2960
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,520
simulation, something

2961
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,280
I haven't done on the

2962
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,360
channel before and that

2963
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,200
I hope you guys

2964
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,440
appreciate. All right.

2965
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,320
With that said, I am going

2966
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,440
to end the video again.

2967
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,440
Please like the video,

2968
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,440
subscribe to the channel

2969
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,400
and I will see you in

2970
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,000
another one.
