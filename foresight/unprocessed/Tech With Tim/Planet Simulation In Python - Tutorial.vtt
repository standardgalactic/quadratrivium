00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
Hello, everybody, and

00:09.560 --> 00:10.800
welcome to another YouTube

00:10.800 --> 00:12.840
video. In this video, I'm

00:12.840 --> 00:13.560
going to be showing you

00:13.560 --> 00:14.640
how to make a planet

00:14.640 --> 00:16.120
simulation using

00:16.120 --> 00:17.680
Python. Now, the goal of

00:17.680 --> 00:18.400
this is going to be to

00:18.400 --> 00:19.560
simulate the orbits of

00:19.560 --> 00:20.280
different planets

00:20.280 --> 00:21.560
around the sun. We're

00:21.560 --> 00:22.440
going to use real

00:22.440 --> 00:23.840
astronomical values. So

00:23.840 --> 00:24.680
the real mass of the

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
sun, the real distance

00:25.680 --> 00:26.760
from Earth to the sun,

00:27.040 --> 00:27.920
all of that type of

00:27.920 --> 00:28.880
stuff. And we're going

00:28.880 --> 00:29.960
to apply the force of

00:29.960 --> 00:31.200
gravity between all of

00:31.200 --> 00:32.080
the different planets.

00:32.120 --> 00:32.960
So we actually get an

00:33.000 --> 00:34.200
accurate elliptical

00:34.240 --> 00:35.800
orbit. Now here it does

00:35.800 --> 00:36.880
look like the orbit is

00:36.880 --> 00:38.400
circular. It is not. You

00:38.400 --> 00:39.200
can see I'm actually

00:39.200 --> 00:40.520
writing the distance of

00:40.520 --> 00:42.320
the planet to the sun on

00:42.320 --> 00:43.080
each planet. So it's

00:43.080 --> 00:43.960
changing as we go

00:43.960 --> 00:45.160
around the orbit. Well,

00:45.160 --> 00:46.080
this is really cool.

00:46.120 --> 00:46.960
We're kind of mixing a

00:46.960 --> 00:48.040
bit of physics with

00:48.080 --> 00:49.600
Python and looking at a

00:49.600 --> 00:51.280
cool simulation. Now, I

00:51.280 --> 00:52.080
will mention that this

00:52.080 --> 00:53.400
tutorial is not designed

00:53.400 --> 00:54.480
for complete beginners.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.480
You should have some

00:55.480 --> 00:56.560
knowledge of Python.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.440
However, if you don't

00:57.440 --> 00:58.000
know anything about

00:58.000 --> 00:59.120
physics, don't worry.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.000
I will teach you the

01:00.000 --> 01:00.920
different physics we need

01:00.920 --> 01:02.400
to know to actually, I

01:02.400 --> 01:03.280
guess, perform this

01:03.280 --> 01:04.560
simulation. It's not

01:04.560 --> 01:05.640
very complicated. I

01:05.640 --> 01:06.960
myself am not a physics

01:06.960 --> 01:08.600
major or a physics guy.

01:08.760 --> 01:09.560
And I was able to figure

01:09.560 --> 01:10.400
it out pretty quickly.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.600
Anyways, with that said,

01:11.600 --> 01:12.360
let's go ahead and get

01:12.360 --> 01:13.480
into the code after a

01:13.480 --> 01:14.600
quick word from our

01:14.600 --> 01:15.640
sponsor. Thanks to

01:15.640 --> 01:16.920

01:23.320 --> 01:24.240
been there excited to

01:24.240 --> 01:25.160
launch a brand new

01:25.160 --> 01:26.360
video game just to be

01:26.360 --> 01:27.640
tormented by crashes,

01:27.760 --> 01:29.320
bugs and an overall bad

01:29.320 --> 01:31.280
user experience. Backtrace

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280

and thanks again to

02:10.000 --> 02:11.400
Backtrace for sponsoring

02:11.400 --> 02:13.000
this video. All right.

02:13.000 --> 02:13.920
So let's go ahead and

02:13.920 --> 02:15.240
get started. Now, I will

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
mention that right here,

02:16.240 --> 02:17.440
I'm not simulating every

02:17.440 --> 02:18.560
single planet. You can

02:18.560 --> 02:19.400
easily adjust the

02:19.400 --> 02:20.600
simulation to add as

02:20.600 --> 02:21.520
many planets as you

02:21.520 --> 02:22.320
would like. You can even

02:22.320 --> 02:23.520
put something like stars

02:23.520 --> 02:24.720
or satellites, whatever.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.600
You can put any of that

02:25.600 --> 02:26.720
here because of the

02:26.720 --> 02:27.440
way we're going to set

02:27.440 --> 02:28.800
this up. However, the

02:28.800 --> 02:29.760
planets I'm simulating

02:29.760 --> 02:30.600
right now are just the

02:30.600 --> 02:32.160
four closest to the sun.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.520
So we have Earth, Mars,

02:33.600 --> 02:35.040
Venus and Mercury.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.080
We're just doing that.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.520
So we get a nice visual

02:37.520 --> 02:38.120
and we can see

02:38.120 --> 02:39.320
everything nice and large.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.560
If you were to simulate

02:40.560 --> 02:41.200
the planets that are

02:41.200 --> 02:42.280
much further away from

02:42.280 --> 02:43.120
the sun, then you're

02:43.120 --> 02:43.960
going to see all of

02:43.960 --> 02:44.680
these plants kind of

02:44.680 --> 02:45.800
smushed really close to

02:45.800 --> 02:46.840
the sun and then the

02:46.840 --> 02:48.640
huge orbits around the

02:48.640 --> 02:49.600
sun from the larger

02:49.600 --> 02:50.440
planets, if that makes

02:50.440 --> 02:51.240
sense. And the planets

02:51.240 --> 02:52.040
that are much further

02:52.040 --> 02:52.960
away. So this is just

02:52.960 --> 02:54.160
a nice visualization.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.240
Again, you can adjust

02:55.280 --> 02:56.000
this however you like,

02:56.000 --> 02:56.960
and I'll show you how to

02:56.960 --> 02:58.160
do that. So with that

02:58.160 --> 02:59.280
said, let's dive into

02:59.280 --> 02:59.840
this. I'm going to

02:59.840 --> 03:00.680
close this and just

03:00.680 --> 03:01.960
open up a new window

03:01.960 --> 03:03.240
here and we'll start

03:03.240 --> 03:04.560
writing some code. Now,

03:04.560 --> 03:05.240
the first thing we do

03:05.240 --> 03:05.920
actually need to do is

03:05.920 --> 03:07.200
install Pi game. So if

03:07.200 --> 03:08.080
you don't already have

03:08.320 --> 03:09.560
Pi game installed, then

03:09.560 --> 03:10.400
just open up your

03:10.400 --> 03:11.600
terminal or command

03:11.600 --> 03:12.800
prompt, depending on

03:12.800 --> 03:13.760
your operating system

03:14.000 --> 03:14.880
and type in the

03:14.880 --> 03:16.200
following command, PIP

03:16.200 --> 03:17.840
install Pi game. That

03:17.840 --> 03:18.480
doesn't work for you.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.720
Try PIP three install

03:19.720 --> 03:20.960
Pi game. If that

03:20.960 --> 03:21.640
doesn't work for you,

03:21.640 --> 03:23.880
try Python hyphen M and

03:23.920 --> 03:25.440
then PIP install Pi game.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.360
If that doesn't work,

03:26.360 --> 03:27.920
try Python three hyphen M

03:27.920 --> 03:29.040
PIP install Pi game.

03:29.320 --> 03:29.920
And if none of those

03:29.920 --> 03:30.680
commands work, I have

03:30.680 --> 03:31.480
two videos that I'll

03:31.480 --> 03:32.280
put on the screen that

03:32.280 --> 03:33.360
show you how to fix

03:33.360 --> 03:34.240
your PIP command.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.280
Anyways, I'm going to

03:35.280 --> 03:35.880
assume that you have

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
Pi game installed.

03:37.080 --> 03:37.880
This is just a 2D

03:37.880 --> 03:38.960
graphics library that

03:38.960 --> 03:39.800
we're going to use for

03:39.800 --> 03:41.000
the simulation. If you

03:41.000 --> 03:41.840
don't know Pi game,

03:41.880 --> 03:42.680
don't worry, we're going

03:42.680 --> 03:43.600
to use very limited

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
features from it. And

03:44.600 --> 03:45.560
I'll talk about how all

03:45.560 --> 03:46.840
of them work. So the

03:46.840 --> 03:47.320
first thing I'm going

03:47.320 --> 03:48.680
to do here is just

03:48.680 --> 03:50.040
import Pi game. And

03:50.040 --> 03:50.600
then I'm going to say

03:50.600 --> 03:53.120
Pi game dot a knit

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
just to initialize the

03:54.520 --> 03:55.640
module. I'm also going

03:55.640 --> 03:56.560
to import the math

03:56.560 --> 03:57.240
module because we're

03:57.240 --> 03:57.880
going to have to use

03:57.880 --> 03:58.640
that in this code.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.800
Okay. So continuing

04:00.840 --> 04:02.040
since I'm using Pi game,

04:02.040 --> 04:02.720
the first thing I want

04:02.720 --> 04:03.480
to do is set up my

04:03.480 --> 04:04.880
Pi game window. Now to

04:04.880 --> 04:05.520
do this, we need to

04:05.520 --> 04:06.720
pick a width and height

04:06.760 --> 04:08.000
in pixels for our

04:08.000 --> 04:09.080
window. So I'm going to

04:09.080 --> 04:10.840
say the width comma the

04:10.840 --> 04:12.160
height in all capitals

04:12.160 --> 04:12.840
because this is a

04:12.840 --> 04:14.320
constant is going to be

04:14.360 --> 04:16.520
800 800 can make this

04:16.520 --> 04:17.200
whatever width and

04:17.200 --> 04:17.920
height you want, but I

04:17.920 --> 04:18.840
recommend you make it

04:18.840 --> 04:20.040
square. And then we're

04:20.080 --> 04:20.600
going to set up a

04:20.600 --> 04:21.960
window. So I'm going to

04:21.960 --> 04:23.680
say when is equal to

04:23.680 --> 04:25.400
Pi game dot display

04:25.440 --> 04:26.560
dot set underscore

04:26.560 --> 04:27.920
mode. Now this is just

04:27.920 --> 04:28.680
going to take in the

04:28.680 --> 04:29.440
coordinates for the

04:29.440 --> 04:31.040
size of our window. So

04:31.040 --> 04:31.920
we're going to pass as

04:31.920 --> 04:32.880
a couple here, the

04:32.880 --> 04:33.720
width and the height.

04:34.320 --> 04:34.880
This is going to give

04:34.880 --> 04:35.520
us what's known as a

04:35.520 --> 04:37.040
Pi game surface. We're

04:37.040 --> 04:37.640
going to call it the

04:37.640 --> 04:38.480
window because it's the

04:38.480 --> 04:39.320
main window that we're

04:39.320 --> 04:40.560
going to draw onto. And

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
we need to have access

04:41.560 --> 04:42.480
to this surface to be

04:42.480 --> 04:43.200
able to put something

04:43.200 --> 04:43.760
on the screen and

04:43.760 --> 04:44.680
actually see something

04:44.680 --> 04:46.080
moving around. Now what

04:46.080 --> 04:46.680
I'm also going to do is

04:46.680 --> 04:47.920
just set a caption for

04:47.920 --> 04:49.080
this window. So Pi game

04:49.080 --> 04:50.880
dot display dot set

04:50.920 --> 04:52.400
underscore caption. Now

04:52.400 --> 04:53.160
the caption is just

04:53.160 --> 04:53.880
going to be kind of the

04:53.880 --> 04:55.160
title of the window. I'll

04:55.160 --> 04:55.880
show you what it looks

04:55.880 --> 04:57.480
like in one second. And

04:57.480 --> 04:58.320
for this, we'll just do

04:58.320 --> 05:01.320
planet simulation. Okay,

05:01.320 --> 05:02.800
perfect. So now that we

05:02.800 --> 05:03.640
have this, what I want to

05:03.640 --> 05:04.440
do is create something

05:04.440 --> 05:05.560
known as the Pi game

05:05.600 --> 05:06.760
event loop. Now this is

05:06.760 --> 05:07.800
essentially an infinite

05:07.800 --> 05:08.680
loop that's going to run

05:08.680 --> 05:09.760
the entire time that

05:09.760 --> 05:11.080
the simulation is going.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.000
Whenever you're working

05:12.000 --> 05:12.840
with some type of game,

05:12.840 --> 05:13.800
you need some type of

05:13.800 --> 05:14.960
loop that's constantly

05:14.960 --> 05:15.920
running. They can keep

05:15.920 --> 05:16.720
track of the different

05:16.720 --> 05:17.800
events that are occurring.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.920
In this case, the only

05:18.920 --> 05:19.840
event is going to be

05:19.840 --> 05:20.640
moving the different

05:20.640 --> 05:21.760
planets, but we need to

05:21.760 --> 05:22.720
have some type of loops

05:22.720 --> 05:23.360
that the window doesn't

05:23.360 --> 05:24.600
just open and instantly

05:24.600 --> 05:25.400
close. We need something

05:25.400 --> 05:26.320
keeping the program

05:26.320 --> 05:27.440
running. So I'm going to

05:27.440 --> 05:28.560
make a function here and

05:28.560 --> 05:29.280
I'm going to call this

05:29.280 --> 05:30.720
main and inside of here,

05:30.720 --> 05:31.080
I'm going to make a

05:31.080 --> 05:32.040
variable. I'm going to

05:32.040 --> 05:33.120
say run is equal to

05:33.120 --> 05:34.280
true. Then we're going

05:34.280 --> 05:35.840
to say, well, run like

05:35.840 --> 05:37.280
this and this loop will

05:37.280 --> 05:38.400
run while this variable

05:38.400 --> 05:39.920
run is true. Now inside

05:39.920 --> 05:41.000
of here, I'm going to

05:41.000 --> 05:41.760
get the different

05:41.760 --> 05:42.840
events that are occurring

05:42.840 --> 05:43.920
in Pi game. So I'm going

05:43.920 --> 05:45.480
to say for event in Pi

05:45.480 --> 05:46.720
game dot event dot get.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.720
Now this is going to give

05:47.720 --> 05:48.800
us a list of all of the

05:48.800 --> 05:49.640
different events that

05:49.640 --> 05:51.640
occur. So key presses,

05:51.640 --> 05:52.480
mouse movements,

05:52.480 --> 05:53.320
whatever. Now when you're

05:53.320 --> 05:54.400
coding a more complex

05:54.400 --> 05:54.880
game, you're going to

05:54.880 --> 05:55.720
handle those different

05:55.720 --> 05:57.040
events. However, the

05:57.040 --> 05:58.240
only event that we want

05:58.240 --> 05:59.400
to handle is when the

05:59.400 --> 06:00.600
user presses the X

06:00.600 --> 06:01.480
button to close the

06:01.480 --> 06:03.040
window. Now that event

06:03.040 --> 06:04.080
is the following. I'm

06:04.080 --> 06:05.040
going to say if event

06:05.040 --> 06:07.520
dot type is equal to

06:07.520 --> 06:08.960
Pi game dot quit in

06:08.960 --> 06:10.480
all capitals, then all

06:10.480 --> 06:11.000
we're going to do is

06:11.000 --> 06:11.960
say run is equal to

06:11.960 --> 06:13.600
false. And then outside

06:13.600 --> 06:14.320
of our wall loop, we're

06:14.320 --> 06:15.480
going to say Pi game dot

06:15.480 --> 06:16.880
quit. So this is

06:16.880 --> 06:17.720
literally all we need

06:17.720 --> 06:18.400
for the event loop,

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
at least for right now,

06:19.720 --> 06:20.400
what's going to happen

06:20.400 --> 06:20.800
is we're going to

06:20.800 --> 06:21.840
continually run, we're

06:21.840 --> 06:22.600
going to get all of the

06:22.600 --> 06:23.960
events. If one of the

06:23.960 --> 06:24.680
events that occurred

06:24.680 --> 06:25.720
was we hit the X

06:25.720 --> 06:26.880
button in the window,

06:27.120 --> 06:28.040
then we are going to

06:28.040 --> 06:28.880
close the window by

06:28.880 --> 06:29.880
making run equal to

06:29.880 --> 06:31.000
false. Since that's

06:31.000 --> 06:31.800
going to exit our loop,

06:31.800 --> 06:32.480
we're going to quit

06:32.480 --> 06:33.360
Pi game and then we'll

06:33.360 --> 06:35.080
be done. Perfect. So

06:35.080 --> 06:35.880
all we need to do here

06:35.880 --> 06:37.080
is just call this main

06:37.080 --> 06:38.200
function. And now that

06:38.200 --> 06:39.000
we do this, we should

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
see a Pi game window

06:40.000 --> 06:41.040
pop up and then we can

06:41.040 --> 06:42.400
close it and get out of

06:42.400 --> 06:44.120
the program safely. So

06:44.120 --> 06:45.520
let's try this. And

06:45.520 --> 06:46.080
there we go. We get

06:46.080 --> 06:47.120
planet simulation.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.000
This is the caption I

06:48.000 --> 06:48.600
was talking about. You

06:48.600 --> 06:49.280
could see it kind of

06:49.280 --> 06:50.160
right here beside the

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
little Pi game logo.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.360
Then if I click the X

06:52.360 --> 06:53.200
button, we're going to

06:53.200 --> 06:54.120
close and we are all

06:54.480 --> 06:55.200
okay. We have set up

06:55.240 --> 06:56.840
our event loop. Nice.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.240
So now that we have

06:58.240 --> 06:59.040
done that, I just want

06:59.040 --> 06:59.960
to show you how we can

06:59.960 --> 07:01.040
draw something onto

07:01.040 --> 07:02.240
the screen and kind of

07:02.280 --> 07:03.720
update the screen. So

07:03.720 --> 07:05.000
let's do that. So at

07:05.000 --> 07:06.040
the top of this loop

07:06.040 --> 07:06.760
here, I'm actually

07:06.760 --> 07:07.200
going to set up

07:07.200 --> 07:07.920
something called a

07:07.920 --> 07:09.760
clock. Now a clock

07:09.760 --> 07:10.640
is essentially going

07:10.640 --> 07:11.360
to make it so that the

07:11.360 --> 07:12.760
frame rate of our game

07:12.760 --> 07:14.080
won't go past a certain

07:14.080 --> 07:15.400
value. I'll talk about

07:15.400 --> 07:16.600
why we need this, but

07:16.600 --> 07:17.720
the idea here is that

07:17.840 --> 07:18.920
if we don't implement

07:18.920 --> 07:20.040
some type of clock, so

07:20.040 --> 07:21.320
some way to synchronize

07:21.320 --> 07:22.280
our game, essentially,

07:22.640 --> 07:23.880
you're going to run

07:23.880 --> 07:25.000
the simulation at the

07:25.000 --> 07:26.160
speed of your computer.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.160
Now, some people want

07:27.160 --> 07:27.880
that to happen. They

07:27.880 --> 07:28.720
want it to run super

07:28.720 --> 07:29.360
fast. If you're on a

07:29.360 --> 07:30.760
super fast computer and

07:30.760 --> 07:31.600
then super slow, if

07:31.600 --> 07:32.120
you're on a super

07:32.120 --> 07:33.480
slow one, but ideally

07:33.480 --> 07:34.600
for me, I don't care

07:34.600 --> 07:35.240
about what type of

07:35.240 --> 07:36.640
processor you have. I

07:36.640 --> 07:37.400
just want you to run

07:37.400 --> 07:38.160
the simulation at the

07:38.160 --> 07:39.040
same speed. So it

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
looks normal. Hopefully

07:41.040 --> 07:41.720
that makes a bit of

07:41.720 --> 07:42.240
sense, but we can

07:42.240 --> 07:43.120
kind of regulate the

07:43.120 --> 07:43.960
frame rate and how

07:43.960 --> 07:45.080
many times our game is

07:45.080 --> 07:46.360
refreshing. So the way

07:46.360 --> 07:47.280
we do that is we say

07:47.320 --> 07:48.160
clock is equal to

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
pie game dot time

07:49.160 --> 07:50.280
dot clock. And then

07:50.280 --> 07:51.160
we go here and we say

07:51.160 --> 07:52.720
clock dot tick. And

07:52.720 --> 07:53.320
then we put in the

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
number of times that

07:54.320 --> 07:55.520
we want this to update

07:55.520 --> 07:57.000
per second. Now, this

07:57.000 --> 07:57.600
does not mean you're

07:57.600 --> 07:58.560
always going to update

07:58.560 --> 07:59.840
at, in this case, 60

07:59.840 --> 08:00.840
frames per second.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.040
However, this is the

08:02.040 --> 08:03.040
maximum that you will

08:03.040 --> 08:04.360
be able to update at.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.040
So we're saying clock

08:05.040 --> 08:06.040
dot tick 60. That

08:06.040 --> 08:06.520
means we're going to

08:06.520 --> 08:07.560
update this loop or

08:07.560 --> 08:09.120
run this loop a maximum

08:09.120 --> 08:10.400
of 60 times per second

08:10.560 --> 08:11.440
to ensure our games

08:11.440 --> 08:12.320
not going too fast.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.400
Okay. So now we have

08:13.400 --> 08:14.600
our clock. And as I

08:14.600 --> 08:15.240
was saying, we want to

08:15.240 --> 08:16.280
draw something on the

08:16.280 --> 08:17.720
screen. So to draw

08:17.720 --> 08:18.560
something, I'm going to

08:18.560 --> 08:19.760
use my window right

08:19.760 --> 08:20.640
here. And I'm going to

08:20.640 --> 08:22.960
say win dot fill. And

08:22.960 --> 08:23.880
then I need to pass an

08:23.880 --> 08:25.520
RGB color here that's

08:25.520 --> 08:26.320
going to be the color

08:26.320 --> 08:27.320
that I want to fill the

08:27.320 --> 08:28.640
entire window with on

08:28.640 --> 08:29.840
the screen. So I'm just

08:29.840 --> 08:30.440
going to define a

08:30.440 --> 08:31.240
color. Let's just go

08:31.240 --> 08:32.760
with white for now. And

08:32.760 --> 08:33.800
white will be equal to

08:33.800 --> 08:37.080
255, 255, 255. Okay.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.680
So that's our RGB value

08:38.680 --> 08:39.920
for white. And then I'm

08:39.920 --> 08:40.920
going to pass white

08:40.920 --> 08:42.280
inside of here. And we

08:42.280 --> 08:43.560
should see in a second

08:43.560 --> 08:44.160
that we're going to get

08:44.160 --> 08:44.920
the screen actually

08:44.920 --> 08:45.760
updating. And now it's

08:45.760 --> 08:46.440
going to have a white

08:46.440 --> 08:47.480
background rather than a

08:47.480 --> 08:49.120
black. However, I will

08:49.120 --> 08:50.320
show you if I currently

08:50.320 --> 08:51.640
run the code, we

08:51.640 --> 08:52.680
actually don't get any

08:52.680 --> 08:54.080
white on the screen. And

08:54.080 --> 08:54.880
the reason we don't get

08:54.880 --> 08:55.800
any white on the screen

08:55.800 --> 08:56.440
is because we're not

08:56.440 --> 08:58.040
updating the display. So

08:58.040 --> 08:58.960
what I need to do is say

08:58.960 --> 09:00.880
pie game dot display dot

09:01.000 --> 09:02.640
update, not clear. And

09:02.640 --> 09:03.480
what this does is

09:03.480 --> 09:04.640
actually take all of the

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
drawing actions that

09:05.640 --> 09:06.920
we've done since the

09:06.920 --> 09:08.400
last update and then

09:08.400 --> 09:09.320
kind of paste them and

09:09.320 --> 09:10.200
draws them onto the

09:10.200 --> 09:11.240
screen. So what I'm

09:11.240 --> 09:12.600
doing is every loop, I'm

09:12.600 --> 09:13.280
going to fill the

09:13.280 --> 09:14.240
background with white

09:14.320 --> 09:14.840
and then I'm going to

09:14.840 --> 09:16.160
update the display. Okay.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.280
So now if I run this,

09:17.720 --> 09:18.480
you're going to see that

09:18.480 --> 09:19.800
we get a white back. Now

09:19.800 --> 09:20.680
we don't actually want

09:20.680 --> 09:21.320
a white background. I

09:21.320 --> 09:22.440
want a black one. So

09:22.440 --> 09:23.080
I'm going to get rid of

09:23.080 --> 09:23.800
this. I just wanted to

09:23.800 --> 09:24.920
show you how we fill the

09:24.920 --> 09:25.960
screen. Okay. So let's

09:25.960 --> 09:26.680
comment these out for

09:26.680 --> 09:28.520
right now. Perfect. So

09:28.520 --> 09:29.320
now that we've done this,

09:29.320 --> 09:30.600
let's start implementing

09:30.600 --> 09:31.920
a plan because obviously

09:31.920 --> 09:32.440
we want to put some

09:32.440 --> 09:33.440
planets on the screen.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.360
And to do this, I'm

09:34.360 --> 09:35.200
going to make a class.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.000
So I'm going to say class

09:37.120 --> 09:39.360
planet. And inside of

09:39.360 --> 09:40.040
here, I'm going to define

09:40.040 --> 09:41.760
an initialization. I'm

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
going to say define a

09:42.760 --> 09:44.440
knit. I'm going to say

09:44.440 --> 09:46.200
self. We need an X and a

09:46.200 --> 09:47.400
Y. Now the X and the Y

09:47.400 --> 09:48.000
is going to be the

09:48.000 --> 09:48.880
position that we want

09:48.880 --> 09:49.840
this planet to be on

09:49.840 --> 09:51.560
the screen. We also

09:51.560 --> 09:52.360
are going to need a

09:52.360 --> 09:53.640
radius. We're going to

09:53.640 --> 09:55.440
need a color. And then

09:55.440 --> 09:56.200
let me just check if we

09:56.200 --> 09:56.960
want to take anything

09:56.960 --> 09:57.560
else. We're also going

09:57.560 --> 09:58.760
to need a mass for the

09:58.760 --> 10:00.520
planet. Okay. So these

10:00.520 --> 10:00.920
are kind of the

10:00.920 --> 10:02.000
initialization values

10:02.000 --> 10:03.520
that we have. So I'm

10:03.520 --> 10:04.240
going to say self dot

10:04.240 --> 10:06.480
X is equal to X self

10:06.480 --> 10:07.960
dot Y is equal to Y

10:08.640 --> 10:09.840
self dot radius is

10:09.840 --> 10:10.600
equal to radius.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.200
Obviously we're going

10:11.200 --> 10:11.760
to have circular

10:11.800 --> 10:13.200
planets, self dot

10:13.200 --> 10:14.000
color is equal to

10:14.000 --> 10:15.480
color. We might want to

10:15.480 --> 10:16.400
make our planets more

10:16.400 --> 10:17.120
detailed and have

10:17.120 --> 10:18.040
multiple colors, but

10:18.040 --> 10:18.640
for now we're just

10:18.640 --> 10:19.040
going to go with a

10:19.040 --> 10:20.440
single color. And then

10:20.440 --> 10:21.400
the mass is going to

10:21.400 --> 10:22.360
be the mass in

10:22.360 --> 10:23.480
kilograms of this

10:23.480 --> 10:24.360
planet. We're going to

10:24.360 --> 10:25.320
have to use that mass

10:25.320 --> 10:26.080
to calculate the

10:26.080 --> 10:27.160
attraction between the

10:27.160 --> 10:27.920
different planets and

10:27.920 --> 10:28.640
then generate the

10:28.640 --> 10:30.000
actual circular orbit,

10:30.360 --> 10:31.120
which we'll get to when

10:31.120 --> 10:31.960
we start talking about

10:31.960 --> 10:33.200
the physics. Now there's

10:33.200 --> 10:33.920
a few other things that

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
we want our planets to

10:34.920 --> 10:35.800
have. They're going to

10:35.800 --> 10:36.880
have to have an X

10:36.880 --> 10:38.080
velocity as well as a

10:38.080 --> 10:39.440
Y velocity. So I'm

10:39.440 --> 10:40.280
going to say self dot

10:40.280 --> 10:41.360
underscore X, well, is

10:41.360 --> 10:42.880
equal to zero and

10:42.880 --> 10:44.480
self dot Y, well, is

10:44.480 --> 10:45.800
equal to zero. Now

10:45.800 --> 10:46.520
I'll explain how all

10:46.520 --> 10:47.400
of these concepts work

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
in a second, but the

10:48.400 --> 10:49.120
idea is we're going to

10:49.120 --> 10:50.000
be moving our planet

10:50.000 --> 10:51.080
in a circle. And in

10:51.080 --> 10:51.720
order to move in a

10:51.720 --> 10:52.960
circle, we have a

10:52.960 --> 10:54.320
velocity in multiple

10:54.320 --> 10:55.360
directions. So we're

10:55.360 --> 10:56.480
going to have it in the

10:56.480 --> 10:57.440
X direction, which is

10:57.440 --> 10:58.160
the horizontal

10:58.160 --> 10:59.240
direction and then in

10:59.240 --> 11:00.680
the Y direction. And by

11:00.680 --> 11:01.520
moving in two

11:01.520 --> 11:02.520
directions at the same

11:02.520 --> 11:03.280
time, we're able to

11:03.280 --> 11:05.120
generate a circle and

11:05.120 --> 11:06.480
have kind of, I don't

11:06.480 --> 11:07.320
want to call it

11:07.920 --> 11:09.000
centripetal force or

11:09.000 --> 11:09.960
some, some tripetal

11:09.960 --> 11:10.760
motion, but something

11:10.800 --> 11:11.640
along those lines, right?

11:11.640 --> 11:12.120
Well, we're actually

11:12.120 --> 11:13.440
moving in a circle

11:13.440 --> 11:15.200
around an object at a

11:15.200 --> 11:17.000
constant speed. Okay.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.280
Hopefully this is

11:18.280 --> 11:19.400
making sense so far.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.400
Another thing that I

11:20.400 --> 11:21.800
want to do here is I

11:21.800 --> 11:22.800
want to have something

11:22.800 --> 11:23.600
that says self that

11:23.600 --> 11:25.280
sun is equal to false.

11:25.480 --> 11:25.960
Now this is going to

11:25.960 --> 11:27.000
tell us if the planet

11:27.000 --> 11:28.640
is the sun. The reason

11:28.640 --> 11:29.680
we want that is because

11:29.680 --> 11:30.640
we're going to draw the

11:30.680 --> 11:31.840
orbit of the planet

11:31.840 --> 11:33.080
moving around. And I

11:33.080 --> 11:33.920
don't want to draw the

11:33.920 --> 11:35.880
orbit for the sun. So I

11:35.880 --> 11:36.560
need to know if it's a

11:36.560 --> 11:37.680
sun to either draw it

11:37.680 --> 11:39.120
or to not draw it. And

11:39.120 --> 11:39.840
then I'm going to have

11:39.880 --> 11:41.680
the self.distance to

11:41.680 --> 11:42.840
the sun. I'm just going

11:42.840 --> 11:43.600
to make this equal to

11:43.600 --> 11:44.800
zero right now. And

11:44.800 --> 11:45.560
we're going to update

11:45.560 --> 11:47.160
this value for every

11:47.160 --> 11:48.000
single planet that we

11:48.000 --> 11:49.480
have so that we know

11:49.480 --> 11:50.360
what its distances and

11:50.360 --> 11:51.200
we can then draw that

11:51.200 --> 11:52.400
on the screen. And then

11:52.400 --> 11:53.200
the last thing that I

11:53.200 --> 11:55.960
want is self.orbit is

11:55.960 --> 11:57.160
equal to an empty list.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.320
We're going to use this

11:58.320 --> 11:59.440
to keep track of all of

11:59.440 --> 12:00.680
the points that this

12:00.680 --> 12:01.800
planet has traveled

12:01.800 --> 12:03.200
along so we can draw a

12:03.200 --> 12:04.200
circular orbit

12:04.200 --> 12:05.280
representing well, the

12:05.280 --> 12:06.200
orbit of the planet.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.360
Okay. Again, all this

12:08.360 --> 12:09.080
will start to make sense

12:09.160 --> 12:09.960
as we get into more of

12:09.960 --> 12:10.800
these concepts. I'm just

12:10.800 --> 12:11.680
kind of setting up all

12:11.680 --> 12:12.640
of the initialization

12:12.640 --> 12:14.320
values. Now, a few

12:14.320 --> 12:14.840
other things that I

12:14.840 --> 12:16.240
want to do here is

12:16.240 --> 12:17.240
just write out a few

12:17.240 --> 12:18.160
constants that we're

12:18.160 --> 12:19.640
going to use for our

12:19.640 --> 12:21.080
simulation. Now, the

12:21.080 --> 12:22.040
first constant we're

12:22.040 --> 12:23.000
going to do as a class

12:23.000 --> 12:24.160
variable in the planet

12:24.160 --> 12:24.880
class. And this is

12:24.880 --> 12:26.280
going to be a you. Now,

12:26.280 --> 12:27.680
a you is astronomical

12:27.680 --> 12:28.640
units. And this is

12:28.640 --> 12:29.960
approximately equal to

12:29.960 --> 12:30.800
the distance of the

12:30.800 --> 12:32.280
earth to the sun. Now,

12:32.280 --> 12:33.360
I want to use a you

12:33.360 --> 12:33.960
because it's going to

12:33.960 --> 12:35.280
simplify the math that

12:35.280 --> 12:36.440
we need to do to

12:36.440 --> 12:37.480
calculate the distance

12:37.480 --> 12:38.240
between the current

12:38.240 --> 12:40.080
planet and the sun and

12:40.120 --> 12:41.280
allow us to initialize

12:41.280 --> 12:42.200
our planets at the

12:42.200 --> 12:43.800
correct a you from the

12:43.800 --> 12:44.600
sun. So they're kind of

12:44.600 --> 12:45.560
the correct distance

12:45.560 --> 12:46.720
away. Hopefully that

12:46.720 --> 12:47.440
makes a bit of sense,

12:47.440 --> 12:49.320
but one a you is equal

12:49.320 --> 12:50.000
to. And I just have to

12:50.000 --> 12:50.920
copy this from my other

12:50.920 --> 12:52.440
screen. One point four

12:52.440 --> 12:54.520
nine dot six to the

12:54.520 --> 12:55.600
exponent six, which is

12:55.600 --> 12:56.840
what this E six stands

12:56.840 --> 12:57.800
for, and then

12:57.800 --> 12:58.840
multiplied by a

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
thousand. And I don't

12:59.880 --> 13:00.560
actually need these

13:00.560 --> 13:01.280
in parentheses. So I

13:01.280 --> 13:02.040
don't know why I had it

13:02.040 --> 13:03.920
there. Okay. So what

13:03.920 --> 13:04.960
this is saying is we

13:04.960 --> 13:06.080
are one hundred and

13:06.080 --> 13:07.920
forty nine thousand. I

13:07.920 --> 13:08.840
guess this is sorry,

13:08.840 --> 13:09.720
one hundred forty nine

13:09.720 --> 13:10.920
million and then six

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
hundred thousand

13:11.920 --> 13:13.320
kilometers. That's what

13:13.320 --> 13:14.200
this stands for right

13:14.200 --> 13:15.400
here, but we want this

13:15.400 --> 13:16.600
to be in meters. So I'm

13:16.600 --> 13:17.520
going to multiply it by

13:17.520 --> 13:18.480
a thousand to get the

13:18.480 --> 13:19.840
distance from the sun

13:20.240 --> 13:22.320
in meters. One a you

13:22.400 --> 13:23.160
that that's what this

13:23.160 --> 13:23.840
is. Hopefully that makes

13:23.840 --> 13:24.520
sense. Again, want to

13:24.520 --> 13:25.440
use the distance from

13:25.440 --> 13:26.320
the earth to the sun

13:26.640 --> 13:28.400
approximately. And here

13:28.400 --> 13:29.240
we're converting this

13:29.360 --> 13:30.320
from kilometers to

13:30.320 --> 13:31.400
meters by multiplying

13:31.400 --> 13:33.280
it by a thousand. Okay.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.440
Now, we also want the

13:34.440 --> 13:35.800
gravitational constant

13:35.960 --> 13:36.920
now. This is not

13:36.920 --> 13:38.080
negative nine point eight.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.640
That's the acceleration

13:39.640 --> 13:41.560
of gravity. I actually

13:41.560 --> 13:42.240
yeah, I think it's

13:42.240 --> 13:42.960
the acceleration of

13:42.960 --> 13:44.040
gravity. I might be

13:44.040 --> 13:44.720
messing that up, but

13:44.720 --> 13:45.160
it's something to do

13:45.160 --> 13:45.800
with gravity, but the

13:45.800 --> 13:47.120
gravitational constant

13:47.120 --> 13:48.640
is used in finding the

13:48.640 --> 13:49.600
force of attraction

13:49.600 --> 13:50.640
between objects, which

13:50.640 --> 13:51.520
is what we want to do.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.280
And G is different than

13:53.280 --> 13:54.400
the regular gravity one.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.480
It is six point six seven

13:56.720 --> 13:57.720
and actually is four

13:57.720 --> 13:58.760
point two eight either

13:58.760 --> 13:59.520
the negative eleven.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.400
Okay. That's great. My

14:00.400 --> 14:01.440
autocomplete is working

14:01.440 --> 14:03.000
very well there. Nice.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.240
Now, the last two

14:04.240 --> 14:05.160
things we want here is

14:05.200 --> 14:06.800
a scale. Since we're

14:06.800 --> 14:07.320
actually going to be

14:07.320 --> 14:08.400
simulating the real

14:08.400 --> 14:09.960
values here for the

14:09.960 --> 14:12.320
orbits, we can't draw

14:12.320 --> 14:13.320
them at the position

14:13.320 --> 14:14.200
that we have them at.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.200
I know that's probably

14:15.200 --> 14:16.280
a confusing line, but

14:16.280 --> 14:17.720
the idea is if our

14:17.720 --> 14:18.840
planet is moving at,

14:18.840 --> 14:20.040
you know, something

14:20.040 --> 14:21.080
kilometers per second,

14:21.080 --> 14:22.000
seven kilometers per

14:22.000 --> 14:23.280
second, 29 kilometers

14:23.280 --> 14:24.400
per second, I can't

14:24.400 --> 14:25.760
draw my planet at a

14:25.760 --> 14:27.120
million kilometers in

14:27.120 --> 14:28.160
my pie game window.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.520
I need to draw it in

14:29.640 --> 14:31.080
a kind of appropriate

14:31.080 --> 14:32.560
scale, right? So I'm

14:32.560 --> 14:33.360
going to have to figure

14:33.360 --> 14:34.560
out what one meter

14:34.600 --> 14:35.720
represents in terms of

14:35.720 --> 14:37.200
pixels in my pie game

14:37.200 --> 14:38.400
scale here, because I'm

14:38.400 --> 14:39.680
only working with 800

14:39.680 --> 14:40.800
pixels high and 800

14:40.800 --> 14:42.680
pixels wide. Hopefully

14:42.680 --> 14:43.520
this is making a little

14:43.520 --> 14:44.520
bit of sense. What I'm

14:44.520 --> 14:45.280
going to do here is say

14:45.280 --> 14:47.480
250 divided by A.U. is

14:47.480 --> 14:48.680
the scale. Now, this

14:48.680 --> 14:50.160
scale essentially says

14:50.280 --> 14:51.840
that one astronomical

14:51.840 --> 14:52.680
unit is going to be

14:52.680 --> 14:54.120
about 100 pixels in my

14:54.120 --> 14:55.600
pie game program. You

14:55.600 --> 14:56.400
can look at the math to

14:56.400 --> 14:57.040
figure out how that

14:57.040 --> 14:58.120
works. But for now, I'll

14:58.120 --> 14:58.920
leave a comment. We're

14:58.920 --> 15:00.640
going to say one A.U. is

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
equal to 100 pixels.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.000
OK, that's kind of the

15:03.000 --> 15:03.840
scale that we're going

15:03.880 --> 15:05.200
with here. So we can

15:05.200 --> 15:06.760
draw things to scale in

15:06.760 --> 15:08.200
the window. And then the

15:08.200 --> 15:09.840
last thing I want is the

15:09.840 --> 15:11.520
time step. And this is

15:11.520 --> 15:13.120
going to represent how

15:13.120 --> 15:15.720
much of time I want to

15:15.720 --> 15:16.480
represent in my

15:16.480 --> 15:17.760
simulation or that I

15:17.760 --> 15:19.360
want to simulate is

15:19.360 --> 15:21.040
being a lapse. So the

15:21.040 --> 15:22.080
idea here is every time

15:22.080 --> 15:23.720
I update the frame, I'm

15:23.720 --> 15:25.320
going to pass a certain

15:25.320 --> 15:26.960
time step and say, OK, I

15:26.960 --> 15:28.480
want to look at one hour

15:28.480 --> 15:29.520
of this planet's movement

15:29.520 --> 15:31.040
at a time or one day of

15:31.040 --> 15:31.920
this planet's movement at

15:31.920 --> 15:32.520
a time, because I don't

15:32.520 --> 15:33.120
want to look at one

15:33.120 --> 15:33.720
second. It's going to

15:33.720 --> 15:34.520
take a really, really

15:34.520 --> 15:35.680
long time to simulate.

15:35.880 --> 15:36.560
Instead, I want to look

15:36.560 --> 15:37.800
at a larger time step.

15:38.120 --> 15:38.800
So what I'm going to do

15:38.800 --> 15:40.440
is say 3600, which is

15:40.440 --> 15:41.920
the number of seconds in

15:41.960 --> 15:44.160
a what is this in an

15:44.160 --> 15:45.080
hour? Yeah, I think

15:45.080 --> 15:45.960
this number of seconds

15:45.960 --> 15:47.280
in an hour. And then I'm

15:47.280 --> 15:48.240
going to multiply this

15:48.240 --> 15:49.840
by 24. And that's going

15:49.840 --> 15:51.280
to give me one day. OK,

15:51.280 --> 15:52.360
so this is representing

15:52.800 --> 15:55.800
one day. I think that's

15:55.800 --> 15:56.680
correct. Yeah, OK, I'm

15:56.680 --> 15:57.920
pretty certain that is

15:57.920 --> 15:58.600
correct. This would be

15:58.600 --> 15:59.480
the number of seconds in

15:59.480 --> 16:00.280
an hour, right? If you

16:00.280 --> 16:01.600
go 60 times 60, I think

16:01.600 --> 16:02.800
that gives you 3600.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.080
And then multiply that by

16:04.080 --> 16:05.240
24. And that is the

16:05.240 --> 16:06.240
time step that we're

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
going to be doing the

16:07.240 --> 16:08.400
simulation on. So kind

16:08.400 --> 16:09.320
of one day at a time

16:09.320 --> 16:10.080
will be updating the

16:10.080 --> 16:11.640
planet. All right.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.560
Hopefully I'm not

16:12.560 --> 16:13.360
confusing you guys too

16:13.360 --> 16:14.200
much. I do understand

16:14.200 --> 16:14.800
this is a lot. We've

16:14.800 --> 16:15.280
got to go through a

16:15.280 --> 16:16.080
bunch of physics and

16:16.080 --> 16:16.920
stuff here to make this

16:16.920 --> 16:18.160
work. But there you go.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.160
That is a planet. Now,

16:20.160 --> 16:20.960
the next thing I want to

16:20.960 --> 16:22.120
do is implement a draw

16:22.120 --> 16:23.240
method. Now, this draw

16:23.240 --> 16:23.880
method just going to

16:23.880 --> 16:24.960
draw the planet on the

16:24.960 --> 16:26.000
screen. So what I'm

16:26.000 --> 16:26.640
going to do is say

16:26.640 --> 16:27.880
self and I'm going to

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
take a window that I

16:28.880 --> 16:29.640
need to draw this

16:29.640 --> 16:31.560
planet on. So the X and Y

16:31.600 --> 16:32.720
for my planet, as well

16:32.720 --> 16:33.840
as the X velocity and

16:33.840 --> 16:34.920
the Y velocity for my

16:34.920 --> 16:36.040
planet is going to be

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
in meters. So the

16:37.040 --> 16:38.120
number of meters that

16:38.120 --> 16:39.520
I am away from the sun,

16:39.560 --> 16:40.640
that's what X and Y is

16:40.640 --> 16:41.880
going to represent. So

16:41.880 --> 16:42.760
I need to take those

16:42.760 --> 16:44.280
values and then draw

16:44.280 --> 16:45.600
them to scale, right?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.320
Because I again, I

16:46.320 --> 16:47.440
can't draw like

16:47.480 --> 16:48.480
something million

16:48.480 --> 16:49.560
kilometers or million

16:49.560 --> 16:50.640
meters away. I need to

16:50.640 --> 16:51.520
draw it in accurate

16:51.520 --> 16:52.920
scale in pie game. So

16:52.920 --> 16:53.480
this is where the

16:53.480 --> 16:54.360
scale is going to come

16:54.360 --> 16:55.320
in. I'm going to say

16:55.320 --> 16:57.160
that my X is equal to

16:57.200 --> 16:57.960
and then this is

16:57.960 --> 16:58.880
going to be the self

16:58.880 --> 17:01.080
dot X multiplied by

17:01.120 --> 17:02.200
my scale. OK, so it's

17:02.200 --> 17:02.800
going to be self

17:02.800 --> 17:04.160
dot scale and self

17:04.160 --> 17:04.720
that scale is going to

17:04.720 --> 17:05.440
be a really, really

17:05.440 --> 17:06.400
tiny number that will

17:06.400 --> 17:07.360
now take this number

17:07.360 --> 17:08.200
and bring it to scale.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.360
And I'm going to say

17:09.360 --> 17:10.440
Y is equal to self

17:10.440 --> 17:11.720
dot Y and I'm going to

17:11.720 --> 17:13.280
multiply that by self

17:13.280 --> 17:15.520
dot scale. OK, nice.

17:15.840 --> 17:16.960
Now, one other thing

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
I need to do is make

17:17.960 --> 17:18.760
sure that I'm drawing

17:18.760 --> 17:19.480
all of this in the

17:19.480 --> 17:21.040
center of my screen

17:21.280 --> 17:21.920
because I haven't

17:21.920 --> 17:22.760
mentioned yet when

17:22.760 --> 17:23.520
we're talking about

17:23.520 --> 17:25.200
pie game, zero, zero

17:25.200 --> 17:26.080
is actually the top

17:26.080 --> 17:26.920
left hand corner.

17:26.920 --> 17:27.320
So let me just

17:27.320 --> 17:27.920
quickly open the

17:27.920 --> 17:29.280
window here, right

17:29.280 --> 17:30.280
here where my mouse is.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.360
So top left hand corner.

17:31.360 --> 17:32.400
This is zero, zero.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.720
If I go all the way

17:33.720 --> 17:34.840
to the right, this would

17:34.840 --> 17:36.280
be eight hundred zero.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.160
If I go all the way

17:37.160 --> 17:37.800
to the bottom right

17:37.800 --> 17:38.480
hand corner, this would

17:38.480 --> 17:39.480
be eight hundred, eight

17:39.480 --> 17:40.600
hundred. So rather than

17:40.600 --> 17:41.640
having zero zero in the

17:41.640 --> 17:42.320
middle, which you might

17:42.320 --> 17:42.960
be used to, it's the

17:42.960 --> 17:44.280
top left. So I don't

17:44.280 --> 17:45.080
want to draw my stuff

17:45.080 --> 17:45.800
in the top left.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.720
I want to draw it in

17:46.720 --> 17:47.800
the center. So that

17:47.800 --> 17:48.720
means I need to take

17:48.720 --> 17:49.920
every single value I

17:49.920 --> 17:51.560
have. I need to offset

17:51.560 --> 17:52.400
it by the center of

17:52.400 --> 17:53.680
the screen so that we

17:53.680 --> 17:54.760
draw stuff in the

17:54.760 --> 17:55.920
middle. Hopefully that

17:55.920 --> 17:56.880
makes a tiny bit of

17:56.880 --> 17:58.280
sense. But the way we

17:58.280 --> 17:59.920
do this is we say plus

18:00.400 --> 18:01.080
and then this is going

18:01.080 --> 18:02.240
to be width over two,

18:02.920 --> 18:03.600
and then this is going

18:03.600 --> 18:04.640
to be plus. And then

18:04.640 --> 18:05.200
this is going to be

18:05.200 --> 18:06.480
height over two. And

18:06.480 --> 18:07.200
those values are

18:07.200 --> 18:07.960
right here. OK, so the

18:07.960 --> 18:08.600
width and the height.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.480
We could just write

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
four hundred, but I'm

18:10.480 --> 18:11.560
going to do width and

18:11.560 --> 18:12.240
height. So that if we

18:12.240 --> 18:12.960
change the width and

18:12.960 --> 18:13.520
the height, this is

18:13.520 --> 18:14.240
going to update

18:14.280 --> 18:15.920
automatically. OK, so

18:15.920 --> 18:17.080
now we have our X and Y

18:17.360 --> 18:18.120
and now I can actually

18:18.120 --> 18:18.920
draw this onto the

18:18.920 --> 18:20.440
screen. So I'm going to

18:20.440 --> 18:23.800
say pie game dot draw

18:24.480 --> 18:26.040
dot circle. And I'm

18:26.040 --> 18:26.680
going to pass the

18:26.680 --> 18:27.760
window, which is where

18:27.760 --> 18:28.520
we want to draw this

18:28.520 --> 18:29.480
circle. I'm going to

18:29.520 --> 18:30.680
pass the color that I

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
want to draw the

18:31.680 --> 18:32.480
circle in. So this is

18:32.480 --> 18:33.080
going to be self

18:33.080 --> 18:34.520
color. I'm going to

18:34.520 --> 18:35.600
pass the position that

18:35.600 --> 18:36.280
I want to draw it in,

18:36.280 --> 18:36.920
which is going to be

18:36.960 --> 18:37.880
X, Y. That's the

18:37.880 --> 18:39.040
center of the circle.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.160
And then lastly, I'm

18:40.160 --> 18:40.720
going to pass the

18:40.720 --> 18:42.160
radius. So self dot

18:42.160 --> 18:44.120
radius. OK, so now

18:44.120 --> 18:44.560
we're actually going

18:44.560 --> 18:45.560
to draw the circle on

18:45.560 --> 18:46.480
the screen when we

18:46.480 --> 18:47.600
call this draw method.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.640
OK, hopefully this is

18:49.640 --> 18:50.320
all making a bit of

18:50.320 --> 18:51.400
sense. And let's now

18:51.400 --> 18:52.440
go and actually draw a

18:52.440 --> 18:53.840
few planets and

18:53.840 --> 18:54.640
initialize some of

18:54.640 --> 18:56.000
their constants. So the

18:56.000 --> 18:56.800
first planet we probably

18:56.800 --> 18:57.400
want to draw is the

18:57.400 --> 18:59.040
sun. Can you call the

18:59.080 --> 18:59.960
sun a planet? I guess

18:59.960 --> 19:01.520
it's a star. Again, not

19:01.520 --> 19:02.480
a big physics guy, but

19:02.480 --> 19:03.320
the first thing we

19:03.320 --> 19:04.160
want to draw is the

19:04.160 --> 19:05.000
sun. OK, so I'm going

19:05.000 --> 19:06.120
to say sun is equal to

19:06.120 --> 19:07.560
planet. And we're

19:07.560 --> 19:09.160
going to pass zero, zero

19:09.160 --> 19:10.440
for its X, Y. OK, so

19:10.440 --> 19:11.360
zero, zero right here

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
for the radius of the

19:12.960 --> 19:13.880
sun. We can kind of

19:13.880 --> 19:15.040
pick whatever value we

19:15.040 --> 19:16.160
want here. We're just

19:16.160 --> 19:16.720
going to be kind of

19:16.720 --> 19:17.560
randomly picking the

19:17.560 --> 19:18.920
radius is based on

19:18.920 --> 19:20.040
the relative mass of

19:20.040 --> 19:21.160
the planets. So we

19:21.160 --> 19:22.000
want the sun to be the

19:22.000 --> 19:22.760
biggest. And what I

19:22.760 --> 19:23.480
have in my other

19:23.480 --> 19:24.920
program here is 30 for

19:24.920 --> 19:25.680
the radius. So we'll go

19:25.680 --> 19:26.920
with that. And for the

19:26.920 --> 19:27.840
color, I want this to

19:27.840 --> 19:28.960
be yellow. So just

19:29.000 --> 19:29.800
make this a bit easier

19:29.800 --> 19:30.920
to read. I'm going to

19:30.920 --> 19:32.160
define yellow up here

19:32.400 --> 19:33.800
and yellow. Actually,

19:33.800 --> 19:34.600
how do you even make

19:34.600 --> 19:35.640
yellow? Let's look at

19:35.640 --> 19:36.520
this. Yellow is going

19:36.520 --> 19:39.520
to be 255, 255 and

19:39.520 --> 19:40.800
zero. OK, so that's

19:40.800 --> 19:41.880
the RGB value for

19:41.880 --> 19:42.960
yellow. Obviously,

19:42.960 --> 19:43.560
that's the color we

19:43.560 --> 19:44.760
want the sun. So let's

19:44.760 --> 19:46.440
now put the color as

19:46.440 --> 19:47.440
yellow. And then the

19:47.440 --> 19:48.200
last thing we need to

19:48.200 --> 19:49.960
pass is the mass and

19:49.960 --> 19:50.760
the mass. I need to

19:50.760 --> 19:51.680
look at my cheat sheet

19:51.680 --> 19:52.160
here because,

19:52.160 --> 19:52.920
unfortunately, I don't

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
have this memorized

19:54.800 --> 19:55.880
is going to be the

19:55.880 --> 19:57.520
following. Let me

19:57.520 --> 20:00.560
paste this in 1.9 8 8 9

20:00.560 --> 20:02.040
2 times 10 to the

20:02.040 --> 20:03.440
exponent 30. And in

20:03.440 --> 20:04.160
case you're wondering

20:04.160 --> 20:05.560
this is in kilograms.

20:06.160 --> 20:06.640
Again, we're going to

20:06.640 --> 20:07.920
use the accurate masses

20:08.160 --> 20:09.360
on astronomical units

20:09.360 --> 20:10.160
and stuff for all of

20:10.160 --> 20:11.400
these planets. OK, so

20:11.400 --> 20:13.240
that is the sun. And

20:13.240 --> 20:14.080
for the sun, we're just

20:14.080 --> 20:14.960
going to say sun dot

20:14.960 --> 20:16.760
sun is equal to true.

20:17.200 --> 20:17.920
Because remember, we

20:17.920 --> 20:18.840
have this property

20:18.840 --> 20:20.280
here that says sun. And

20:20.280 --> 20:20.720
we're going to make

20:20.720 --> 20:21.560
this true so that we

20:21.560 --> 20:22.920
don't draw the distance

20:22.920 --> 20:24.040
to the sun from the

20:24.040 --> 20:24.840
sun and we don't draw

20:24.840 --> 20:25.680
the orbit for the sun,

20:25.680 --> 20:26.240
which we don't need.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.120
OK, so now that we

20:28.120 --> 20:28.840
have this, let's just

20:28.840 --> 20:29.600
see if we can draw this

20:29.600 --> 20:31.040
on the screen. So

20:31.040 --> 20:34.080
let's go. Planets is

20:34.080 --> 20:34.880
equal to and let's

20:34.880 --> 20:35.680
make a list of all of

20:35.680 --> 20:36.320
the planets, because

20:36.320 --> 20:36.760
we're going to add a

20:36.760 --> 20:38.000
few more. And then

20:38.000 --> 20:39.040
inside of our loop

20:39.040 --> 20:39.960
here, we're going to

20:39.960 --> 20:42.480
say for planet in

20:42.480 --> 20:43.560
planets. And we're

20:43.560 --> 20:44.320
going to say planet

20:44.720 --> 20:46.280
dot draw. And we're

20:46.280 --> 20:46.800
going to pass the

20:46.800 --> 20:47.520
window that we want to

20:47.520 --> 20:48.680
draw it on, which is

20:48.680 --> 20:50.160
win in all capitals.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.880
OK. Nice. And we

20:51.880 --> 20:52.520
also need to make sure

20:52.520 --> 20:53.160
that we're updating

20:53.160 --> 20:53.960
this place. So let's

20:53.960 --> 20:55.680
steal this here. And

20:55.720 --> 20:57.360
let's put it down

20:57.360 --> 20:58.400
there. OK. Nice. So

20:58.400 --> 20:59.120
we're saying for planet

20:59.120 --> 21:00.200
and planet plan to draw

21:00.480 --> 21:01.280
by game display

21:01.280 --> 21:02.640
dot update. Let's see

21:02.640 --> 21:03.800
if this works. Fingers

21:03.800 --> 21:04.600
crossed. Let's run the

21:04.600 --> 21:06.760
code. OK. There we go.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.600
We get a sun in the

21:07.600 --> 21:08.400
middle of the screen.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.360
Very nice. That is

21:09.360 --> 21:10.520
exactly what we want.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.200
All right. Now, the

21:12.200 --> 21:12.920
next thing we want to

21:12.920 --> 21:13.800
do is draw a few more

21:13.800 --> 21:15.080
plans, right? So let's

21:15.080 --> 21:16.360
create earth, mercury,

21:16.360 --> 21:17.600
all of those. OK. So

21:17.600 --> 21:18.000
we're going to start

21:18.000 --> 21:18.720
with earth. I'm going

21:18.720 --> 21:19.640
to say earth is equal

21:19.640 --> 21:21.320
to planet. Now, the

21:21.320 --> 21:22.040
earth is actually

21:22.040 --> 21:23.040
going to be negative

21:23.040 --> 21:25.080
one multiplied by

21:25.440 --> 21:26.760
planet with an all

21:26.760 --> 21:29.360
capital dot a U. This

21:29.360 --> 21:29.840
is going to be the

21:29.840 --> 21:31.080
distance from the sun.

21:31.080 --> 21:31.560
So we're going to put

21:31.560 --> 21:32.480
that as the X

21:32.480 --> 21:33.920
coordinate. And for the

21:33.920 --> 21:34.640
Y coordinate, we're

21:34.640 --> 21:35.200
just going to make it

21:35.200 --> 21:36.160
zero for right now.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.840
The color of the earth

21:37.840 --> 21:38.800
is going to be blue.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.240
We'll write that RGB

21:40.440 --> 21:41.360
variable in a second.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.760
And then the mass of

21:42.760 --> 21:44.560
the earth. Actually,

21:44.560 --> 21:45.120
sorry, we need the

21:45.120 --> 21:47.000
radius as well. Let's

21:47.000 --> 21:47.760
put the radius first.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.400
What was the radius

21:48.400 --> 21:49.920
of the earth? I had

21:49.920 --> 21:50.800
60 in here as the

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
radius. And then the

21:52.800 --> 21:54.280
mass of the earth is

21:54.960 --> 21:56.840
this number. Let me

21:56.840 --> 21:59.600
copy it in 5.9742

22:00.160 --> 22:01.040
times 10 to the

22:01.040 --> 22:02.680
exponent 24. OK. That's

22:02.680 --> 22:03.360
a mass of the earth.

22:04.080 --> 22:04.840
Now, I will actually

22:04.840 --> 22:05.560
mention here before I

22:05.560 --> 22:06.600
continue that there

22:06.600 --> 22:07.840
isn't a great article.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.680
I'm going to open it up

22:08.680 --> 22:09.840
so I can show it to you

22:09.840 --> 22:11.520
guys. Let me get it on

22:11.520 --> 22:12.600
my Google Chrome here

22:13.160 --> 22:13.800
that I'm actually

22:13.800 --> 22:14.960
inspired by making

22:14.960 --> 22:16.040
this program that has

22:16.040 --> 22:17.000
all of these values

22:17.000 --> 22:18.080
already. So this is

22:18.080 --> 22:18.840
the article. Leave it

22:18.840 --> 22:19.920
in the description, but

22:19.920 --> 22:20.480
it essentially

22:20.480 --> 22:21.320
implements the same

22:21.320 --> 22:21.920
thing we're going to

22:21.960 --> 22:23.120
implement here in

22:23.120 --> 22:23.920
turtle. Now, I didn't

22:23.920 --> 22:24.800
want to do it in turtle

22:24.800 --> 22:25.560
because pie game is a

22:25.560 --> 22:26.280
lot better and it's a

22:26.280 --> 22:27.760
lot faster. But if you

22:27.760 --> 22:28.640
look here, all the

22:28.640 --> 22:29.560
values that I'm using

22:29.560 --> 22:30.200
are just coming from

22:30.200 --> 22:30.960
here. Right. So like

22:31.000 --> 22:32.840
the earth mass, the

22:32.840 --> 22:34.000
earth distance, negative

22:34.000 --> 22:35.400
one times a you, the

22:35.400 --> 22:36.600
sun mass, just wanted

22:36.600 --> 22:37.400
to give credit to this

22:37.400 --> 22:38.320
article. I'll leave it

22:38.320 --> 22:39.000
in the description.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.560
Anyways, enough of that.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.600
We have the distance to

22:42.600 --> 22:43.520
the sun, which is this.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.640
We have zero, 16 blue.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
This is the mass. And I

22:47.680 --> 22:48.760
think that's all we need

22:48.760 --> 22:49.880
for the earth right now.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.520
Let's now put earth

22:51.560 --> 22:52.640
inside of here and see

22:52.640 --> 22:53.880
if when we draw it, we

22:53.880 --> 22:55.160
get it in an accurate

22:55.160 --> 22:56.680
position. OK, so let's

22:56.680 --> 22:58.920
run this. And we get

22:58.920 --> 22:59.800
blue is not fine. OK, I

22:59.800 --> 23:00.400
forgot to do that.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.240
Let's define the color

23:01.240 --> 23:02.960
blue. Blue is going to

23:02.960 --> 23:04.600
be equal to. And then I

23:04.600 --> 23:05.400
want kind of a nice

23:05.400 --> 23:07.120
light blue. So I just

23:07.200 --> 23:07.840
picked one of these

23:07.840 --> 23:08.560
before. It's going to be

23:08.560 --> 23:11.880
100 149 237. This is

23:11.880 --> 23:13.040
the RGB value for kind

23:13.040 --> 23:14.400
of a lighter blue. If

23:14.400 --> 23:15.160
you just wanted to be

23:15.160 --> 23:16.080
regular blue, then you

23:16.080 --> 23:17.360
could go zero, zero,

23:17.360 --> 23:18.800
and then 255. And I

23:18.800 --> 23:19.720
give you a nice dark

23:19.720 --> 23:22.080
blue. OK, so let's run

23:22.080 --> 23:23.600
this now and see if

23:23.600 --> 23:24.560
this works. And there

23:24.560 --> 23:26.000
we go. We get the the

23:26.000 --> 23:27.120
earth, which is, you

23:27.120 --> 23:28.560
know, one way from the

23:28.560 --> 23:30.480
sun. Hopefully that

23:30.480 --> 23:31.240
makes sense. But this

23:31.240 --> 23:31.880
is how the scales

23:31.880 --> 23:33.200
working. We put it at

23:33.200 --> 23:34.240
negative one, which

23:34.240 --> 23:34.800
means we're going to

23:34.800 --> 23:35.760
the left. If we put at

23:35.920 --> 23:37.280
one, we would have gone

23:37.280 --> 23:38.280
to the right. Doesn't

23:38.280 --> 23:39.000
really matter where we

23:39.000 --> 23:40.760
started. And there we

23:40.760 --> 23:43.160
go. OK, so now we have

23:43.160 --> 23:44.640
the earth, the next

23:44.640 --> 23:45.480
planet that I want to

23:45.480 --> 23:46.720
do. Let's look here is

23:46.720 --> 23:48.080
going to be Mars. So

23:48.080 --> 23:49.600
let's say Mars is equal

23:49.640 --> 23:51.520
to a planet. Now, the

23:51.520 --> 23:53.880
distance for Mars is

23:53.880 --> 23:55.280
going to be this. Let

23:55.280 --> 23:56.120
me just copy it in.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.840
It's going to be negative

23:57.840 --> 23:58.960
one point five to four

23:58.960 --> 24:01.400
times planet.au. Again,

24:01.400 --> 24:01.960
we're going to put its

24:01.960 --> 24:03.080
Y coordinate at zero.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.880
The radius of Mars,

24:04.960 --> 24:06.160
it's much smaller than

24:06.160 --> 24:06.680
Earth. We're going to

24:06.680 --> 24:08.760
go with 12. It's going

24:08.760 --> 24:09.640
to be red, which I'll

24:09.640 --> 24:11.120
define in a second. And

24:11.120 --> 24:12.280
then the mass of Mars

24:12.280 --> 24:13.040
is a little bit less

24:13.040 --> 24:14.960
than Earth as well. So

24:14.960 --> 24:15.800
that's going to be six

24:15.800 --> 24:16.880
point three nine times

24:16.880 --> 24:17.920
10 to the exponent

24:17.920 --> 24:19.400
twenty three. Now, for

24:19.400 --> 24:20.680
red, we need to define

24:20.680 --> 24:21.840
this. Now, again, I

24:21.840 --> 24:22.720
want to kind of a nice

24:22.720 --> 24:23.640
looking red. So I

24:23.640 --> 24:25.440
picked a custom RGB

24:25.440 --> 24:26.760
value here, and this

24:26.760 --> 24:27.640
value is going to be

24:27.640 --> 24:29.920
one eighty eight thirty

24:29.920 --> 24:33.080
nine and fifty. OK. And

24:33.080 --> 24:34.080
now we have Mars. So

24:34.080 --> 24:34.800
now that we have Mars,

24:34.800 --> 24:35.600
we're going to put Mars

24:35.600 --> 24:37.360
inside of here, and we

24:37.360 --> 24:38.400
should now draw Mars

24:38.400 --> 24:39.040
at the appropriate

24:39.040 --> 24:40.000
scale. So let's look

24:40.000 --> 24:41.560
at this and we see the

24:41.560 --> 24:42.800
Mars over here. So

24:42.800 --> 24:43.560
notice that Mars is

24:43.560 --> 24:44.320
kind of right by the

24:44.320 --> 24:45.760
border. I'm fine with

24:45.760 --> 24:46.560
that. But if you wanted

24:46.560 --> 24:47.400
to move everything in

24:47.440 --> 24:48.600
closer, then what you

24:48.600 --> 24:50.960
would do is reduce

24:50.960 --> 24:52.000
this number right here.

24:52.040 --> 24:52.800
So rather than doing

24:52.800 --> 24:53.760
250, you would do

24:53.760 --> 24:55.360
something like 200. And

24:55.360 --> 24:56.280
you're going to notice

24:56.440 --> 24:57.120
this is going to move

24:57.120 --> 24:57.800
us in a little bit

24:57.800 --> 24:58.720
closer. So that's kind

24:58.720 --> 24:59.400
of how you can mess

24:59.400 --> 25:00.640
with things. Just make

25:00.640 --> 25:01.240
the number here

25:01.240 --> 25:02.400
smaller. If you want

25:02.400 --> 25:02.960
everything to get

25:02.960 --> 25:04.840
closer to the sun. OK,

25:04.840 --> 25:05.800
so we'll go to 50

25:05.800 --> 25:07.520
AU for now. All right.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.400
So now we have Mars.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.480
Let's do our other

25:09.480 --> 25:10.800
planets. So the other

25:10.800 --> 25:12.200
planets we have is

25:12.200 --> 25:13.360
Mercury. This is going

25:13.360 --> 25:14.960
to be equal to planet

25:15.800 --> 25:17.280
this distance.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
This is the closest

25:18.280 --> 25:19.720
one to the sun.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.440
My understanding is at

25:21.440 --> 25:22.680
least this is going to

25:22.680 --> 25:23.880
be zero. We're going

25:23.880 --> 25:24.680
to have to make this

25:24.680 --> 25:25.440
smaller. So we're going

25:25.440 --> 25:26.840
to go to zero. The

25:26.840 --> 25:27.440
color is going to be

25:27.440 --> 25:28.280
dark gray, which

25:28.280 --> 25:29.120
will implement in the

25:29.120 --> 25:30.720
second. And then the

25:30.720 --> 25:31.880
mass. Let me just

25:31.880 --> 25:34.320
copy this in is going

25:34.320 --> 25:37.160
to be 0.3 30 times

25:37.160 --> 25:38.720
10 to the exponent 24.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.480
If you wanted to be

25:39.480 --> 25:40.320
consistent, we could go

25:40.320 --> 25:42.240
3.3 times 10 to the

25:42.240 --> 25:43.800
exponent 23. That

25:43.800 --> 25:44.560
gives us the same thing.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.560
OK, so let's implement

25:45.560 --> 25:47.080
dark gray now. So let's

25:47.080 --> 25:48.320
go up to colors.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.680
Dark gray is equal to

25:51.720 --> 25:52.920
and then what did I

25:52.920 --> 25:53.880
have dark gray at?

25:53.880 --> 25:54.960
Let me just look here.

25:55.480 --> 25:59.000
This is going to be 80 71.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.520
No, 78 and 81.

26:02.200 --> 26:02.920
Getting a mess with these

26:02.920 --> 26:03.600
colors. If you want,

26:03.600 --> 26:04.320
I'm just picking some

26:04.320 --> 26:05.200
custom ones that look

26:05.200 --> 26:05.840
a little bit nicer.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.040
OK, so now we have

26:07.040 --> 26:08.040
Mercury. So let's put

26:08.560 --> 26:10.360
Mercury in here and we

26:10.360 --> 26:11.400
can just go right on

26:11.440 --> 26:12.600
to Venus, which I

26:12.600 --> 26:13.800
believe is next planet.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.560
So we're going to say

26:14.560 --> 26:15.880
Venus is equal to

26:15.880 --> 26:17.960
planet. It's distance

26:17.960 --> 26:20.320
is going to be 0.7 to

26:20.320 --> 26:23.760
3 times planet.au.

26:24.240 --> 26:24.920
In case you're wondering

26:24.920 --> 26:26.560
planet.au is referencing

26:26.560 --> 26:27.440
this right here, just

26:27.440 --> 26:28.240
because it's inside of

26:28.240 --> 26:30.000
the planet class. OK,

26:30.040 --> 26:31.520
so planet.au, we're going

26:31.520 --> 26:32.920
to have zero. This is

26:32.920 --> 26:33.680
a little bit larger.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.080
So we're going to have a

26:34.080 --> 26:35.760
14. The color of this

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
will just be a regular

26:36.760 --> 26:38.560
white. And then the mass

26:38.600 --> 26:39.480
is going to be this.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.320
Let me copy it in 4.8685

26:43.360 --> 26:44.560
times 10 to the exponent

26:44.560 --> 26:46.200
of 24. OK, let me zoom

26:46.200 --> 26:46.920
in so you guys can read

26:46.920 --> 26:47.800
that a little bit better.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.480
Let's now put Venus in

26:50.480 --> 26:52.280
the list. And let me go

26:52.280 --> 26:53.280
ahead and run this and

26:53.280 --> 26:54.040
see if we're getting all

26:54.040 --> 26:56.760
of our plants. OK, nice.

26:56.800 --> 26:57.480
So there we go. And I've

26:57.480 --> 26:58.200
just put the plants on

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
different sides. Again,

26:59.200 --> 27:00.080
you can kind of put put

27:00.080 --> 27:00.800
them wherever you want.

27:00.800 --> 27:01.440
Doesn't really matter.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.160
We could put them all in

27:02.160 --> 27:03.080
the same side and have

27:03.080 --> 27:04.200
them move at the same time.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
I'm just staggering them a

27:05.400 --> 27:07.040
bit. Maybe some of you

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
will have issue with that

27:08.040 --> 27:08.920
based on your physics

27:08.920 --> 27:10.080
knowledge. This is what

27:10.080 --> 27:10.880
we're going to do for

27:10.880 --> 27:12.200
right now. OK, there we

27:12.200 --> 27:13.040
go. We have all of our

27:13.040 --> 27:14.400
plants. So now that we

27:14.400 --> 27:15.440
have all of our planets,

27:15.920 --> 27:16.760
the next thing we need to

27:16.760 --> 27:17.840
do is start moving them.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.240
Now, moving them is

27:19.240 --> 27:20.440
complicated. But again,

27:20.440 --> 27:21.240
as I mentioned, we're

27:21.240 --> 27:22.040
going to be moving them

27:22.040 --> 27:23.440
by their X velocity and

27:23.440 --> 27:24.960
their Y velocity. But we

27:24.960 --> 27:25.920
need to determine what

27:25.920 --> 27:27.080
those velocities are.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.160
And those velocities are

27:28.160 --> 27:29.280
determined by the force

27:29.280 --> 27:30.760
of attraction. So

27:30.760 --> 27:31.600
essentially the force of

27:31.600 --> 27:32.760
gravity between the

27:32.760 --> 27:33.960
different planets. All

27:33.960 --> 27:34.480
right. So I'm going to

27:34.480 --> 27:35.720
start explaining the math

27:35.720 --> 27:36.600
that's going to go on here

27:36.600 --> 27:37.560
to actually move the

27:37.560 --> 27:39.200
planets around the sun.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
And before I can do that,

27:40.400 --> 27:41.280
I just want to give you a

27:41.280 --> 27:42.600
general understanding of

27:42.600 --> 27:44.320
gravity and how planets

27:44.320 --> 27:45.400
actually orbit around the

27:45.400 --> 27:46.080
sun, in case you're

27:46.080 --> 27:47.840
unfamiliar. So the reason

27:47.840 --> 27:49.320
why when we jump up, we

27:49.320 --> 27:50.080
fall down. And when we

27:50.080 --> 27:51.240
throw a ball up, it comes

27:51.240 --> 27:52.480
down is because of gravity.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.040
Now, we all know gravity,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.600
but gravity is relative

27:55.600 --> 27:57.120
to different objects. OK.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.480
So all objects are

27:58.480 --> 27:59.600
actually attracting one

27:59.600 --> 28:00.920
another. And the force of

28:00.920 --> 28:01.880
attraction that they have

28:01.880 --> 28:03.080
on one another is based

28:03.080 --> 28:04.320
on the mass of those

28:04.320 --> 28:05.760
objects. Now, this only

28:05.760 --> 28:07.080
really becomes relevant

28:07.080 --> 28:08.200
when you have very, very

28:08.200 --> 28:09.520
massive objects like

28:09.600 --> 28:10.880
planets. So when we're

28:10.880 --> 28:11.560
talking about something

28:11.560 --> 28:13.160
like Earth, this a massive

28:13.160 --> 28:14.240
body, right? Is something

28:14.240 --> 28:16.480
like, you know, six to six

28:16.480 --> 28:17.440
multiplied by 10 to the

28:17.440 --> 28:18.840
exponent, 24 kilograms

28:19.000 --> 28:19.960
or whatever the number is.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.200
It's a very, very massive

28:21.200 --> 28:22.880
body. So relative to our

28:22.880 --> 28:24.080
mass, which is maybe 60

28:24.080 --> 28:25.280
kilograms, 70 kilograms,

28:25.280 --> 28:26.440
80 kilograms, whatever it

28:26.440 --> 28:28.320
is, it's way, way larger.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.720
So it actually exerts a

28:29.720 --> 28:31.240
massive force on us that

28:31.240 --> 28:32.560
pulls us downwards

28:32.560 --> 28:34.280
towards the earth. Now,

28:34.280 --> 28:35.560
what actually determines

28:35.560 --> 28:36.680
the strength of this force

28:36.800 --> 28:38.360
is the distance from us

28:38.360 --> 28:39.960
to the center of the earth.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.120
Hence why when you go up

28:41.120 --> 28:42.160
in space, you have zero

28:42.160 --> 28:42.920
gravity because you're

28:42.920 --> 28:44.480
much further away from

28:44.480 --> 28:46.400
the earth. Now, all objects

28:46.400 --> 28:47.920
again, exert forces on

28:47.920 --> 28:48.600
each other. And those

28:48.600 --> 28:49.680
forces depend on the two

28:49.680 --> 28:50.920
masses of the objects, as

28:50.920 --> 28:52.120
well as the distance of

28:52.120 --> 28:53.240
the objects. But if you're

28:53.240 --> 28:54.240
just naively looking at

28:54.240 --> 28:55.240
this equation here, which

28:55.240 --> 28:56.200
is actually the force of

28:56.200 --> 28:57.440
attraction, you'll see

28:57.440 --> 28:58.760
that the distance between

28:58.760 --> 28:59.560
the center of the two

28:59.560 --> 29:00.920
objects is the most

29:00.920 --> 29:02.120
important when it comes

29:02.120 --> 29:03.320
to what type of the force,

29:03.360 --> 29:04.160
what type of force you're

29:04.160 --> 29:05.080
going to get, because it's

29:05.080 --> 29:06.560
R squared. So the further

29:06.560 --> 29:08.560
away you go, exponentially,

29:08.560 --> 29:09.520
the less gravity you're

29:09.520 --> 29:10.600
going to have the closer

29:10.600 --> 29:11.760
you get exponentially,

29:11.760 --> 29:12.840
the more gravity you're

29:12.840 --> 29:13.800
going to get. Now, again,

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
I'm not a physics major,

29:14.800 --> 29:15.840
so take everything with a

29:15.840 --> 29:16.680
grain of salt here.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.560
That's the basic

29:17.560 --> 29:18.720
understanding of gravity.

29:19.120 --> 29:19.840
Now, when we're talking

29:19.840 --> 29:20.800
about planets, we're

29:20.800 --> 29:22.320
talking about multiple

29:22.440 --> 29:24.320
massive objects that

29:24.320 --> 29:25.440
are moving around each

29:25.440 --> 29:26.840
other. So when we talk

29:26.840 --> 29:27.880
about an object like

29:27.920 --> 29:29.280
earth here, right? The

29:29.280 --> 29:30.480
earth is moving at a

29:30.480 --> 29:31.800
constant velocity. Well,

29:31.840 --> 29:32.920
not necessarily constant,

29:32.920 --> 29:33.920
but it's moving at a

29:33.960 --> 29:35.000
relatively constant

29:35.000 --> 29:36.280
velocity around the sun.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.680
Now, what forces it to

29:37.680 --> 29:39.520
move around the sun is

29:39.560 --> 29:40.800
gravity. So the earth is

29:40.800 --> 29:42.240
already on a trajectory

29:42.240 --> 29:44.040
moving in the x direction.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.400
OK, so it has some speed

29:45.400 --> 29:46.680
going in the x direction.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.360
And then there is a force

29:48.360 --> 29:50.000
pulling it towards the sun.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.760
That force is gravity or

29:51.760 --> 29:53.120
the attraction between

29:53.120 --> 29:54.040
the earth and the sun.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.120
Now, the reason why

29:55.120 --> 29:56.440
there's an attraction is

29:56.440 --> 29:57.840
because the sun is much,

29:57.840 --> 29:59.040
much larger than the earth.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.200
If the earth was larger

30:00.200 --> 30:00.920
than the sun, then the

30:00.920 --> 30:01.760
sun would be orbiting

30:01.760 --> 30:03.160
around it. Great example.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.120
If you think of the moon,

30:04.120 --> 30:05.040
right, the moon is much

30:05.040 --> 30:05.800
smaller than the earth.

30:06.000 --> 30:06.840
It's very close to the

30:06.840 --> 30:08.080
earth. And so it orbits

30:08.120 --> 30:10.120
around the earth.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.480
OK, hopefully this is

30:11.480 --> 30:12.280
making a little bit of

30:12.280 --> 30:13.640
sense. But the idea is

30:13.640 --> 30:14.840
that you have some force

30:15.160 --> 30:16.640
and that force,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.040
essentially, is causing

30:18.040 --> 30:19.120
the earth to move around

30:19.120 --> 30:20.200
the sun. And the reason

30:20.200 --> 30:21.080
why the earth doesn't just

30:21.080 --> 30:22.640
shoot directly towards

30:22.640 --> 30:23.480
the sun, like we shoot

30:23.480 --> 30:24.680
directly down on earth

30:24.680 --> 30:25.680
when we jump up is

30:25.680 --> 30:26.760
because it already has

30:26.760 --> 30:27.800
momentum moving in

30:27.800 --> 30:28.600
another direction.

30:28.840 --> 30:29.880
And so there's multiple

30:29.880 --> 30:30.840
forces affecting it,

30:31.080 --> 30:32.160
causing it to go in an

30:32.160 --> 30:33.240
orbit. Again, very

30:33.240 --> 30:34.360
simplified explanation

30:34.360 --> 30:35.080
of what's going on.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.200
But hopefully that makes

30:36.200 --> 30:37.240
a bit of sense. Now, the

30:37.240 --> 30:38.160
reason I'm saying this

30:38.200 --> 30:39.080
is because we have

30:39.080 --> 30:40.360
multiple planets that

30:40.360 --> 30:41.120
are orbiting around

30:41.120 --> 30:41.680
the earth, right?

30:41.680 --> 30:42.520
Maybe we have another

30:42.520 --> 30:43.720
planet. I know I

30:43.720 --> 30:44.240
probably shouldn't have

30:44.240 --> 30:44.920
drawn it in blue.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
But the point is there's

30:46.240 --> 30:47.160
a distance between

30:47.160 --> 30:48.080
these two planets, and

30:48.080 --> 30:49.040
they also have a force

30:49.040 --> 30:49.920
of attraction on each

30:49.920 --> 30:51.000
other. And that's why

30:51.000 --> 30:51.520
you're going to have

30:51.520 --> 30:52.880
different orbits and

30:52.880 --> 30:54.560
different speeds based

30:54.560 --> 30:55.280
on the location of

30:55.280 --> 30:56.440
other planets and kind

30:56.440 --> 30:57.240
of their orbital

30:57.240 --> 30:58.600
trajectory. So if you

30:58.600 --> 30:59.760
have two planets here,

30:59.760 --> 31:00.640
as well as a planet

31:00.640 --> 31:01.600
here, well, this guy's

31:01.600 --> 31:02.560
still orbiting around

31:02.560 --> 31:03.200
the sun, because the

31:03.200 --> 31:04.200
sun is much larger

31:04.200 --> 31:05.240
than him, but he's going

31:05.240 --> 31:06.480
to be orbiting slower

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
than the earth is

31:07.680 --> 31:08.480
because he's not as

31:08.480 --> 31:09.800
close. However, the

31:09.800 --> 31:10.520
earth is going to be

31:10.560 --> 31:11.720
attracting or having

31:11.720 --> 31:12.360
some force of

31:12.360 --> 31:13.160
attraction on this

31:13.160 --> 31:14.080
planet, and this

31:14.080 --> 31:14.680
planet is going to have

31:14.680 --> 31:15.800
some force of attraction

31:15.800 --> 31:17.000
on the earth. And so

31:17.000 --> 31:18.360
you need to take that

31:18.360 --> 31:19.040
into account when

31:19.040 --> 31:19.640
you're actually

31:19.640 --> 31:20.240
calculating the

31:20.240 --> 31:21.120
different orbits of

31:21.120 --> 31:22.760
the planets. All right.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.760
I know this is a lot.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.400
Very, very math and

31:25.400 --> 31:26.600
physics has heavy here,

31:26.600 --> 31:27.680
but the idea is every

31:27.680 --> 31:28.920
single object exhibits

31:28.920 --> 31:29.840
some force on each

31:29.840 --> 31:30.720
other. And we need to

31:30.720 --> 31:31.680
calculate what all of

31:31.680 --> 31:33.000
those forces are when

31:33.000 --> 31:33.840
we are actually

31:33.880 --> 31:35.000
determining the orbit

31:35.200 --> 31:36.200
so that we are going

31:36.200 --> 31:36.880
to be orbiting

31:36.960 --> 31:38.000
appropriate to where

31:38.000 --> 31:38.960
the other planets are.

31:38.960 --> 31:39.640
So we can't just

31:39.640 --> 31:40.400
calculate the force

31:40.440 --> 31:41.600
to the sun. We need to

31:41.600 --> 31:42.400
also calculate the

31:42.400 --> 31:43.040
force to the other

31:43.040 --> 31:44.000
planets, and that's

31:44.000 --> 31:44.520
going to give us a

31:44.520 --> 31:45.320
somewhat elliptical

31:45.320 --> 31:47.160
orbit as well. OK.

31:47.920 --> 31:48.920
Hopefully this makes a

31:48.920 --> 31:49.600
little bit of sense.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.400
Now let's talk about

31:50.400 --> 31:51.760
how we actually do

31:51.760 --> 31:53.080
this. So as I kind

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
of already hinted at,

31:54.080 --> 31:55.080
if you look to the

31:55.080 --> 31:56.400
left of my screen,

31:56.880 --> 31:57.600
you can see that I

31:57.600 --> 31:58.840
have the equation here

31:58.840 --> 32:00.080
for the force of

32:00.120 --> 32:00.960
attraction between

32:00.960 --> 32:02.600
two objects. Now, this

32:02.600 --> 32:03.400
force is the

32:03.400 --> 32:04.640
straight line force

32:04.640 --> 32:05.640
between two objects.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.320
So let me just move

32:06.320 --> 32:07.200
the earth a bit here.

32:07.640 --> 32:08.600
So I can explain kind

32:08.600 --> 32:09.440
of what I mean by that

32:09.440 --> 32:10.240
and why we need to do

32:10.240 --> 32:10.680
a little bit of

32:10.680 --> 32:12.280
trigonometry. So let's

32:12.280 --> 32:13.120
say we have the earth

32:13.120 --> 32:15.400
over here. This will

32:15.400 --> 32:16.880
say is the force of

32:16.880 --> 32:17.680
gravity or the force

32:17.680 --> 32:18.520
of attraction between

32:18.520 --> 32:19.240
the two objects. Now

32:19.240 --> 32:20.240
to calculate this is

32:20.240 --> 32:21.440
fairly simple. We just

32:21.440 --> 32:22.400
need to first calculate

32:22.400 --> 32:23.280
the distance between

32:23.280 --> 32:24.160
the two objects, which

32:24.160 --> 32:25.840
we can do. We then

32:25.840 --> 32:26.600
need to know the masses,

32:26.600 --> 32:27.320
which we already know

32:27.560 --> 32:28.920
and the gravitational

32:28.920 --> 32:29.800
constant, which we know

32:29.800 --> 32:30.840
as well. So let's say

32:30.840 --> 32:31.440
we know the force.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.400
Well, if we know the

32:32.400 --> 32:33.360
force, the issue is

32:33.360 --> 32:34.040
it's giving us the

32:34.040 --> 32:35.440
straight line force.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.440
We want to break this

32:37.440 --> 32:38.920
force into two

32:38.960 --> 32:40.400
components so that we

32:40.400 --> 32:41.920
are able to move the

32:41.920 --> 32:43.720
earth in an X direction,

32:44.120 --> 32:45.640
as well as a Y direction.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.800
So we need to kind of

32:46.800 --> 32:47.680
understand this, that

32:47.680 --> 32:48.360
it's giving us the

32:48.360 --> 32:49.240
straight line force.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.360
We need to break that

32:50.360 --> 32:51.600
force into X and Y

32:51.600 --> 32:52.840
components so we can

32:52.840 --> 32:54.160
actually move the earth

32:54.160 --> 32:55.160
around the sun in both

32:55.160 --> 32:56.240
the X and the Y

32:56.240 --> 32:57.720
direction. Now, this is

32:57.720 --> 32:58.400
the same way that we're

32:58.400 --> 32:59.200
going to calculate the

32:59.200 --> 33:00.720
distance. It's very

33:00.720 --> 33:01.640
easy for us to actually

33:01.640 --> 33:02.440
find the distance

33:02.440 --> 33:03.640
because we're looking

33:03.640 --> 33:04.440
for. Let me just

33:04.440 --> 33:05.440
redraw all of this,

33:05.880 --> 33:06.600
this right here. So

33:06.600 --> 33:07.120
this is going to be

33:07.160 --> 33:08.480
R. We don't know what

33:08.480 --> 33:10.800
R is, but we know what

33:10.800 --> 33:12.280
the Y distances and

33:12.280 --> 33:13.680
the X distance distances

33:13.680 --> 33:14.800
between these two points

33:14.800 --> 33:15.480
because for both these

33:15.480 --> 33:16.760
points, we have an X and

33:16.760 --> 33:17.920
a Y, right? So we have

33:17.920 --> 33:20.360
like X two and Y two.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.320
So if we know both of

33:21.320 --> 33:22.520
those points, we can

33:22.520 --> 33:23.480
calculate the difference

33:23.480 --> 33:24.560
in X and the difference

33:24.560 --> 33:25.600
in Y. And then to

33:25.600 --> 33:26.800
figure out what R is

33:26.800 --> 33:27.760
relative to our right

33:27.760 --> 33:29.080
triangle here, what

33:29.080 --> 33:29.920
equation do we use?

33:29.920 --> 33:30.840
Well, Pythagorean

33:30.840 --> 33:31.960
theorem. I know I

33:31.960 --> 33:32.800
completely butchered

33:32.800 --> 33:34.120
that that name, but

33:34.320 --> 33:35.280
it's going to be X squared

33:35.280 --> 33:36.560
plus Y squared. Take the

33:36.560 --> 33:37.680
root of that and that's

33:37.680 --> 33:39.160
going to give us R. OK,

33:39.160 --> 33:39.880
so we are able to

33:39.880 --> 33:40.840
calculate R. Then

33:40.840 --> 33:41.480
obviously we can take

33:41.480 --> 33:42.920
the square. So once we

33:42.920 --> 33:43.840
do that, we calculate

33:43.840 --> 33:44.680
the distance, then

33:44.680 --> 33:45.400
we're going to calculate

33:45.400 --> 33:46.360
the force and then we

33:46.360 --> 33:46.960
need to go in the

33:46.960 --> 33:48.080
opposite direction

33:48.080 --> 33:49.840
from the force back

33:49.840 --> 33:51.600
to the X and Y components.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.760
OK, so let's redraw this.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.000
So now let's say we know

33:55.000 --> 33:56.880
the force. OK. And again,

33:56.880 --> 33:57.760
we need to split this

33:57.760 --> 33:59.600
into X and Y. So we

33:59.600 --> 34:00.720
need to have, I guess,

34:00.720 --> 34:03.680
F X and F Y. Now, the

34:03.680 --> 34:04.600
way that we do this is

34:04.600 --> 34:05.440
we need to calculate

34:05.440 --> 34:07.120
the angle here, because

34:07.120 --> 34:07.960
if we have any two

34:07.960 --> 34:09.040
aspects of a triangle,

34:09.040 --> 34:09.840
so if we have one

34:09.840 --> 34:10.880
side length and an

34:10.880 --> 34:11.920
angle and it's a right

34:11.920 --> 34:13.080
angle triangle, we can

34:13.080 --> 34:13.920
calculate any other

34:13.920 --> 34:14.920
angle or any other

34:14.920 --> 34:15.760
side length, right?

34:15.760 --> 34:16.520
That's just a property

34:16.520 --> 34:17.280
of a right triangle.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.600
So we know F and we

34:18.600 --> 34:19.640
should know this angle.

34:19.720 --> 34:20.440
And the reason we know

34:20.440 --> 34:21.320
this angle is because

34:21.320 --> 34:23.720
we know X and we know

34:23.720 --> 34:25.040
why. So the way we

34:25.040 --> 34:26.680
calculate this angle is

34:26.680 --> 34:28.000
we take the arc tangent,

34:28.160 --> 34:29.880
so the tan inverse of

34:30.400 --> 34:32.200
Y over X. Now, to

34:32.200 --> 34:33.400
derive why this is

34:33.400 --> 34:34.120
going to give us the

34:34.120 --> 34:35.600
angle, theta, let's

34:35.600 --> 34:36.960
look at the equation

34:37.680 --> 34:40.080
of tan of theta is

34:40.080 --> 34:41.000
equal to. And then

34:41.000 --> 34:41.520
this is going to be

34:41.520 --> 34:43.280
the opposite over the

34:43.280 --> 34:44.240
adjacent. Now, I like

34:44.240 --> 34:45.240
to remember this as

34:45.280 --> 34:47.440
Toa. OK, but this is

34:47.440 --> 34:48.880
the equation. You know,

34:48.880 --> 34:49.840
this is a property of a

34:49.840 --> 34:51.160
right triangle. So if I

34:51.160 --> 34:52.560
have tan theta is equal

34:52.560 --> 34:53.400
to the opposite over

34:53.400 --> 34:54.120
the adjacent, and

34:54.120 --> 34:54.720
we're talking about

34:54.720 --> 34:55.880
this right here, the

34:55.880 --> 34:56.960
opposite side length is

34:56.960 --> 34:58.520
why the adjacent side

34:58.520 --> 35:00.560
length is X. And so we

35:00.560 --> 35:01.280
can kind of sub those

35:01.280 --> 35:02.480
values in, right? And we

35:02.520 --> 35:04.800
get Y and X. If we want

35:04.800 --> 35:06.080
to isolate for theta, we

35:06.080 --> 35:07.080
need to take the inverse

35:07.080 --> 35:08.040
tangent. So that's what

35:08.040 --> 35:09.320
we do. We take tan inverse

35:09.320 --> 35:10.920
of Y over X. That gives

35:10.920 --> 35:12.320
us theta. OK, so now

35:12.320 --> 35:13.400
that we know theta, we

35:13.400 --> 35:14.520
can now use theta to

35:14.520 --> 35:16.680
calculate what the F force

35:16.680 --> 35:18.080
component is or the X

35:18.200 --> 35:19.640
force component is as

35:19.640 --> 35:20.600
well as the Y force

35:20.600 --> 35:22.320
component. So to do

35:22.320 --> 35:23.320
that, we need to use

35:23.320 --> 35:24.120
some other properties.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.720
So we have a property.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.320
It is so let me write

35:28.320 --> 35:29.920
this property. So

35:30.640 --> 35:32.800
katoa, this is the way

35:32.800 --> 35:33.560
that I always remember

35:33.560 --> 35:35.280
these, but we can say

35:35.640 --> 35:37.680
that the sign of theta

35:37.840 --> 35:38.720
is equal to the

35:38.720 --> 35:40.080
opposite over the

35:40.080 --> 35:41.320
hypotenuse. And since

35:41.320 --> 35:41.960
we're looking for the

35:41.960 --> 35:43.520
opposite, which is F Y,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.200
we can say sign of the

35:45.200 --> 35:46.120
angle theta, which we

35:46.120 --> 35:47.800
know is equal to the F

35:47.800 --> 35:49.920
of Y over H. H is F.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.120
We know F and we're

35:51.120 --> 35:53.120
able to find what F of

35:53.120 --> 35:54.440
Y is by just isolating

35:54.440 --> 35:55.680
for F of Y. So multiplying

35:55.680 --> 35:57.360
F by sine theta. And

35:57.360 --> 35:58.280
then same thing. If we

35:58.280 --> 35:59.480
want to find what F X

35:59.520 --> 36:01.200
is, we can say F X is

36:01.200 --> 36:02.440
equal to this is going

36:02.440 --> 36:04.040
to be the coast of theta

36:04.680 --> 36:06.720
multiplied by F. That

36:06.720 --> 36:07.640
will give us the F X

36:07.640 --> 36:08.880
component. And then once

36:08.880 --> 36:09.840
we know the X and Y

36:09.840 --> 36:10.880
velocity, we can very

36:10.880 --> 36:12.120
easily move this around

36:12.120 --> 36:13.480
the sun. All right.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.280
Math lesson is now

36:15.280 --> 36:17.120
over. Hopefully I

36:17.120 --> 36:18.360
didn't confuse you too

36:18.360 --> 36:19.560
badly. Again, I'm trying

36:19.560 --> 36:20.480
to squeeze in what is

36:20.480 --> 36:21.640
probably taught an entire

36:21.640 --> 36:23.560
year of grade 12 physics

36:23.720 --> 36:25.360
in about 10 minutes. But

36:25.360 --> 36:26.240
that is the math that

36:26.240 --> 36:27.240
we need to understand to

36:27.240 --> 36:28.400
be able to move these

36:28.440 --> 36:29.720
objects around. Can't

36:29.720 --> 36:30.320
really make it much

36:30.320 --> 36:31.240
simpler than that. If

36:31.240 --> 36:31.840
you don't understand

36:31.840 --> 36:32.840
basic trigonometry,

36:32.840 --> 36:33.840
then I'm sure this was

36:33.840 --> 36:35.160
a lot, but you can

36:35.160 --> 36:35.920
kind of just trust the

36:35.920 --> 36:36.960
properties that I showed

36:36.960 --> 36:37.840
you here and I will

36:37.840 --> 36:38.400
show you how to

36:38.400 --> 36:39.280
implement them in code.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.240
You don't understand

36:40.280 --> 36:41.120
totally fine. You can

36:41.120 --> 36:42.000
still follow along and

36:42.000 --> 36:42.920
you will have a working

36:42.920 --> 36:44.080
simulation. With that

36:44.080 --> 36:45.320
said, let's go back to

36:45.320 --> 36:46.200
the code. All right. So

36:46.200 --> 36:47.680
I'm back in the code and

36:47.680 --> 36:49.200
it is time to do some

36:49.200 --> 36:50.720
math inside of code. Now

36:50.720 --> 36:51.280
I know we just did a

36:51.280 --> 36:51.960
lot of math, but now

36:51.960 --> 36:52.880
we're doing it in code.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.440
Hopefully that gave

36:54.440 --> 36:55.160
you an explanation of

36:55.160 --> 36:55.920
what I'm about to write

36:55.920 --> 36:57.320
here. So I'm on my

36:57.360 --> 36:58.680
planet class and I'm

36:58.680 --> 36:59.280
going to write a

36:59.280 --> 37:00.240
method that will

37:00.240 --> 37:01.520
calculate the force of

37:01.520 --> 37:03.280
attraction between

37:03.360 --> 37:05.400
another object and the

37:05.400 --> 37:06.560
current object. Okay.

37:07.120 --> 37:07.600
So I'm going to say

37:07.760 --> 37:10.000
define attraction like

37:10.000 --> 37:10.880
that. I'm going to

37:10.880 --> 37:12.040
take in self and I'm

37:12.040 --> 37:12.600
going to take in an

37:12.600 --> 37:14.320
other object. Now the

37:14.320 --> 37:14.960
other is going to be

37:14.960 --> 37:16.000
another planet. Okay.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.480
So the first thing I'm

37:17.480 --> 37:18.640
going to do is say that

37:18.640 --> 37:20.080
my other underscore X

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
other underscore Y is

37:22.920 --> 37:24.480
equal to other dot X

37:25.400 --> 37:28.360
and other dot Y. Okay.

37:28.800 --> 37:29.880
Now, the first thing we

37:29.880 --> 37:30.800
need to do here is we

37:30.800 --> 37:31.680
need to calculate the

37:31.680 --> 37:33.120
distance between the

37:33.120 --> 37:34.280
current object and the

37:34.280 --> 37:35.680
other object. So let's

37:35.680 --> 37:36.600
do that. We're going to

37:36.600 --> 37:38.000
say the distance in X

37:38.240 --> 37:39.680
is equal to, and this is

37:39.680 --> 37:40.520
going to be the other

37:40.520 --> 37:43.640
X minus the self dot X.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.840
Okay. And then the

37:44.840 --> 37:46.640
distance in Y is going

37:46.640 --> 37:47.320
to be equal to the

37:47.320 --> 37:50.120
other Y minus the

37:50.120 --> 37:51.360
self dot Y. Now it

37:51.360 --> 37:52.120
doesn't matter if you

37:52.120 --> 37:53.160
take the self dot X and

37:53.160 --> 37:54.000
subtract it from other

37:54.040 --> 37:55.360
dot X. It doesn't matter

37:55.360 --> 37:56.080
what way you do it. It's

37:56.080 --> 37:56.800
going to give us the

37:57.560 --> 37:58.440
the magnitude, which is

37:58.440 --> 37:59.800
what we, which is what

37:59.800 --> 38:01.160
we want. Sorry, because

38:01.160 --> 38:02.880
once we take the square

38:02.880 --> 38:03.640
of both these values,

38:03.640 --> 38:04.000
we're going to get a

38:04.000 --> 38:04.840
positive value, no

38:04.840 --> 38:06.480
matter what. So I have

38:06.480 --> 38:07.200
the distance X and the

38:07.200 --> 38:08.480
distance Y. Now I'm

38:08.480 --> 38:10.120
going to say distance is

38:10.160 --> 38:12.320
equal to, and this is

38:12.320 --> 38:15.680
going to be the math dot

38:15.720 --> 38:19.240
sqrt of the distance X

38:19.240 --> 38:21.160
to the exponent to plus

38:21.160 --> 38:23.560
the distance Y to the

38:23.600 --> 38:24.800
exponent to. Okay. Let

38:24.800 --> 38:25.520
me just check and make

38:25.520 --> 38:26.080
sure I haven't messed

38:26.080 --> 38:27.320
this up yet. Looks

38:27.320 --> 38:28.320
good. We have found the

38:28.320 --> 38:29.800
distance. Okay. Now the

38:29.800 --> 38:30.320
first thing I'm going to

38:30.320 --> 38:31.200
do is I'm going to say

38:31.280 --> 38:33.880
if the other dot sun,

38:34.320 --> 38:35.520
then I'm going to say

38:36.800 --> 38:38.400
the self dot distance to

38:38.400 --> 38:39.880
sun is equal to distance.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.360
Now the reason I'm doing

38:41.360 --> 38:42.560
this is because if the

38:42.560 --> 38:43.360
other object that we're

38:43.360 --> 38:44.480
calculating the force of

38:44.480 --> 38:45.360
attraction with is the

38:45.360 --> 38:46.840
sun, I just calculated

38:46.840 --> 38:48.000
the distance to the sun.

38:48.240 --> 38:48.680
And I just want to

38:48.680 --> 38:49.720
update the distance to

38:49.720 --> 38:51.240
sun property here so that

38:51.240 --> 38:52.360
I can use that when I

38:52.400 --> 38:53.560
actually want to draw

38:53.640 --> 38:54.640
the distance to the sun

38:54.680 --> 38:56.160
on top of the plan. Again,

38:56.160 --> 38:56.840
we're just checking is

38:56.840 --> 38:57.440
the other object, the

38:57.440 --> 38:58.640
sun. If it is, okay, we

38:58.640 --> 38:59.400
know the distance. So

38:59.400 --> 39:00.320
let's just plug that in

39:00.320 --> 39:01.440
and save that value

39:01.440 --> 39:02.840
inside of the class. That

39:02.840 --> 39:03.240
way we're not

39:03.240 --> 39:04.320
recalculating it later

39:04.320 --> 39:05.160
on. We already have the

39:05.160 --> 39:06.560
value. Okay. So now that

39:06.560 --> 39:07.320
we've done that, we need

39:07.320 --> 39:08.480
to calculate the force

39:08.520 --> 39:09.680
of attraction. So we're

39:09.680 --> 39:11.160
going to say the force.

39:12.040 --> 39:12.840
Yeah. I think it's force

39:12.880 --> 39:13.520
is going to be equal to

39:13.520 --> 39:15.320
self dot G. We're going

39:15.320 --> 39:16.840
to multiply this by

39:16.880 --> 39:18.280
our self dot mass

39:18.800 --> 39:20.400
multiplied by the other

39:20.400 --> 39:22.240
dot mass. And then we're

39:22.240 --> 39:24.000
going to divide this by

39:24.000 --> 39:25.760
the distance to the

39:25.760 --> 39:27.240
exponent to why did I

39:27.240 --> 39:27.880
write it like that? It's

39:27.880 --> 39:28.640
going to be distance to

39:28.640 --> 39:30.480
the exponent to. And I

39:30.480 --> 39:32.600
think that's good. Okay.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.200
Now we don't need to do

39:33.200 --> 39:34.080
any parentheses because

39:34.080 --> 39:34.920
these have the same order

39:34.920 --> 39:36.360
of operations and

39:36.360 --> 39:37.680
exponent to the exponent

39:37.680 --> 39:39.480
to is going to happen

39:39.480 --> 39:40.920
first anyways. Okay. So

39:40.920 --> 39:41.680
this is how we calculate

39:41.680 --> 39:42.800
the force. Now remember,

39:42.800 --> 39:44.080
this is the straight line

39:44.080 --> 39:45.600
force. We need to break

39:45.600 --> 39:46.840
this force down into the

39:46.840 --> 39:48.280
X and to the Y component,

39:48.440 --> 39:49.280
which is why we had to do

39:49.280 --> 39:50.320
all of that trigonometry.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.040
So now we need to

39:52.040 --> 39:53.520
calculate the angle theta.

39:53.640 --> 39:54.200
So we're going to say

39:54.200 --> 39:56.520
theta is equal to, and

39:56.520 --> 39:57.600
then this is going to be

39:57.600 --> 39:59.360
the math dot arc tangent

39:59.480 --> 40:00.560
of, and it's actually

40:00.560 --> 40:01.320
going to be here at the

40:01.320 --> 40:03.240
distance Y over the

40:03.240 --> 40:04.280
distance X. Now, the

40:04.280 --> 40:05.800
reason I'm doing a 10 to

40:05.960 --> 40:06.680
is because this is a

40:06.680 --> 40:07.920
special function in

40:07.920 --> 40:09.160
Python that's going to

40:09.160 --> 40:11.120
take the Y over the X

40:11.120 --> 40:11.880
and then give us the

40:11.880 --> 40:13.040
angle associated with it.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.360
So make sure you use a 10

40:14.360 --> 40:16.120
to from the math library.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.600
If you just use a 10,

40:17.600 --> 40:18.240
that's not going to work.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.400
You need a 10 to. Okay.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.640
So math dot eight and

40:20.640 --> 40:22.280
distance X, distance Y.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.880
Now we know the angle theta.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.400
Now that we know the angle

40:25.400 --> 40:26.440
theta, we can calculate

40:26.440 --> 40:27.760
the X velocity and the Y

40:27.760 --> 40:29.200
velocity. So we're going to

40:29.200 --> 40:30.440
say or sorry, not the X

40:30.440 --> 40:31.000
velocity, we're going to

40:31.000 --> 40:32.040
calculate the X force and

40:32.040 --> 40:33.320
the Y force. So we're

40:33.320 --> 40:34.520
going to say the force X

40:35.040 --> 40:36.520
is equal to this is going

40:36.520 --> 40:38.320
to be math dot cosine

40:38.920 --> 40:40.760
of theta multiplied

40:41.320 --> 40:42.080
by the force.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.880
OK, and then the force

40:43.880 --> 40:45.280
underscore Y is going to

40:45.280 --> 40:46.320
be equal to the math dot

40:46.320 --> 40:48.600
sign of the theta.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.160
Multiplied by the force.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.000
OK, and then we're going to

40:54.000 --> 40:55.960
return from here the force

40:55.960 --> 40:57.800
X and the force Y.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.000
OK, let's break down what we

41:00.000 --> 41:00.920
did here. I understand this

41:00.920 --> 41:01.560
is probably a little bit

41:01.560 --> 41:02.280
confusing still.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.960
We first calculate the

41:03.960 --> 41:04.960
distance between the two

41:04.960 --> 41:05.920
objects. There we go.

41:05.920 --> 41:06.840
We have distance.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.280
Great. Then what we're

41:08.280 --> 41:09.120
going to do is determine

41:09.120 --> 41:10.160
if the other object is the

41:10.160 --> 41:11.200
sun. If it is, we're just

41:11.200 --> 41:11.760
going to store that

41:11.760 --> 41:12.880
distance in a property

41:12.880 --> 41:13.600
here, because we want to

41:13.600 --> 41:14.480
know what that value is.

41:15.040 --> 41:15.960
Now, after that, we want

41:15.960 --> 41:16.880
to calculate the force of

41:16.880 --> 41:17.760
attraction. So this is

41:17.760 --> 41:18.600
the force of attraction

41:18.600 --> 41:20.120
here. It's F equals M,

41:20.160 --> 41:23.280
lowercase M over

41:23.520 --> 41:24.960
R squared multiplied by

41:24.960 --> 41:25.920
the gravitational constant

41:25.920 --> 41:26.920
G. OK, so that's what

41:26.920 --> 41:27.720
we're doing. So self that

41:27.720 --> 41:29.600
G times mass multiplied

41:29.600 --> 41:30.720
by other mass over

41:30.760 --> 41:32.000
distance squared.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.960
OK, then we want to

41:33.960 --> 41:35.200
break this distance down

41:35.200 --> 41:36.240
into the two components.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.640
So the sorry, the force

41:37.640 --> 41:38.800
into the X force and the

41:38.800 --> 41:40.480
Y force. So we first need

41:40.480 --> 41:41.520
to calculate the angle.

41:41.680 --> 41:42.640
So we say the math, the

41:42.640 --> 41:43.720
arc tangent to of the

41:43.720 --> 41:44.960
distance Y over distance

41:44.960 --> 41:46.360
X gives us the angle

41:46.360 --> 41:47.480
that we want. Then we're

41:47.480 --> 41:48.680
going to say the force X

41:48.680 --> 41:49.600
is equal to the math

41:49.600 --> 41:51.000
dot cosine of theta

41:51.000 --> 41:52.880
multiplied by force and

41:52.880 --> 41:54.160
the force Y is equal to

41:54.160 --> 41:55.360
the math dot sine theta

41:55.360 --> 41:56.560
multiplied by the force.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.720
Now, remember here that

41:58.720 --> 41:59.920
all of these distances

42:00.200 --> 42:01.400
and all of these forces

42:01.520 --> 42:02.880
are real distances and

42:02.880 --> 42:03.640
forces. These are

42:03.680 --> 42:04.880
actually the distances

42:04.880 --> 42:05.720
and the forces that you

42:05.720 --> 42:06.800
would see. I mean, it's

42:06.800 --> 42:08.000
an approximation in the

42:08.000 --> 42:09.280
real solar system. So I'm

42:09.280 --> 42:10.440
not using really small

42:10.440 --> 42:11.880
pixel values in pi game.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.320
I'm using massive, you

42:13.320 --> 42:14.640
know, meter per squared

42:15.080 --> 42:16.280
kilogram squared values,

42:16.280 --> 42:17.120
whatever the units are

42:17.120 --> 42:18.360
of these forces, I'm

42:18.360 --> 42:19.240
actually using the

42:19.240 --> 42:20.640
correct numbers, like

42:20.640 --> 42:21.840
the large two scale

42:21.840 --> 42:23.000
numbers. I just want to

42:23.000 --> 42:23.720
make that clear here

42:23.720 --> 42:25.040
because like if we were

42:25.040 --> 42:26.320
to print out what X

42:26.320 --> 42:27.600
were and print out what

42:27.600 --> 42:28.280
the force were, you

42:28.280 --> 42:29.320
would see really, really

42:29.320 --> 42:30.240
massive numbers

42:30.440 --> 42:31.440
because that's actually

42:31.440 --> 42:32.240
what they are in the real

42:32.240 --> 42:33.120
world because we're trying

42:33.120 --> 42:34.160
to do a simulation here.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.280
Okay. Anyway, so we have

42:36.280 --> 42:37.640
attraction. Now that we

42:37.640 --> 42:38.160
have the force of

42:38.160 --> 42:39.280
attraction, what we need

42:39.280 --> 42:40.440
to do is actually update

42:40.440 --> 42:41.600
the position of each

42:41.600 --> 42:43.080
planet based on the

42:43.080 --> 42:43.960
force of attraction

42:43.960 --> 42:45.200
between every single

42:45.200 --> 42:46.400
other planet, because

42:46.440 --> 42:47.560
we can't just do it from

42:47.560 --> 42:48.720
the sun. We need to look

42:48.720 --> 42:49.680
at all the other planets

42:49.680 --> 42:50.760
as I was discussing kind

42:50.760 --> 42:51.440
of in the whiteboard

42:51.440 --> 42:52.720
section. So what I'm

42:52.720 --> 42:54.080
going to do is make a

42:54.320 --> 42:54.960
method here. I'm going

42:54.960 --> 42:56.640
to say update position.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.120
And this is going to take

42:58.120 --> 43:00.120
in self and planets.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.160
Okay. So what we're

43:02.160 --> 43:02.760
going to do is loop

43:02.760 --> 43:03.360
through all of the

43:03.360 --> 43:04.520
planets. We're going to

43:04.520 --> 43:05.440
calculate the force of

43:05.440 --> 43:06.960
attraction between the

43:06.960 --> 43:08.040
current planet and all

43:08.040 --> 43:08.840
of the other planets.

43:09.080 --> 43:09.840
We're then going to

43:09.840 --> 43:10.640
calculate what the

43:10.640 --> 43:12.480
velocity needs to be

43:12.920 --> 43:14.240
for these planets. Then

43:14.240 --> 43:14.920
we're going to move them

43:14.920 --> 43:16.600
by that velocity. So

43:16.600 --> 43:18.000
we're going to say the

43:18.000 --> 43:19.280
total force in the X

43:19.280 --> 43:20.840
direction is equal to

43:20.840 --> 43:21.760
the total force in the

43:21.760 --> 43:22.800
Y direction, which is

43:22.800 --> 43:23.760
currently equal to zero.

43:24.000 --> 43:24.800
And we're going to sum

43:24.800 --> 43:25.720
all of the forces

43:25.720 --> 43:27.040
together from all of the

43:27.040 --> 43:28.280
planets. So we're going

43:28.280 --> 43:30.080
to say for planet in

43:30.080 --> 43:31.160
planets, we're going to

43:31.160 --> 43:32.160
pass a list of plants

43:32.160 --> 43:32.640
here. That's what we're

43:32.640 --> 43:34.040
taking in. We're going to

43:34.040 --> 43:36.360
say if self is equal to

43:36.360 --> 43:38.080
planet, then continue

43:38.080 --> 43:38.760
because we don't want to

43:38.760 --> 43:39.640
calculate the force with

43:39.640 --> 43:41.080
ourself. In fact, that

43:41.080 --> 43:42.080
would just give us a zero

43:42.080 --> 43:43.680
division error because

43:43.680 --> 43:44.520
the distance between

43:44.520 --> 43:45.400
ourself and ourself is

43:45.400 --> 43:46.600
zero, right? So we can't

43:47.200 --> 43:48.160
do this division with

43:48.160 --> 43:49.880
the arch tangent or

43:49.880 --> 43:50.800
sorry, with the distance

43:50.800 --> 43:51.400
squared, that would give

43:51.400 --> 43:52.680
us an issue. Anyways,

43:52.680 --> 43:54.360
continuing. Now what

43:54.360 --> 43:55.040
we're going to do is say

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
that the force X force Y

43:57.080 --> 43:58.320
is equal to, and this is

43:58.320 --> 43:59.080
going to be the self

43:59.080 --> 44:01.160
dot attraction to

44:02.240 --> 44:03.720
this plant. Okay. So

44:03.720 --> 44:04.560
again, for every single

44:04.560 --> 44:05.640
planet, we're going to

44:05.640 --> 44:06.720
calculate the force X and

44:06.720 --> 44:07.520
the force Y that's

44:07.520 --> 44:08.840
exerting on this planet.

44:09.120 --> 44:09.880
We're going to say self

44:09.880 --> 44:11.000
dot attraction is equal

44:11.000 --> 44:11.720
to planet. That's what's

44:11.720 --> 44:12.600
doing the calculation

44:12.600 --> 44:13.920
here that gives us the FX

44:13.960 --> 44:15.040
and FY. Now we're just

44:15.040 --> 44:16.280
going to sum these two

44:16.280 --> 44:17.160
variables or add to

44:17.160 --> 44:17.960
these two variables. So

44:17.960 --> 44:19.800
self that X FX plus

44:19.800 --> 44:22.560
equals FX and total FY

44:22.680 --> 44:24.800
plus equals FY. Okay.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.080
So now that we know what

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
the total forces that's

44:27.080 --> 44:28.200
being exerted on us and

44:28.200 --> 44:29.560
the X and the Y direction,

44:29.600 --> 44:30.480
we need to use these

44:30.480 --> 44:31.320
forces to actually

44:31.320 --> 44:32.040
calculate with the

44:32.040 --> 44:33.240
velocity of the planet's

44:33.240 --> 44:34.280
going to be. All right.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.280
So the way we calculate

44:35.280 --> 44:36.840
the velocity here is

44:36.840 --> 44:37.800
we're going to say that

44:37.800 --> 44:39.200
the self dot X underscore

44:39.200 --> 44:40.680
Vell is equal to the

44:40.680 --> 44:42.920
total FX divided by

44:42.920 --> 44:44.160
the self dot mass

44:44.480 --> 44:47.480
multiplied by the self

44:47.520 --> 44:48.760
dots. And then this is

44:48.760 --> 44:49.720
going to be time step.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.280
Now, I'm going to explain

44:51.280 --> 44:52.320
how this works, but this

44:52.320 --> 44:53.040
is using kind of the

44:53.040 --> 44:54.760
famous equation F equals

44:54.800 --> 44:55.960
M a case. We have this

44:55.960 --> 44:58.120
equation F equals M a

44:58.400 --> 44:59.360
and this stands for the

44:59.360 --> 45:00.480
total force is equal to

45:00.480 --> 45:01.760
the mass divided by

45:01.760 --> 45:03.360
the acceleration. Now

45:03.400 --> 45:04.480
you can use this to

45:04.480 --> 45:05.520
solve for the acceleration,

45:05.520 --> 45:06.320
which is what we're doing

45:06.320 --> 45:07.400
here. So we're saying

45:08.040 --> 45:09.360
the acceleration is equal

45:09.360 --> 45:11.760
to F over M. So I'm taking

45:11.760 --> 45:13.960
my total FX and my total

45:13.960 --> 45:15.080
mass, right? And I'm

45:15.080 --> 45:16.200
dividing those to get

45:16.200 --> 45:17.360
the acceleration. Now,

45:17.360 --> 45:18.120
the thing is I'm going to

45:18.120 --> 45:19.200
be adding to this. I'm

45:19.200 --> 45:20.760
saying self that XL plus

45:20.800 --> 45:22.240
equals. So the way this

45:22.240 --> 45:23.960
works is I'm increasing

45:23.960 --> 45:25.800
my velocity by my

45:25.800 --> 45:27.800
acceleration multiplied

45:27.800 --> 45:29.120
by the time step. Now,

45:29.120 --> 45:29.880
there's another equation

45:29.880 --> 45:30.840
that has to do with time

45:30.840 --> 45:31.640
and acceleration to

45:31.640 --> 45:32.640
equal velocity and all

45:32.640 --> 45:33.440
those kinds of things.

45:33.960 --> 45:34.920
Anyways, the point is

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
though, since we're

45:35.920 --> 45:36.960
simulating this over a

45:36.960 --> 45:38.280
period of time, we're

45:38.280 --> 45:39.320
going to take the time

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
step, which is right

45:40.320 --> 45:41.520
here, which is one day

45:42.040 --> 45:43.240
we're going to multiply

45:43.240 --> 45:44.960
that by whatever the

45:44.960 --> 45:46.360
acceleration is. Now,

45:46.360 --> 45:47.160
we're going to take that

45:47.160 --> 45:48.680
value and add that to

45:48.680 --> 45:50.280
the current velocity. Now,

45:50.280 --> 45:51.040
why this is going to

45:51.040 --> 45:51.960
give us a perfect

45:51.960 --> 45:53.920
elliptical is because as

45:53.920 --> 45:55.200
soon as we start going

45:55.360 --> 45:56.160
to the left or to the

45:56.160 --> 45:57.040
right of the planet and

45:57.040 --> 45:58.120
the distances and the

45:58.120 --> 45:59.960
angles change, our force

46:00.000 --> 46:00.920
is going to be either

46:00.920 --> 46:02.360
negative or positive,

46:02.640 --> 46:03.440
saying that we're going

46:03.440 --> 46:04.200
kind of right or we're

46:04.200 --> 46:04.800
going left or we're

46:04.800 --> 46:05.640
going up or we're going

46:05.640 --> 46:06.840
down. So by doing a

46:06.840 --> 46:08.000
total summation of all

46:08.000 --> 46:09.160
of these forces, what

46:09.160 --> 46:10.040
ends up happening is we

46:10.040 --> 46:11.320
go in a complete circle

46:11.520 --> 46:12.520
because by the time we

46:12.520 --> 46:13.640
get to a certain point in

46:13.640 --> 46:15.560
the orbit, the velocity

46:15.560 --> 46:16.520
is going to be changing

46:16.520 --> 46:18.000
and either getting more

46:18.000 --> 46:19.160
positive or more negative,

46:19.160 --> 46:20.080
moving us to the left

46:20.080 --> 46:21.960
or to the right. Hopefully

46:21.960 --> 46:22.960
that makes a tiny bit of

46:22.960 --> 46:23.720
sense. But the point is

46:23.720 --> 46:24.760
we're going to constantly

46:24.760 --> 46:25.840
add this and you'll

46:25.840 --> 46:26.680
notice that we're not

46:26.680 --> 46:27.760
going to go faster.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.440
We're just going to

46:28.440 --> 46:30.000
change in directions

46:30.000 --> 46:30.720
because what's going to

46:30.720 --> 46:32.360
happen is X velocity is

46:32.360 --> 46:33.280
going to be decreasing

46:33.280 --> 46:34.640
while the Y velocity is

46:34.640 --> 46:35.600
increasing when we're at

46:35.600 --> 46:36.480
a certain point in the

46:36.480 --> 46:37.560
circle. And then that's

46:37.560 --> 46:38.400
going to continually

46:38.400 --> 46:39.440
change and change

46:39.480 --> 46:40.880
directions as we move

46:40.880 --> 46:42.720
around. So you'll see

46:42.720 --> 46:43.480
when we start running

46:43.480 --> 46:44.800
this, but that's how

46:44.800 --> 46:45.640
this works. Now we do the

46:45.640 --> 46:46.600
exact same thing with the

46:46.600 --> 46:48.120
Y. So plus equals the

46:48.120 --> 46:50.280
total F Y over the

46:50.280 --> 46:52.600
self dot mass can then

46:52.600 --> 46:54.160
multiplied by the self

46:54.160 --> 46:56.360
dot timestamp. OK, so

46:56.360 --> 46:57.400
now that we have that,

46:57.520 --> 46:58.320
what we need to do is

46:58.320 --> 46:59.560
just increment the X and

46:59.560 --> 47:00.480
the Y because this is

47:00.480 --> 47:02.040
just the velocity. So

47:02.040 --> 47:02.960
from acceleration, you

47:02.960 --> 47:03.920
get velocity from

47:03.920 --> 47:04.600
velocity, you get

47:04.600 --> 47:06.040
displacement or distance,

47:06.040 --> 47:06.720
which is what we're now

47:06.720 --> 47:07.760
going to do. So we're

47:07.760 --> 47:08.840
going to say self dot X.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.160
And then this is going to

47:10.160 --> 47:12.280
be plus equals self dot

47:12.360 --> 47:13.920
X underscore Vell. And

47:13.920 --> 47:14.760
then we need to multiply

47:14.760 --> 47:15.920
this by the time step as

47:15.920 --> 47:17.000
well. And then we're going

47:17.000 --> 47:20.120
to say self dots Y plus

47:20.160 --> 47:21.520
equals. This needs to be

47:21.520 --> 47:23.280
self dot Y Vell multiplied

47:23.280 --> 47:24.720
by self dot timestamp. And

47:24.720 --> 47:26.520
then let's fix this to be

47:26.520 --> 47:28.240
self dot X. Well, OK, and

47:28.240 --> 47:30.240
then lastly here, we can

47:30.240 --> 47:31.440
actually say the self

47:31.440 --> 47:34.360
dot orbit and then dot

47:34.360 --> 47:36.360
append. And I'm going to

47:36.360 --> 47:38.680
append just a tuple

47:38.680 --> 47:39.520
here, which is going to

47:39.520 --> 47:41.600
be self dot X, self

47:41.600 --> 47:43.800
dot Y. And yeah, I think

47:43.800 --> 47:44.800
that's actually good for

47:44.800 --> 47:46.480
the orbit. OK, so let me

47:47.000 --> 47:47.880
break this down one more

47:47.880 --> 47:49.320
time. What we're doing is

47:49.320 --> 47:49.960
we're getting the total

47:49.960 --> 47:51.800
forces exerted on this

47:51.800 --> 47:52.920
planet from all other

47:52.920 --> 47:53.640
plants that are not

47:53.640 --> 47:55.200
itself. We are then

47:55.200 --> 47:56.840
going to figure out with

47:56.840 --> 47:58.120
the X and the Y velocity

47:58.120 --> 47:59.080
is using the equations I

47:59.080 --> 48:00.200
describe. Then we are

48:00.200 --> 48:01.440
going to update the X and

48:01.440 --> 48:02.880
Y position by using the

48:02.880 --> 48:03.720
velocity. We need to

48:03.720 --> 48:04.920
multiply by the time step

48:04.920 --> 48:05.760
to make sure we're moving

48:05.800 --> 48:06.640
in the accurate amount of

48:06.640 --> 48:08.600
time here. OK. And then

48:08.600 --> 48:09.560
we have self that orbit

48:10.160 --> 48:10.960
dot append and we're

48:10.960 --> 48:12.000
appending the X and Y

48:12.000 --> 48:12.640
position that we're

48:12.640 --> 48:13.760
currently at so that now

48:13.760 --> 48:15.560
we can draw the orbit

48:15.600 --> 48:16.560
forward this planet,

48:16.560 --> 48:17.760
which I'm going to do in

48:17.760 --> 48:19.360
a second. OK, so there

48:19.360 --> 48:20.040
we go. We actually have

48:20.040 --> 48:20.800
all of the hard stuff

48:20.800 --> 48:21.840
done. Now we just need

48:21.840 --> 48:23.320
to call the update

48:23.320 --> 48:25.600
position method here on

48:25.600 --> 48:26.760
all of our planets. And

48:26.760 --> 48:27.280
you'll see that they'll

48:27.280 --> 48:28.080
start moving around the

48:28.080 --> 48:29.160
screen. So I'm going to

48:29.160 --> 48:30.640
go to right before planet

48:30.640 --> 48:31.840
dot draw. And I'm going

48:31.840 --> 48:33.400
to say planet dot. And

48:33.400 --> 48:35.080
then this is going to be

48:35.800 --> 48:37.640
update position. And I'm

48:37.640 --> 48:38.560
just going to pass to it

48:38.560 --> 48:41.800
planets. OK. And that's

48:41.800 --> 48:42.440
actually all we need to

48:42.440 --> 48:43.480
start moving the planet.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.520
And let's just run this

48:45.520 --> 48:46.560
now and see if it works.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.400
OK, so let's see. And we

48:49.400 --> 48:50.480
can see that our planets

48:50.480 --> 48:51.600
are moving, but we're

48:51.600 --> 48:52.120
getting a bit of an

48:52.120 --> 48:52.680
issue. And I'm going to

48:52.680 --> 48:54.040
explain why that happens.

48:54.320 --> 48:55.840
So first of all, the

48:55.840 --> 48:56.760
reason why we were seeing

48:56.760 --> 48:58.160
our planets like thousands

48:58.160 --> 48:59.520
of times on the screen is

48:59.520 --> 49:00.520
because we need to

49:00.520 --> 49:02.360
refresh the screen by

49:02.360 --> 49:03.800
kind of redrawing a

49:03.800 --> 49:05.000
background on top of it

49:05.000 --> 49:06.160
before we draw everything

49:06.160 --> 49:07.000
again. So what's

49:07.000 --> 49:07.720
happening right now is

49:07.720 --> 49:08.400
we're continually

49:08.400 --> 49:09.200
drawing the planets,

49:09.400 --> 49:10.120
we're not drawing

49:10.120 --> 49:11.200
anything on top of the

49:11.200 --> 49:12.240
old planets. And so we

49:12.240 --> 49:13.040
keep seeing the old

49:13.040 --> 49:14.240
planets. So all I need to

49:14.240 --> 49:15.280
do here, say wind up

49:15.280 --> 49:16.640
fill. And I'm just going

49:16.640 --> 49:17.720
to put inside of here

49:18.960 --> 49:20.040
zero, zero, zero, which

49:20.040 --> 49:21.200
is just the color black.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.720
And now if I run this,

49:23.360 --> 49:23.960
you're going to see that

49:23.960 --> 49:25.360
the planets just zoom

49:25.360 --> 49:26.920
towards the sun. Now,

49:27.000 --> 49:27.680
the reason they're

49:27.680 --> 49:28.560
zooming towards the sun

49:28.560 --> 49:29.320
is because they don't

49:29.320 --> 49:30.680
have a velocity in the

49:30.680 --> 49:33.160
Y or sorry, in the X is

49:33.160 --> 49:33.960
the X. No, it's in the

49:33.960 --> 49:35.680
Y direction. So

49:35.760 --> 49:36.600
currently, right? If

49:36.600 --> 49:37.440
again, if I run this,

49:37.600 --> 49:38.520
you see that they just

49:38.520 --> 49:39.640
zoom right towards the

49:39.640 --> 49:40.600
sun and then keep going.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.360
The reason they're

49:41.360 --> 49:42.040
doing that is because

49:42.040 --> 49:42.800
we don't have another

49:42.800 --> 49:43.840
velocity. And that's

49:43.840 --> 49:44.840
what would happen if

49:44.840 --> 49:45.800
they weren't already

49:45.800 --> 49:47.200
moving in another

49:47.200 --> 49:48.480
direction. So we need to

49:48.480 --> 49:49.680
apply an existing

49:49.680 --> 49:51.560
velocity in the Y

49:51.560 --> 49:52.640
direction to these

49:52.640 --> 49:53.800
planets so that they

49:53.800 --> 49:55.360
will be moving around

49:55.360 --> 49:56.160
the sun, so that the

49:56.160 --> 49:57.360
force attracted them to

49:57.360 --> 49:58.640
the sun causes this

49:58.680 --> 49:59.560
kind of centripetal

49:59.560 --> 50:01.080
motion or the circular

50:01.080 --> 50:02.200
motion around the plant.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.240
I know this is like

50:04.240 --> 50:05.080
there's a lot of physics

50:05.080 --> 50:06.040
that I wasn't actually

50:06.040 --> 50:07.360
can considering how many

50:07.360 --> 50:08.120
physics I would need to

50:08.120 --> 50:09.240
explain here. But the

50:09.240 --> 50:10.280
idea is for all of these

50:10.280 --> 50:11.400
planets, they need some

50:11.400 --> 50:12.520
starting velocity in the

50:12.520 --> 50:14.040
Y direction. Otherwise,

50:14.040 --> 50:15.000
the only force being

50:15.000 --> 50:16.560
applied is directly X

50:17.000 --> 50:18.320
because of kind of where

50:18.320 --> 50:19.200
the planets are placed

50:19.200 --> 50:19.880
and the fact that we're

50:19.880 --> 50:21.600
just going straight down

50:21.600 --> 50:22.480
towards the sun. That's

50:22.480 --> 50:23.200
the only force being

50:23.200 --> 50:23.960
applied currently,

50:24.200 --> 50:24.720
because we don't have

50:24.720 --> 50:26.240
another velocity. So

50:26.240 --> 50:27.000
let's apply the other

50:27.000 --> 50:28.600
velocities. I'm just

50:28.600 --> 50:29.320
going to copy them in

50:29.320 --> 50:30.800
from my other screen. So

50:30.800 --> 50:31.480
this is the earth

50:31.520 --> 50:33.440
velocity. I'll pause so

50:33.440 --> 50:34.200
we can read them all in

50:34.200 --> 50:35.480
a second. This is the

50:35.480 --> 50:38.080
Mars velocity. This is

50:38.080 --> 50:39.400
the mercury velocity.

50:40.440 --> 50:41.840
And then this is the

50:41.840 --> 50:44.640
Venus velocity. OK, so

50:44.640 --> 50:46.200
the earth Y velocity is

50:46.200 --> 50:47.240
twenty nine point seven

50:47.240 --> 50:47.960
eight three. This is

50:47.960 --> 50:49.280
kilometers per second

50:49.320 --> 50:50.520
multiplied by a thousand,

50:50.520 --> 50:51.560
which gives us meters

50:51.560 --> 50:52.200
per second, because

50:52.200 --> 50:52.880
that's what we're using.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.640
Excuse me. The Mars

50:55.640 --> 50:56.600
velocity, twenty four

50:56.600 --> 50:58.080
point zero seven seven

50:58.080 --> 50:59.080
multiplied by a thousand

50:59.080 --> 51:00.080
again, this meters per

51:00.080 --> 51:01.160
second. So kilometers,

51:01.160 --> 51:02.120
then we convert to meters

51:02.680 --> 51:03.600
forty seven point four

51:03.600 --> 51:05.080
for mercury and then

51:05.080 --> 51:05.880
negative thirty five

51:05.880 --> 51:07.160
point oh two times a

51:07.160 --> 51:09.040
thousand for Venus. Now

51:09.040 --> 51:09.960
you'll notice that for

51:09.960 --> 51:11.000
some of these, we have

51:11.000 --> 51:13.640
positive and negative

51:13.640 --> 51:14.760
or not positive, not

51:14.760 --> 51:15.480
negative, right? Like we

51:15.480 --> 51:16.560
have a negative plant, A

51:16.560 --> 51:18.040
U moving us to the left

51:18.320 --> 51:18.840
and then we have a

51:18.840 --> 51:20.280
positive Y velocity.

51:21.000 --> 51:21.600
Then for this one,

51:21.600 --> 51:22.080
right, we have a

51:22.080 --> 51:23.840
negative and positive.

51:24.120 --> 51:24.960
And then here we have a

51:24.960 --> 51:25.960
positive and this

51:25.960 --> 51:26.760
actually needs to be

51:26.760 --> 51:27.960
negative to make sure

51:27.960 --> 51:28.560
that it's going to be

51:28.560 --> 51:29.560
moving in the correct

51:29.560 --> 51:30.720
direction. So if you

51:30.720 --> 51:31.880
have one, this positive,

51:31.880 --> 51:32.760
the other one needs to be

51:32.760 --> 51:33.760
negative so that they're

51:33.760 --> 51:34.560
all moving in the same

51:34.560 --> 51:36.280
direction vice versa.

51:36.280 --> 51:36.880
Hopefully that makes

51:36.880 --> 51:37.840
sense, but you'll see

51:37.840 --> 51:39.000
here when this starts

51:39.000 --> 51:40.440
running. OK, so let me

51:40.440 --> 51:41.360
actually just run this

51:41.360 --> 51:42.600
now and we should see

51:42.600 --> 51:43.640
that they orbit. So

51:43.640 --> 51:45.400
let's have a look. OK,

51:45.400 --> 51:46.120
so there we go. Now we

51:46.120 --> 51:47.400
have an orbit. Obviously

51:47.400 --> 51:48.080
doesn't look as cool.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.040
We're not drawing the

51:49.040 --> 51:50.000
orbits, but notice that

51:50.000 --> 51:50.880
they're all moving in

51:50.880 --> 51:51.760
the same direction and

51:51.760 --> 51:52.600
obviously the ones that

51:52.600 --> 51:53.680
are closer to the sun

51:53.960 --> 51:55.120
are moving faster.

51:55.880 --> 51:56.400
Perfect. So the

51:56.400 --> 51:57.880
simulation seems to be

51:57.880 --> 51:59.720
working. OK, so let's

51:59.720 --> 52:01.000
now draw the orbits

52:01.000 --> 52:02.760
around and the way that

52:02.760 --> 52:03.400
we're going to do that

52:03.400 --> 52:03.960
is we're going to use

52:03.960 --> 52:04.840
all of the points that

52:04.840 --> 52:05.600
we're storing in this

52:05.600 --> 52:06.480
orbit list, because

52:06.480 --> 52:07.600
every time that we call

52:07.600 --> 52:08.280
this, we're going to add

52:08.280 --> 52:09.640
a point to the orbit

52:09.640 --> 52:11.520
list and we're going

52:11.520 --> 52:12.840
to draw them. So what

52:12.840 --> 52:14.320
I'm going to do is

52:14.320 --> 52:16.440
add something here and

52:16.440 --> 52:21.760
say four point in self

52:21.760 --> 52:23.120
that orbit and I

52:23.120 --> 52:23.880
actually want to draw

52:23.880 --> 52:25.040
this. Yeah, I'll draw

52:25.040 --> 52:25.840
this before I draw the

52:25.840 --> 52:27.600
circle. I'm going to say

52:27.640 --> 52:32.040
X Y equals point. And

52:32.040 --> 52:32.760
then I'm going to say

52:32.760 --> 52:34.520
X is equal to X

52:34.520 --> 52:35.960
multiplied by self

52:35.960 --> 52:37.680
that scale. And then

52:37.680 --> 52:38.160
this is going to be

52:38.160 --> 52:40.320
plus width over two.

52:42.000 --> 52:42.880
And I'm going to say

52:42.880 --> 52:44.640
Y is equal to Y

52:45.000 --> 52:47.120
multiplied by self

52:47.240 --> 52:50.520
that scale plus height

52:50.880 --> 52:53.480
over two. And then

52:53.480 --> 52:54.720
we are going to

52:55.440 --> 52:56.560
actually store these in

52:56.560 --> 52:58.480
an updated points list.

52:58.480 --> 52:58.840
We're going to say

52:58.840 --> 52:59.840
updated points equal

52:59.840 --> 53:03.320
to this updated points

53:03.760 --> 53:06.680
dot append point. And

53:06.680 --> 53:07.240
then we're going to

53:07.240 --> 53:08.120
draw all these points

53:08.120 --> 53:09.760
as a line. So we're

53:09.760 --> 53:10.040
going to say

53:10.040 --> 53:13.160
pie game dot draw dot

53:13.160 --> 53:15.760
line. And is it lines?

53:15.760 --> 53:16.520
Let me just have a look

53:16.520 --> 53:17.240
here to see actually

53:17.240 --> 53:18.280
exactly what we need to

53:18.280 --> 53:20.040
drew to do. So this is

53:20.040 --> 53:20.560
actually going to be

53:20.560 --> 53:21.600
lines. Sorry, we're

53:21.600 --> 53:23.040
going to pass win. We're

53:23.040 --> 53:24.480
going to pass self dot

53:24.480 --> 53:26.040
color. We're going to

53:26.080 --> 53:28.160
pass false, which means

53:28.160 --> 53:28.960
this is not an

53:28.960 --> 53:30.400
enclosed line. So we're

53:30.400 --> 53:31.040
not going to draw an

53:31.040 --> 53:32.400
ending line, essentially.

53:32.840 --> 53:33.400
And then we're going to

53:33.400 --> 53:35.360
pass the updated points

53:36.080 --> 53:36.760
and we'll pass a

53:36.760 --> 53:38.400
thickness of two. OK, let

53:38.400 --> 53:39.000
me explain what I did.

53:39.000 --> 53:39.960
I understand. I kind of

53:39.960 --> 53:40.600
just went through this

53:40.600 --> 53:41.640
without any explanation.

53:42.080 --> 53:42.840
So what I'm doing is

53:42.840 --> 53:43.600
I'm getting a list of

53:43.640 --> 53:44.560
updated points, which

53:44.560 --> 53:45.240
are going to be all of

53:45.240 --> 53:46.560
the X, Y coordinates to

53:46.560 --> 53:47.480
scale, right? Because I

53:47.480 --> 53:48.600
need to get them to scale.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.760
Otherwise, I can't draw

53:49.760 --> 53:51.120
these properly. So I

53:51.120 --> 53:52.160
take them. I do what I

53:52.160 --> 53:52.880
need to do to get them

53:52.880 --> 53:53.880
to scale exactly what I

53:53.880 --> 53:55.120
did right here. And then

53:55.120 --> 53:56.920
I update, I make a new

53:57.080 --> 53:57.800
list here, updated

53:57.800 --> 53:59.760
points and append, sorry,

53:59.760 --> 54:01.800
not the point, the new

54:01.800 --> 54:03.840
X, Y that I made right

54:03.840 --> 54:05.320
here. OK, then I'm going

54:05.320 --> 54:06.760
to draw lines. Now, what

54:06.760 --> 54:07.680
this does is it takes a

54:07.680 --> 54:08.920
list of points, which is

54:08.920 --> 54:10.120
right here, and it

54:10.160 --> 54:12.480
essentially just draws a

54:12.480 --> 54:14.320
bunch of a bunch of lines

54:14.320 --> 54:14.960
between the different

54:14.960 --> 54:15.920
points, and it doesn't

54:15.960 --> 54:16.880
enclose them because I

54:16.880 --> 54:18.440
passed false. Now, this

54:18.440 --> 54:19.800
is the thickness that I

54:19.800 --> 54:20.560
want to draw the lines,

54:20.560 --> 54:21.320
which is going to be two

54:21.320 --> 54:22.720
pixels. Now, one thing I

54:22.720 --> 54:23.600
do need to do is just

54:23.600 --> 54:24.440
put an if statement here

54:24.440 --> 54:27.480
and say if the length of

54:27.520 --> 54:30.240
self dot points is less

54:30.240 --> 54:32.200
than two, actually less

54:32.200 --> 54:32.840
than or equal to two,

54:32.840 --> 54:33.720
because I believe we need

54:33.720 --> 54:34.600
at least three points,

54:34.840 --> 54:36.320
then I don't want to do

54:36.320 --> 54:37.440
any of this. So we're

54:37.440 --> 54:38.320
going to say actually

54:38.320 --> 54:39.480
the opposite. We're going

54:39.480 --> 54:40.840
to say if, yeah, if the

54:40.840 --> 54:41.400
line of points is

54:41.400 --> 54:43.360
greater than two. So

54:43.360 --> 54:44.280
meaning that it is at

54:44.280 --> 54:45.560
least three, then it

54:45.560 --> 54:46.440
will do this. Just

54:46.440 --> 54:47.440
confusing myself there.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.080
We need at least three

54:48.080 --> 54:48.840
points. So if the line

54:48.840 --> 54:49.480
of points greater than

54:49.480 --> 54:50.760
two, do all of this.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Otherwise, don't do it.

54:52.080 --> 54:52.960
That should give us the

54:52.960 --> 54:54.400
orbit. So let's see now

54:54.520 --> 54:55.280
if we're going to get kind

54:55.280 --> 54:56.320
of the orbital ring

54:56.320 --> 54:58.040
around. Let's run this

54:58.320 --> 54:59.560
and planet object has no

54:59.560 --> 55:00.960
actually points. Sorry,

55:00.960 --> 55:02.600
it's not points. It is

55:02.640 --> 55:05.280
orbit. And I think I did

55:05.280 --> 55:06.200
this right. Self that

55:06.200 --> 55:07.160
orbit. Yes. OK, self

55:07.160 --> 55:09.080
that. Nice. All right.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.480
Let's see. There we go.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.440
Now we get the orbits

55:11.440 --> 55:12.800
being drawn as the

55:12.800 --> 55:14.520
planets are moving around.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.560
Very nice. So I mean, you

55:16.560 --> 55:17.720
can run the simulation as

55:17.720 --> 55:18.920
long as you like and see

55:18.920 --> 55:20.560
everything working. Now

55:20.560 --> 55:21.840
what I want to do is

55:21.840 --> 55:23.120
implement the distance to

55:23.160 --> 55:24.640
the sun, just to show

55:24.640 --> 55:25.800
you that this is not a

55:25.800 --> 55:26.920
perfect circle. It is

55:26.920 --> 55:27.840
actually elliptical. I

55:27.840 --> 55:28.400
know it looks like a

55:28.400 --> 55:29.560
perfect circle, but

55:29.560 --> 55:32.320
since the scale is so, I

55:32.320 --> 55:33.600
guess, small here that

55:33.600 --> 55:34.280
we're drawing this out,

55:34.440 --> 55:35.880
you can't really see the

55:35.880 --> 55:37.120
ellipticalness of the

55:37.120 --> 55:39.200
orbits. OK, so now what

55:39.200 --> 55:40.160
I want to do is also

55:40.160 --> 55:41.320
draw that distance on

55:41.320 --> 55:42.440
top. So to do that, I

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
need to initialize a

55:43.440 --> 55:45.200
font in Pygame. So I'm

55:45.200 --> 55:46.120
just going to say font

55:46.200 --> 55:47.880
is equal to Pygame dot

55:47.880 --> 55:50.120
font dot S Y S font like

55:50.120 --> 55:51.920
that. And I'm going to

55:51.920 --> 55:53.520
pass inside of here,

55:53.520 --> 55:55.440
comic sans as my font.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.240
And for the font size,

55:57.240 --> 55:57.640
we'll just go with

55:57.640 --> 55:59.200
something like 16. So

55:59.200 --> 56:00.080
this is the font you

56:00.080 --> 56:00.880
want. And this is the

56:00.880 --> 56:01.840
size. That's how you

56:01.840 --> 56:03.480
initialize the font. And

56:03.480 --> 56:04.440
then what I need to do if

56:04.440 --> 56:05.440
I want to draw the

56:05.440 --> 56:07.160
distance is I need to

56:07.160 --> 56:08.600
say, first of all, if

56:08.960 --> 56:11.840
not self dot sun and

56:11.880 --> 56:13.160
forgot working in Python.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.080
So let's use the actual

56:14.080 --> 56:15.120
not because I don't want

56:15.120 --> 56:15.840
to draw the distance

56:15.840 --> 56:16.480
between the sun and the

56:16.480 --> 56:17.240
sun, which is always

56:17.240 --> 56:18.400
going to be zero. So I'm

56:18.400 --> 56:19.560
going to say if not self

56:19.560 --> 56:22.080
dot sun, then we'll say

56:22.160 --> 56:24.000
distance underscore text

56:24.240 --> 56:27.600
is equal to font dot

56:27.600 --> 56:28.560
render. This is how you

56:28.560 --> 56:29.520
actually create a text

56:29.560 --> 56:30.680
object that you can draw.

56:31.080 --> 56:31.720
I'm going to say font

56:31.720 --> 56:32.920
render and do an F

56:32.920 --> 56:34.040
string. And this is

56:34.040 --> 56:35.480
simply going to be the

56:35.480 --> 56:37.120
self dot distance to

56:37.120 --> 56:38.600
the sun. And then this is

56:38.600 --> 56:39.840
going to be in meters. So

56:39.840 --> 56:40.640
what I can do is I can

56:40.640 --> 56:41.760
divide this value by

56:41.760 --> 56:42.880
1000 if I want to get

56:42.880 --> 56:43.880
kilometers to make it a

56:43.880 --> 56:45.200
little bit smaller. So

56:45.200 --> 56:46.440
let's do that divide by

56:46.440 --> 56:47.880
1000 in kilometers. I'm

56:47.880 --> 56:48.800
also just going to round

56:48.800 --> 56:49.920
this just so that we

56:49.920 --> 56:50.840
don't get a massive

56:50.840 --> 56:52.800
number here. So let's

56:52.800 --> 56:54.240
just round this to one

56:54.240 --> 56:55.400
decimal point, put that

56:55.400 --> 56:56.920
in kilometers. And then

56:56.920 --> 56:58.360
we want anti aliasing one,

56:58.360 --> 56:59.040
which is the next

56:59.040 --> 57:01.120
argument. And then the

57:01.120 --> 57:02.720
last argument, I believe

57:02.760 --> 57:04.080
is the color that I want

57:04.080 --> 57:05.480
to draw this in, which we

57:05.480 --> 57:07.240
can just make, I guess

57:07.240 --> 57:07.840
it shouldn't be self

57:07.840 --> 57:09.480
color. We'll do white.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.240
OK, perfect. So that is

57:13.240 --> 57:14.440
now the text object

57:14.440 --> 57:15.840
created. Again, you have

57:15.840 --> 57:17.280
to use a font object to

57:17.280 --> 57:18.480
create a text object,

57:18.520 --> 57:19.200
which then you can

57:19.360 --> 57:20.840
render on the screen. Now

57:20.840 --> 57:21.640
I want to draw it on the

57:21.640 --> 57:23.080
screen. So I'm going to

57:23.080 --> 57:25.880
say win dot bullet. I'm

57:25.880 --> 57:26.920
going to pass the

57:26.920 --> 57:28.840
distance text. And then

57:28.840 --> 57:29.760
the position that I want

57:29.760 --> 57:31.120
to draw this at is a

57:31.120 --> 57:32.360
little bit complicated.

57:33.320 --> 57:34.280
And also, guys, sorry, I

57:34.280 --> 57:35.680
just realized I made a

57:35.680 --> 57:36.960
little bit of a mistake

57:36.960 --> 57:38.960
here. Actually, no,

57:38.960 --> 57:40.280
maybe this is OK the way

57:40.280 --> 57:42.400
it is. When I define X,

57:42.400 --> 57:43.440
Y inside the for loop,

57:43.440 --> 57:44.120
this might be

57:44.120 --> 57:45.160
interfering with this,

57:45.160 --> 57:46.120
although it didn't seem

57:46.120 --> 57:48.440
like it was. So I guess

57:48.480 --> 57:49.400
we can just proceed, but

57:49.400 --> 57:50.360
I don't like having these

57:50.360 --> 57:51.240
names shadow each other.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.160
OK, we'll just proceed

57:52.160 --> 57:53.880
for now, but that's kind

57:53.880 --> 57:54.720
of what I was realizing

57:54.720 --> 57:55.520
and why I pause there.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.640
Anyways, what I'm going to

57:56.640 --> 57:59.520
do is draw this at X, Y,

57:59.800 --> 58:00.640
and we're referencing

58:00.640 --> 58:02.200
this X, Y here, which is

58:02.200 --> 58:02.960
going to be the center of

58:02.960 --> 58:04.120
the circle. Now, the

58:04.120 --> 58:05.120
issue is if I draw this

58:05.120 --> 58:05.760
at the center of the

58:05.760 --> 58:06.960
circle, since I start

58:06.960 --> 58:07.920
drawing the text from

58:07.920 --> 58:09.480
the top left hand corner,

58:09.880 --> 58:10.760
you'll see actually, let

58:10.760 --> 58:11.400
me just run the code

58:11.400 --> 58:11.840
and you'll see what

58:11.840 --> 58:12.720
happens here when I do

58:12.720 --> 58:14.240
this. So you'll notice

58:14.240 --> 58:16.640
that the actual text is

58:16.640 --> 58:18.400
kind of at the bottom

58:18.400 --> 58:19.480
right of the center.

58:20.000 --> 58:20.880
Now, that looks really

58:20.880 --> 58:21.720
ugly. Obviously don't

58:21.720 --> 58:22.560
want that to be there.

58:22.560 --> 58:23.440
So what I'm going to do

58:23.440 --> 58:25.320
instead is I'm going to

58:25.320 --> 58:26.160
make it so it's drawn

58:26.160 --> 58:27.040
directly in the center.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.200
Now, do that. I take the

58:28.200 --> 58:29.840
X and need to subtract

58:29.840 --> 58:30.920
this from the distance

58:30.920 --> 58:33.120
underscore text dot get

58:33.120 --> 58:34.400
underscore width divided

58:34.400 --> 58:36.200
by two. So if I take the

58:36.200 --> 58:36.920
width of the text and

58:36.920 --> 58:37.880
divide that by two and

58:37.880 --> 58:38.960
then subtract that from

58:38.960 --> 58:40.360
the X that shifts me to

58:40.360 --> 58:41.840
the left, some exactly

58:41.840 --> 58:43.160
in the middle. And then

58:43.160 --> 58:43.840
the same thing with the

58:43.840 --> 58:45.080
Y. So why is distance

58:45.080 --> 58:46.040
text dot get underscore

58:46.040 --> 58:47.760
height over two? Okay.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.480
Nice. Hopefully that is

58:50.520 --> 58:52.040
all clear. Now, I'm

58:52.040 --> 58:52.760
just going to take all

58:52.760 --> 58:53.960
of this and we're going

58:53.960 --> 58:55.120
to put this below when

58:55.120 --> 58:56.120
we're drawing the circle

58:56.120 --> 58:57.280
so that it gets drawn on

58:57.280 --> 58:58.280
top and we don't have

58:58.280 --> 59:00.000
any overlap or we don't

59:00.000 --> 59:00.880
have the circle kind of

59:00.880 --> 59:01.880
overlapping the text.

59:02.520 --> 59:03.520
OK, so let's close that.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.480
You guys can pause the

59:04.480 --> 59:05.040
video if you want to

59:05.040 --> 59:05.680
have a look at this.

59:05.960 --> 59:06.720
Let's run the code,

59:06.720 --> 59:07.880
though, and let's see

59:07.880 --> 59:08.920
what we get. Nice. OK,

59:08.920 --> 59:10.080
so now we actually have

59:10.080 --> 59:11.800
the text being drawn on

59:11.800 --> 59:12.960
top. And for some of

59:12.960 --> 59:13.720
the planets, given it

59:13.720 --> 59:14.760
is a bit hard to see,

59:15.520 --> 59:17.160
but that is all working.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.120
Nice. So with that said,

59:19.120 --> 59:20.120
I think I'm going to end

59:20.120 --> 59:21.160
this tutorial here.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.200
This was a lot of stuff

59:22.200 --> 59:23.200
to go through. I hope

59:23.200 --> 59:24.160
you guys appreciated

59:24.160 --> 59:25.160
this and all of the math

59:25.160 --> 59:26.160
and explanations.

59:26.480 --> 59:27.400
If you did, please make

59:27.400 --> 59:28.280
sure you leave a like.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.160
Obviously, you can

59:29.160 --> 59:30.160
extend this as much as

59:30.160 --> 59:30.800
you would like. You can

59:30.800 --> 59:31.800
mess around with the scale.

59:31.800 --> 59:32.440
You can mess around with

59:32.440 --> 59:33.200
the speed. You can

59:33.200 --> 59:34.160
change the time step.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.080
This is a really, really

59:35.080 --> 59:36.240
flexible program.

59:36.360 --> 59:37.120
And all of the hard

59:37.120 --> 59:38.400
physics and math is done.

59:38.520 --> 59:39.400
So if you want to add

59:39.400 --> 59:40.200
more planets, you can

59:40.200 --> 59:41.360
really easily do that.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.440
This is a realistic

59:42.440 --> 59:43.520
simulation, something

59:43.520 --> 59:44.280
I haven't done on the

59:44.280 --> 59:45.360
channel before and that

59:45.360 --> 59:46.200
I hope you guys

59:46.200 --> 59:47.440
appreciate. All right.

59:47.440 --> 59:48.320
With that said, I am going

59:48.320 --> 59:49.440
to end the video again.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.440
Please like the video,

59:50.480 --> 59:51.440
subscribe to the channel

59:51.440 --> 59:52.400
and I will see you in

59:52.440 --> 59:53.000
another one.
