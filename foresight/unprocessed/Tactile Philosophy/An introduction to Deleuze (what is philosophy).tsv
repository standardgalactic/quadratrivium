0	9000	Philosophy is dead. It couldn't keep up with the sciences, so science left it behind.
9000	14000	We do not need philosophy anymore for the questions that once belonged to philosophy.
14000	22000	Questions of being, of free will, of reality itself can now be answered by science.
22000	29000	Thus proclaimed the physicists Stephen Hawking and Lenin Mladinov in the book The Grand Design.
29000	37000	Their view is an example of what is called scientism, the belief that all things can be understood scientifically,
37000	41000	and that scientific knowledge is the most valuable form of knowledge there is.
41000	46000	In this video I want to respond to scientism and the supposed death of philosophy
46000	53000	by introducing you to Gilles Deleuze and his unorthodox understanding of the purpose of philosophy, contra-science.
53000	58000	Deleuze was the French philosopher who was highly influential in the late 20th century.
58000	64000	His work is known for being subversive and challenging the orthodoxies of his time.
64000	69000	Writing on the history of philosophy, he sought out thinkers he believed to have been marginalised
69000	76000	and attempted to create new ways of thinking and break free of what he called the dogmatic image of thought.
76000	85000	In addition to writing on historical philosophers, he also wrote on things such as art, cinema, psychoanalysis and literature.
85000	89000	And toward the end of his life, he decided to look back at his career
89000	93000	and define exactly what he thought the purpose of philosophy was.
93000	100000	So he wrote the book What is Philosophy, together with his good friend, the psychoanalyst, Felix Guattari.
100000	109000	The two had already written three books together, The Antietopus, A Thousand Plateaus, and a book about Kafka, respectively.
109000	113000	This was the first and only directly philosophical book the pair would write.
113000	120000	In What is Philosophy, they put forth the thesis that philosophy is the art of creating concepts.
120000	123000	This is by no means a new idea for Deleuze.
123000	126000	We find this assertion even in his early work.
126000	133000	But now, Deleuze wants to slow down and really create a theoretical basis for his claim.
134000	142000	As they write in the beginning of their book, the question, What is Philosophy, can perhaps be posed only late in life,
142000	146000	with the arrival of old age and the time for speaking concretely.
146000	153000	It was asked before, it was always being asked, but always too indirectly or obliquely.
153000	157000	The question was too artificial or too abstract.
157000	164000	In developing the aforementioned basis, they start by distancing themselves from popular conceptions of philosophy,
164000	169000	as being about reflection, communication, or contemplation.
169000	177000	Communication, they say, only leads to consensus, which inevitably reinforces the dogmas of our society.
177000	182000	And they outright laugh at the proposition that philosophy is about reflection or contemplation,
182000	190000	saying that mathematicians or artists have never waited on philosophers to reflect on or contemplate their work.
190000	196000	If philosophy is its own discipline, it must be because it has a purpose distinct from other fields.
196000	201000	And that purpose, they write, is to create concepts.
201000	209000	The first principle they present of their understanding of philosophy is that philosophers always create concepts in response to problems.
209000	214000	But what they mean by problem is a little different from what you and I think of when we say problem.
214000	217000	We think of problems in terms of solutions.
217000	223000	For example, if we put forth a mathematical problem like, What is 2 plus 2?
223000	227000	We are doing so because we want to find the correct answer.
227000	233000	4. Delusion-Guatterie's understanding, however, sees the problem as forcing us to think,
233000	236000	without necessarily coming to a singular conclusion.
236000	240000	The solution instead co-exists with other solutions.
240000	247000	As such, the philosopher tries to create concepts as a way of answering the problems he is faced with.
247000	254000	Not to provide universal or final solutions, but to provide new alternative responses to the problem.
254000	258000	But the problems don't remain stagnant. They are forever changing.
258000	264000	Therefore, philosophy must change with them, as delusion-Guatterie themselves write.
264000	269000	If one can still be a Platonist, a Cartesian or a Kantian today,
269000	275000	it is because one is justified in thinking that their concepts can be reactivated in our problems
275000	278000	and inspire those concepts that need to be created.
278000	281000	What is the best way to follow the great philosophers?
281000	283000	Is it to repeat what they said?
283000	285000	What to do as they did?
285000	290000	That is to say, create concepts for problems that necessarily change.
290000	294000	Through presenting philosophy as acting in response to problems,
294000	300000	delusion-Guatterie are creating a conception of philosophy as being in need of constant change,
300000	306000	thereby denouncing all claims to philosophy as being about universal truths.
306000	309000	But what about the eternal problems, you might ask?
309000	314000	Problems like what is justice have been posited throughout history
314000	318000	and will probably continue to be asked to the end of time.
318000	324000	Surely this is an example of a universal problem that requires a universal solution.
324000	327000	Though this might appear to be the case,
327000	331000	we must first ask whether we are dealing with the same problem across time
331000	336000	or if we are dealing with different problems that take the same shape.
336000	342000	For instance, is a question what is justice the same now as it was in the wake of the Holocaust?
342000	347000	I say it isn't, because when it was asked after the Second World War,
347000	353000	it was asked in an attempt to come to terms with one of the greatest tragedies in human history.
353000	357000	But when we ask it today, we are not asking it for the same reasons.
357000	360000	We are asking it out of intellectual curiosity,
360000	364000	or perhaps we are thinking about a specific kind of justice,
364000	370000	for example social justice or racial justice or any number of other motivations.
370000	377000	So although the question what is justice remains the same, it is at once a different question.
377000	383000	And thus, we need to create different concepts in response to those different questions.
383000	388000	Therefore, philosophy must always reinvent and recreate itself.
388000	392000	We might think of philosophy here in contrast to science.
392000	398000	Science, once it is found the right answer, sticks to that answer indefinitely,
398000	403000	unless that answer is proven to be wrong, at which point it seeks a new answer.
403000	408000	Philosophy, however, has to be done over and over and over again.
408000	415000	There is always a new problem that requires a concept, a new dogma that needs to be challenged.
415000	419000	This brings us to the second aspect of Deleuze and Guattari's view on philosophy,
419000	423000	namely that it is a distinct way of handling chaos.
423000	429000	This might be easiest to approach if we start with how Deleuze and Guattari say science handles chaos.
429000	434000	According to them, science provides things with their proper names.
434000	440000	These proper names make up core names on a plane of reference that gives stability to the chaos.
440000	446000	This somewhat obscure phrasing might be understood as being about objective knowledge,
446000	450000	that science provides us with empirical, dispassionate knowledge about the world
450000	456000	and gives stability to the chaos of living, like our dam gives stability to a river.
456000	458000	Consider the experience of love.
458000	464000	It can be an intense, fieve-like experience, and may cause us to act in ways we would never expect,
464000	467000	completely rationally at times.
467000	471000	Science allows us to understand these chaotic elements of living
471000	475000	by giving us insight into how our neurobiology works.
475000	479000	When we are in love, certain chemicals are released into our brains.
479000	483000	These chemicals, which according to a big-think interview with Helen Fisher,
483000	490000	create a similar reaction in the brain as being high on cocaine, thereby accounting for our irrational behavior.
490000	495000	What science can't do is deliver its insight into our subjective experiences of love,
495000	503000	because that lies beyond its scope, and therein lies the utility of philosophy in place of science.
503000	508000	We look to the ancient Greek philosophers who were the forefathers of Western philosophy,
508000	511000	as they had three different conceptions of love.
511000	514000	Eros, Agape, and Filia.
514000	521000	Eros is associated with a kind of sexual desire, a passionate, spirited kind of love.
521000	524000	Agape often means a religious love.
524000	528000	It is a love of God, his love of us, and our love of each other through God.
528000	534000	Filia represents a kind of brotherly love between friends, or a familial love between family members.
534000	541000	These different conceptions of love help us grasp our different experiences of love for different people.
541000	548000	This way, philosophy helps us deal with the chaos of living in a different way from science.
548000	557000	In Deluz and Guattari's words, through the creation of concepts, philosophy gives consistency to chaos while preserving its intensity.
557000	562000	Just like we compared science to dam stabilizing and controlling the water,
562000	570000	we might compare philosophy to a sailboat channeling the winds of chaos without being at their mercy.
570000	574000	Philosophy then seems to gain a certain sociological aspect,
574000	581000	as giving consistency to chaos is of little use if only a handful of academics have access to it.
581000	588000	As such, this perspective seems to demand that philosophy take on an active role in social discourse.
588000	592000	Here, however, we encounter a bit of a problem.
592000	597000	See, if this one thing Deluz is best known for, it is being difficult to read.
597000	601000	His work is often complicated and filled with technical terminology
601000	606000	that is near incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't devoted several years to studying philosophy.
606000	610000	Even then, you're not guaranteed comprehension.
610000	617000	A Deluz scholar called Daniel Smith once commented that even he sometimes struggles to understand what Deluz and Guattari mean,
617000	619000	even after years of studying them.
619000	622000	So what are we to make of what is philosophy?
622000	625000	Is it just another book written by academics?
625000	631000	Four academics, trying to define a technical term which in this case just happens to be philosophy?
631000	633000	I don't think that's the case.
633000	637000	After all, something Deluz has consistently emphasized,
637000	643000	particularly in his cooperation with Guattari, is the value of the creative act.
643000	647000	Therefore, I believe what Deluz and Guattari are really doing
647000	652000	is establishing a theoretical basis for philosophical experimentation.
652000	657000	After all, that is certainly something Deluz himself can be said to practice.
657000	663000	His work on the history of philosophy has at times been called creative misreadings,
663000	668000	because it seems disinterested in the intentions of whatever philosopher he is writing about.
668000	672000	Instead, he focuses on the potential he sees in said philosopher,
672000	676000	and the possibilities for newness he finds in their texts.
676000	682000	To drive this point home, I want to leave you with a final quote from Deluz and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus,
682000	686000	which is a quote to embrace creativity and explore new possibilities,
686000	688000	and it reads as follows.
688000	690000	This is how it should be done.
690000	692000	Lodge yourself on a stratum.
692000	695000	Experiment with the possibilities it offers.
695000	698000	Find an advantageous place on it.
698000	701000	Find potential movements of de-territorialization.
701000	703000	Possible lines of flight.
703000	705000	Experience them.
705000	708000	Produce flow conjunctions here and there.
708000	713000	Try out continuums of intensities, segment by segment.
713000	717000	Have a small plot of new land at all times.
717000	721000	So the next time you pick up a philosophy book or listen to a lecture,
721000	725000	don't just wonder if the theories you are presented with are correct.
725000	727000	Ask what you might take away from it.
727000	731000	What possibilities for newness is hidden beneath the surface.
731000	736000	How the ideas presented there can be applied in new and creative ways.
736000	740000	That is exactly what making this video has been an attempt at doing.
740000	746000	By taking the context of a very complex book and placing it against a backdrop of scientism,
746000	749000	I have attempted to explore Deleuze's ideas in a new way,
749000	753000	hoping that it might reveal new possibilities for approaching his thought.
753000	758000	Whether I have been successful, I will leave up to you to decide.
758000	760000	If you want to learn more about Deleuze,
760000	765000	I can recommend introductory videos by both Jonas Shaker as well as then and now.
765000	770000	If you want to go more in depth, you can check out the podcast Philosophize This,
770000	772000	which has five episodes on Deleuze.
772000	776000	Or you can check out my personal favorite, The Plastic Pilts Podcast.
776000	779000	We'll find both episodes where they talk about Deleuze
779000	783000	and interviews of Deleuze scholars like Daniel Smith.
783000	786000	If you prefer books, then I recommend Todd Mays,
786000	788000	Gilles Deleuze and Introduction,
788000	793000	or The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze by Henry Thomas Hall and Daniel Smith.
793000	796000	But on my part, that's all I've got for you today.
796000	799000	I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you soon.
799000	801000	Take care, bye.
