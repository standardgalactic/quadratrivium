00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Philosophy is dead. It couldn't keep up with the sciences, so science left it behind.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
We do not need philosophy anymore for the questions that once belonged to philosophy.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Questions of being, of free will, of reality itself can now be answered by science.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Thus proclaimed the physicists Stephen Hawking and Lenin Mladinov in the book The Grand Design.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Their view is an example of what is called scientism, the belief that all things can be understood scientifically,

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
and that scientific knowledge is the most valuable form of knowledge there is.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
In this video I want to respond to scientism and the supposed death of philosophy

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
by introducing you to Gilles Deleuze and his unorthodox understanding of the purpose of philosophy, contra-science.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Deleuze was the French philosopher who was highly influential in the late 20th century.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
His work is known for being subversive and challenging the orthodoxies of his time.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Writing on the history of philosophy, he sought out thinkers he believed to have been marginalised

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
and attempted to create new ways of thinking and break free of what he called the dogmatic image of thought.

01:16.000 --> 01:25.000
In addition to writing on historical philosophers, he also wrote on things such as art, cinema, psychoanalysis and literature.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And toward the end of his life, he decided to look back at his career

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
and define exactly what he thought the purpose of philosophy was.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
So he wrote the book What is Philosophy, together with his good friend, the psychoanalyst, Felix Guattari.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
The two had already written three books together, The Antietopus, A Thousand Plateaus, and a book about Kafka, respectively.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
This was the first and only directly philosophical book the pair would write.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
In What is Philosophy, they put forth the thesis that philosophy is the art of creating concepts.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
This is by no means a new idea for Deleuze.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
We find this assertion even in his early work.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
But now, Deleuze wants to slow down and really create a theoretical basis for his claim.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
As they write in the beginning of their book, the question, What is Philosophy, can perhaps be posed only late in life,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
with the arrival of old age and the time for speaking concretely.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
It was asked before, it was always being asked, but always too indirectly or obliquely.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
The question was too artificial or too abstract.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
In developing the aforementioned basis, they start by distancing themselves from popular conceptions of philosophy,

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
as being about reflection, communication, or contemplation.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
Communication, they say, only leads to consensus, which inevitably reinforces the dogmas of our society.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
And they outright laugh at the proposition that philosophy is about reflection or contemplation,

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
saying that mathematicians or artists have never waited on philosophers to reflect on or contemplate their work.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
If philosophy is its own discipline, it must be because it has a purpose distinct from other fields.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
And that purpose, they write, is to create concepts.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
The first principle they present of their understanding of philosophy is that philosophers always create concepts in response to problems.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
But what they mean by problem is a little different from what you and I think of when we say problem.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
We think of problems in terms of solutions.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
For example, if we put forth a mathematical problem like, What is 2 plus 2?

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
We are doing so because we want to find the correct answer.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
4. Delusion-Guatterie's understanding, however, sees the problem as forcing us to think,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
without necessarily coming to a singular conclusion.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
The solution instead co-exists with other solutions.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
As such, the philosopher tries to create concepts as a way of answering the problems he is faced with.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
Not to provide universal or final solutions, but to provide new alternative responses to the problem.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
But the problems don't remain stagnant. They are forever changing.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
Therefore, philosophy must change with them, as delusion-Guatterie themselves write.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
If one can still be a Platonist, a Cartesian or a Kantian today,

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
it is because one is justified in thinking that their concepts can be reactivated in our problems

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
and inspire those concepts that need to be created.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
What is the best way to follow the great philosophers?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Is it to repeat what they said?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
What to do as they did?

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
That is to say, create concepts for problems that necessarily change.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Through presenting philosophy as acting in response to problems,

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
delusion-Guatterie are creating a conception of philosophy as being in need of constant change,

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
thereby denouncing all claims to philosophy as being about universal truths.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
But what about the eternal problems, you might ask?

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Problems like what is justice have been posited throughout history

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
and will probably continue to be asked to the end of time.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
Surely this is an example of a universal problem that requires a universal solution.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Though this might appear to be the case,

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
we must first ask whether we are dealing with the same problem across time

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
or if we are dealing with different problems that take the same shape.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
For instance, is a question what is justice the same now as it was in the wake of the Holocaust?

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I say it isn't, because when it was asked after the Second World War,

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
it was asked in an attempt to come to terms with one of the greatest tragedies in human history.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
But when we ask it today, we are not asking it for the same reasons.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
We are asking it out of intellectual curiosity,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
or perhaps we are thinking about a specific kind of justice,

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
for example social justice or racial justice or any number of other motivations.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
So although the question what is justice remains the same, it is at once a different question.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And thus, we need to create different concepts in response to those different questions.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Therefore, philosophy must always reinvent and recreate itself.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
We might think of philosophy here in contrast to science.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
Science, once it is found the right answer, sticks to that answer indefinitely,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
unless that answer is proven to be wrong, at which point it seeks a new answer.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Philosophy, however, has to be done over and over and over again.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
There is always a new problem that requires a concept, a new dogma that needs to be challenged.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
This brings us to the second aspect of Deleuze and Guattari's view on philosophy,

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
namely that it is a distinct way of handling chaos.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
This might be easiest to approach if we start with how Deleuze and Guattari say science handles chaos.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
According to them, science provides things with their proper names.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
These proper names make up core names on a plane of reference that gives stability to the chaos.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
This somewhat obscure phrasing might be understood as being about objective knowledge,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
that science provides us with empirical, dispassionate knowledge about the world

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
and gives stability to the chaos of living, like our dam gives stability to a river.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Consider the experience of love.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
It can be an intense, fieve-like experience, and may cause us to act in ways we would never expect,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
completely rationally at times.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Science allows us to understand these chaotic elements of living

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
by giving us insight into how our neurobiology works.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
When we are in love, certain chemicals are released into our brains.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
These chemicals, which according to a big-think interview with Helen Fisher,

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
create a similar reaction in the brain as being high on cocaine, thereby accounting for our irrational behavior.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
What science can't do is deliver its insight into our subjective experiences of love,

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
because that lies beyond its scope, and therein lies the utility of philosophy in place of science.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
We look to the ancient Greek philosophers who were the forefathers of Western philosophy,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
as they had three different conceptions of love.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Eros, Agape, and Filia.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
Eros is associated with a kind of sexual desire, a passionate, spirited kind of love.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Agape often means a religious love.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
It is a love of God, his love of us, and our love of each other through God.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
Filia represents a kind of brotherly love between friends, or a familial love between family members.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
These different conceptions of love help us grasp our different experiences of love for different people.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
This way, philosophy helps us deal with the chaos of living in a different way from science.

09:08.000 --> 09:17.000
In Deluz and Guattari's words, through the creation of concepts, philosophy gives consistency to chaos while preserving its intensity.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Just like we compared science to dam stabilizing and controlling the water,

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
we might compare philosophy to a sailboat channeling the winds of chaos without being at their mercy.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Philosophy then seems to gain a certain sociological aspect,

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
as giving consistency to chaos is of little use if only a handful of academics have access to it.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
As such, this perspective seems to demand that philosophy take on an active role in social discourse.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Here, however, we encounter a bit of a problem.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
See, if this one thing Deluz is best known for, it is being difficult to read.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
His work is often complicated and filled with technical terminology

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
that is near incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't devoted several years to studying philosophy.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Even then, you're not guaranteed comprehension.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
A Deluz scholar called Daniel Smith once commented that even he sometimes struggles to understand what Deluz and Guattari mean,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
even after years of studying them.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So what are we to make of what is philosophy?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Is it just another book written by academics?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Four academics, trying to define a technical term which in this case just happens to be philosophy?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't think that's the case.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
After all, something Deluz has consistently emphasized,

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
particularly in his cooperation with Guattari, is the value of the creative act.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Therefore, I believe what Deluz and Guattari are really doing

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
is establishing a theoretical basis for philosophical experimentation.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
After all, that is certainly something Deluz himself can be said to practice.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
His work on the history of philosophy has at times been called creative misreadings,

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
because it seems disinterested in the intentions of whatever philosopher he is writing about.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Instead, he focuses on the potential he sees in said philosopher,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
and the possibilities for newness he finds in their texts.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
To drive this point home, I want to leave you with a final quote from Deluz and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
which is a quote to embrace creativity and explore new possibilities,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
and it reads as follows.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
This is how it should be done.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Lodge yourself on a stratum.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Experiment with the possibilities it offers.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Find an advantageous place on it.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Find potential movements of de-territorialization.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Possible lines of flight.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Experience them.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Produce flow conjunctions here and there.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Try out continuums of intensities, segment by segment.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Have a small plot of new land at all times.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
So the next time you pick up a philosophy book or listen to a lecture,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
don't just wonder if the theories you are presented with are correct.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Ask what you might take away from it.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
What possibilities for newness is hidden beneath the surface.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
How the ideas presented there can be applied in new and creative ways.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
That is exactly what making this video has been an attempt at doing.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
By taking the context of a very complex book and placing it against a backdrop of scientism,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
I have attempted to explore Deleuze's ideas in a new way,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
hoping that it might reveal new possibilities for approaching his thought.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Whether I have been successful, I will leave up to you to decide.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
If you want to learn more about Deleuze,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
I can recommend introductory videos by both Jonas Shaker as well as then and now.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
If you want to go more in depth, you can check out the podcast Philosophize This,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
which has five episodes on Deleuze.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Or you can check out my personal favorite, The Plastic Pilts Podcast.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
We'll find both episodes where they talk about Deleuze

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
and interviews of Deleuze scholars like Daniel Smith.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
If you prefer books, then I recommend Todd Mays,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Gilles Deleuze and Introduction,

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
or The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze by Henry Thomas Hall and Daniel Smith.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
But on my part, that's all I've got for you today.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I hope you enjoyed the video and I'll see you soon.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Take care, bye.
