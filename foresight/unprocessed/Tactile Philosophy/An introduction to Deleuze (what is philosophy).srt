1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Philosophy is dead. It couldn't keep up with the sciences, so science left it behind.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We do not need philosophy anymore for the questions that once belonged to philosophy.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Questions of being, of free will, of reality itself can now be answered by science.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Thus proclaimed the physicists Stephen Hawking and Lenin Mladinov in the book The Grand Design.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Their view is an example of what is called scientism, the belief that all things can be understood scientifically,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and that scientific knowledge is the most valuable form of knowledge there is.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In this video I want to respond to scientism and the supposed death of philosophy

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
by introducing you to Gilles Deleuze and his unorthodox understanding of the purpose of philosophy, contra-science.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Deleuze was the French philosopher who was highly influential in the late 20th century.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
His work is known for being subversive and challenging the orthodoxies of his time.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Writing on the history of philosophy, he sought out thinkers he believed to have been marginalised

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and attempted to create new ways of thinking and break free of what he called the dogmatic image of thought.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In addition to writing on historical philosophers, he also wrote on things such as art, cinema, psychoanalysis and literature.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And toward the end of his life, he decided to look back at his career

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and define exactly what he thought the purpose of philosophy was.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So he wrote the book What is Philosophy, together with his good friend, the psychoanalyst, Felix Guattari.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The two had already written three books together, The Antietopus, A Thousand Plateaus, and a book about Kafka, respectively.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This was the first and only directly philosophical book the pair would write.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In What is Philosophy, they put forth the thesis that philosophy is the art of creating concepts.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is by no means a new idea for Deleuze.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We find this assertion even in his early work.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But now, Deleuze wants to slow down and really create a theoretical basis for his claim.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As they write in the beginning of their book, the question, What is Philosophy, can perhaps be posed only late in life,

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
with the arrival of old age and the time for speaking concretely.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was asked before, it was always being asked, but always too indirectly or obliquely.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The question was too artificial or too abstract.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In developing the aforementioned basis, they start by distancing themselves from popular conceptions of philosophy,

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
as being about reflection, communication, or contemplation.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Communication, they say, only leads to consensus, which inevitably reinforces the dogmas of our society.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And they outright laugh at the proposition that philosophy is about reflection or contemplation,

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
saying that mathematicians or artists have never waited on philosophers to reflect on or contemplate their work.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If philosophy is its own discipline, it must be because it has a purpose distinct from other fields.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And that purpose, they write, is to create concepts.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The first principle they present of their understanding of philosophy is that philosophers always create concepts in response to problems.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But what they mean by problem is a little different from what you and I think of when we say problem.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We think of problems in terms of solutions.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For example, if we put forth a mathematical problem like, What is 2 plus 2?

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We are doing so because we want to find the correct answer.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
4. Delusion-Guatterie's understanding, however, sees the problem as forcing us to think,

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
without necessarily coming to a singular conclusion.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The solution instead co-exists with other solutions.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
As such, the philosopher tries to create concepts as a way of answering the problems he is faced with.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Not to provide universal or final solutions, but to provide new alternative responses to the problem.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But the problems don't remain stagnant. They are forever changing.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Therefore, philosophy must change with them, as delusion-Guatterie themselves write.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If one can still be a Platonist, a Cartesian or a Kantian today,

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
it is because one is justified in thinking that their concepts can be reactivated in our problems

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and inspire those concepts that need to be created.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is the best way to follow the great philosophers?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it to repeat what they said?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What to do as they did?

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That is to say, create concepts for problems that necessarily change.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Through presenting philosophy as acting in response to problems,

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
delusion-Guatterie are creating a conception of philosophy as being in need of constant change,

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
thereby denouncing all claims to philosophy as being about universal truths.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But what about the eternal problems, you might ask?

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Problems like what is justice have been posited throughout history

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and will probably continue to be asked to the end of time.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Surely this is an example of a universal problem that requires a universal solution.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Though this might appear to be the case,

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
we must first ask whether we are dealing with the same problem across time

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or if we are dealing with different problems that take the same shape.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For instance, is a question what is justice the same now as it was in the wake of the Holocaust?

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I say it isn't, because when it was asked after the Second World War,

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it was asked in an attempt to come to terms with one of the greatest tragedies in human history.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But when we ask it today, we are not asking it for the same reasons.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We are asking it out of intellectual curiosity,

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
or perhaps we are thinking about a specific kind of justice,

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
for example social justice or racial justice or any number of other motivations.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So although the question what is justice remains the same, it is at once a different question.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And thus, we need to create different concepts in response to those different questions.

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Therefore, philosophy must always reinvent and recreate itself.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We might think of philosophy here in contrast to science.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Science, once it is found the right answer, sticks to that answer indefinitely,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
unless that answer is proven to be wrong, at which point it seeks a new answer.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Philosophy, however, has to be done over and over and over again.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There is always a new problem that requires a concept, a new dogma that needs to be challenged.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This brings us to the second aspect of Deleuze and Guattari's view on philosophy,

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
namely that it is a distinct way of handling chaos.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This might be easiest to approach if we start with how Deleuze and Guattari say science handles chaos.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
According to them, science provides things with their proper names.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
These proper names make up core names on a plane of reference that gives stability to the chaos.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This somewhat obscure phrasing might be understood as being about objective knowledge,

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
that science provides us with empirical, dispassionate knowledge about the world

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and gives stability to the chaos of living, like our dam gives stability to a river.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Consider the experience of love.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It can be an intense, fieve-like experience, and may cause us to act in ways we would never expect,

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
completely rationally at times.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Science allows us to understand these chaotic elements of living

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
by giving us insight into how our neurobiology works.

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When we are in love, certain chemicals are released into our brains.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
These chemicals, which according to a big-think interview with Helen Fisher,

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
create a similar reaction in the brain as being high on cocaine, thereby accounting for our irrational behavior.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What science can't do is deliver its insight into our subjective experiences of love,

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
because that lies beyond its scope, and therein lies the utility of philosophy in place of science.

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We look to the ancient Greek philosophers who were the forefathers of Western philosophy,

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
as they had three different conceptions of love.

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Eros, Agape, and Filia.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Eros is associated with a kind of sexual desire, a passionate, spirited kind of love.

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Agape often means a religious love.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It is a love of God, his love of us, and our love of each other through God.

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Filia represents a kind of brotherly love between friends, or a familial love between family members.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
These different conceptions of love help us grasp our different experiences of love for different people.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This way, philosophy helps us deal with the chaos of living in a different way from science.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In Deluz and Guattari's words, through the creation of concepts, philosophy gives consistency to chaos while preserving its intensity.

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Just like we compared science to dam stabilizing and controlling the water,

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
we might compare philosophy to a sailboat channeling the winds of chaos without being at their mercy.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Philosophy then seems to gain a certain sociological aspect,

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
as giving consistency to chaos is of little use if only a handful of academics have access to it.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As such, this perspective seems to demand that philosophy take on an active role in social discourse.

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Here, however, we encounter a bit of a problem.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
See, if this one thing Deluz is best known for, it is being difficult to read.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
His work is often complicated and filled with technical terminology

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that is near incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't devoted several years to studying philosophy.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Even then, you're not guaranteed comprehension.

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A Deluz scholar called Daniel Smith once commented that even he sometimes struggles to understand what Deluz and Guattari mean,

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
even after years of studying them.

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So what are we to make of what is philosophy?

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is it just another book written by academics?

120
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Four academics, trying to define a technical term which in this case just happens to be philosophy?

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't think that's the case.

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
After all, something Deluz has consistently emphasized,

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
particularly in his cooperation with Guattari, is the value of the creative act.

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Therefore, I believe what Deluz and Guattari are really doing

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is establishing a theoretical basis for philosophical experimentation.

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
After all, that is certainly something Deluz himself can be said to practice.

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
His work on the history of philosophy has at times been called creative misreadings,

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
because it seems disinterested in the intentions of whatever philosopher he is writing about.

129
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Instead, he focuses on the potential he sees in said philosopher,

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and the possibilities for newness he finds in their texts.

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
To drive this point home, I want to leave you with a final quote from Deluz and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus,

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
which is a quote to embrace creativity and explore new possibilities,

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and it reads as follows.

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is how it should be done.

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Lodge yourself on a stratum.

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Experiment with the possibilities it offers.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Find an advantageous place on it.

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Find potential movements of de-territorialization.

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Possible lines of flight.

140
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Experience them.

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Produce flow conjunctions here and there.

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Try out continuums of intensities, segment by segment.

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Have a small plot of new land at all times.

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So the next time you pick up a philosophy book or listen to a lecture,

145
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
don't just wonder if the theories you are presented with are correct.

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ask what you might take away from it.

147
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What possibilities for newness is hidden beneath the surface.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How the ideas presented there can be applied in new and creative ways.

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That is exactly what making this video has been an attempt at doing.

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
By taking the context of a very complex book and placing it against a backdrop of scientism,

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have attempted to explore Deleuze's ideas in a new way,

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
hoping that it might reveal new possibilities for approaching his thought.

153
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Whether I have been successful, I will leave up to you to decide.

154
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you want to learn more about Deleuze,

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can recommend introductory videos by both Jonas Shaker as well as then and now.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you want to go more in depth, you can check out the podcast Philosophize This,

157
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
which has five episodes on Deleuze.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or you can check out my personal favorite, The Plastic Pilts Podcast.

159
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We'll find both episodes where they talk about Deleuze

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and interviews of Deleuze scholars like Daniel Smith.
