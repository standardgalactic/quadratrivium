30000	34000	You wonder what you'll find with an open mind.
34000	38000	You may be surprised.
38000	41000	Yeah!
41000	46000	You gotta get away from this illusion.
46000	50000	For the sake of the world, this delusion.
50000	55000	It's gotta, gotta, gotta go.
55000	59000	Yeah!
60000	66000	Hey everybody, welcome to the Atheist Experience.
66000	72000	I'm your host, Russell Glasser, and with me today, I am honored to be joined by Dr. Richard Carrier.
72000	73000	Hello.
73000	80000	The author of On the Historicity of Jesus and Homer Hitler Bible Christ, among a lot of things.
80000	87000	And here on this side is Chris Johnson, author and filmmaker of A Better Life.
87000	92000	A hundred atheists speak out on joy and meaning in a world without God.
92000	97000	We're, we're here doing the show live today after the Bat Cruise,
97000	101000	which means that just like every time this year, we've got a huge studio audience.
101000	102000	Let's hear it.
102000	107000	Wow.
107000	111000	Today is Sunday, September 28th, 2014,
111000	116000	where we are live calling public access Atheist television show based in Austin, Texas,
116000	121000	dedicated to promoting positive atheism and the separation of church and state.

144000	148000	If you enjoy the show today, please check out our related podcast, The Nonprofits,
148000	152000	which airs the first and third Wednesday of every month.
152000	157000	And as usual, the cast and crew of the Atheist experience is going to be getting together
157000	162000	after the show at El Arroyo at 1624 West Fifth Street.
162000	164000	We'll be arriving at around 6 p.m.
164000	168000	Now, all those people you just heard, a bunch of them are going,
168000	171000	so it's going to be pretty crowded.
171000	174000	Just fair warning.
174000	177000	So that's it for the announcements,
177000	181000	and I'm going to kick it over to Richard,
181000	185000	who's going to tell us a few things, maybe from the lecture we heard yesterday
185000	187000	and about his work.
187000	189000	Yeah, right.
189000	193000	Well, my latest book is on the historicity of Jesus and the significance of this,
193000	195000	and I talked about it yesterday,
195000	200000	was this idea that Jesus never really existed as a historical person
200000	202000	has been kicked around for about 100 years,
202000	206000	and in the last 20 years, a lot of amateur books and websites and things have come out.
206000	210000	It even, like, was a featured topic in Religious, the movie.
210000	214000	But the problem is that there's a lot of misinformation, a lot of bad scholarship,
214000	217000	but there's also a lot of good stuff in there as well, and it's all sort of mixed up.
217000	221000	And no one had really gone through the trouble of clearing away all the bad stuff,
221000	223000	doing all the good stuff, doing thorough research on it all,
223000	227000	and then presenting it in a manner that would pass peer review at an academic press.
227000	231000	And so my book is actually the first book arguing that there was no Jesus,
231000	233000	that it was actually a mythical person that was made up,
233000	236000	or at least the Jesus of Galilee was made up.
236000	240000	It's the first one to be published by a university, the University of Sheffield,
240000	243000	and to have passed extensive peer review within the field.
243000	247000	And so it's going to get more attention from scholars in the field,
247000	250000	and since it doesn't have all of the bogus stuff in it that other things have had,
250000	257000	it's actually the first really good case that I think might start to rattle the cages of biblical studies.
257000	262000	And I guess maybe we can talk more about that if people call in and want to know more about it.
262000	263000	But that's just the gist.
263000	268000	Sure, yeah. With both Richard and Chris here talking about their topics,
268000	271000	this would be a great day to talk about something they know about.
271000	276000	But we'll be happy to get the usual kind of calls too. Anything else?
276000	280000	No, that's it, actually.
280000	282000	Oh, well, I suppose I should mention for those who don't know,
282000	286000	my PhD is in ancient history from Columbia University,
286000	290000	history of philosophy, religion, and science in the Greco-Roman era.
290000	295000	So that's my main field of expertise for those who are interested in calling in on that subject.
295000	298000	Okay. Chris, how are you doing?
298000	300000	Well, I'm good. I'm thrilled to be here.
300000	303000	And I worked on a project called A Better Life.
303000	306000	A hundred atheists speak out and join, meaning in a world without God.
306000	310000	I'm working on the film version right now as well, putting that together.
310000	315000	Basically, I wanted to change the way we talk about atheism
315000	318000	and talk about atheism from a positive perspective.
318000	321000	Instead of talking about what we are reeling against,
321000	324000	talk about what we love, what we're passionate about, what we value.
324000	329000	So I worked on a book, put that together, and now I'm putting together a film.
329000	335000	And I actually brought a clip along to show you a little bit about what I'm doing.
335000	337000	All right, let's hear it.
344000	345000	It's coming.
345000	348000	I'm hearing unhappy noises from the studio.
348000	350000	Live public access, everybody.
350000	352000	It'll happen.
360000	363000	Life is like its own reward.
363000	369000	You know, this idea that some people have that atheists must be nihilists
369000	373000	who have no purpose, and they're all dull or all the time,
373000	377000	and, oh, this life has no meaning and purpose, and why don't we just end it all?
377000	380000	I just, I cannot grasp that.
380000	385000	The more I've understood about how the universe works, the more that all,
385000	389000	the more joy, rather than it going, oh, it's just clockwork.
389000	392000	The sun's there, and we go around it every year and all that stuff.
392000	393000	No, I think that's amazing.
393000	395000	That is extraordinary how that's happening.
395000	401000	Since we are made of the same stuff, the same molecules that were created,
401000	405000	you know, in the explosions of the stars,
405000	413000	and we ourselves have evolved this incredible ability to contemplate our place in the universe,
413000	416000	we are a way for the cosmos to know itself.
443000	445000	Thank you.
473000	476000	You have instant, profound meaning in your life.
476000	478000	You happen to be alive right now.
478000	480000	You should really make the most of it.
480000	485000	So you have about 300 months to live with passion, to live with vividness,
485000	492000	to live trying to do something, make something, trying to create some significance.
492000	496000	People love things that they find beautiful,
496000	499000	and it can be a very expensive thing and an exquisite thing,
499000	504000	or it can just be as simple as, I used to have that when I was a child,
504000	507000	and I can't believe I've seen this now in the thrift store.
507000	511000	I haven't thought of this thing in, you know, 30 years.
511000	515000	And then there's my dogs.
515000	518000	Then there's the dog.
518000	520000	We love our dogs.
529000	543000	Thanks, Chris.
543000	545000	Thank you.
545000	547000	So we're going to go straight to calls now.
547000	549000	Nobody has any objections.
549000	555000	We're going to be starting with a local caller from, it's Christian from Cedar Park, Texas.
555000	557000	Hello.
557000	558000	Hi, Christian.
558000	560000	Hey, how's it going?
560000	562000	Good. How are you?
562000	565000	I'm pretty good.
565000	572000	I had a question for you guys, and I think it relates a little bit to Mr. Johnson
572000	577000	and his kind of the theme of his movie, too, a little bit.
577000	578000	Okay.
578000	588000	And that is, if somebody is religious and they have a predisposition towards religion,
588000	597000	then it seems like that even if they, excuse me.
597000	598000	Go on.
598000	602000	Even if they have a, I'm going to get a little echo.
602000	603000	Oh.
603000	605000	Sorry.
605000	606000	They're working on it.
606000	607000	Okay.
607000	615000	So even if I had doubts about whether there was an actual God or a Supreme being,
615000	627000	then I still might want to keep being religious just for any of the multiple aspects that come from being religious.
627000	633000	And in that sense, and this doesn't really describe me right now.
633000	640000	I mean, I have faith for the time being, and I believe.
640000	649000	But I did go through other periods where I was, you know, pretty much agnostic and atheist.
649000	655000	But I didn't feel, I just always felt like there was something missing.
655000	659000	I'm getting a pretty fierce echo.
659000	662000	But just work through it.
662000	663000	I'm sorry.
663000	664000	Okay.
664000	676000	So, you know, I like the ritual of religion, and I like the worship part of it, even if
676000	683000	it's just, you know, if you're singing the phrases of creation, ultimately, you know,
683000	690000	just the idea of hymns, just kind of the emotional tone of them.
690000	696000	And I like, even when I was young, I liked church and religion more than what I wanted.
696000	701000	So you're saying basically that you're still firm in your faith right now,
701000	712000	but you're wondering if somebody who was losing their faith would ought to feel a benefit from continuing to go through the motions
712000	717000	and rituals of religion just to get the sort of comfort and fellowship that it involves.
717000	718000	Is that what you're saying?
718000	723000	Yeah, if they find it fulfilling, then...
723000	726000	Well, he was asking you, Chris.
726000	732000	You've talked to a lot of people who have been through the deconversion process.
732000	734000	Do you have a perspective on this?
734000	738000	I would just say that you don't necessarily have to stop singing religious music.
738000	745000	If you like the music, you can still sing music, even if it has a religious basis.
745000	752000	One thing that is nice, though, that, you know, the secular community really is coming together more so than it used to.
752000	758000	So you can get that fellowship and that community from atheists.
758000	764000	I mean, we spent yesterday on the Bat Cruise, and it was great hanging out with all these wonderful people and meeting people and talking.
764000	769000	I mean, you get that same sense of community and friendship from atheists,
769000	774000	and I think you can get that from a secular community just as much as a religious one.
774000	776000	Well, there's also...
776000	780000	Wait, what is it, Richard?
780000	784000	Well, there's also Sunday Assembly, which isn't my thing, but some people love that.
784000	790000	I mean, it's kind of like a hymn-based, ecstatic religious experience,
790000	793000	except it's not religious, it's for atheists and non-believers.
793000	798000	If you just Google Sunday Assembly, you can probably find websites and see where those things are going around.
798000	803000	It's kind of like, you know, it's like a little tent event that goes around the country.
803000	806000	And they want to create more of these things.
806000	809000	And they do serve a segment of the community that want that part of...
809000	814000	They just can't believe anymore in the ideology or the particular teachings of the religion,
814000	820000	but love that particular experience of church, of the singing and that particular kind of thing.
820000	822000	So they've created a sort of secular version of this.
822000	826000	So people who are into that, that might be the thing for you, I don't know.
826000	839000	Well, I think that it's also kind of the fact that religion addresses this aspect of us that is somewhat primitive
839000	843000	and, you know, some of it's lost in the past,
843000	850000	but it forms in kind of a state of innocence that innocence...
850000	855000	I'm going to have to be the curmudgeon at this table and disagree with that.
855000	858000	I don't think... by innocence I don't agree.
858000	861000	Innocence of causing harm to people.
861000	863000	Right, but no, but I mean...
863000	867000	Religion didn't just form spontaneously, as I see it.
867000	871000	It grew organically out of a bunch of social conventions.
871000	879000	And even today, most people wind up with the religion that comes from their parents or their culture or whatever.
879000	880000	Absolutely.
880000	882000	So it depends.
882000	885000	Well, let me rephrase what I meant by innocence.
885000	896000	I mean, there's a sophistication of thought that develops as you learn about science and psychology, etc.
896000	901000	In the same way that when you're a child, you can perceive things a certain way,
901000	907000	but once you learn a certain amount, you kind of lose the ability to go back to that perception.
907000	913000	But are you getting at, like, the idea of the sense of awe and wonder that you can get at the universe?
913000	915000	Well, I'm just saying that...
915000	922000	I don't think that you can go to an atheist gathering for fellowship and get the same thing
922000	927000	that you can get going to a 500-year-old cathedral and being with people
927000	933000	who are actually, you know, fully engaging in the original way.
933000	938000	But I've been to a 500-year-old cathedral and still gotten that sense of awe and wonder,
938000	940000	and it had nothing to do with God.
940000	942000	It had to do with the architecture, it had to do with the space,
942000	945000	it had to do, most of all, with the history that's part of that.
945000	946000	Absolutely.
946000	949000	So I don't think it has anything to do with, you know, God or religion.
950000	955000	What I would say to your point is that every experience is unique
955000	959000	and a lot of different experiences can be moving in a way.
959000	963000	You know, the feeling you get from going to a 500-year-old cathedral
963000	967000	is not the same feeling that you get when you go to the Louvre
967000	972000	and you look at these amazing paintings that people have worked on.
972000	975000	And I think by denying the existence of God,
975000	980000	we're not invalidating that there's some really great religious art
980000	983000	and architecture and music.
983000	990000	And you're right that you can continue to participate in those things
990000	993000	and appreciate them, but at the same time,
993000	999000	there's not the feeling that you're required to focus on that one type of thing
999000	1002000	as the only thing that can elevate you in your life.
1002000	1004000	Oh, sure.
1004000	1009000	Well, I would add also that a lot of that, of course, is marketing campaign, right?
1009000	1013000	I mean, churches, they don't just want you to come there and sing.
1013000	1016000	They want you to vote a certain way, they want you to have certain values,
1016000	1018000	they want you to treat gay people a certain way,
1018000	1020000	or they want you to treat women a certain way.
1020000	1023000	They have certain ideology they're trying to sell.
1023000	1027000	And so you're going to be socially pressured to adopt that ideology.
1027000	1029000	I know a lot of people that have left the church simply because
1029000	1031000	they no longer agreed with the values
1031000	1034000	and the congregation simply wouldn't let them be themselves.
1034000	1038000	They would constantly try to pressure them to just toe the party line.
1038000	1041000	And I think that's the main problem with that.
1041000	1044000	And you'd have to have a church like the Unitarian Universalist Church
1044000	1046000	which is accepting of all different kinds of beliefs
1046000	1049000	and they don't pressure you quite the same way.
1049000	1052000	But then maybe you won't find, I mean, they don't have 500-year-old cathedrals
1052000	1054000	in the Unitarian Church.
1054000	1056000	They weren't funded as well.
1056000	1058000	Well, you'd be surprised.
1058000	1061000	Historians have often some good land and some good churches,
1061000	1063000	but they're often more modern.
1063000	1069000	Well, what I mean to say is that the point I'm making when I'm talking about cathedrals and such
1069000	1076000	is that something is built up, it's a culture is built up around worship
1076000	1083000	and relating to God and daily activities and ways to carry out the religious life.
1083000	1091000	And like whoever said before, I turn my TV off so that I'm not looking at you guys.
1091000	1094000	Whoever said it, it grows organically.
1094000	1096000	And that's kind of what I mean by that.
1096000	1100000	Yeah, but what I'm saying is that is not unique to religion.
1100000	1105000	People form all sorts of different cultures and call it all sorts of different things.
1105000	1109000	I mean, they form football cultures and gaming cultures.
1109000	1112000	They form fraternity cultures at their college.
1112000	1115000	And those fill different roles.
1115000	1122000	People have lots of social groups in their adult life.
1122000	1125000	I didn't mean to say that it was exclusive in any way.
1125000	1130000	What I'm saying is it's all those things that have been tied together in religion.
1130000	1135000	And maybe because you were raised with that religion or because you found it attractive.
1135000	1137000	Yeah, a lot of it really comes from your upbringing.
1137000	1139000	I wasn't ready for religious and I don't miss it.
1139000	1140000	And it's not just religion.
1140000	1141000	Absolutely.
1141000	1142000	Like we said before, it's history.
1142000	1143000	It's culture.
1143000	1145000	It's all wrapped up in many of those different things.
1145000	1147000	You can't just say it's only religion.
1147000	1149000	It's a bunch of different things wrapped together.
1149000	1155000	And you can take those parts and appreciate those different parts without having to buy into the religion.
1155000	1156000	Sure.
1156000	1159000	Or you might also buy into the religion.
1159000	1160000	You could.
1160000	1163000	Lots of people do from what I've heard.
1163000	1170000	And on issues of believing in God and that kind of thing, it seems that even religious people I know,
1170000	1177000	it seems that everybody I know has some type of doubt or goes in and out of periods of certainty.
1177000	1178000	That's very common.
1178000	1181000	You have no idea how heartened I am to hear that.
1181000	1182000	Oh sure.
1182000	1184000	No, but it is true, yeah.
1184000	1185000	But so...
1185000	1187000	Yeah, I mean Mother Teresa had doubts.
1187000	1191000	That may not be any reason to leave the religion if you find it fulfilling that alone.
1191000	1195000	But the reason to leave religion is that it might actually not be true.
1195000	1197000	And it might be misleading.
1197000	1200000	And it might actually be harmful in certain aspects.
1200000	1206000	And I think that there is no reason to jettison the bad part...
1206000	1217000	To jettison all the good parts along with getting rid of the unnecessary thing of unquestioningly worshiping this infinite being
1217000	1222000	and taking at face value something that people in authority tell you all your life.
1222000	1226000	But those are what I see as the negative sides of religion.
1226000	1228000	But also I don't believe in God.
1228000	1234000	So I don't think that at the bottom level there is a basis for it.
1234000	1235000	Right.
1235000	1242000	But I'm saying being that there are people besides you who may be at different places along that spectrum
1242000	1250000	then, you know, again, what they decide is harmful and what they decide is true or not true is going to be different.
1250000	1261000	So even if somebody has major doubts about the metaphysical God, they may still go on with being religious.
1261000	1262000	Right, they may.
1262000	1264000	I think we're in agreement.
1264000	1269000	And I think that you can also, but the one other thing that I was pointing to at the beginning is
1269000	1273000	you can, some people have a religious attitude towards nature.
1273000	1274000	Yeah.
1274000	1284000	And so since God supposedly is, existence comes from God or he's the source of existence, then there's kind of an overlap there.
1284000	1286000	If you believe in God.
1286000	1288000	No, I'm saying in the concept.
1288000	1290000	There's an overlap in the concept.
1290000	1292000	There can be.
1292000	1303000	And so in that sense, it may naturally go towards what you, what was worshiping God may naturally go towards an appreciation or a love or a worship of nature.
1303000	1309000	Yeah, there are all kinds of things you can channel that energy into that aren't explicitly religious.
1309000	1311000	But I think you can do it a religious way.
1311000	1313000	I think we're going to move on to other callers now.
1313000	1314000	All right.
1314000	1315000	Thanks for calling, Christian.
1315000	1316000	Sure.
1316000	1317000	Good talking to you.
1317000	1319000	Bye.
1319000	1323000	I have a look in Austin.
1323000	1325000	Are you there?
1325000	1326000	Yeah.
1326000	1328000	Hi, what's up?
1328000	1330000	Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
1330000	1334000	I've been an atheist for, I think, three to four years.
1334000	1336000	I was born in India.
1336000	1339000	I was a Hindu all my life.
1339000	1343000	I think in the last five years, I've become an atheist.
1343000	1347000	Before that, I was a non religious Hindu.
1347000	1349000	I believe in spirituality.
1349000	1351000	I have a scientific background.
1351000	1356000	I went to the best scientific schools in India and US.
1356000	1368000	So I have no, I have no questions or doubts about being an atheist and the stuff we believe in.
1368000	1371000	I believe in facts and truth.
1371000	1376000	I believe in seeing what I believe.
1376000	1383000	The only thing I miss when I was not atheist is emotional void.
1383000	1394000	When I was not atheist, when I was going through bad times, I thought I had a God I would believe in.
1394000	1397000	Maybe it was a placebo effect.
1397000	1400000	Maybe it was magic or something I believed in.
1400000	1410000	But I think that is the biggest thing which is missing from your show because you talk about facts and how the Bible is wrong and how everything else is wrong.
1410000	1420000	But I do not think you're answering the question that if as atheists we go through bad times, we can talk to our families.
1420000	1423000	We can talk to our wives and sons.
1423000	1427000	And it does not have the same effect like it did before.
1428000	1440000	You spend so little time on that and I think that is a big reason which makes believers not become atheists or make atheists become believers.
1440000	1452000	So if you have really bad times in your life and you used to have supernatural power before you believed in and now you don't.
1453000	1461000	I mean you can be strong and you can be confident but how do you deal with that?
1461000	1468000	For myself, all of that I replace with good friends, determination and self-confidence.
1468000	1476000	With those three things I know that I can use reason, I can use my community, I can use the facts we've established to try and make my situation better.
1476000	1481000	And if I can't then I have those good friends that I can commiserate with and share that experience with.
1481000	1487000	And then I have my own experience of life that I can share that experience with just with myself and that respect.
1487000	1496000	And that works for me and I know it works for a lot of other people but I can't really speak necessarily to the experience of others that might be in different situations than myself.
1497000	1511000	I would just say that I think you raise a good point in a way that life is sometimes very difficult and working on a project about our life was not trying to say that everything is hunky-dory all the time and we're all happy.
1511000	1521000	Life can be very difficult and there are times where we need other people and you can believe something that's false that's comforting.
1521000	1524000	I mean you could make up something that's very comforting.
1524000	1529000	You know I could make up that I have a million dollars and that would be very comforting to me and my bank account.
1529000	1534000	But it wouldn't be true and ultimately probably wouldn't be very helpful.
1534000	1543000	And so I think looking at it realistically and thinking what, you know, this is a difficult time, how can I overcome this?
1543000	1556000	And finding real answers, friends, family, relationships, things like that, people you can count on who are actually there as opposed to praying to a God who's not there would probably be better.
1556000	1564000	But you're right that it is scary sometimes and I think we have to realize that life can be scary and that's part of the experience of it, right?
1564000	1569000	But there are ways to get through it and get through it together with other people.
1570000	1574000	The slogan, you know, that hands that help are better than lips that pray.
1574000	1586000	People that are in certain specific dire circumstances can actually find people in the same similar circumstances, band together and find a way to solve this problem or fight it or become activists and get involved.
1586000	1593000	And then you can feel like if you can't solve your problem you might be able to help make the world better so that other people don't end up in whatever situation.
1593000	1602000	Whether this is curing cancer or escaping a drug addiction or whatever it is that you're dealing with or, you know, if it's losing loved ones and all kinds of things like this.
1602000	1611000	There are lots of people who are having the same experiences that you can join and together with and bond with and work together with to actually fix it or make it better in some fashion.
1611000	1618000	And I think that you can get a lot of, you can feel really good about that, that you've made the world a better place, that you've tried to make the world a better place.
1618000	1626000	And you weren't alone. You had other people who are in the same situation but also willing to bond together and fight together and work together to make these changes.
1626000	1632000	That's all we have, really. I mean, to be honest, that's the truth of the world.
1632000	1638000	So we shouldn't not avail ourselves of that. That's the one thing that does exist that we can create.
1638000	1644000	And so we are kind of obligated really to do that if we want something better.
1645000	1648000	I don't think I can add anything to those.
1648000	1655000	Yeah, I think I get your point but I'm hurting a lot on this one.
1655000	1665000	So I'm talking to my family, my friends, but I missed the fake magic which I had with thought.
1665000	1672000	I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you, I see you're here in Austin. Have you tried, I mean, have you been to any of our meetings?
1673000	1677000	No, I just joined a group a few weeks back.
1677000	1686000	Well, I hope to see you. And I mean, I don't have any magic solutions to your problems.
1686000	1699000	But, you know, I'd like a chance to sit down with you sometime and talk about this more, especially since I don't know as much about ex-Hindus as I do about a lot of other ex-religious types.
1700000	1703000	Okay, thank you so much gentlemen.
1703000	1706000	Alright, thanks for calling and, you know, good luck.
1706000	1707000	Bye.
1710000	1714000	Gary in Columbus, Mississippi?
1716000	1717000	Gary?
1717000	1718000	Yes, I'm here.
1718000	1720000	Hi, how are you?
1720000	1722000	I'm doing great. How are you doing?
1722000	1723000	I'm well.
1723000	1726000	Nice to talk to you for the first time, Russell.
1726000	1727000	Nice to talk to you too.
1727000	1734000	You're a Matt Schuve. Well, I say you're a Matt. I've watched that experience about five years.
1734000	1735000	Thank you.
1735000	1740000	I really enjoy the show. I'm square in the Bible belt here in Columbus, Mississippi.
1740000	1743000	I don't recognize the other two guys with you at all.
1743000	1753000	Well, these are our guests from, they just gave some lectures on the Bat Cruise. Richard Carrier here is a historian and Chris Johnson.
1753000	1756000	Well, Richard Carrier, yeah, I know of him.
1756000	1757000	There you go.
1757000	1758000	Awesome.
1758000	1759000	I just recognized him.
1759000	1760000	That's who I am, yeah.
1760000	1763000	And Chris Johnson is a photographer and a filmmaker.
1763000	1765000	Hello, Chris. Nice to meet you.
1765000	1766000	Hello.
1766000	1771000	I didn't really have a question. I really just want to make a statement if I could to your viewers.
1771000	1772000	Okay.
1772000	1784000	I would like for your younger viewers, I know you've had many younger viewers, especially with this one guy that called in about, he was a teacher, a scientist teacher,
1784000	1792000	and he had several of his students, eighth grade students, calling in and, or not calling in, just viewing the show.
1792000	1799000	But, and he was upset about that. And I want to tell them just a word to the younger folks.
1799000	1807000	Don't be afraid to lose your fear that religion has instilled in you as a young person.
1807000	1808000	Right.
1808000	1810000	Well, I agree with you.
1810000	1816000	Don't feel free to lose your religion. It's okay. Don't feel fear from that.
1816000	1817000	Okay.
1817000	1831000	You know, it, you know, you might be cheered here that a lot of young people won't need that message because the younger you get in demographics, the more likely it is that people just don't believe in God these days.
1831000	1833000	I know Russell and I love that.
1833000	1834000	Yes.
1835000	1842000	In fact, I love the fact that most people who are in universities right now are less religious.
1842000	1844000	I actually have an electrical engineering degree.
1844000	1847000	Less religious. There's still majority religious.
1847000	1853000	And it seems the more educated a person is, the less likely they are to be religious.
1853000	1854000	Well, that is true.
1854000	1867000	It is true, but don't get complacent. You know, as my friend Matt Dillahunty likes to say, just because you've solved the easiest question in the world doesn't make you a genius.
1867000	1869000	That is so ultimately true.
1869000	1876000	Right. So thanks for that message, though.
1876000	1882000	For the time and I know that most of the viewers want to see religious colors.
1882000	1885000	All right. Well, thanks for calling.
1885000	1886000	Thank you for taking my call.
1886000	1887000	I'll see you.
1889000	1893000	Mario in Tucson, Arizona.
1893000	1894000	Hi.
1894000	1896000	How are you?
1896000	1897000	I'm good.
1897000	1902000	So I was wondering, I don't really have a lot of Christian friends.
1902000	1910000	I mean, well, fundamentalists, I suppose, or apologists that kind of like run my ideas fast.
1910000	1913000	Contradictions I find within the Bible.
1913000	1917000	And so I was wondering if you could possibly play like devil advocate in this situation.
1917000	1920000	Angels advocate.
1920000	1931000	So one person in particular, Matthew 1231 says, and so I tell you every kind of sin and flander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.
1931000	1941000	And so this is like the only unforgivable sin, which I find ridiculous, but doesn't I just want to know what your thoughts were on that.
1941000	1951000	Maybe if you could give an apologist statement and maybe explain where born again Christians think that they can find salvation.
1951000	1953000	I don't have a strong opinion on that.
1953000	1954000	You guys.
1954000	1956000	Yeah, I wouldn't know how to answer the second question.
1956000	1967000	I mean, the issue about blasphemy is that under Jewish law at the time, blasphemy just meant uttering the actual name of God in a non-reverent way.
1967000	1974000	So blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is almost an unintelligible statement in the context of ancient Judaism.
1974000	1982000	So we're not really sure what that statement really meant and what particular issue the Christians who wrote that passage were trying to address.
1982000	1984000	Almost certainly Jesus never said those words.
1984000	1986000	That was the invention of the later Christian community.
1986000	1993000	They were dealing with some sort of issue in their community that we don't know about because we don't have the documentation of what kind of problems they were dealing with in their church.
1993000	2001000	But someone just inserted that line in Jesus's mouth in the gospel to just have him advocate whatever position they were trying to advocate.
2001000	2006000	We don't really know what it was because we don't have the context for it.
2006000	2022000	Yeah, I mean, the only thing I'd say to this and questions like this in general is that there is no the Christian answer because with 33,000 different branches of Christianity and a lot of other religions in the world,
2022000	2032000	ultimately all this stuff is at best loosely based on this book that was assembled over a few centuries.
2032000	2049000	And so if you read up a little bit on the history of how fundamentalism came to be such a uniquely American tradition, you'll find that people are basically constructing their own theologies as they go along.
2049000	2062000	And anytime that you branch out, you know, anytime that you have a disagreement with your parent organization, a lot of times what will happen is you just branch out into a new sect of Christianity.
2062000	2063000	Right.
2063000	2070000	You know, I don't want to, like, make you go hunting down fundamentalist churches or anything and ask them.
2070000	2076000	But really, I think the problem with asking us is that we don't take any of it seriously.
2076000	2084000	And there would be a different answer depending on who you ask and what you've decided to believe in their own minds.
2084000	2105000	Okay, I suppose it's also furthermore asks that or supposes that God is not all powerful because he cannot forgive unconditionally, whereas as people people can so if someone gets like hits my dog and gets away with it, you know, driving,
2105000	2109000	I could come to forgive that person without them ever needing to ask for it.
2109000	2116000	And so this then supposes that I can do more than God, right?
2116000	2118000	Yeah, yeah.
2118000	2121000	That's a spot on statement.
2121000	2123000	There's a lot of ways you can use that argument.
2123000	2129000	I mean, whenever you're trying to use the argument from evil, they'll always come back with trying all these excuses for why God can't fix the world.
2129000	2132000	And you go, but I would fix the world if I had God's powers.
2132000	2134000	And therefore, what am I nicer than God?
2134000	2135000	Is that even possible?
2135000	2136000	You are nicer than God.
2136000	2137000	Thank you.
2137000	2139000	I've seen you in action.
2139000	2141000	I can't argue with that.
2141000	2142000	But yeah, you're absolutely right.
2142000	2148000	If there's things that we can actually do that God cannot do, that does mean we have powers that God does not have.
2148000	2151000	And that refutes the whole concept of omnipotence.
2151000	2153000	Thanks, guys, for your input.
2153000	2154000	All right.
2154000	2155000	Thanks for calling.
2155000	2157000	Bye.
2157000	2161000	We've got Jennifer from here in Austin.
2161000	2162000	Hello.
2162000	2163000	Hi, Jennifer.
2163000	2165000	Hi.
2165000	2167000	I have two questions.
2167000	2181000	And the first one is, it seems like a lot of times when you talk to atheists, they start from the premise that personal experience has been established to be unreliable.
2182000	2185000	But we rely on personal experience all the time.
2185000	2194000	Like in courtroom, the value of eyewitness testimony, that's the fundamental evidence.
2194000	2203000	The jury can take it and believe it or not believe it, but the value of personal testimony, not hearsay, what someone else has told you has been their experience.
2203000	2211000	But what you experienced yourself, the value of putting it forward, is still considered primary.
2211000	2215000	And it's a foundational principle of the U.S.
2215000	2219000	And we also rely on personal experience all the time.
2219000	2229000	Like if you're going to do something like climb the Himalayas and you've never done it, you read about people who have done that before and they say, you know, that whatever else to I experienced this.
2229000	2234000	You don't know, but you believe them.
2234000	2239000	You take precautions or you prepare based on what they experienced.
2239000	2247000	And so it seems like the value of personal experience has not been proven to be unreliable.
2247000	2255000	And then the second question is that it seems like something can be understood or it can't.
2255000	2257000	It's understandable or it's not.
2257000	2264000	And like Catholics start from the premise that the nature of reality can't be understood.
2264000	2266000	It's not understandable.
2266000	2275000	And atheists seem to start from the premise that, you know, reality is a process that could be understood.
2275000	2280000	But if it could, why don't we understand any more than we did like 2,000 years ago?
2280000	2286000	We have theory, you know, the theory of the Big Bang, but when you look at what complexity theorists say,
2286000	2294000	they say that there's still a lot of leaps that have to be made in thinking to make the concepts work.
2294000	2299000	You know, like it's not established. We still don't fully understand it.
2299000	2308000	And so if the nature of reality is understandable, why don't we understand more about it today than we did say 2,000 years ago?
2308000	2310000	Well, let's take that one at a time.
2310000	2313000	I probably should have interrupted you before going on to the second one.
2314000	2318000	Personal experience. Is it reliable?
2318000	2324000	Well, you have to realize it's not binary. It's not like all personal experience is reliable or no personal experience is reliable.
2324000	2330000	It's not like you're choosing to, you know, deny all experience or accept all experience. That's not how it works.
2330000	2334000	Personal experience has a certain probability of being reliable.
2334000	2341000	And what you're looking at is when the particular claim the person is making is going to have an intrinsic prior probability.
2341000	2349000	So if they're saying, you know, aliens abducted them or they're saying they saw a horde of demons attack them in their room or something like that,
2349000	2355000	we know from past experience that that usually turns out to be hallucinatory or not true.
2355000	2360000	And so for a personal experience to overcome that, we need a lot more evidence than that.
2360000	2366000	We need a superbly good personal experience or we need a lot of it from a lot of different sources, a lot of different witnesses,
2366000	2368000	or we need physical evidence.
2368000	2373000	You're talking about like standards of evidence that professional historians would take into account.
2373000	2379000	Oh, absolutely. Yeah. This is what I do in the book. It's Bayesian reasoning where you have to weigh the different possibilities.
2379000	2385000	So certain kinds of testimonies are unreliable or obviously unreliable because they make improbable claims.
2385000	2390000	And so for those claims to be upheld, you need more than just someone claiming it.
2391000	2402000	I mean, like what about, you know, people who wrote Gospels who said, you know, they wrote it after they say Jesus died and they say, you know, they witnessed it.
2402000	2404000	Oh, but they don't.
2404000	2406000	They were closer in time.
2406000	2410000	Yeah. None of the Gospels were written by anyone who says they saw any of the stuff they wrote down.
2410000	2414000	In fact, they don't even tell us who they are or how they know anything that they haven't.
2414000	2417000	They don't tell us their sources. They don't tell us their methods, which is very weird.
2417000	2422000	I mean, 50 years in the big scheme of things is not that much time.
2422000	2425000	And so actually it is. I made this point.
2425000	2428000	I just want to say I'm so excited to get this call with Richard.
2428000	2429000	I made this point.
2429000	2433000	It's a lot less than, you know, 1,550 years.
2433000	2436000	Well, let's talk about Roswell, New Mexico.
2436000	2445000	In 1947, this Air Force officer found some sticks and tinfoil in the desert and he claimed it was debris from a flying saucer.
2445000	2448000	Within just 30 to 40 years.
2448000	2453000	And this is in the 20th century with universal literacy, newspapers, photographs, the whole deal.
2453000	2460000	Within just 30 to 40 years, an entire legend had built up about the government discovering an entire intact flying saucer
2460000	2464000	that they recovered alien bodies from and performed autopsies on.
2464000	2466000	That's just 30 to 40 years.
2466000	2469000	So it's the exact same timeline that we're looking at with the Gospels.
2469000	2471000	Legends can spring up really fast.
2471000	2475000	It's starting from a not an eyewitness account.
2475000	2477000	Well, yeah, it is actually.
2477000	2479000	No, he said he found something.
2479000	2481000	Well, from what you said, he said he found something.
2481000	2483000	Yeah, it was published in the newspaper.
2483000	2488000	Yeah, it was in the newspaper with photographs of the debris that he found from 1947.
2488000	2492000	But you didn't say he said he saw the ship's sound.
2492000	2495000	No, no, that was what people were telling just 30 to 40 years later.
2495000	2498000	And so when we look at the Gospels, we don't know where these people were getting their stories.
2498000	2500000	They're not eyewitnesses themselves.
2500000	2502000	They don't claim to know any eyewitnesses.
2502000	2504000	They don't even tell us what their sources are.
2504000	2507000	Well, why are they written as a description?
2507000	2509000	I mean, it's written as an eyewitness description.
2509000	2511000	It actually isn't.
2511000	2516000	It's like Jesus was on the cross, then he asked for a drink.
2516000	2517000	Oh, no, no.
2517000	2518000	Oh, you know what?
2518000	2521000	I highly recommend that you can do some more research on this.
2521000	2526000	For example, the crucifixion account is almost entirely based on clips from the Psalms.
2526000	2527000	They just took passages.
2527000	2530000	If I had time, I could dig out an example from my book.
2530000	2533000	But the language is like first person.
2533000	2534000	I mean, I've read it.
2534000	2536000	Yeah, but the language is biblical.
2536000	2538000	We can look at eyewitness accounts.
2538000	2544000	We have, for example, Lucian of Samosata wrote an account of him encountering a new religion in what's now Turkey.
2544000	2546000	It's called Alexander the Quack Prophet.
2546000	2551000	You could probably find examples of it online, but that's what an eyewitness account looks like.
2551000	2553000	The Gospels aren't written like that at all.
2553000	2558000	If you look at Caesar's Civil War, he writes it in third person, but it's still an eyewitness account.
2558000	2561000	And again, it's written very differently than what we see in the Gospels.
2561000	2563000	The Gospels look a lot like mythology.
2563000	2568000	We have a lot of examples of other religions that were coming up with documents that are written in the same kind of voice.
2568000	2571000	And there were, in fact, about 40 different Gospels.
2571000	2577000	And we know about 10 to 12 of them that we have mostly intact or largely intact.
2577000	2582000	And we know a lot of those have to be false, and yet they read a lot like the Gospels we have in the New Testament.
2582000	2588000	So it was actually very common to fabricate narratives in the form that we see in the Gospels in the New Testament.
2588000	2598000	But I know from personally reading the Gospels that it sounds like a first person account.
2598000	2599000	Oh, we'll see.
2599000	2604000	I think what you need to do is you have to understand these books were written 2,000 years ago in a different language, in a different culture.
2604000	2605000	So if you want to understand that...
2605000	2607000	So it was written in time.
2607000	2611000	No, but my point is you have to look at what literature was like back then.
2611000	2617000	So you can't judge it based on the standards of what you're used to reading today because what people write today is very different.
2617000	2623000	The styles they write, the way they choose words, the way they construct stories is entirely different today than it was 2,000 years ago.
2623000	2628000	Yeah, and to circle back to your original question about how reliable personal experience is,
2628000	2635000	I mean, you're telling us that you have this personal experience of having read the Gospels and just knowing by reading it,
2635000	2639000	like knowing and inherently understanding what's going on in there.
2639000	2650000	Even though there is this whole system of historians having read it and compared notes and comparing it to things that they already know.
2650000	2654000	Tell me whether something is written as a first person account or not.
2654000	2656000	I can judge that for myself.
2656000	2659000	I can read it and I could be like, this sounds like a third person.
2659000	2660000	I'll give you an example.
2660000	2662000	It sounds like an omniscient point of view.
2662000	2664000	This sounds like a first person.
2664000	2666000	I can make that judgment myself.
2666000	2668000	But they aren't, actually.
2668000	2671000	They aren't even written in first person by a standard literary theory.
2671000	2675000	So here's the Gospel of Mark, chapter 15, verse 24.
2675000	2679000	It reads, literally, they part his garments among them, casting lots upon them.
2679000	2682000	Now here's Psalm 22, verse 18.
2682000	2685000	They part my garments among them and cast lots upon them.
2685000	2687000	It's almost identical words to words.
2687000	2689000	But what are the psalms supposed to be like prophecy?
2689000	2691000	So if it were true.
2691000	2695000	Mark is writing in the third person, the psalms are writing in the first person.
2695000	2697000	The psalms were written hundreds of years before.
2697000	2700000	But if I had the prophecy and then it was experienced.
2700000	2702000	See, that's the thing, you can say that.
2702000	2706000	But they're using the exact word for word, exact same statement.
2706000	2708000	And it doesn't even say it's a filled prophecy.
2708000	2711000	To get back to the point, I was really asking a question.
2711000	2713000	But it's third person.
2713000	2715000	It's not first person.
2715000	2717000	It's just they part his garments among them.
2717000	2723000	I've watched a couple of your shows and people will call and they'll be like,
2723000	2727000	my mom said she saw a demon in a room or you know, my friend.
2727000	2731000	And then a lot of times the first responses.
2731000	2736000	Well, you know, I would say I wasn't there.
2736000	2741000	I don't have your experience and I can't tell whether that really happened or not.
2741000	2750000	But you said that this sort of thing goes in courts and I can guarantee you that if somebody came in as a witness in court and said,
2750000	2753000	and then I saw a demon rise up out of the earth,
2753000	2761000	it's really unlikely that the judge or jury would take that into account as a serious explanation for,
2761000	2765000	let's say a murder trial or embezzlement where somebody said,
2765000	2770000	suddenly this demon made all this money disappear for the company's account.
2770000	2776000	But the value of the experience for it to be judged by the fact finder,
2776000	2778000	whether it's a jury or a judge.
2778000	2785000	The value of the person saying it and then the listener interpreting it is primary.
2785000	2790000	Chris really sounds like he's got something to say.
2790000	2792000	I want to jump in here.
2792000	2800000	You talk about eyewitness testimony being so reliable and it's the ultimate piece of evidence in our court system
2800000	2802000	and that's just not true at all.
2802000	2807000	If you look at the reliability of eyewitness testimony, it is terrible.
2807000	2811000	You put a room full of people and you show them something and then ask them what they saw.
2811000	2820000	You'll get many different answers and people have been convicted wrongly based on people who were sure this is who they saw
2820000	2825000	and they were wrong and it's very, very easy to fool yourself to think you saw something.
2825000	2830000	If you don't remember clearly, your brain will just make up stuff to fill in the gaps
2830000	2834000	and we've demonstrated that thousands of times in different studies.
2834000	2838000	Eyewitness testimony is actually really, really unreliable.
2838000	2840000	One of the leading researchers on that.
2840000	2843000	It's true what you're saying.
2843000	2846000	You put people in a room and then it's like, what's the guy wearing his tie?
2846000	2849000	And three of them say yes and two of them say no.
2849000	2854000	But we still hold that as meaningful.
2854000	2855000	Well, we shouldn't.
2855000	2857000	Chris was just saying we don't.
2857000	2862000	We don't and that would be a bad thing for everybody so we shouldn't do that.
2862000	2863000	You have to wait.
2863000	2869000	I'm an attorney and I've taken a really unconventional route.
2869000	2877000	I took my studies extremely seriously looking at the purpose of the system
2877000	2880000	and the procedure that we've established.
2880000	2885000	People from all different backgrounds coming together and deciding this is what we're going to do.
2885000	2888000	This has meaning and this is useful.
2888000	2893000	Despite the errors, this is the most fair way we can assess what's going on
2893000	2896000	and we still have witnesses.
2896000	2901000	We still take in witness accounts and we still say all relevant witnesses can be in place.
2901000	2903000	You know, witnesses can lie.
2903000	2905000	Witnesses can be deceived.
2905000	2907000	Witnesses can misreport badly.
2907000	2909000	I mean, you must know this if you've been in court.
2909000	2913000	Certainly if you're a defense attorney, you must have actually used these arguments that I'm using myself
2913000	2915000	in defense of your client.
2916000	2921000	Well, the thing is that sometimes they are telling the truth.
2921000	2923000	Sometimes, yes.
2923000	2928000	It's a thing that's primary for the witness.
2928000	2931000	You say what they're thinking for the fact finder to be like,
2931000	2934000	well, I think your mom was lying.
2934000	2940000	Yeah, but it certainly depends at least as much on the nature of the testimony
2940000	2942000	as the content of the testimony itself.
2942000	2948000	I mean, if you, you know, if today you were to have somebody walk into court
2948000	2953000	and say I saw this guy die and three days later rise from the dead
2953000	2956000	or I saw a ghost show up in my house,
2956000	2961000	that would be one of the least likely things that you were going to accept in court
2961000	2963000	as relevant to the case.
2963000	2966000	Well, it depends on what the case was about, whether it would be right.
2966000	2967000	Really?
2967000	2968000	I don't think so, actually.
2968000	2969000	Wow.
2969000	2973000	Actually, by Supreme Court ruling, spectral evidence is not allowed.
2973000	2976000	Yeah, by 16th century ruling.
2976000	2979000	We don't know what's trying to be proved.
2979000	2982000	I mean, it would depend on what kind of case it was.
2982000	2987000	I mean, you're talking about a dread case where someone killed someone else
2987000	2990000	and, you know, they're saying what they experienced
2990000	2992000	and that's why they killed that person.
2992000	2994000	And it's like, was it intentional?
2994000	2995000	Was it not intentional?
2995000	2996000	Are they lying?
2996000	2998000	It depends on what's being proved.
2998000	3002000	So, I mean, to my second question, as far as, you know,
3002000	3008000	whether things, you know, everything is understandable or it's not.
3008000	3011000	I can answer that one because this is right in my field.
3011000	3013000	But you, please go ahead.
3013000	3015000	Do we understand more than we did 2,000 years ago?
3015000	3018000	My PhD's primary subject is history of science.
3018000	3021000	So, and I studied ancient science.
3021000	3024000	So I actually, a lot of what I've done is certainly in my dissertation
3024000	3028000	was compare what we knew scientifically about the world
3028000	3030000	in the first and second century AD
3030000	3032000	with what we know about the world today.
3032000	3038000	And it's mind-bogglingly vastly more understanding today than we had.
3038000	3043000	I mean, just bewildering how much more understanding we have today.
3043000	3045000	So much so that what we've thoroughly established
3045000	3049000	over the last, since the scientific revolution in the 17th century
3049000	3051000	in just the last few hundred years,
3051000	3055000	we've thoroughly established that the scientific method is so incredibly effective
3055000	3057000	that it can take our understanding of the world
3057000	3060000	and multiply it millions and millions of times.
3060000	3063000	I mean, which it has done so since 1600.
3063000	3067000	So we know, what does anything we know is that science works exceedingly well.
3067000	3071000	And the only thing that actually interferes with our advance,
3071000	3075000	that slows it down perhaps, is technological access to the data.
3075000	3078000	A lot of the things, the questions we can't answer today,
3078000	3081000	we only can't answer because we just don't have the particular machine
3081000	3083000	that can see the thing that we want to look at.
3083000	3086000	Or, you know, in particular ways, for example, brain science.
3086000	3088000	To really understand how the brain works,
3088000	3092000	we would need a functional brain scanner that can scan the brain as it works
3092000	3095000	down to the resolution of individual synaptic connections.
3095000	3098000	We just haven't developed that technology yet,
3098000	3101000	but within 50 or 60 years we may have scanners that can do that.
3101000	3103000	And that's just a technological obstacle.
3103000	3107000	The thing that I'm wondering, so like with that example you just gave,
3107000	3112000	we know that it is understandable, but we're not there yet.
3112000	3113000	Sure.
3113000	3116000	What Richard is saying, though, is that there are always more,
3116000	3119000	no, excuse me, I'm going to put you on hold.
3119000	3121000	I need to talk.
3121000	3127000	What Richard is saying is that we never have all the answers.
3127000	3132000	And it certainly isn't going to ever be the case that we're done looking for stuff
3132000	3137000	because, as humans, we like collecting more and more knowledge over time.
3137000	3141000	But to say that because we haven't obtained an infinite amount of knowledge,
3141000	3146000	we therefore have zero knowledge, or exactly the same knowledge as we did 100 years ago
3146000	3149000	when we lived maybe half as long on average.
3149000	3155000	When we didn't have immediate access to everything that was going on
3155000	3159000	around the globe through electronic communications.
3160000	3167000	When we didn't have as thorough a knowledge of human reproduction, for example,
3167000	3174000	or people still believed that the Earth, that the Sun goes around the Earth, right?
3174000	3180000	To say that we've accumulated all this knowledge, and yet we know exactly the same amount as we did 2,000 years ago,
3180000	3182000	is just untrue.
3182000	3187000	But when it comes to God, knowing where the God exists.
3187000	3190000	Well, that's actually a really good point.
3190000	3195000	With all the knowledge that we've been able to gain over all this time,
3195000	3198000	we've learned nothing new about God.
3198000	3203000	With the brain science example, we are aware that it's understandable,
3203000	3205000	but we don't have the talk technology yet.
3205000	3211000	But when it comes to the existence of God, we are no further along.
3211000	3215000	Yeah, to me that's an indication that there's no...
3215000	3218000	We've been looking with a fine-toothed comb and found nothing.
3218000	3222000	We've been trying as hard as we can, but to me that's an indication...
3222000	3226000	It may be that God exists, but it's not understandable.
3226000	3228000	Like, you can...
3228000	3230000	Or...
3230000	3234000	Let me add to this, if it's not understandable, then Catholicism is false, right?
3234000	3236000	No, that's the primary premise.
3236000	3243000	But if you can't understand God, then you can't actually have any true beliefs about God.
3243000	3246000	That doesn't make sense.
3246000	3251000	If you have a true belief about God, you're claiming to understand something about God,
3251000	3253000	and therefore God is not...
3253000	3255000	You don't have to understand something for it to exist.
3255000	3258000	For you to understand what it is that's true, yeah.
3258000	3261000	If you're going to make any statement that has any meaning that's true about God,
3261000	3265000	that means you understand something about God, and therefore God is understandable.
3265000	3268000	Well, then we go back to personal experience.
3268000	3270000	Really, the question is...
3270000	3272000	We don't think it's reliable.
3272000	3274000	Hey, Jennifer, we're running out of...
3274000	3275000	Thank you for your time.
3275000	3277000	Yeah, we're running out of time, but this is...
3277000	3281000	I mean, it's a great conversation, and I'd welcome you to call back anytime.
3281000	3282000	Okay, thank you.
3282000	3285000	Thanks, bye.
3285000	3289000	And I think we've got more for Chris to talk about.
3289000	3293000	Alan in Fort Morgan, Colorado.
3293000	3294000	Alan?
3294000	3295000	Hi, how's it going?
3295000	3296000	Hi, how are you?
3296000	3301000	We've got about three minutes of real showtime to fill, so make it quick.
3302000	3303000	All right.
3303000	3309000	Well, I don't know if this has been touched on because I kind of died in the show a little bit late,
3309000	3311000	but me, I'm an atheist.
3311000	3314000	I've been an atheist for about five, six years now,
3314000	3320000	and felt very relieved to get away from religion, things like that.
3320000	3329000	But the thing is, you know, when you guys are talking about things like finding happiness in life as an atheist,
3329000	3333000	one of the things that really brings me a lot of joy is my family.
3333000	3341000	However, they're very religious, and they don't quite like my position as an atheist,
3341000	3347000	so how do you reconcile being, you know, an atheist who sees a lot of joy in life
3347000	3354000	if the thing that gives you joy is such as family is contrary to your position?
3354000	3356000	Chris, I'm pretty sure you own this topic.
3356000	3357000	Yeah.
3358000	3360000	Sure, Richard doesn't want to take it.
3360000	3362000	No, no, this is Chris's for sure.
3362000	3369000	I mean, that can be really tough if you have a family that's not really accepting of your way of life.
3369000	3375000	I mean, it's like, you know, if you're gay and your family doesn't accept that, it's a very similar kind of thing.
3375000	3381000	I mean, just you can create your own community, you can create your own family in a way,
3381000	3385000	and you can still be a part of a family even if you disagree on a particular topic.
3385000	3392000	I mean, I don't think anyone agrees 100% with everything everyone in their family thinks,
3392000	3395000	so it's not like an all-or-nothing thing.
3395000	3398000	I think you can still have a relationship with your family.
3398000	3402000	I know many people who have relationships with very religious family members,
3402000	3406000	and they find ways of making it work, either just not talking about it
3406000	3410000	or sometimes hashing it out and talking about it,
3410000	3413000	coming to an understanding, you know, to agree to disagree kind of thing.
3413000	3415000	So it is possible, I think.
3415000	3419000	Trying to find common ground on values, I think, is one of the most important things.
3419000	3423000	If you could just find out where you agree on just basic values, human values,
3423000	3429000	how humans should be treated, what you should think about the way that you should treat people in the world and so on.
3429000	3433000	If you can find enough common ground there, you can build and maintain a relationship,
3433000	3435000	even if you have other different beliefs.
3435000	3437000	I think that's where the problem can arise.
3437000	3439000	If you have fundamentally different values, like you were saying,
3439000	3443000	if you're gay and your parents think you're going to hell because you're gay,
3443000	3445000	well, now you've got a fundamental conflict in values,
3445000	3450000	and I think there's probably, unless they're going to change on that, there's really nothing that you can do.
3450000	3453000	I mean, that's a difficult thing.
3453000	3458000	And if you're in that situation, the next best thing is, like you said, is to try and create your own family.
3458000	3464000	Like, you can get a group of friends together, develop friendships in your life that are like family,
3464000	3466000	and just make your own family.
3466000	3469000	I guess the resident Joss Whedon fan?
3469000	3470000	I don't know.
3470000	3472000	Oh, excuse me.
3472000	3474000	Oh, so we have two here at least.
3474000	3476000	That's the theme.
3476000	3478000	Just about out of time.
3478000	3481000	That's the theme of Joss Whedon's, many of Joss Whedon's shows and things.
3481000	3483000	Watch more Joss Whedon.
3483000	3485000	Take one thing away from the show today.
3485000	3489000	I want to thank Richard Carrier and Chris Johnson for being an incredible guest today.
3489000	3491000	Thanks for being here.
3491000	3493000	And our fantastic audience.
3496000	3501000	See you all at El Royo and tune in next week.
