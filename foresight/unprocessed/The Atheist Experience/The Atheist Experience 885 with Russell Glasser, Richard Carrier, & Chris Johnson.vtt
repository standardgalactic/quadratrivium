00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
You wonder what you'll find with an open mind.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
You may be surprised.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Yeah!

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
You gotta get away from this illusion.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
For the sake of the world, this delusion.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
It's gotta, gotta, gotta go.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Hey everybody, welcome to the Atheist Experience.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm your host, Russell Glasser, and with me today, I am honored to be joined by Dr. Richard Carrier.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Hello.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
The author of On the Historicity of Jesus and Homer Hitler Bible Christ, among a lot of things.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
And here on this side is Chris Johnson, author and filmmaker of A Better Life.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
A hundred atheists speak out on joy and meaning in a world without God.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
We're, we're here doing the show live today after the Bat Cruise,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
which means that just like every time this year, we've got a huge studio audience.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Let's hear it.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Wow.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Today is Sunday, September 28th, 2014,

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
where we are live calling public access Atheist television show based in Austin, Texas,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
dedicated to promoting positive atheism and the separation of church and state.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We're available through live streaming at ustream.tv.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
The official Atheist experience website is www.atheist-experience.com.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
You can provide feedback by commenting on the official show blog,

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
freethoughtblogs.com, slash AXP, or you can email us at tvatatheist-community.org.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
If you enjoy the show today, please check out our related podcast, The Nonprofits,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
which airs the first and third Wednesday of every month.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
And as usual, the cast and crew of the Atheist experience is going to be getting together

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
after the show at El Arroyo at 1624 West Fifth Street.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
We'll be arriving at around 6 p.m.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Now, all those people you just heard, a bunch of them are going,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
so it's going to be pretty crowded.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Just fair warning.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
So that's it for the announcements,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
and I'm going to kick it over to Richard,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
who's going to tell us a few things, maybe from the lecture we heard yesterday

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
and about his work.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah, right.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Well, my latest book is on the historicity of Jesus and the significance of this,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and I talked about it yesterday,

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
was this idea that Jesus never really existed as a historical person

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
has been kicked around for about 100 years,

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
and in the last 20 years, a lot of amateur books and websites and things have come out.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
It even, like, was a featured topic in Religious, the movie.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
But the problem is that there's a lot of misinformation, a lot of bad scholarship,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
but there's also a lot of good stuff in there as well, and it's all sort of mixed up.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
And no one had really gone through the trouble of clearing away all the bad stuff,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
doing all the good stuff, doing thorough research on it all,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
and then presenting it in a manner that would pass peer review at an academic press.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And so my book is actually the first book arguing that there was no Jesus,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
that it was actually a mythical person that was made up,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
or at least the Jesus of Galilee was made up.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It's the first one to be published by a university, the University of Sheffield,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and to have passed extensive peer review within the field.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
And so it's going to get more attention from scholars in the field,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
and since it doesn't have all of the bogus stuff in it that other things have had,

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
it's actually the first really good case that I think might start to rattle the cages of biblical studies.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
And I guess maybe we can talk more about that if people call in and want to know more about it.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
But that's just the gist.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Sure, yeah. With both Richard and Chris here talking about their topics,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
this would be a great day to talk about something they know about.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
But we'll be happy to get the usual kind of calls too. Anything else?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
No, that's it, actually.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh, well, I suppose I should mention for those who don't know,

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
my PhD is in ancient history from Columbia University,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
history of philosophy, religion, and science in the Greco-Roman era.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
So that's my main field of expertise for those who are interested in calling in on that subject.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay. Chris, how are you doing?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, I'm good. I'm thrilled to be here.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And I worked on a project called A Better Life.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
A hundred atheists speak out and join, meaning in a world without God.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm working on the film version right now as well, putting that together.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Basically, I wanted to change the way we talk about atheism

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
and talk about atheism from a positive perspective.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Instead of talking about what we are reeling against,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
talk about what we love, what we're passionate about, what we value.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
So I worked on a book, put that together, and now I'm putting together a film.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
And I actually brought a clip along to show you a little bit about what I'm doing.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
All right, let's hear it.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
It's coming.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm hearing unhappy noises from the studio.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Live public access, everybody.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It'll happen.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Life is like its own reward.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
You know, this idea that some people have that atheists must be nihilists

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
who have no purpose, and they're all dull or all the time,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
and, oh, this life has no meaning and purpose, and why don't we just end it all?

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I just, I cannot grasp that.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
The more I've understood about how the universe works, the more that all,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
the more joy, rather than it going, oh, it's just clockwork.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
The sun's there, and we go around it every year and all that stuff.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
No, I think that's amazing.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
That is extraordinary how that's happening.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Since we are made of the same stuff, the same molecules that were created,

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
you know, in the explosions of the stars,

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
and we ourselves have evolved this incredible ability to contemplate our place in the universe,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
we are a way for the cosmos to know itself.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Thank you.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You have instant, profound meaning in your life.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You happen to be alive right now.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You should really make the most of it.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
So you have about 300 months to live with passion, to live with vividness,

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
to live trying to do something, make something, trying to create some significance.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
People love things that they find beautiful,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
and it can be a very expensive thing and an exquisite thing,

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
or it can just be as simple as, I used to have that when I was a child,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
and I can't believe I've seen this now in the thrift store.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I haven't thought of this thing in, you know, 30 years.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And then there's my dogs.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Then there's the dog.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
We love our dogs.

08:49.000 --> 09:03.000
Thanks, Chris.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Thank you.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So we're going to go straight to calls now.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Nobody has any objections.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
We're going to be starting with a local caller from, it's Christian from Cedar Park, Texas.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Hello.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Hi, Christian.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Hey, how's it going?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Good. How are you?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm pretty good.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
I had a question for you guys, and I think it relates a little bit to Mr. Johnson

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
and his kind of the theme of his movie, too, a little bit.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay.

09:38.000 --> 09:48.000
And that is, if somebody is religious and they have a predisposition towards religion,

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
then it seems like that even if they, excuse me.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Go on.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Even if they have a, I'm going to get a little echo.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Oh.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Sorry.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
They're working on it.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Okay.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
So even if I had doubts about whether there was an actual God or a Supreme being,

10:15.000 --> 10:27.000
then I still might want to keep being religious just for any of the multiple aspects that come from being religious.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
And in that sense, and this doesn't really describe me right now.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
I mean, I have faith for the time being, and I believe.

10:40.000 --> 10:49.000
But I did go through other periods where I was, you know, pretty much agnostic and atheist.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
But I didn't feel, I just always felt like there was something missing.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm getting a pretty fierce echo.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
But just work through it.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm sorry.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Okay.

11:04.000 --> 11:16.000
So, you know, I like the ritual of religion, and I like the worship part of it, even if

11:16.000 --> 11:23.000
it's just, you know, if you're singing the phrases of creation, ultimately, you know,

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
just the idea of hymns, just kind of the emotional tone of them.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
And I like, even when I was young, I liked church and religion more than what I wanted.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
So you're saying basically that you're still firm in your faith right now,

11:41.000 --> 11:52.000
but you're wondering if somebody who was losing their faith would ought to feel a benefit from continuing to go through the motions

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
and rituals of religion just to get the sort of comfort and fellowship that it involves.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Is that what you're saying?

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah, if they find it fulfilling, then...

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Well, he was asking you, Chris.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
You've talked to a lot of people who have been through the deconversion process.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Do you have a perspective on this?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
I would just say that you don't necessarily have to stop singing religious music.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
If you like the music, you can still sing music, even if it has a religious basis.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
One thing that is nice, though, that, you know, the secular community really is coming together more so than it used to.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
So you can get that fellowship and that community from atheists.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
I mean, we spent yesterday on the Bat Cruise, and it was great hanging out with all these wonderful people and meeting people and talking.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
I mean, you get that same sense of community and friendship from atheists,

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
and I think you can get that from a secular community just as much as a religious one.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, there's also...

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
Wait, what is it, Richard?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, there's also Sunday Assembly, which isn't my thing, but some people love that.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, it's kind of like a hymn-based, ecstatic religious experience,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
except it's not religious, it's for atheists and non-believers.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
If you just Google Sunday Assembly, you can probably find websites and see where those things are going around.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
It's kind of like, you know, it's like a little tent event that goes around the country.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And they want to create more of these things.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
And they do serve a segment of the community that want that part of...

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
They just can't believe anymore in the ideology or the particular teachings of the religion,

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
but love that particular experience of church, of the singing and that particular kind of thing.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So they've created a sort of secular version of this.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
So people who are into that, that might be the thing for you, I don't know.

13:46.000 --> 13:59.000
Well, I think that it's also kind of the fact that religion addresses this aspect of us that is somewhat primitive

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
and, you know, some of it's lost in the past,

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
but it forms in kind of a state of innocence that innocence...

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm going to have to be the curmudgeon at this table and disagree with that.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't think... by innocence I don't agree.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Innocence of causing harm to people.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Right, but no, but I mean...

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Religion didn't just form spontaneously, as I see it.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
It grew organically out of a bunch of social conventions.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
And even today, most people wind up with the religion that comes from their parents or their culture or whatever.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Absolutely.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
So it depends.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Well, let me rephrase what I meant by innocence.

14:45.000 --> 14:56.000
I mean, there's a sophistication of thought that develops as you learn about science and psychology, etc.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
In the same way that when you're a child, you can perceive things a certain way,

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
but once you learn a certain amount, you kind of lose the ability to go back to that perception.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
But are you getting at, like, the idea of the sense of awe and wonder that you can get at the universe?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Well, I'm just saying that...

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't think that you can go to an atheist gathering for fellowship and get the same thing

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
that you can get going to a 500-year-old cathedral and being with people

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
who are actually, you know, fully engaging in the original way.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
But I've been to a 500-year-old cathedral and still gotten that sense of awe and wonder,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and it had nothing to do with God.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It had to do with the architecture, it had to do with the space,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
it had to do, most of all, with the history that's part of that.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Absolutely.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
So I don't think it has anything to do with, you know, God or religion.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
What I would say to your point is that every experience is unique

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
and a lot of different experiences can be moving in a way.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
You know, the feeling you get from going to a 500-year-old cathedral

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
is not the same feeling that you get when you go to the Louvre

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
and you look at these amazing paintings that people have worked on.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
And I think by denying the existence of God,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
we're not invalidating that there's some really great religious art

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and architecture and music.

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
And you're right that you can continue to participate in those things

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
and appreciate them, but at the same time,

16:33.000 --> 16:39.000
there's not the feeling that you're required to focus on that one type of thing

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
as the only thing that can elevate you in your life.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Oh, sure.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, I would add also that a lot of that, of course, is marketing campaign, right?

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean, churches, they don't just want you to come there and sing.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
They want you to vote a certain way, they want you to have certain values,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
they want you to treat gay people a certain way,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
or they want you to treat women a certain way.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
They have certain ideology they're trying to sell.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
And so you're going to be socially pressured to adopt that ideology.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I know a lot of people that have left the church simply because

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
they no longer agreed with the values

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
and the congregation simply wouldn't let them be themselves.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
They would constantly try to pressure them to just toe the party line.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
And I think that's the main problem with that.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
And you'd have to have a church like the Unitarian Universalist Church

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
which is accepting of all different kinds of beliefs

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
and they don't pressure you quite the same way.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
But then maybe you won't find, I mean, they don't have 500-year-old cathedrals

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
in the Unitarian Church.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
They weren't funded as well.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, you'd be surprised.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Historians have often some good land and some good churches,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
but they're often more modern.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Well, what I mean to say is that the point I'm making when I'm talking about cathedrals and such

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
is that something is built up, it's a culture is built up around worship

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
and relating to God and daily activities and ways to carry out the religious life.

18:03.000 --> 18:11.000
And like whoever said before, I turn my TV off so that I'm not looking at you guys.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Whoever said it, it grows organically.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And that's kind of what I mean by that.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, but what I'm saying is that is not unique to religion.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
People form all sorts of different cultures and call it all sorts of different things.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I mean, they form football cultures and gaming cultures.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
They form fraternity cultures at their college.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
And those fill different roles.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
People have lots of social groups in their adult life.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
I didn't mean to say that it was exclusive in any way.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
What I'm saying is it's all those things that have been tied together in religion.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
And maybe because you were raised with that religion or because you found it attractive.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah, a lot of it really comes from your upbringing.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I wasn't ready for religious and I don't miss it.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
And it's not just religion.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Absolutely.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Like we said before, it's history.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
It's culture.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It's all wrapped up in many of those different things.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
You can't just say it's only religion.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It's a bunch of different things wrapped together.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
And you can take those parts and appreciate those different parts without having to buy into the religion.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Sure.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Or you might also buy into the religion.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You could.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Lots of people do from what I've heard.

19:23.000 --> 19:30.000
And on issues of believing in God and that kind of thing, it seems that even religious people I know,

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
it seems that everybody I know has some type of doubt or goes in and out of periods of certainty.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
That's very common.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
You have no idea how heartened I am to hear that.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh sure.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
No, but it is true, yeah.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
But so...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah, I mean Mother Teresa had doubts.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
That may not be any reason to leave the religion if you find it fulfilling that alone.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
But the reason to leave religion is that it might actually not be true.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
And it might be misleading.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
And it might actually be harmful in certain aspects.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
And I think that there is no reason to jettison the bad part...

20:06.000 --> 20:17.000
To jettison all the good parts along with getting rid of the unnecessary thing of unquestioningly worshiping this infinite being

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
and taking at face value something that people in authority tell you all your life.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
But those are what I see as the negative sides of religion.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But also I don't believe in God.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
So I don't think that at the bottom level there is a basis for it.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Right.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
But I'm saying being that there are people besides you who may be at different places along that spectrum

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
then, you know, again, what they decide is harmful and what they decide is true or not true is going to be different.

20:50.000 --> 21:01.000
So even if somebody has major doubts about the metaphysical God, they may still go on with being religious.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Right, they may.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I think we're in agreement.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
And I think that you can also, but the one other thing that I was pointing to at the beginning is

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
you can, some people have a religious attitude towards nature.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:24.000
And so since God supposedly is, existence comes from God or he's the source of existence, then there's kind of an overlap there.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If you believe in God.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
No, I'm saying in the concept.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
There's an overlap in the concept.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
There can be.

21:32.000 --> 21:43.000
And so in that sense, it may naturally go towards what you, what was worshiping God may naturally go towards an appreciation or a love or a worship of nature.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, there are all kinds of things you can channel that energy into that aren't explicitly religious.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
But I think you can do it a religious way.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I think we're going to move on to other callers now.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
All right.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Thanks for calling, Christian.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Sure.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Good talking to you.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Bye.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I have a look in Austin.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Are you there?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Hi, what's up?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah, thanks for taking my call.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
I've been an atheist for, I think, three to four years.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I was born in India.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I was a Hindu all my life.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
I think in the last five years, I've become an atheist.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Before that, I was a non religious Hindu.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I believe in spirituality.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I have a scientific background.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
I went to the best scientific schools in India and US.

22:36.000 --> 22:48.000
So I have no, I have no questions or doubts about being an atheist and the stuff we believe in.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
I believe in facts and truth.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
I believe in seeing what I believe.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.000
The only thing I miss when I was not atheist is emotional void.

23:03.000 --> 23:14.000
When I was not atheist, when I was going through bad times, I thought I had a God I would believe in.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Maybe it was a placebo effect.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Maybe it was magic or something I believed in.

23:20.000 --> 23:30.000
But I think that is the biggest thing which is missing from your show because you talk about facts and how the Bible is wrong and how everything else is wrong.

23:30.000 --> 23:40.000
But I do not think you're answering the question that if as atheists we go through bad times, we can talk to our families.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
We can talk to our wives and sons.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
And it does not have the same effect like it did before.

23:48.000 --> 24:00.000
You spend so little time on that and I think that is a big reason which makes believers not become atheists or make atheists become believers.

24:00.000 --> 24:12.000
So if you have really bad times in your life and you used to have supernatural power before you believed in and now you don't.

24:13.000 --> 24:21.000
I mean you can be strong and you can be confident but how do you deal with that?

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
For myself, all of that I replace with good friends, determination and self-confidence.

24:28.000 --> 24:36.000
With those three things I know that I can use reason, I can use my community, I can use the facts we've established to try and make my situation better.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
And if I can't then I have those good friends that I can commiserate with and share that experience with.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
And then I have my own experience of life that I can share that experience with just with myself and that respect.

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
And that works for me and I know it works for a lot of other people but I can't really speak necessarily to the experience of others that might be in different situations than myself.

24:57.000 --> 25:11.000
I would just say that I think you raise a good point in a way that life is sometimes very difficult and working on a project about our life was not trying to say that everything is hunky-dory all the time and we're all happy.

25:11.000 --> 25:21.000
Life can be very difficult and there are times where we need other people and you can believe something that's false that's comforting.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I mean you could make up something that's very comforting.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
You know I could make up that I have a million dollars and that would be very comforting to me and my bank account.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
But it wouldn't be true and ultimately probably wouldn't be very helpful.

25:34.000 --> 25:43.000
And so I think looking at it realistically and thinking what, you know, this is a difficult time, how can I overcome this?

25:43.000 --> 25:56.000
And finding real answers, friends, family, relationships, things like that, people you can count on who are actually there as opposed to praying to a God who's not there would probably be better.

25:56.000 --> 26:04.000
But you're right that it is scary sometimes and I think we have to realize that life can be scary and that's part of the experience of it, right?

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
But there are ways to get through it and get through it together with other people.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
The slogan, you know, that hands that help are better than lips that pray.

26:14.000 --> 26:26.000
People that are in certain specific dire circumstances can actually find people in the same similar circumstances, band together and find a way to solve this problem or fight it or become activists and get involved.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
And then you can feel like if you can't solve your problem you might be able to help make the world better so that other people don't end up in whatever situation.

26:33.000 --> 26:42.000
Whether this is curing cancer or escaping a drug addiction or whatever it is that you're dealing with or, you know, if it's losing loved ones and all kinds of things like this.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.000
There are lots of people who are having the same experiences that you can join and together with and bond with and work together with to actually fix it or make it better in some fashion.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
And I think that you can get a lot of, you can feel really good about that, that you've made the world a better place, that you've tried to make the world a better place.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
And you weren't alone. You had other people who are in the same situation but also willing to bond together and fight together and work together to make these changes.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.000
That's all we have, really. I mean, to be honest, that's the truth of the world.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
So we shouldn't not avail ourselves of that. That's the one thing that does exist that we can create.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
And so we are kind of obligated really to do that if we want something better.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
I don't think I can add anything to those.

27:28.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah, I think I get your point but I'm hurting a lot on this one.

27:35.000 --> 27:45.000
So I'm talking to my family, my friends, but I missed the fake magic which I had with thought.

27:45.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you, I see you're here in Austin. Have you tried, I mean, have you been to any of our meetings?

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
No, I just joined a group a few weeks back.

27:57.000 --> 28:06.000
Well, I hope to see you. And I mean, I don't have any magic solutions to your problems.

28:06.000 --> 28:19.000
But, you know, I'd like a chance to sit down with you sometime and talk about this more, especially since I don't know as much about ex-Hindus as I do about a lot of other ex-religious types.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Okay, thank you so much gentlemen.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Alright, thanks for calling and, you know, good luck.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Bye.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
Gary in Columbus, Mississippi?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Gary?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Yes, I'm here.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Hi, how are you?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
I'm well.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Nice to talk to you for the first time, Russell.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Nice to talk to you too.

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
You're a Matt Schuve. Well, I say you're a Matt. I've watched that experience about five years.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Thank you.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
I really enjoy the show. I'm square in the Bible belt here in Columbus, Mississippi.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
I don't recognize the other two guys with you at all.

29:03.000 --> 29:13.000
Well, these are our guests from, they just gave some lectures on the Bat Cruise. Richard Carrier here is a historian and Chris Johnson.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Well, Richard Carrier, yeah, I know of him.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
There you go.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Awesome.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I just recognized him.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
That's who I am, yeah.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
And Chris Johnson is a photographer and a filmmaker.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Hello, Chris. Nice to meet you.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Hello.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
I didn't really have a question. I really just want to make a statement if I could to your viewers.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Okay.

29:32.000 --> 29:44.000
I would like for your younger viewers, I know you've had many younger viewers, especially with this one guy that called in about, he was a teacher, a scientist teacher,

29:44.000 --> 29:52.000
and he had several of his students, eighth grade students, calling in and, or not calling in, just viewing the show.

29:52.000 --> 29:59.000
But, and he was upset about that. And I want to tell them just a word to the younger folks.

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
Don't be afraid to lose your fear that religion has instilled in you as a young person.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Right.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Well, I agree with you.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
Don't feel free to lose your religion. It's okay. Don't feel fear from that.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Okay.

30:17.000 --> 30:31.000
You know, it, you know, you might be cheered here that a lot of young people won't need that message because the younger you get in demographics, the more likely it is that people just don't believe in God these days.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I know Russell and I love that.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Yes.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
In fact, I love the fact that most people who are in universities right now are less religious.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I actually have an electrical engineering degree.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Less religious. There's still majority religious.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
And it seems the more educated a person is, the less likely they are to be religious.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Well, that is true.

30:54.000 --> 31:07.000
It is true, but don't get complacent. You know, as my friend Matt Dillahunty likes to say, just because you've solved the easiest question in the world doesn't make you a genius.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
That is so ultimately true.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Right. So thanks for that message, though.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
For the time and I know that most of the viewers want to see religious colors.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
All right. Well, thanks for calling.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Thank you for taking my call.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I'll see you.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Mario in Tucson, Arizona.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Hi.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
How are you?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
I'm good.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
So I was wondering, I don't really have a lot of Christian friends.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
I mean, well, fundamentalists, I suppose, or apologists that kind of like run my ideas fast.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Contradictions I find within the Bible.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
And so I was wondering if you could possibly play like devil advocate in this situation.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
Angels advocate.

32:00.000 --> 32:11.000
So one person in particular, Matthew 1231 says, and so I tell you every kind of sin and flander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.

32:11.000 --> 32:21.000
And so this is like the only unforgivable sin, which I find ridiculous, but doesn't I just want to know what your thoughts were on that.

32:21.000 --> 32:31.000
Maybe if you could give an apologist statement and maybe explain where born again Christians think that they can find salvation.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I don't have a strong opinion on that.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
You guys.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah, I wouldn't know how to answer the second question.

32:36.000 --> 32:47.000
I mean, the issue about blasphemy is that under Jewish law at the time, blasphemy just meant uttering the actual name of God in a non-reverent way.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
So blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is almost an unintelligible statement in the context of ancient Judaism.

32:54.000 --> 33:02.000
So we're not really sure what that statement really meant and what particular issue the Christians who wrote that passage were trying to address.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Almost certainly Jesus never said those words.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
That was the invention of the later Christian community.

33:06.000 --> 33:13.000
They were dealing with some sort of issue in their community that we don't know about because we don't have the documentation of what kind of problems they were dealing with in their church.

33:13.000 --> 33:21.000
But someone just inserted that line in Jesus's mouth in the gospel to just have him advocate whatever position they were trying to advocate.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
We don't really know what it was because we don't have the context for it.

33:26.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, I mean, the only thing I'd say to this and questions like this in general is that there is no the Christian answer because with 33,000 different branches of Christianity and a lot of other religions in the world,

33:42.000 --> 33:52.000
ultimately all this stuff is at best loosely based on this book that was assembled over a few centuries.

33:52.000 --> 34:09.000
And so if you read up a little bit on the history of how fundamentalism came to be such a uniquely American tradition, you'll find that people are basically constructing their own theologies as they go along.

34:09.000 --> 34:22.000
And anytime that you branch out, you know, anytime that you have a disagreement with your parent organization, a lot of times what will happen is you just branch out into a new sect of Christianity.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Right.

34:23.000 --> 34:30.000
You know, I don't want to, like, make you go hunting down fundamentalist churches or anything and ask them.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
But really, I think the problem with asking us is that we don't take any of it seriously.

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
And there would be a different answer depending on who you ask and what you've decided to believe in their own minds.

34:44.000 --> 35:05.000
Okay, I suppose it's also furthermore asks that or supposes that God is not all powerful because he cannot forgive unconditionally, whereas as people people can so if someone gets like hits my dog and gets away with it, you know, driving,

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
I could come to forgive that person without them ever needing to ask for it.

35:09.000 --> 35:16.000
And so this then supposes that I can do more than God, right?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
That's a spot on statement.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
There's a lot of ways you can use that argument.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
I mean, whenever you're trying to use the argument from evil, they'll always come back with trying all these excuses for why God can't fix the world.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
And you go, but I would fix the world if I had God's powers.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
And therefore, what am I nicer than God?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Is that even possible?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
You are nicer than God.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Thank you.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I've seen you in action.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I can't argue with that.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
But yeah, you're absolutely right.

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
If there's things that we can actually do that God cannot do, that does mean we have powers that God does not have.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And that refutes the whole concept of omnipotence.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Thanks, guys, for your input.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
All right.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Thanks for calling.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Bye.

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
We've got Jennifer from here in Austin.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Hello.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Hi, Jennifer.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Hi.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I have two questions.

36:07.000 --> 36:21.000
And the first one is, it seems like a lot of times when you talk to atheists, they start from the premise that personal experience has been established to be unreliable.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
But we rely on personal experience all the time.

36:25.000 --> 36:34.000
Like in courtroom, the value of eyewitness testimony, that's the fundamental evidence.

36:34.000 --> 36:43.000
The jury can take it and believe it or not believe it, but the value of personal testimony, not hearsay, what someone else has told you has been their experience.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
But what you experienced yourself, the value of putting it forward, is still considered primary.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
And it's a foundational principle of the U.S.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
And we also rely on personal experience all the time.

36:59.000 --> 37:09.000
Like if you're going to do something like climb the Himalayas and you've never done it, you read about people who have done that before and they say, you know, that whatever else to I experienced this.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
You don't know, but you believe them.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
You take precautions or you prepare based on what they experienced.

37:19.000 --> 37:27.000
And so it seems like the value of personal experience has not been proven to be unreliable.

37:27.000 --> 37:35.000
And then the second question is that it seems like something can be understood or it can't.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
It's understandable or it's not.

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
And like Catholics start from the premise that the nature of reality can't be understood.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
It's not understandable.

37:46.000 --> 37:55.000
And atheists seem to start from the premise that, you know, reality is a process that could be understood.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
But if it could, why don't we understand any more than we did like 2,000 years ago?

38:00.000 --> 38:06.000
We have theory, you know, the theory of the Big Bang, but when you look at what complexity theorists say,

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
they say that there's still a lot of leaps that have to be made in thinking to make the concepts work.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
You know, like it's not established. We still don't fully understand it.

38:19.000 --> 38:28.000
And so if the nature of reality is understandable, why don't we understand more about it today than we did say 2,000 years ago?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, let's take that one at a time.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
I probably should have interrupted you before going on to the second one.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Personal experience. Is it reliable?

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
Well, you have to realize it's not binary. It's not like all personal experience is reliable or no personal experience is reliable.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
It's not like you're choosing to, you know, deny all experience or accept all experience. That's not how it works.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Personal experience has a certain probability of being reliable.

38:54.000 --> 39:01.000
And what you're looking at is when the particular claim the person is making is going to have an intrinsic prior probability.

39:01.000 --> 39:09.000
So if they're saying, you know, aliens abducted them or they're saying they saw a horde of demons attack them in their room or something like that,

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
we know from past experience that that usually turns out to be hallucinatory or not true.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
And so for a personal experience to overcome that, we need a lot more evidence than that.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
We need a superbly good personal experience or we need a lot of it from a lot of different sources, a lot of different witnesses,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
or we need physical evidence.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
You're talking about like standards of evidence that professional historians would take into account.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. This is what I do in the book. It's Bayesian reasoning where you have to weigh the different possibilities.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
So certain kinds of testimonies are unreliable or obviously unreliable because they make improbable claims.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
And so for those claims to be upheld, you need more than just someone claiming it.

39:51.000 --> 40:02.000
I mean, like what about, you know, people who wrote Gospels who said, you know, they wrote it after they say Jesus died and they say, you know, they witnessed it.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Oh, but they don't.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
They were closer in time.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah. None of the Gospels were written by anyone who says they saw any of the stuff they wrote down.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
In fact, they don't even tell us who they are or how they know anything that they haven't.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
They don't tell us their sources. They don't tell us their methods, which is very weird.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
I mean, 50 years in the big scheme of things is not that much time.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
And so actually it is. I made this point.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I just want to say I'm so excited to get this call with Richard.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I made this point.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
It's a lot less than, you know, 1,550 years.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Well, let's talk about Roswell, New Mexico.

40:36.000 --> 40:45.000
In 1947, this Air Force officer found some sticks and tinfoil in the desert and he claimed it was debris from a flying saucer.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
Within just 30 to 40 years.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
And this is in the 20th century with universal literacy, newspapers, photographs, the whole deal.

40:53.000 --> 41:00.000
Within just 30 to 40 years, an entire legend had built up about the government discovering an entire intact flying saucer

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
that they recovered alien bodies from and performed autopsies on.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
That's just 30 to 40 years.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
So it's the exact same timeline that we're looking at with the Gospels.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Legends can spring up really fast.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
It's starting from a not an eyewitness account.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Well, yeah, it is actually.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
No, he said he found something.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, from what you said, he said he found something.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah, it was published in the newspaper.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
Yeah, it was in the newspaper with photographs of the debris that he found from 1947.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
But you didn't say he said he saw the ship's sound.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
No, no, that was what people were telling just 30 to 40 years later.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
And so when we look at the Gospels, we don't know where these people were getting their stories.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They're not eyewitnesses themselves.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
They don't claim to know any eyewitnesses.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
They don't even tell us what their sources are.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Well, why are they written as a description?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I mean, it's written as an eyewitness description.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It actually isn't.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
It's like Jesus was on the cross, then he asked for a drink.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Oh, no, no.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Oh, you know what?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I highly recommend that you can do some more research on this.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
For example, the crucifixion account is almost entirely based on clips from the Psalms.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
They just took passages.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
If I had time, I could dig out an example from my book.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
But the language is like first person.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
I mean, I've read it.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah, but the language is biblical.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
We can look at eyewitness accounts.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
We have, for example, Lucian of Samosata wrote an account of him encountering a new religion in what's now Turkey.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's called Alexander the Quack Prophet.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
You could probably find examples of it online, but that's what an eyewitness account looks like.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
The Gospels aren't written like that at all.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
If you look at Caesar's Civil War, he writes it in third person, but it's still an eyewitness account.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
And again, it's written very differently than what we see in the Gospels.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
The Gospels look a lot like mythology.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
We have a lot of examples of other religions that were coming up with documents that are written in the same kind of voice.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
And there were, in fact, about 40 different Gospels.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
And we know about 10 to 12 of them that we have mostly intact or largely intact.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
And we know a lot of those have to be false, and yet they read a lot like the Gospels we have in the New Testament.

43:02.000 --> 43:08.000
So it was actually very common to fabricate narratives in the form that we see in the Gospels in the New Testament.

43:08.000 --> 43:18.000
But I know from personally reading the Gospels that it sounds like a first person account.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Oh, we'll see.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
I think what you need to do is you have to understand these books were written 2,000 years ago in a different language, in a different culture.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
So if you want to understand that...

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
So it was written in time.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
No, but my point is you have to look at what literature was like back then.

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
So you can't judge it based on the standards of what you're used to reading today because what people write today is very different.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
The styles they write, the way they choose words, the way they construct stories is entirely different today than it was 2,000 years ago.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, and to circle back to your original question about how reliable personal experience is,

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
I mean, you're telling us that you have this personal experience of having read the Gospels and just knowing by reading it,

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
like knowing and inherently understanding what's going on in there.

43:59.000 --> 44:10.000
Even though there is this whole system of historians having read it and compared notes and comparing it to things that they already know.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
Tell me whether something is written as a first person account or not.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I can judge that for myself.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
I can read it and I could be like, this sounds like a third person.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
I'll give you an example.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It sounds like an omniscient point of view.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
This sounds like a first person.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I can make that judgment myself.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
But they aren't, actually.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
They aren't even written in first person by a standard literary theory.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
So here's the Gospel of Mark, chapter 15, verse 24.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
It reads, literally, they part his garments among them, casting lots upon them.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Now here's Psalm 22, verse 18.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
They part my garments among them and cast lots upon them.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It's almost identical words to words.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But what are the psalms supposed to be like prophecy?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
So if it were true.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
Mark is writing in the third person, the psalms are writing in the first person.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
The psalms were written hundreds of years before.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
But if I had the prophecy and then it was experienced.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
See, that's the thing, you can say that.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
But they're using the exact word for word, exact same statement.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And it doesn't even say it's a filled prophecy.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
To get back to the point, I was really asking a question.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
But it's third person.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
It's not first person.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's just they part his garments among them.

45:17.000 --> 45:23.000
I've watched a couple of your shows and people will call and they'll be like,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
my mom said she saw a demon in a room or you know, my friend.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
And then a lot of times the first responses.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Well, you know, I would say I wasn't there.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
I don't have your experience and I can't tell whether that really happened or not.

45:41.000 --> 45:50.000
But you said that this sort of thing goes in courts and I can guarantee you that if somebody came in as a witness in court and said,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
and then I saw a demon rise up out of the earth,

45:53.000 --> 46:01.000
it's really unlikely that the judge or jury would take that into account as a serious explanation for,

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
let's say a murder trial or embezzlement where somebody said,

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
suddenly this demon made all this money disappear for the company's account.

46:10.000 --> 46:16.000
But the value of the experience for it to be judged by the fact finder,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
whether it's a jury or a judge.

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
The value of the person saying it and then the listener interpreting it is primary.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
Chris really sounds like he's got something to say.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I want to jump in here.

46:32.000 --> 46:40.000
You talk about eyewitness testimony being so reliable and it's the ultimate piece of evidence in our court system

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and that's just not true at all.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
If you look at the reliability of eyewitness testimony, it is terrible.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
You put a room full of people and you show them something and then ask them what they saw.

46:51.000 --> 47:00.000
You'll get many different answers and people have been convicted wrongly based on people who were sure this is who they saw

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
and they were wrong and it's very, very easy to fool yourself to think you saw something.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
If you don't remember clearly, your brain will just make up stuff to fill in the gaps

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
and we've demonstrated that thousands of times in different studies.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
Eyewitness testimony is actually really, really unreliable.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
One of the leading researchers on that.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
It's true what you're saying.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
You put people in a room and then it's like, what's the guy wearing his tie?

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
And three of them say yes and two of them say no.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
But we still hold that as meaningful.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Well, we shouldn't.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Chris was just saying we don't.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
We don't and that would be a bad thing for everybody so we shouldn't do that.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
You have to wait.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
I'm an attorney and I've taken a really unconventional route.

47:49.000 --> 47:57.000
I took my studies extremely seriously looking at the purpose of the system

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
and the procedure that we've established.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
People from all different backgrounds coming together and deciding this is what we're going to do.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
This has meaning and this is useful.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Despite the errors, this is the most fair way we can assess what's going on

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
and we still have witnesses.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
We still take in witness accounts and we still say all relevant witnesses can be in place.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
You know, witnesses can lie.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Witnesses can be deceived.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Witnesses can misreport badly.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I mean, you must know this if you've been in court.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
Certainly if you're a defense attorney, you must have actually used these arguments that I'm using myself

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
in defense of your client.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
Well, the thing is that sometimes they are telling the truth.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Sometimes, yes.

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
It's a thing that's primary for the witness.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
You say what they're thinking for the fact finder to be like,

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
well, I think your mom was lying.

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah, but it certainly depends at least as much on the nature of the testimony

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
as the content of the testimony itself.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
I mean, if you, you know, if today you were to have somebody walk into court

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
and say I saw this guy die and three days later rise from the dead

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
or I saw a ghost show up in my house,

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
that would be one of the least likely things that you were going to accept in court

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
as relevant to the case.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
Well, it depends on what the case was about, whether it would be right.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Really?

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
I don't think so, actually.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Wow.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Actually, by Supreme Court ruling, spectral evidence is not allowed.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Yeah, by 16th century ruling.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
We don't know what's trying to be proved.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
I mean, it would depend on what kind of case it was.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
I mean, you're talking about a dread case where someone killed someone else

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
and, you know, they're saying what they experienced

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
and that's why they killed that person.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And it's like, was it intentional?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Was it not intentional?

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Are they lying?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
It depends on what's being proved.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
So, I mean, to my second question, as far as, you know,

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
whether things, you know, everything is understandable or it's not.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
I can answer that one because this is right in my field.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
But you, please go ahead.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Do we understand more than we did 2,000 years ago?

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
My PhD's primary subject is history of science.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
So, and I studied ancient science.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
So I actually, a lot of what I've done is certainly in my dissertation

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
was compare what we knew scientifically about the world

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
in the first and second century AD

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
with what we know about the world today.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
And it's mind-bogglingly vastly more understanding today than we had.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
I mean, just bewildering how much more understanding we have today.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
So much so that what we've thoroughly established

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
over the last, since the scientific revolution in the 17th century

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
in just the last few hundred years,

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
we've thoroughly established that the scientific method is so incredibly effective

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
that it can take our understanding of the world

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
and multiply it millions and millions of times.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
I mean, which it has done so since 1600.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
So we know, what does anything we know is that science works exceedingly well.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
And the only thing that actually interferes with our advance,

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
that slows it down perhaps, is technological access to the data.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
A lot of the things, the questions we can't answer today,

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
we only can't answer because we just don't have the particular machine

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
that can see the thing that we want to look at.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Or, you know, in particular ways, for example, brain science.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
To really understand how the brain works,

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
we would need a functional brain scanner that can scan the brain as it works

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
down to the resolution of individual synaptic connections.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
We just haven't developed that technology yet,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
but within 50 or 60 years we may have scanners that can do that.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And that's just a technological obstacle.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
The thing that I'm wondering, so like with that example you just gave,

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
we know that it is understandable, but we're not there yet.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Sure.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
What Richard is saying, though, is that there are always more,

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
no, excuse me, I'm going to put you on hold.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I need to talk.

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
What Richard is saying is that we never have all the answers.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
And it certainly isn't going to ever be the case that we're done looking for stuff

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
because, as humans, we like collecting more and more knowledge over time.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
But to say that because we haven't obtained an infinite amount of knowledge,

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
we therefore have zero knowledge, or exactly the same knowledge as we did 100 years ago

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
when we lived maybe half as long on average.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
When we didn't have immediate access to everything that was going on

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
around the globe through electronic communications.

52:40.000 --> 52:47.000
When we didn't have as thorough a knowledge of human reproduction, for example,

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
or people still believed that the Earth, that the Sun goes around the Earth, right?

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
To say that we've accumulated all this knowledge, and yet we know exactly the same amount as we did 2,000 years ago,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
is just untrue.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
But when it comes to God, knowing where the God exists.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
Well, that's actually a really good point.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
With all the knowledge that we've been able to gain over all this time,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
we've learned nothing new about God.

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
With the brain science example, we are aware that it's understandable,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
but we don't have the talk technology yet.

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
But when it comes to the existence of God, we are no further along.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
Yeah, to me that's an indication that there's no...

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
We've been looking with a fine-toothed comb and found nothing.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
We've been trying as hard as we can, but to me that's an indication...

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
It may be that God exists, but it's not understandable.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Like, you can...

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Or...

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
Let me add to this, if it's not understandable, then Catholicism is false, right?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
No, that's the primary premise.

53:56.000 --> 54:03.000
But if you can't understand God, then you can't actually have any true beliefs about God.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
That doesn't make sense.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
If you have a true belief about God, you're claiming to understand something about God,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
and therefore God is not...

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
You don't have to understand something for it to exist.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
For you to understand what it is that's true, yeah.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
If you're going to make any statement that has any meaning that's true about God,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
that means you understand something about God, and therefore God is understandable.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Well, then we go back to personal experience.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Really, the question is...

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
We don't think it's reliable.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Hey, Jennifer, we're running out of...

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Thank you for your time.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah, we're running out of time, but this is...

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
I mean, it's a great conversation, and I'd welcome you to call back anytime.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Okay, thank you.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
Thanks, bye.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
And I think we've got more for Chris to talk about.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
Alan in Fort Morgan, Colorado.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Alan?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Hi, how's it going?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Hi, how are you?

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
We've got about three minutes of real showtime to fill, so make it quick.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
All right.

55:03.000 --> 55:09.000
Well, I don't know if this has been touched on because I kind of died in the show a little bit late,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
but me, I'm an atheist.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
I've been an atheist for about five, six years now,

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
and felt very relieved to get away from religion, things like that.

55:20.000 --> 55:29.000
But the thing is, you know, when you guys are talking about things like finding happiness in life as an atheist,

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
one of the things that really brings me a lot of joy is my family.

55:33.000 --> 55:41.000
However, they're very religious, and they don't quite like my position as an atheist,

55:41.000 --> 55:47.000
so how do you reconcile being, you know, an atheist who sees a lot of joy in life

55:47.000 --> 55:54.000
if the thing that gives you joy is such as family is contrary to your position?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Chris, I'm pretty sure you own this topic.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Yeah.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Sure, Richard doesn't want to take it.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
No, no, this is Chris's for sure.

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
I mean, that can be really tough if you have a family that's not really accepting of your way of life.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
I mean, it's like, you know, if you're gay and your family doesn't accept that, it's a very similar kind of thing.

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
I mean, just you can create your own community, you can create your own family in a way,

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
and you can still be a part of a family even if you disagree on a particular topic.

56:25.000 --> 56:32.000
I mean, I don't think anyone agrees 100% with everything everyone in their family thinks,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
so it's not like an all-or-nothing thing.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
I think you can still have a relationship with your family.

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
I know many people who have relationships with very religious family members,

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
and they find ways of making it work, either just not talking about it

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
or sometimes hashing it out and talking about it,

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
coming to an understanding, you know, to agree to disagree kind of thing.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
So it is possible, I think.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
Trying to find common ground on values, I think, is one of the most important things.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
If you could just find out where you agree on just basic values, human values,

57:03.000 --> 57:09.000
how humans should be treated, what you should think about the way that you should treat people in the world and so on.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
If you can find enough common ground there, you can build and maintain a relationship,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
even if you have other different beliefs.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I think that's where the problem can arise.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
If you have fundamentally different values, like you were saying,

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
if you're gay and your parents think you're going to hell because you're gay,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
well, now you've got a fundamental conflict in values,

57:25.000 --> 57:30.000
and I think there's probably, unless they're going to change on that, there's really nothing that you can do.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I mean, that's a difficult thing.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
And if you're in that situation, the next best thing is, like you said, is to try and create your own family.

57:38.000 --> 57:44.000
Like, you can get a group of friends together, develop friendships in your life that are like family,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
and just make your own family.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
I guess the resident Joss Whedon fan?

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
I don't know.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Oh, excuse me.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Oh, so we have two here at least.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
That's the theme.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Just about out of time.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
That's the theme of Joss Whedon's, many of Joss Whedon's shows and things.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Watch more Joss Whedon.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Take one thing away from the show today.

58:05.000 --> 58:09.000
I want to thank Richard Carrier and Chris Johnson for being an incredible guest today.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Thanks for being here.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
And our fantastic audience.

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
See you all at El Royo and tune in next week.
