00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Hello. Sorry, she said waving the book. Welcome to the latest AQR webinar and welcome to Nick

00:08.080 --> 00:15.760
Salsgate and Nick Chater. I'm very kindly come on board to discuss Nick Cee's latest book.

00:16.480 --> 00:23.440
This one, The Mind is Flat, which he's just told us, has won the US prose award for best book

00:23.440 --> 00:32.240
in clinical psychology. So many congratulations for that. Nick Salsgate, or I can hear a corner,

00:34.640 --> 00:40.560
partook of our last webinar. So he's an old hand at this and he says he's a

00:40.560 --> 00:46.160
philosopher turned advertising planner, turned into some sort of hybrid creature

00:46.160 --> 00:49.600
by work at the School of Life and the Institute of Practition as an advertiser.

00:50.560 --> 00:55.200
Nick Chater is Professor of Behavioural Science and Pathology at the School.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.320
He's on the advisory board of the Nudge Unit. He also broadcasts regularly on BBC Radio 4,

01:02.320 --> 01:11.360
has hundreds of publications on his under his belt and runs a, I meant to ask, what is an M00C?

01:11.360 --> 01:17.520
On the Shocking Shallowness of Human Psychology on Future Learn. Anyway, this is about The Mind

01:17.520 --> 01:25.360
is Flat, the relevance to qualitative research. So I will leave you to it there with me when I

01:25.360 --> 01:37.920
disappear off the screen, hopefully. And Feta Black-Luella. So what a little phase into the background.

01:38.800 --> 01:45.360
So Nick, thanks for joining us. I was reflecting on this. It's about 10 years since we first met

01:45.440 --> 01:52.160
doing work at the IPA. So and it was very exciting to see you publish your now award winning book.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.720
So all those conversations I never got to finish with you because you were rushing somewhere else.

01:56.720 --> 02:04.000
A lot of it was in the book. But what I'm interested in is it strikes me it's quite a personal book in

02:04.000 --> 02:12.240
that it's not just built out of your research, but it's built out of your sort of more profound

02:12.240 --> 02:17.520
beliefs or your deeper beliefs. So I was just interested to start by asking you how you came

02:17.520 --> 02:22.080
to write a book called The Mind is Flat for me. And then we're getting to watching Mead by The

02:22.080 --> 02:28.720
Mind Being Flat. Yes, that's a good question. I think it comes from a couple of sources. One is

02:28.720 --> 02:35.360
that my starting point in the academic world when I did my PhD was the world of cognitive science.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.240
And that's the project of trying to build computer models of the mind. So it's sort of like artificial

02:40.240 --> 02:46.080
intelligence. Your aim is to build models that are like people. And a very natural strategy to do

02:46.080 --> 02:50.240
that is to think, well, what we need to do is to work out what people's beliefs are, what they know

02:50.240 --> 02:54.800
about the world, and also what they like, what they want, what they don't like. So we try and get all

02:54.800 --> 02:59.680
this out of people's heads. And then we put it into a computer program and try and figure out

02:59.680 --> 03:04.640
what the program would like to do. So it seems like a sensible strategy and between before

03:04.880 --> 03:10.800
about from 1980 or so, it was probably the most popular strategy and artificial intelligence.

03:10.800 --> 03:19.120
I came into the field in I suppose about 1986 as a PhD student. So I was in the sort of latter

03:19.120 --> 03:24.240
phases of this project. And it was very influential on me to think that when people tried to do this,

03:25.760 --> 03:30.960
it always seemed to go horribly wrong at the very first stage. So you'd think, I want to know how

03:30.960 --> 03:34.960
to play chess. I want to make a computer that can play chess. So I need to talk to some grand

03:34.960 --> 03:38.720
masters. I mean, they're really good at chess. They must know loads about this. So they'll just

03:38.720 --> 03:42.960
tell me what the strategies they're using are. And I'll put it into my computer and off it will go.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.520
But in fact, it turns out that's a disastrous approach, partly because the grand masters have no

03:47.520 --> 03:52.880
idea what they seem to know. They tell you different things on different days. Most of the time they

03:52.880 --> 03:57.280
just say, well, that's obviously a silly move. You wouldn't want to do that. But they can't really

03:57.280 --> 04:03.680
tell you why. But not only that, they also, the things they can tell you turn out to be rapidly

04:04.320 --> 04:09.200
to lead to inconsistencies. So they'll tell you a few things like, well, a good rule of thumb is x,

04:09.200 --> 04:12.880
good rule of thumb is y. And then you say, yeah, but wait a minute, what about this case where

04:13.520 --> 04:17.040
they seem to give different answers? And that happens immediately, all the time.

04:17.920 --> 04:23.360
And we see this, of course, with ethics. So you think about the general punches we have with

04:23.360 --> 04:28.720
ethics. We're always struggling with things like, well, of course, we want to avoid suffering,

04:28.720 --> 04:35.360
that's terrible, we must reduce suffering. But on the other hand, we want to maintain autonomy.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.000
So we don't want to find ourselves. So that creates ethical dilemmas where people are extremely ill

04:40.000 --> 04:44.480
or suffering terribly. So we don't quite know what to do about that. All of the ethical challenges

04:44.480 --> 04:48.080
that we face now, I've said just illustrations of this fact that the sooner we think about anything

04:48.080 --> 04:53.280
tricky, we realize, oh, no, my beliefs, my preferences, my values, my principles are in

04:53.280 --> 04:59.520
contradiction. To the extent that I can formulate them at all. So just to where that got me to the

04:59.520 --> 05:06.240
thinking about the mind is flat, or the title of the mind is flat, is the old sort of artificial

05:06.240 --> 05:11.360
intelligence perspective would be, you don't quite know what your beliefs are, you don't

05:11.360 --> 05:15.680
quite know what your preferences are, and your principles are. But that sort of whatever's in

05:15.760 --> 05:20.080
your head, it's a bit, it's beliefs and principles and preferences and things like that. There's lots

05:20.080 --> 05:24.080
on. And, you know, the more you think about them, the more you think, oh, I've forgotten about this

05:24.080 --> 05:28.800
one. Oh, I remember that one. And you can tell a longer and longer story about what these preferences

05:28.800 --> 05:35.040
and beliefs are. But I think it's an illusion to think that these stories are actually reflecting

05:35.040 --> 05:39.920
what's in your head. What they are is creative enterprises. They're a creative endeavor. If

05:39.920 --> 05:44.160
you try to understand yourself, in the moment, at the very moment, you're thinking,

05:44.960 --> 05:49.280
well, why did I make that move? Or why is this wrong? But that's not wrong.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.600
Then that's the point at which I'm inventing the story.

05:52.160 --> 05:57.760
So I think what you're saying there is that rather than this, so it's in folks sort of

05:57.760 --> 06:02.560
folk psychological terms, we can say comfortably enough, people do have beliefs and preferences,

06:02.560 --> 06:09.120
and they know things. But the idea that they are somehow stitched together underneath in a coherent

06:09.200 --> 06:15.120
or near coherent whole, that seems to be where your suggestion is they don't lie underneath,

06:15.120 --> 06:19.760
stitched together. We stitch them together as we go. Yes. It's a mention in the moment because

06:19.760 --> 06:27.600
you talk a lot in the book about the improvising mind. Yes. Now, that's exactly right. So I think

06:27.600 --> 06:31.040
we should think of ourselves as rather like fictional characters. So again, one of the things

06:31.040 --> 06:37.120
that comes up a lot in the book is the analogies with fiction. And I think when we're reading a book,

06:37.120 --> 06:41.680
we have a really a real sense of the depth of the characters and our motivations. I'm not quite

06:41.680 --> 06:47.280
sure about all our motivations. We have a sense that they're sort of deep, interesting, rich things.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.800
And indeed, we ourselves are deep, interesting, rich things in a sense. But the sense of depth

06:52.800 --> 06:59.920
can't be that inside the head of the character, say Anna Karenader or Sherlock Holmes, there are

06:59.920 --> 07:04.240
real beliefs and desires and principles. Because of course, this is a fictional character, they

07:04.240 --> 07:10.640
don't have a brain. It's nothing inside. But from the scraps of information we know about that

07:10.640 --> 07:16.160
person, we are able ourselves to weave a complicated story about why they did this and why they thought

07:16.160 --> 07:19.760
that and probably they would have done this in a different situation. And we can do that about

07:19.760 --> 07:25.760
ourselves too. And I think we can do it for the same reason. So we're observing our own lives flow

07:25.760 --> 07:30.320
by, we're observing the people around us. And we understand ourselves in just the way we understand

07:30.320 --> 07:35.680
fictional characters or other people by improvising stories. I think the illusion is thinking, no,

07:35.680 --> 07:40.720
no, when I'm understanding myself, I look inside, you know, I just, there's all this coherent stuff

07:40.720 --> 07:45.600
in my head. And I just have a good, a good nose around in my own brain. And I think that's something

07:45.600 --> 07:49.040
we just simply can't do at all. And it's sort of, sort of, we know this. I mean, if you ask me

07:49.040 --> 07:59.120
something like, I don't know, for example, why, why, why do I, why do I do by one thing rather

07:59.200 --> 08:03.280
than another thing? So I'm say, why do I, you know, why have I got a particular broadband

08:03.280 --> 08:08.080
provider or something really not terribly like that? I think, God, you've got me there. Well,

08:08.880 --> 08:12.800
I can tell you something historical about what I used to have. And I didn't get on very well with

08:12.800 --> 08:17.680
them. And I don't know why I switched to this one, but I can give you a story. And I know it's not,

08:17.680 --> 08:22.480
this is not a thank you a story. It's useful stuff to know. But the idea that it indicates

08:22.480 --> 08:26.400
something like that is an trivial, it's sort of obviously true that we don't have some sort of

08:26.400 --> 08:30.720
deep sense. And yes, I've got a big, all the providers that have strengths and weaknesses.

08:30.720 --> 08:35.280
No, of course I have. I've just got a scrappy understanding. But that scrappy understanding

08:35.280 --> 08:40.720
is sort of always like that. I mean, the sense is, in fact, that we have of being kind of slightly

08:40.720 --> 08:45.440
impostors and skating on thin ice as we flow through life. I think all of us know, really,

08:45.440 --> 08:50.000
that when we're trying to explain and understand our behavior, we're kind of,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.920
we're kind of very unsure. We're bumbling from one situation to another. And we're really quite

08:55.920 --> 09:01.520
good at maintaining the pretence that it's all coherent. Okay, so I want to pick up on here. So

09:01.520 --> 09:06.480
if you're a qualitative researcher, you sit there and conversation with me. And it is a sort of

09:07.120 --> 09:12.640
prevalent belief in the industry that our task, and indeed, this is what clients ask us to do,

09:12.640 --> 09:19.840
they say, I want to know what is behind their thinking. Now, you've just said those, these

09:19.840 --> 09:23.600
comments, if you ask the question, like, why did you switch your broadband provider? And someone

09:23.600 --> 09:28.880
says, well, I became hugely frustrated with the old one. This seems this is true. They've not,

09:30.480 --> 09:35.520
they've not said something that's like profoundly false. But your, your suggestion is what that

09:35.520 --> 09:39.920
they've not revealed, because we're trying to learn these things to predict things. So I suppose

09:39.920 --> 09:46.000
there's two things. So how should we sort of wait what we've discovered there? And what predictive

09:46.000 --> 09:53.120
value should we ascribe to it, if any? Yeah, I think the, the thing I stress really is when

09:53.120 --> 09:58.320
you're asking someone why they did something, they can quite often tell you, not necessarily all

09:58.320 --> 10:03.920
that accurately, but they can tell you something about the history. So what happened? And a little

10:03.920 --> 10:10.800
bit about why? Are there often that, of course, easy in fact, latter interpretation, and I suppose

10:10.800 --> 10:14.720
I must have been fed up with my broadband provider, otherwise why did they change? I may have some

10:14.720 --> 10:19.600
memory of, you know, service outages or something. But this is likely to be pretty partial and,

10:19.600 --> 10:24.800
and mostly much of it will be sort of later interpretation. Having said that, that might be

10:25.760 --> 10:30.480
quite predictive of my future behavior. So the, the sort of superficial sense I have of,

10:31.520 --> 10:36.880
I don't trust company X, Y or Z, even if I'm not quite sure why I do that sense of anything,

10:38.080 --> 10:42.080
that company, or any company with a similar name or any company owned by the same people or

10:42.080 --> 10:46.400
anything that's vaguely associated with it, I just don't like it. And that's useful information to

10:46.400 --> 10:51.680
know. It's not, it's not that there's some sort of deep theory I have, or some really, really

10:51.680 --> 10:58.080
coherent set of things that express my sort of deep true values across all possible situations.

10:58.080 --> 11:03.600
It's just a sort of scatter of local, local experiences and views. So I think there's something

11:03.600 --> 11:07.920
you're touching on there, which I suppose I talked a little bit about this beforehand, that

11:07.920 --> 11:13.760
you're, if we ask a question like that, we put, do we maybe learn very little predictively about

11:13.760 --> 11:19.200
that individual, but maybe learn something predictably about people in general. So we learn

11:19.200 --> 11:24.320
that frustration is a reason for doing something. But broadly, if you reduce frustration in that

11:24.320 --> 11:32.560
market, you will keep more customers. I think this is sort of borrowing from, you know, the idea

11:32.560 --> 11:36.480
of like a Freudian unconscious wherever you come to be, that we'd like to think that preferences

11:36.480 --> 11:42.880
are deeply internal. I think it's the extent to which when we tell these stories about why we

11:42.880 --> 11:47.680
change, they are predictive, not only more of other people's behavior than our own, or they're

11:47.680 --> 11:54.400
kind of collective tropes that we borrow upon. Yeah, I think, I think there is a lot of truth

11:54.400 --> 11:58.720
in that. I think the, sometimes, I mean, I'm first of all, I should stress that I think that

11:58.720 --> 12:03.520
qualitative sort of face-to-face conversational interactions, rich interactions with people

12:03.520 --> 12:08.960
are fantastically important, if you want to understand anything. So I mean, my background

12:08.960 --> 12:14.160
is experimental research and I run a quant or co-run a quant consultancy decision technology,

12:14.160 --> 12:23.520
which does very quanty things. In reality, you can't get very far without rich engagement with

12:23.520 --> 12:26.880
individuals, if you want to understand, you know, or with anything you know, qualitative research

12:26.880 --> 12:32.880
just care about. So I'm not sort of imagining that there's some alternative strategy. But I think

12:32.880 --> 12:38.160
it's probably a mistake to think that what the qualitative research is trying to do is to uncover

12:38.160 --> 12:42.320
some sort of hidden belief structure that the person's not really aware of. It's more that

12:42.320 --> 12:49.120
they're, you're helping, you're allowing them to, as it were, create and give you a story about

12:49.120 --> 12:52.720
their behavior. If you get several people to do this, you'll suddenly find sort of recurrent

12:52.720 --> 12:57.680
patterns and the same things start to come up. And the things that people find persuasive stories

12:57.680 --> 13:02.080
are themselves important. Because if you're introducing a new product or a new option,

13:02.800 --> 13:06.240
a really crucial question is what story are they going to tell about this? And the answer is not

13:06.240 --> 13:12.240
defined. It's not that it's not clear before we start. It's a creative question. And so if I

13:12.240 --> 13:17.600
introduce, you know, the iPhone for the first time or introduce texting or something, before

13:17.600 --> 13:22.240
texting came along, this sounded like a total turkey. It's a, you've already could speak,

13:22.240 --> 13:25.440
now we just can be typing characters in it on a terrible keyboard to each other. That's never

13:25.440 --> 13:30.480
going to work. But in fact, it turns out there are ways of, you know, ways of using the technology

13:30.480 --> 13:35.840
which we love. So I think the idea, we all know that it's not, so whether people are like or

13:35.840 --> 13:40.720
dislike something, it's not, it's not something that's, it's kind of fixed in their head before

13:40.720 --> 13:45.840
the new product or service or offering comes to them. There's a sort of dynamic creative process of

13:45.840 --> 13:49.680
are we all going to get our heads around this? Are we going to decide we love it and this is how

13:49.680 --> 13:53.840
we're using it? Or are we going to just not, and you know, that's just not well, well-determined.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.680
But qualitative interactions with people and exploring that space with them will be really

13:57.680 --> 14:03.920
helpful when giving you a clue. So I suppose, I just wanted to pick up, have you ever in your

14:03.920 --> 14:08.160
long career in psychology, experiment psychology, used qualitative methods? Is that?

14:08.800 --> 14:12.880
Yes, yes, I have actually, yes. So I've been doing, what did you use those for? Because I think one

14:12.880 --> 14:19.520
of the things that people at the AQRR are, they're used to sort of, as we were talking to Luella

14:19.520 --> 14:22.880
before, one of the previous webinars was someone who's written a book called The Focus Group Is

14:22.880 --> 14:27.840
Dead, right? They're used to that kind of wholesale attack on the very credibility of it. So to talk

14:27.840 --> 14:34.480
to someone who holds this apparently sort of a heretical view, yet has used

14:34.480 --> 14:36.800
qualitative methodologies. It'd be interesting to hear about that.

14:36.800 --> 14:42.560
Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, let me, actually, I've used it quite a lot. So in, for example, in

14:42.560 --> 14:50.640
pensions choices, we did a project years ago on what people do, what happens when you're,

14:51.280 --> 14:54.000
when you get to the pensionable age and you can potentially change your annuity.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.920
You can buy a different annuity from the one that's you've got with your current pension

14:57.920 --> 15:02.080
provider. Most of us don't even think about this, we just plow on, we think, well, I'm with,

15:02.080 --> 15:06.560
whoever I'm with, that's just, and often that's really not a good idea. So it's actually relevant

15:06.560 --> 15:12.080
to you at some point in the future, any of you. Watch out, because actually, you can get,

15:12.640 --> 15:16.480
actually, it really makes a big difference which provider you're with. Anyway, the question is,

15:16.480 --> 15:21.440
why don't people do this and how can we get them to do it better? And of course, you might want

15:22.000 --> 15:26.160
to have a big web-based survey of pensions of different ages and so on. There's a quantity

15:26.160 --> 15:31.200
sort of approach and look at different possible ways in which you can persuade people to pay

15:31.200 --> 15:35.120
differently or just get them to explore how they ended up with the pension and ended up with all

15:35.120 --> 15:38.640
that stuff. But you can't really get started with knowing what questions to ask without having

15:38.640 --> 15:43.600
rich interactions with actual people in a situation. And I think that's just the general

15:43.600 --> 15:48.880
story for quantum research, which doesn't start with qual, tends to be pretty hopeless, I think.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.320
Because you just don't know what questions you should be asking, so you just miss out something

15:52.320 --> 15:58.720
absolutely crucial. Yeah, so you wouldn't really want to do a quant, and it used to be the classical

15:58.720 --> 16:04.240
methodology, would never do a quant thing without at least a small, small pie, just to test the

16:04.240 --> 16:10.000
questions, basically. Yeah, yeah. It's probably to test the questions and also to test the breath.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.280
So I think the reality of real interaction, another example would be energy. As it's true,

16:15.440 --> 16:20.160
most of the big quantum projects we do in decision technology do have a qual

16:20.160 --> 16:27.440
front end of some kind, sometimes quite a big one. So things like understanding energy purchasing,

16:27.440 --> 16:34.640
those are all about switching or non-switching for the big six or whatever it is now,

16:35.600 --> 16:41.840
utilities. There are a lot of the factors that people that really are important to people,

16:41.840 --> 16:44.800
are things that will never cross your mind unless you've had those interactions, which

16:44.800 --> 16:49.680
would be obvious to listeners, but it wasn't so obvious to me. So talking to people about

16:51.280 --> 16:56.400
energy, you would find some people who said, no, I think it's basically part of who I am,

16:56.400 --> 17:00.720
that I can keep the house as hot as possible. And I don't want any of this insulation, because I just

17:00.720 --> 17:07.600
want to be able to get much, much energy going through the house as possible. That's comfort.

17:07.600 --> 17:11.600
And you might say, well, that just doesn't make any sense, so surely. It's easy,

17:11.600 --> 17:14.480
more insulation, that's got to be good, but that's not always the way it seems.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.400
There's a nanny state perspective. There are all kinds of perspectives on the problem,

17:18.400 --> 17:24.560
or indeed just a sense that you don't want to think about it. It's upsetting. The whole issue of

17:24.560 --> 17:29.520
energy builds is unpleasant. And not a nice thing to think about, and you just, you're worried about

17:29.520 --> 17:33.760
it. And the last thing you want to be doing is focusing your mind on this and this disturbing

17:33.760 --> 17:37.520
question. So you just don't want to even think about changing your provider or insulating your loft

17:37.520 --> 17:42.800
or anything of that kind. But there's a space of possibilities. It's vast, and people who don't

17:44.640 --> 17:50.480
interact at one to one level with other people who are on this question of interest are going to just

17:50.480 --> 17:54.880
be picking a few things out of the air, which seem like they're a sensible, rational person.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.800
A bit like them seems sensible, but that'll just miss almost everything of interest, I think.

17:59.680 --> 18:04.400
So I think that if people are not getting these, when they express beliefs and preferences,

18:04.400 --> 18:08.960
if they're not getting them from within, where do they get them from?

18:09.760 --> 18:15.200
Yeah, well, I think they get them from basically two places. So one, they're getting them from

18:15.200 --> 18:18.720
their own past experiences. There's a little bit of circularity there, of course, because,

18:19.840 --> 18:25.920
but nonetheless, it's the case that most many of my choices are very much similar to my choices

18:25.920 --> 18:29.920
in the past. And also, I'm using my past choices to work out what sort of person I actually am.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.360
I've quit it. So if I'm thinking tea or coffee in the morning, I often, in fact,

18:35.360 --> 18:39.120
won't think much about it at all. I'll just default to tea in the morning, coffee in the

18:39.120 --> 18:44.480
afternoon, or whatever it is. But indeed, if I try to think carefully about it,

18:44.480 --> 18:49.360
so I find myself in sipping my tea and thinking, is this actually nicer than coffee would be?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.520
It's just really hard to tell, but you have to do a sort of experiment and test both.

18:54.400 --> 18:59.120
We don't, that's not what we're doing. We have the feeling that I must have a desire for tea.

19:00.400 --> 19:05.360
But actually, it's much closer psychologically to the point that I have a habit for tea.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.880
And so that's a lot of our behaviors like that.

19:09.440 --> 19:14.320
So we have habits for which we give reasons, because to have habits with no reasons would seem

19:15.440 --> 19:19.600
embarrassing and incoherent. I've often had the experience of drinking not particularly nice

19:19.600 --> 19:25.600
coffee in places like canteens, where I will have a coffee and I'll think, I've done it again.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.840
I think of myself as a coffee drinker. So when someone says, what would you like, I think,

19:29.840 --> 19:33.520
I'll have some coffee. But then it comes out of some horrendous machine. And I always think,

19:33.520 --> 19:38.560
oh, this bears no relation to the thing I actually like. But there I am drinking it.

19:38.560 --> 19:45.120
And I do it again and again. It's not, it's based on this, in my case, I suppose, a very superficial.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.360
It's what you do in those circumstances. Yeah, your coffee is the thing I tend to respond with.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.360
And I suppose that's sort of your range then. I think there's some, so some of the decisions

19:53.360 --> 19:58.000
are very context driven. So I don't drink at all and I don't like beer. But if I find myself

19:58.000 --> 20:02.160
having to wait for somebody in a pub for a long time, I have a sort of reflexive habit,

20:02.160 --> 20:06.960
while I order a pint of Guinness, because you can sit with a pint of Guinness in a pub forever,

20:06.960 --> 20:10.960
and no one will trouble you. That seems to be, so even though I hate, I'd like,

20:10.960 --> 20:15.200
you have to drink about a third of it. So then people really won't, they just can't work out

20:15.200 --> 20:19.120
how long you've been there and how dangerous you are or whatever. So that's ridiculous,

20:19.120 --> 20:24.080
because I hate the stuff I do. Everything about it is wrong. And yeah, it's a habit.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.240
I just wonder how much, and that seems to be driven by where I am, what I have to do.

20:29.360 --> 20:36.160
There's some work by Steve Sloman called Knowledge Illusion, which is very much about how we,

20:36.160 --> 20:43.200
in a very real sense, store a lot of our apparent beliefs in the outside world. So he used an example,

20:43.760 --> 20:50.320
I think it's a Liverpool University sourced paper, about asking people who can ride a bike

20:50.320 --> 20:54.480
to draw a bicycle. And it turns out, even people who know how to ride a bicycle,

20:54.480 --> 20:58.480
when you ask them to draw one, that it's mechanically, disastrously inaccurate.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.840
And that's because when they, I think when they go to ride a bicycle, the bike reminds them,

21:03.840 --> 21:07.760
as it were, how to ride it. So you don't really need to know, you just need to know enough to

21:07.760 --> 21:13.840
be reminded when a bicycle appears before you. So do you sort of ascribing that what we might be,

21:13.840 --> 21:20.720
when we're questioning people qualitatively, what we're looking for, is to find those

21:20.720 --> 21:24.560
context driven responses, where we then sort of create these?

21:26.480 --> 21:31.760
Yeah, I think that's right. So the thing about habits is they are completely,

21:32.320 --> 21:35.200
they're triggered by the situation we're in, they're triggered by context.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.480
And they often are triggered in a fairly, fairly superficial way. So the bicycle example is a lovely

21:40.480 --> 21:46.000
one. And in riding a bicycle, you don't have to know much, you have to know sort of roughly where

21:46.000 --> 21:50.240
the pedals are, where the seat is, how to get on it. And then you actually have to know some

21:50.240 --> 21:54.160
quite complicated balancing stuff, which you've got no conscious of when it's of any way.

21:55.280 --> 22:00.880
And sort of off you go. But if you don't have to understand the way the gears work and all this

22:00.960 --> 22:05.120
stuff. And so as you say, people can, but people have a sense they must understand what a bicycle

22:05.120 --> 22:10.000
looks like. It seems obvious. And I ride one every day. I must go to the draw one. But the

22:10.000 --> 22:15.200
answer is not at all. Now, that's one of the, going back to the first point about the early

22:15.200 --> 22:20.400
cognitive science and artificial intelligence, the kind, these are sort of similar examples.

22:20.400 --> 22:26.160
So it's a famous example about air conditioners, where you ask people, in America, where everybody

22:26.160 --> 22:30.560
has air conditioners. Well, you know, what's an air conditioner do? How does that work then?

22:31.680 --> 22:36.400
And of course, none of the faintest idea of what the earth is going on. But, but it's,

22:36.400 --> 22:40.160
that's a revelation. And most people have a strong sense, similarly as with the bicycle,

22:40.160 --> 22:43.840
they have a strong sense that they perfectly well understand this, they know all the details,

22:43.840 --> 22:46.720
and they're just going to tell you, but actually now they start to think about it. It's a bit more

22:46.720 --> 22:51.360
complicated than they thought. And I think that's not just true for parts of the physical world.

22:51.360 --> 22:56.080
It's true for our attitudes to the political parties and attitudes of the companies,

22:56.080 --> 23:00.640
our attitudes to deep philosophical questions, but our attitudes for everything are very much

23:00.640 --> 23:06.080
like the bicycle. We have a few snippets, which we get us by in terms of, you know,

23:06.080 --> 23:11.680
struggling, making, engaging with whatever this is enough that we can get by in daily life.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.280
But if you ask us about deep things, then, you know, we're struggling.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.840
Yeah, I decided, I suppose one of the, I mean, I'm a big advocate that the,

23:19.840 --> 23:26.000
the role of a qualitative researcher is one of analysis and interpretation. So it's never just

23:26.000 --> 23:31.040
to report what people said is to think. And I think one of the things that we have to weigh

23:31.040 --> 23:36.800
time and time again is people give you an answer. So you say, do you believe in giving to charity?

23:36.800 --> 23:40.400
This is a very leading question. And they say, yes, of course, I believe in giving to charity.

23:40.400 --> 23:46.000
And we then have to judge whether they really mean that. It's just a socially acceptable answer,

23:46.000 --> 23:51.120
you know, whether that would give any kind of, you're, I mean, you'd ask a slightly more

23:51.760 --> 23:57.440
nuanced series of questions, but the task is to say whether they mean it or whether they just

23:57.440 --> 24:03.920
talk a good game and then never do it. And you get, I do quite a lot of work listening to doctors,

24:03.920 --> 24:12.000
for example. And you do this thing where they can talk about identifying different types of

24:12.000 --> 24:18.720
patient. But if there are only really two kinds of treatment available for mild patients and serious

24:18.720 --> 24:24.400
patients, every patient has to be defined as mild or serious. So even though they can describe what

24:24.400 --> 24:29.040
an in-between moderate patient might be, for example, they will always reclassify them as

24:29.040 --> 24:33.040
mild or serious, because there's nothing to do with a moderate patient. They're no use to them.

24:33.040 --> 24:38.480
So this is, they can talk for hours about the moderate patient, but you know, it's in a sense

24:38.480 --> 24:44.960
empty talk. It's completely sincere, well-meaning to be empty in terms of motivation. And do you

24:44.960 --> 24:51.760
have any sort of tips about how you would detect in the way people talk about things, how to tell

24:51.760 --> 24:55.520
sort of the weak from the chef, or if you think that's possible at all?

24:57.200 --> 25:00.800
Well, I don't think there's any, I don't think there's any simple

25:00.800 --> 25:05.120
way to detect the weak from the chef, but I do completely think it's right that

25:05.120 --> 25:11.360
one should view the task of qualitative researchers as an interpretative task. So you,

25:11.360 --> 25:16.240
as the qualitative researcher, with the knowledge and sophistication and understanding of people

25:16.240 --> 25:22.080
you have, are the best place to have a sense of, well, this is the kind of thing everybody says,

25:22.080 --> 25:27.360
or this doesn't sound quite sincere or whatever. There's no, there's no sort of methodology that

25:27.360 --> 25:33.360
will do better than human judgment on that, I think. I think that's right. So I think, yeah,

25:33.360 --> 25:38.880
so I think sometimes people who are keen on the value of qual from the quantitative end

25:38.880 --> 25:42.080
sort of think that qual is a bit like quant, but it's just less of it.

25:43.040 --> 25:48.880
Complete mistake. It's just totally, it's not that if you could only do lots and lots and lots of

25:48.880 --> 25:53.680
qual and sort of do lots of statistical analysis of the things that people say and so on, that would

25:53.760 --> 25:58.560
be better. I think that's completely, completely mistaken. I think what's very hard in what you

25:58.560 --> 26:06.080
said there is, it is the ability to read other people is a human instinct or something we can do

26:06.080 --> 26:11.280
and we can maybe hone that and get better at it and that is incredibly valuable as a research tool.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.320
Even if we don't believe there is this deep mind, there are so many other things we can

26:16.320 --> 26:22.640
detect in their usefulness and sincerity. Yeah, that's right. And so, I mean, the fact that there's

26:22.640 --> 26:28.880
no, there's no sort of ground truth. There's no ground truth about, you know, am I, am I really

26:28.880 --> 26:32.800
pro or anti charity or do I think giving to charities is good or bad? And the answer is going

26:32.800 --> 26:37.440
to be, well, in some situations, I think it is a good idea and abstract. I think, of course,

26:37.440 --> 26:40.960
charity is very important. People should give to them and perhaps I ought to give to them, but then

26:41.520 --> 26:46.800
in reality, maybe I'm not giving as much as I say I should be. And yet sometimes in particular

26:46.800 --> 26:53.360
context, I will and so I will be a jumble and we're all a jumble. So what the quality, I mean,

26:53.360 --> 26:57.840
I think you qualitative researchers are all very aware of the sort of richness of this.

26:57.840 --> 27:04.480
And I think the task is not to distill it down. I think, well, what's what's really going on with

27:04.480 --> 27:10.560
this person is more to get a sense of what are the various perspectives and experiences and actions

27:10.560 --> 27:15.520
and things that have happened to them that they embody. So what, so it will be a mixture. So I

27:15.600 --> 27:22.160
think one thing that I think is particularly useful is getting people to talk about concrete

27:22.160 --> 27:30.480
examples. So things have actually done. I think people can spin a good yarn in the general context,

27:30.480 --> 27:36.480
which is fairly unconnected to the actual behavior. If you say charity, good or a bad thing,

27:36.480 --> 27:41.120
of course, very good, of course they are. And you can talk at that level of generality forever.

27:41.200 --> 27:46.880
But it gets much more, it's much more specific to me if you say, when did you last give to charity

27:46.880 --> 27:51.760
and why was that? And what happens if you meet someone in the street with a tin or what do you

27:51.760 --> 27:57.280
feel when people come to your door? When did that last happen? The more situation specific, the better.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.520
I think that's because actually one of the questions that's come through on the the chatter

28:01.520 --> 28:07.520
is do you have any sort of question stratagems and that would clearly be one to be as concrete

28:07.520 --> 28:12.640
as possible and specific as possible. And I think one of the things I sort of always that comes up

28:12.640 --> 28:17.920
in coal, I think it's interesting is what is called a FOAF, but a friend of a friend story.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.480
And I think those are interesting because they circulate as folklore, but the person they actually

28:22.480 --> 28:28.960
happen to, nobody has ever actually met. They're that distant. They have a certain quality that you

28:28.960 --> 28:33.600
and you can say, well, does anyone really take them seriously or are they scare stories? So you

28:33.600 --> 28:38.080
tend to hear them for example, say about credit card security, while somebody had their pocket

28:38.080 --> 28:43.280
scanned on the tube and they lost thousands. And the actual occasions of this happening are

28:43.840 --> 28:50.160
non-existent, but the belief is wide. And yeah, so you say, well, when did it actually happen to you?

28:50.160 --> 28:54.240
It would be a very good way of shaking out that. And obviously people then double down,

28:54.240 --> 28:58.240
they say, really did happen to them. And kind of tell when they're doing that.

28:58.720 --> 29:02.800
Another thing to get some of the questions because I'm sort of heading towards the end of our time

29:02.800 --> 29:09.840
is someone's asked, where in the sort of continuum of modern day psychology would you place yourself?

29:09.840 --> 29:13.920
Because the mind of flat does seem, obviously, I realised it's the title of a book and it's

29:13.920 --> 29:17.680
this idea of attention to a book. It seems quite a radical position.

29:17.680 --> 29:24.720
Yeah, I think it is. It is. I was driven to write the book. So this goes back to your very first

29:24.720 --> 29:31.360
question really, because I sort of struggled for all my academic life with two sort of contradictory

29:32.160 --> 29:39.360
feelings. So on the one hand, the large amounts of academic psychology and artificial intelligence

29:39.360 --> 29:44.080
and many other nearby disciplines basically do eschew and economics for that matter.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.600
We have preferences and knowledge and they're pretty stable and they wobble around a bit of

29:47.600 --> 29:53.040
the edges as it were. But that's basically the sort of stuff of the mind, the solid beliefs and

29:53.040 --> 29:57.360
desires and so on. And yeah, every time I ever did an experiment and everybody else, this is

29:57.360 --> 30:02.000
true for everybody else in judgment and decision making or social psychology or any other area of

30:02.000 --> 30:05.360
cognitive psychology, every time you try and pin down one of these beliefs or desires, it shoots

30:05.360 --> 30:09.360
around all over your place and change the context, change the experiment, change the instructions,

30:09.360 --> 30:14.800
you just get totally different answers. So the struggle for me was thinking, well, what do I

30:14.800 --> 30:20.560
make of this? Do I, how do I square this contradiction? And I think ultimately I've broken

30:20.560 --> 30:26.560
one way rather than the other rather. So I've just come to the conclusion that the very idea

30:26.560 --> 30:30.640
that there's any bedrock is a completely, that's just the fundamental mistake.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.280
So this is quite a radical position. So a lot of the experiments I talk about in the book

30:36.000 --> 30:40.320
are quite standard and indeed some of the explanations I give are quite standard. I don't

30:40.320 --> 30:46.320
think there are very many people who are quite taking such a thoroughgoing line as I am and saying,

30:46.320 --> 30:50.160
well, actually, it's sort of improvisation all the way down. But I think the reason one can,

30:50.160 --> 30:55.680
that is a sustainable view and this is a sort of breakthrough in my thinking, hopefully productive

30:55.680 --> 31:00.880
one, was thinking, ah, well, of course, the thing is that when you're improvising, you're always,

31:00.880 --> 31:04.800
you can always improvise based on what all the other thoughts you've had before. And also the

31:04.800 --> 31:07.600
thoughts you've heard from other people and the things they've said and things they've done.

31:07.600 --> 31:12.800
So you're not starting from scratch, you've got this incredibly rich tapestry of previous

31:12.800 --> 31:17.680
improvisational experiences and thoughts and things to draw on. And that's what's allowing you to

31:17.680 --> 31:23.680
create as it were the next thought. It's not, so it's always on the surface, it's always constructed

31:23.680 --> 31:28.320
in the moment, but every moment can refer back to all those other moments. It's not that you're

31:28.320 --> 31:33.360
referring back to a sort of a deeper underlying, this is what I really think and who I really am

31:33.360 --> 31:39.280
level, it's more, I'm more like a tradition, the traditional things that Nick tends to say and do.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.600
Okay, that's it. Someone's just come to the question, it's very interesting,

31:43.600 --> 31:46.640
whether we improvise our emotions as well as our beliefs?

31:46.640 --> 31:51.920
Ah, yes. So there's some lovely examples of this. So I'll mention a couple from the book.

31:52.880 --> 31:58.400
So I think the absolutely answer is yes. There's a lovely experiment where, this is by

31:59.280 --> 32:03.200
Dutton and Aaron in 1974. So it's really an old experiment, but a beautiful experiment,

32:03.200 --> 32:09.600
where they ask female, attractive female experiments as to interview male bridge

32:09.600 --> 32:13.520
crosses. So people are walking across bridges. I should say this is an experiment from 1971,

32:13.520 --> 32:20.880
isn't it? Hence the rather, sort of a pre-me to era nature of the experiment. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

32:20.880 --> 32:24.560
absolutely. Yes, yes, yes, I should stress this. Yes, yes, it would all be done a bit differently

32:24.560 --> 32:31.440
now. Careful. But it was a, so your female experimenters interviewed the male bridge

32:31.440 --> 32:36.480
crosses who are crossing either a high wobbly suspension type bridge on the University of

32:36.480 --> 32:42.000
British Columbia campus, or they have just crossed a low bridge, which is not scary at all.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.920
And the important thing is that the experimenters give the bridge crosser their phone number to

32:47.920 --> 32:51.200
say if there are any issues raised by this experiment, which is very unlikely because

32:51.200 --> 32:54.800
it's not a very interesting experiment. If you want to, if you need to get back to any ethical

32:54.800 --> 32:59.440
concerns, here's my number. And of course, quite a lot of the experimenters who are

32:59.440 --> 33:05.040
undergraduates on campus do in fact call the, call the experimenters because they,

33:05.040 --> 33:10.400
you know, they're interested in seeing more of them. The question, but the exciting prediction

33:10.400 --> 33:16.720
that Dutton and Aaron made was that there would, they were predicted that there would be higher

33:16.720 --> 33:21.840
numbers of phone calls if people had just crossed a high bridge, not a low bridge. And that turns

33:21.840 --> 33:27.360
out to be true. So it's the way the prediction works is you say, well, if you just want to cross

33:27.360 --> 33:30.960
a high bridge, you're full of adrenaline. When you're full of adrenaline, you're thinking,

33:30.960 --> 33:34.720
ah, where's all this adrenaline come from? Ah, I've just met this person who's been running

33:34.720 --> 33:38.640
me through this experiment. I guess I must kind of like them. I mean, you know, I didn't normally

33:38.640 --> 33:42.560
have this much adrenaline. It must be because it's because of them. They've caused it. So you have

33:42.560 --> 33:48.960
that interpretation of your physiological state of it being adrenalized. We interpret that as

33:48.960 --> 33:54.160
attraction. And you get, and you get this absolutely everywhere. So, you know, you get,

33:54.160 --> 33:58.400
so they get this if you go back even earlier in psychology, when you give people adrenaline

33:58.400 --> 34:04.240
shocks, shots, the syringe, but you don't either you do tell them, I'm going to give you some

34:04.240 --> 34:09.200
adrenaline now or you don't. If you don't tell them, then they have to sit and wait for the

34:09.200 --> 34:15.120
experiment to begin. And then they interact with somebody who is a bit strangely and then the

34:15.120 --> 34:21.600
person will either be more annoyed than normal by the person's behavior or more amused by the

34:21.600 --> 34:26.000
behavior, whatever their behavior, the person who's in the waiting room with them, whatever

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
they do, the person who's got more adrenaline, it got adrenaline in their body, but doesn't

34:30.000 --> 34:34.640
realize it reacts more strongly. But they don't realize that they're reacting more strongly

34:34.640 --> 34:38.080
because of the adrenaline. Of course, they don't know anything about that. They were so annoying.

34:38.080 --> 34:41.200
That person was just, I couldn't believe how annoying they were. And the reason they think

34:41.200 --> 34:45.360
they're so, so annoying is because they're, the person's behaving a bit irritatingly,

34:45.360 --> 34:49.200
but I've got lots of adrenaline. So I must be really annoyed about this because where's the

34:49.200 --> 34:53.360
adrenaline coming from? But if you tell people, are you going to feel a bit weird? Yeah, if there's

34:53.360 --> 34:59.600
adrenaline, there's adrenaline injection. So if you expected to be a bit, feel a bit peculiar,

34:59.600 --> 35:04.320
then those effects don't completely disappear, but they're much reduced because then obviously I

35:04.320 --> 35:10.160
think, oh, I'm feeling a bit strange because they told me I would. So I don't misinterpret my emotion.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.520
So emotionally interpretation is just incredibly rich, incredibly complicated.

35:13.520 --> 35:19.760
But it's the key, I think, to take the key taken message, and I think this is really quite standard

35:19.760 --> 35:24.960
perspective in emotion research, is that you shouldn't think of emotions. We shouldn't think of

35:24.960 --> 35:31.440
emotions as welling up from within that active interpretations. So what you have access to

35:31.440 --> 35:36.960
is your physiological state. I'll know. I've got adrenaline. I haven't got adrenaline. I'm sleepy.

35:36.960 --> 35:42.880
I'm waitful. But I'm then trying to interpret, well, why? Why am I feeling that? And that's

35:42.880 --> 35:48.240
the emotion has been generated. And is that something where we can learn to, in a sense,

35:48.240 --> 35:54.480
create our own emotions? Because I noticed that, despite your clear skepticism for sort of the

35:54.480 --> 36:02.000
psychoanalysis of Freud, you speak favorably, I think, of the effects of CBT or other talking

36:02.000 --> 36:07.040
cures. You believe those are real, that they can change people's lives for the better. So

36:07.040 --> 36:10.880
they're not changing the deep person. What are they changing the patterns of response?

36:11.440 --> 36:17.120
Yeah, I think what they're doing, and I think, actually, the virtues of CBT are quite closely,

36:17.120 --> 36:22.000
closely connected to the virtues of qualitative research, actually. It's all about rich,

36:22.000 --> 36:26.880
rich engagement with other human beings. And one of the things that CBT is doing is what I think

36:26.880 --> 36:33.200
it's doing two key things. One is it's telling you that the experience and thoughts you have

36:33.200 --> 36:37.120
should not be taking the face value. They're interpretations of the moment. So if you have

36:37.120 --> 36:42.640
a feeling of, I'm hopeless, or I can't succeed, or you shouldn't think, oh, that's my inner self

36:42.640 --> 36:47.040
speaking, it's told the real truth. Other people say I'm okay, but I've got the voice from within,

36:47.040 --> 36:50.800
that's the one that's right. That should be treated with great skepticism, because it's

36:50.800 --> 36:54.240
just one or more of those improvisations. And you should be able to step back from and say,

36:54.240 --> 36:57.440
then take yourself, yeah, I improvise that sometimes, sometimes I come up with other stuff.

36:58.320 --> 37:04.480
So that's one point, which is detaching yourself from a sense that there's some sort of gushing

37:04.480 --> 37:09.360
inner truth bursting forth, which you just have to take, which it can be very dangerous if those

37:09.360 --> 37:15.280
thoughts are negative. But the other thing is it's helping you create new habits and new structures

37:15.280 --> 37:22.000
and new stories. I think sometimes therapists think of themselves as creating the true story or

37:22.000 --> 37:26.560
uncovering the true story. And I would say that's not quite right. It's more like co-creation. We

37:26.560 --> 37:32.160
together in this session, as it were, are trying to find a different way of interpreting your life,

37:32.160 --> 37:35.040
maybe a more useful one, and one that will help you go forwards.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.280
Okay, Llewela, you've reappeared. Does this mean we're out of time? Because someone has just asked

37:39.280 --> 37:45.040
to actually what would be a brilliant question. Go ahead. Someone said, what do you think? I think

37:45.040 --> 37:49.440
I remember your answer to this, and I think it was you just burst out laughing, actually. What do

37:49.440 --> 37:57.200
you think of implicit association tests? Ah, right. Well, I think this is a tricky question,

37:57.200 --> 38:04.240
really. I mean, implicit association tests do, you know, they are very powerful. They are powerful

38:04.240 --> 38:15.680
measures of things like of unconscious bias. And I don't think that's right. Well, the implicitness,

38:15.680 --> 38:21.280
I think, is, you might think, ah, they're implicit, these association tests, so they must

38:21.280 --> 38:26.000
actually, these are, therefore, they must be contacting your unconscious. And I think that's

38:26.000 --> 38:36.880
not the right way to look at it. So I think it is true that we do, we do have certain kind of

38:36.880 --> 38:41.920
associative networks between different categories and concepts, which are very fluid and very

38:41.920 --> 38:48.400
variable and jump around, but they nonetheless are there. And we're not aware of them. But, of

38:48.400 --> 38:52.320
course, we're not aware of anything about our minds. We're always improvising in the moment.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.360
So I suppose the thing I want to say, so I'm not a great skeptic of implicit association tests,

38:57.360 --> 39:01.040
and they aren't genuinely interesting and useful. But I don't think that what they're not doing is

39:01.040 --> 39:07.600
revealing your unconscious in any particularly particular way, because from my point of view,

39:07.600 --> 39:13.840
you're never conscious of your inner workings of your brain. Your consciousness just doesn't work

39:13.840 --> 39:19.600
that way. All you ever have is a stream of improvisation. And so if I say, I'll ask you

39:19.600 --> 39:25.280
explicitly, what's your attitude to people in a particular group? I'll generate some stuff. You

39:25.280 --> 39:28.880
might think, well, you must have been conscious of that. But the answer is no, no, you're conscious

39:28.880 --> 39:34.480
of what you've just said. That's true. You weren't conscious of the processes underneath. And you

39:34.480 --> 39:39.360
never are. So you're happy with the association part. It's the implicit part that you know.

39:41.360 --> 39:45.840
That claim that you find troubling. Okay, well, I think, regrettably, because as I think I'm proving

39:45.840 --> 39:51.680
I could talk to all day, there's a time has come to answer Luella has appeared to wrap us up. So

39:51.680 --> 39:58.480
thank you so much for talking about your book, which I can warmly recommend to anyone. So Luella,

39:58.480 --> 40:02.720
to you to wrap us up. Thank you very much, Nick. Well, thank you both very much. I mean,

40:02.720 --> 40:07.040
it was fascinating. And I apologize for hanging around like a bad smell and not turning my video

40:07.040 --> 40:14.400
off. Got there in the end. Just before we say goodbye, hope to see you at the next webinar.

40:15.840 --> 40:21.680
Details will be coming out shortly. And just say or to remind members that there's just over a week

40:21.680 --> 40:29.760
to go before the deadline for paper submissions to a qr's big day out. And through other little

40:29.760 --> 40:35.440
bits and pieces, there are still a few tickets tickets left for a qr's, not the Christmas party

40:35.440 --> 40:43.040
details on the website. There's a new breakfast bites coming up. And a qr spark returns

40:43.600 --> 40:50.720
later on in February with transforming imposter syndrome, which sounds fascinating.

40:51.440 --> 40:57.120
But again, thank you both very much. And I look forward to a rematch actually at some

40:57.120 --> 41:03.920
point, because it seems to be an awful lot that didn't go said. So maybe maybe. Thank you. Thank you.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.840
Bye. Bye.
