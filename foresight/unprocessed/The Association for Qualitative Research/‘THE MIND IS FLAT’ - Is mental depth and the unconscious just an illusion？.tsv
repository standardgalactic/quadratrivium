0	8080	Hello. Sorry, she said waving the book. Welcome to the latest AQR webinar and welcome to Nick
8080	15760	Salsgate and Nick Chater. I'm very kindly come on board to discuss Nick Cee's latest book.
16480	23440	This one, The Mind is Flat, which he's just told us, has won the US prose award for best book
23440	32240	in clinical psychology. So many congratulations for that. Nick Salsgate, or I can hear a corner,
34640	40560	partook of our last webinar. So he's an old hand at this and he says he's a
40560	46160	philosopher turned advertising planner, turned into some sort of hybrid creature
46160	49600	by work at the School of Life and the Institute of Practition as an advertiser.
50560	55200	Nick Chater is Professor of Behavioural Science and Pathology at the School.
56080	62320	He's on the advisory board of the Nudge Unit. He also broadcasts regularly on BBC Radio 4,
62320	71360	has hundreds of publications on his under his belt and runs a, I meant to ask, what is an M00C?
71360	77520	On the Shocking Shallowness of Human Psychology on Future Learn. Anyway, this is about The Mind
77520	85360	is Flat, the relevance to qualitative research. So I will leave you to it there with me when I
85360	97920	disappear off the screen, hopefully. And Feta Black-Luella. So what a little phase into the background.
98800	105360	So Nick, thanks for joining us. I was reflecting on this. It's about 10 years since we first met
105440	112160	doing work at the IPA. So and it was very exciting to see you publish your now award winning book.
112960	116720	So all those conversations I never got to finish with you because you were rushing somewhere else.
116720	124000	A lot of it was in the book. But what I'm interested in is it strikes me it's quite a personal book in
124000	132240	that it's not just built out of your research, but it's built out of your sort of more profound
132240	137520	beliefs or your deeper beliefs. So I was just interested to start by asking you how you came
137520	142080	to write a book called The Mind is Flat for me. And then we're getting to watching Mead by The
142080	148720	Mind Being Flat. Yes, that's a good question. I think it comes from a couple of sources. One is
148720	155360	that my starting point in the academic world when I did my PhD was the world of cognitive science.
155360	160240	And that's the project of trying to build computer models of the mind. So it's sort of like artificial
160240	166080	intelligence. Your aim is to build models that are like people. And a very natural strategy to do
166080	170240	that is to think, well, what we need to do is to work out what people's beliefs are, what they know
170240	174800	about the world, and also what they like, what they want, what they don't like. So we try and get all
174800	179680	this out of people's heads. And then we put it into a computer program and try and figure out
179680	184640	what the program would like to do. So it seems like a sensible strategy and between before
184880	190800	about from 1980 or so, it was probably the most popular strategy and artificial intelligence.
190800	199120	I came into the field in I suppose about 1986 as a PhD student. So I was in the sort of latter
199120	204240	phases of this project. And it was very influential on me to think that when people tried to do this,
205760	210960	it always seemed to go horribly wrong at the very first stage. So you'd think, I want to know how
210960	214960	to play chess. I want to make a computer that can play chess. So I need to talk to some grand
214960	218720	masters. I mean, they're really good at chess. They must know loads about this. So they'll just
218720	222960	tell me what the strategies they're using are. And I'll put it into my computer and off it will go.
222960	227520	But in fact, it turns out that's a disastrous approach, partly because the grand masters have no
227520	232880	idea what they seem to know. They tell you different things on different days. Most of the time they
232880	237280	just say, well, that's obviously a silly move. You wouldn't want to do that. But they can't really
237280	243680	tell you why. But not only that, they also, the things they can tell you turn out to be rapidly
244320	249200	to lead to inconsistencies. So they'll tell you a few things like, well, a good rule of thumb is x,
249200	252880	good rule of thumb is y. And then you say, yeah, but wait a minute, what about this case where
253520	257040	they seem to give different answers? And that happens immediately, all the time.
257920	263360	And we see this, of course, with ethics. So you think about the general punches we have with
263360	268720	ethics. We're always struggling with things like, well, of course, we want to avoid suffering,
268720	275360	that's terrible, we must reduce suffering. But on the other hand, we want to maintain autonomy.
275360	280000	So we don't want to find ourselves. So that creates ethical dilemmas where people are extremely ill
280000	284480	or suffering terribly. So we don't quite know what to do about that. All of the ethical challenges
284480	288080	that we face now, I've said just illustrations of this fact that the sooner we think about anything
288080	293280	tricky, we realize, oh, no, my beliefs, my preferences, my values, my principles are in
293280	299520	contradiction. To the extent that I can formulate them at all. So just to where that got me to the
299520	306240	thinking about the mind is flat, or the title of the mind is flat, is the old sort of artificial
306240	311360	intelligence perspective would be, you don't quite know what your beliefs are, you don't
311360	315680	quite know what your preferences are, and your principles are. But that sort of whatever's in
315760	320080	your head, it's a bit, it's beliefs and principles and preferences and things like that. There's lots
320080	324080	on. And, you know, the more you think about them, the more you think, oh, I've forgotten about this
324080	328800	one. Oh, I remember that one. And you can tell a longer and longer story about what these preferences
328800	335040	and beliefs are. But I think it's an illusion to think that these stories are actually reflecting
335040	339920	what's in your head. What they are is creative enterprises. They're a creative endeavor. If
339920	344160	you try to understand yourself, in the moment, at the very moment, you're thinking,
344960	349280	well, why did I make that move? Or why is this wrong? But that's not wrong.
349280	351600	Then that's the point at which I'm inventing the story.
352160	357760	So I think what you're saying there is that rather than this, so it's in folks sort of
357760	362560	folk psychological terms, we can say comfortably enough, people do have beliefs and preferences,
362560	369120	and they know things. But the idea that they are somehow stitched together underneath in a coherent
369200	375120	or near coherent whole, that seems to be where your suggestion is they don't lie underneath,
375120	379760	stitched together. We stitch them together as we go. Yes. It's a mention in the moment because
379760	387600	you talk a lot in the book about the improvising mind. Yes. Now, that's exactly right. So I think
387600	391040	we should think of ourselves as rather like fictional characters. So again, one of the things
391040	397120	that comes up a lot in the book is the analogies with fiction. And I think when we're reading a book,
397120	401680	we have a really a real sense of the depth of the characters and our motivations. I'm not quite
401680	407280	sure about all our motivations. We have a sense that they're sort of deep, interesting, rich things.
407280	412800	And indeed, we ourselves are deep, interesting, rich things in a sense. But the sense of depth
412800	419920	can't be that inside the head of the character, say Anna Karenader or Sherlock Holmes, there are
419920	424240	real beliefs and desires and principles. Because of course, this is a fictional character, they
424240	430640	don't have a brain. It's nothing inside. But from the scraps of information we know about that
430640	436160	person, we are able ourselves to weave a complicated story about why they did this and why they thought
436160	439760	that and probably they would have done this in a different situation. And we can do that about
439760	445760	ourselves too. And I think we can do it for the same reason. So we're observing our own lives flow
445760	450320	by, we're observing the people around us. And we understand ourselves in just the way we understand
450320	455680	fictional characters or other people by improvising stories. I think the illusion is thinking, no,
455680	460720	no, when I'm understanding myself, I look inside, you know, I just, there's all this coherent stuff
460720	465600	in my head. And I just have a good, a good nose around in my own brain. And I think that's something
465600	469040	we just simply can't do at all. And it's sort of, sort of, we know this. I mean, if you ask me
469040	479120	something like, I don't know, for example, why, why, why do I, why do I do by one thing rather
479200	483280	than another thing? So I'm say, why do I, you know, why have I got a particular broadband
483280	488080	provider or something really not terribly like that? I think, God, you've got me there. Well,
488880	492800	I can tell you something historical about what I used to have. And I didn't get on very well with
492800	497680	them. And I don't know why I switched to this one, but I can give you a story. And I know it's not,
497680	502480	this is not a thank you a story. It's useful stuff to know. But the idea that it indicates
502480	506400	something like that is an trivial, it's sort of obviously true that we don't have some sort of
506400	510720	deep sense. And yes, I've got a big, all the providers that have strengths and weaknesses.
510720	515280	No, of course I have. I've just got a scrappy understanding. But that scrappy understanding
515280	520720	is sort of always like that. I mean, the sense is, in fact, that we have of being kind of slightly
520720	525440	impostors and skating on thin ice as we flow through life. I think all of us know, really,
525440	530000	that when we're trying to explain and understand our behavior, we're kind of,
530000	535920	we're kind of very unsure. We're bumbling from one situation to another. And we're really quite
535920	541520	good at maintaining the pretence that it's all coherent. Okay, so I want to pick up on here. So
541520	546480	if you're a qualitative researcher, you sit there and conversation with me. And it is a sort of
547120	552640	prevalent belief in the industry that our task, and indeed, this is what clients ask us to do,
552640	559840	they say, I want to know what is behind their thinking. Now, you've just said those, these
559840	563600	comments, if you ask the question, like, why did you switch your broadband provider? And someone
563600	568880	says, well, I became hugely frustrated with the old one. This seems this is true. They've not,
570480	575520	they've not said something that's like profoundly false. But your, your suggestion is what that
575520	579920	they've not revealed, because we're trying to learn these things to predict things. So I suppose
579920	586000	there's two things. So how should we sort of wait what we've discovered there? And what predictive
586000	593120	value should we ascribe to it, if any? Yeah, I think the, the thing I stress really is when
593120	598320	you're asking someone why they did something, they can quite often tell you, not necessarily all
598320	603920	that accurately, but they can tell you something about the history. So what happened? And a little
603920	610800	bit about why? Are there often that, of course, easy in fact, latter interpretation, and I suppose
610800	614720	I must have been fed up with my broadband provider, otherwise why did they change? I may have some
614720	619600	memory of, you know, service outages or something. But this is likely to be pretty partial and,
619600	624800	and mostly much of it will be sort of later interpretation. Having said that, that might be
625760	630480	quite predictive of my future behavior. So the, the sort of superficial sense I have of,
631520	636880	I don't trust company X, Y or Z, even if I'm not quite sure why I do that sense of anything,
638080	642080	that company, or any company with a similar name or any company owned by the same people or
642080	646400	anything that's vaguely associated with it, I just don't like it. And that's useful information to
646400	651680	know. It's not, it's not that there's some sort of deep theory I have, or some really, really
651680	658080	coherent set of things that express my sort of deep true values across all possible situations.
658080	663600	It's just a sort of scatter of local, local experiences and views. So I think there's something
663600	667920	you're touching on there, which I suppose I talked a little bit about this beforehand, that
667920	673760	you're, if we ask a question like that, we put, do we maybe learn very little predictively about
673760	679200	that individual, but maybe learn something predictably about people in general. So we learn
679200	684320	that frustration is a reason for doing something. But broadly, if you reduce frustration in that
684320	692560	market, you will keep more customers. I think this is sort of borrowing from, you know, the idea
692560	696480	of like a Freudian unconscious wherever you come to be, that we'd like to think that preferences
696480	702880	are deeply internal. I think it's the extent to which when we tell these stories about why we
702880	707680	change, they are predictive, not only more of other people's behavior than our own, or they're
707680	714400	kind of collective tropes that we borrow upon. Yeah, I think, I think there is a lot of truth
714400	718720	in that. I think the, sometimes, I mean, I'm first of all, I should stress that I think that
718720	723520	qualitative sort of face-to-face conversational interactions, rich interactions with people
723520	728960	are fantastically important, if you want to understand anything. So I mean, my background
728960	734160	is experimental research and I run a quant or co-run a quant consultancy decision technology,
734160	743520	which does very quanty things. In reality, you can't get very far without rich engagement with
743520	746880	individuals, if you want to understand, you know, or with anything you know, qualitative research
746880	752880	just care about. So I'm not sort of imagining that there's some alternative strategy. But I think
752880	758160	it's probably a mistake to think that what the qualitative research is trying to do is to uncover
758160	762320	some sort of hidden belief structure that the person's not really aware of. It's more that
762320	769120	they're, you're helping, you're allowing them to, as it were, create and give you a story about
769120	772720	their behavior. If you get several people to do this, you'll suddenly find sort of recurrent
772720	777680	patterns and the same things start to come up. And the things that people find persuasive stories
777680	782080	are themselves important. Because if you're introducing a new product or a new option,
782800	786240	a really crucial question is what story are they going to tell about this? And the answer is not
786240	792240	defined. It's not that it's not clear before we start. It's a creative question. And so if I
792240	797600	introduce, you know, the iPhone for the first time or introduce texting or something, before
797600	802240	texting came along, this sounded like a total turkey. It's a, you've already could speak,
802240	805440	now we just can be typing characters in it on a terrible keyboard to each other. That's never
805440	810480	going to work. But in fact, it turns out there are ways of, you know, ways of using the technology
810480	815840	which we love. So I think the idea, we all know that it's not, so whether people are like or
815840	820720	dislike something, it's not, it's not something that's, it's kind of fixed in their head before
820720	825840	the new product or service or offering comes to them. There's a sort of dynamic creative process of
825840	829680	are we all going to get our heads around this? Are we going to decide we love it and this is how
829680	833840	we're using it? Or are we going to just not, and you know, that's just not well, well-determined.
833840	837680	But qualitative interactions with people and exploring that space with them will be really
837680	843920	helpful when giving you a clue. So I suppose, I just wanted to pick up, have you ever in your
843920	848160	long career in psychology, experiment psychology, used qualitative methods? Is that?
848800	852880	Yes, yes, I have actually, yes. So I've been doing, what did you use those for? Because I think one
852880	859520	of the things that people at the AQRR are, they're used to sort of, as we were talking to Luella
859520	862880	before, one of the previous webinars was someone who's written a book called The Focus Group Is
862880	867840	Dead, right? They're used to that kind of wholesale attack on the very credibility of it. So to talk
867840	874480	to someone who holds this apparently sort of a heretical view, yet has used
874480	876800	qualitative methodologies. It'd be interesting to hear about that.
876800	882560	Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, let me, actually, I've used it quite a lot. So in, for example, in
882560	890640	pensions choices, we did a project years ago on what people do, what happens when you're,
891280	894000	when you get to the pensionable age and you can potentially change your annuity.
894960	897920	You can buy a different annuity from the one that's you've got with your current pension
897920	902080	provider. Most of us don't even think about this, we just plow on, we think, well, I'm with,
902080	906560	whoever I'm with, that's just, and often that's really not a good idea. So it's actually relevant
906560	912080	to you at some point in the future, any of you. Watch out, because actually, you can get,
912640	916480	actually, it really makes a big difference which provider you're with. Anyway, the question is,
916480	921440	why don't people do this and how can we get them to do it better? And of course, you might want
922000	926160	to have a big web-based survey of pensions of different ages and so on. There's a quantity
926160	931200	sort of approach and look at different possible ways in which you can persuade people to pay
931200	935120	differently or just get them to explore how they ended up with the pension and ended up with all
935120	938640	that stuff. But you can't really get started with knowing what questions to ask without having
938640	943600	rich interactions with actual people in a situation. And I think that's just the general
943600	948880	story for quantum research, which doesn't start with qual, tends to be pretty hopeless, I think.
948960	952320	Because you just don't know what questions you should be asking, so you just miss out something
952320	958720	absolutely crucial. Yeah, so you wouldn't really want to do a quant, and it used to be the classical
958720	964240	methodology, would never do a quant thing without at least a small, small pie, just to test the
964240	970000	questions, basically. Yeah, yeah. It's probably to test the questions and also to test the breath.
970000	975280	So I think the reality of real interaction, another example would be energy. As it's true,
975440	980160	most of the big quantum projects we do in decision technology do have a qual
980160	987440	front end of some kind, sometimes quite a big one. So things like understanding energy purchasing,
987440	994640	those are all about switching or non-switching for the big six or whatever it is now,
995600	1001840	utilities. There are a lot of the factors that people that really are important to people,
1001840	1004800	are things that will never cross your mind unless you've had those interactions, which
1004800	1009680	would be obvious to listeners, but it wasn't so obvious to me. So talking to people about
1011280	1016400	energy, you would find some people who said, no, I think it's basically part of who I am,
1016400	1020720	that I can keep the house as hot as possible. And I don't want any of this insulation, because I just
1020720	1027600	want to be able to get much, much energy going through the house as possible. That's comfort.
1027600	1031600	And you might say, well, that just doesn't make any sense, so surely. It's easy,
1031600	1034480	more insulation, that's got to be good, but that's not always the way it seems.
1034480	1038400	There's a nanny state perspective. There are all kinds of perspectives on the problem,
1038400	1044560	or indeed just a sense that you don't want to think about it. It's upsetting. The whole issue of
1044560	1049520	energy builds is unpleasant. And not a nice thing to think about, and you just, you're worried about
1049520	1053760	it. And the last thing you want to be doing is focusing your mind on this and this disturbing
1053760	1057520	question. So you just don't want to even think about changing your provider or insulating your loft
1057520	1062800	or anything of that kind. But there's a space of possibilities. It's vast, and people who don't
1064640	1070480	interact at one to one level with other people who are on this question of interest are going to just
1070480	1074880	be picking a few things out of the air, which seem like they're a sensible, rational person.
1074880	1078800	A bit like them seems sensible, but that'll just miss almost everything of interest, I think.
1079680	1084400	So I think that if people are not getting these, when they express beliefs and preferences,
1084400	1088960	if they're not getting them from within, where do they get them from?
1089760	1095200	Yeah, well, I think they get them from basically two places. So one, they're getting them from
1095200	1098720	their own past experiences. There's a little bit of circularity there, of course, because,
1099840	1105920	but nonetheless, it's the case that most many of my choices are very much similar to my choices
1105920	1109920	in the past. And also, I'm using my past choices to work out what sort of person I actually am.
1110640	1115360	I've quit it. So if I'm thinking tea or coffee in the morning, I often, in fact,
1115360	1119120	won't think much about it at all. I'll just default to tea in the morning, coffee in the
1119120	1124480	afternoon, or whatever it is. But indeed, if I try to think carefully about it,
1124480	1129360	so I find myself in sipping my tea and thinking, is this actually nicer than coffee would be?
1130000	1133520	It's just really hard to tell, but you have to do a sort of experiment and test both.
1134400	1139120	We don't, that's not what we're doing. We have the feeling that I must have a desire for tea.
1140400	1145360	But actually, it's much closer psychologically to the point that I have a habit for tea.
1146240	1148880	And so that's a lot of our behaviors like that.
1149440	1154320	So we have habits for which we give reasons, because to have habits with no reasons would seem
1155440	1159600	embarrassing and incoherent. I've often had the experience of drinking not particularly nice
1159600	1165600	coffee in places like canteens, where I will have a coffee and I'll think, I've done it again.
1166560	1169840	I think of myself as a coffee drinker. So when someone says, what would you like, I think,
1169840	1173520	I'll have some coffee. But then it comes out of some horrendous machine. And I always think,
1173520	1178560	oh, this bears no relation to the thing I actually like. But there I am drinking it.
1178560	1185120	And I do it again and again. It's not, it's based on this, in my case, I suppose, a very superficial.
1185120	1189360	It's what you do in those circumstances. Yeah, your coffee is the thing I tend to respond with.
1189360	1193360	And I suppose that's sort of your range then. I think there's some, so some of the decisions
1193360	1198000	are very context driven. So I don't drink at all and I don't like beer. But if I find myself
1198000	1202160	having to wait for somebody in a pub for a long time, I have a sort of reflexive habit,
1202160	1206960	while I order a pint of Guinness, because you can sit with a pint of Guinness in a pub forever,
1206960	1210960	and no one will trouble you. That seems to be, so even though I hate, I'd like,
1210960	1215200	you have to drink about a third of it. So then people really won't, they just can't work out
1215200	1219120	how long you've been there and how dangerous you are or whatever. So that's ridiculous,
1219120	1224080	because I hate the stuff I do. Everything about it is wrong. And yeah, it's a habit.
1224800	1228240	I just wonder how much, and that seems to be driven by where I am, what I have to do.
1229360	1236160	There's some work by Steve Sloman called Knowledge Illusion, which is very much about how we,
1236160	1243200	in a very real sense, store a lot of our apparent beliefs in the outside world. So he used an example,
1243760	1250320	I think it's a Liverpool University sourced paper, about asking people who can ride a bike
1250320	1254480	to draw a bicycle. And it turns out, even people who know how to ride a bicycle,
1254480	1258480	when you ask them to draw one, that it's mechanically, disastrously inaccurate.
1259600	1263840	And that's because when they, I think when they go to ride a bicycle, the bike reminds them,
1263840	1267760	as it were, how to ride it. So you don't really need to know, you just need to know enough to
1267760	1273840	be reminded when a bicycle appears before you. So do you sort of ascribing that what we might be,
1273840	1280720	when we're questioning people qualitatively, what we're looking for, is to find those
1280720	1284560	context driven responses, where we then sort of create these?
1286480	1291760	Yeah, I think that's right. So the thing about habits is they are completely,
1292320	1295200	they're triggered by the situation we're in, they're triggered by context.
1295920	1300480	And they often are triggered in a fairly, fairly superficial way. So the bicycle example is a lovely
1300480	1306000	one. And in riding a bicycle, you don't have to know much, you have to know sort of roughly where
1306000	1310240	the pedals are, where the seat is, how to get on it. And then you actually have to know some
1310240	1314160	quite complicated balancing stuff, which you've got no conscious of when it's of any way.
1315280	1320880	And sort of off you go. But if you don't have to understand the way the gears work and all this
1320960	1325120	stuff. And so as you say, people can, but people have a sense they must understand what a bicycle
1325120	1330000	looks like. It seems obvious. And I ride one every day. I must go to the draw one. But the
1330000	1335200	answer is not at all. Now, that's one of the, going back to the first point about the early
1335200	1340400	cognitive science and artificial intelligence, the kind, these are sort of similar examples.
1340400	1346160	So it's a famous example about air conditioners, where you ask people, in America, where everybody
1346160	1350560	has air conditioners. Well, you know, what's an air conditioner do? How does that work then?
1351680	1356400	And of course, none of the faintest idea of what the earth is going on. But, but it's,
1356400	1360160	that's a revelation. And most people have a strong sense, similarly as with the bicycle,
1360160	1363840	they have a strong sense that they perfectly well understand this, they know all the details,
1363840	1366720	and they're just going to tell you, but actually now they start to think about it. It's a bit more
1366720	1371360	complicated than they thought. And I think that's not just true for parts of the physical world.
1371360	1376080	It's true for our attitudes to the political parties and attitudes of the companies,
1376080	1380640	our attitudes to deep philosophical questions, but our attitudes for everything are very much
1380640	1386080	like the bicycle. We have a few snippets, which we get us by in terms of, you know,
1386080	1391680	struggling, making, engaging with whatever this is enough that we can get by in daily life.
1391680	1395280	But if you ask us about deep things, then, you know, we're struggling.
1396160	1399840	Yeah, I decided, I suppose one of the, I mean, I'm a big advocate that the,
1399840	1406000	the role of a qualitative researcher is one of analysis and interpretation. So it's never just
1406000	1411040	to report what people said is to think. And I think one of the things that we have to weigh
1411040	1416800	time and time again is people give you an answer. So you say, do you believe in giving to charity?
1416800	1420400	This is a very leading question. And they say, yes, of course, I believe in giving to charity.
1420400	1426000	And we then have to judge whether they really mean that. It's just a socially acceptable answer,
1426000	1431120	you know, whether that would give any kind of, you're, I mean, you'd ask a slightly more
1431760	1437440	nuanced series of questions, but the task is to say whether they mean it or whether they just
1437440	1443920	talk a good game and then never do it. And you get, I do quite a lot of work listening to doctors,
1443920	1452000	for example. And you do this thing where they can talk about identifying different types of
1452000	1458720	patient. But if there are only really two kinds of treatment available for mild patients and serious
1458720	1464400	patients, every patient has to be defined as mild or serious. So even though they can describe what
1464400	1469040	an in-between moderate patient might be, for example, they will always reclassify them as
1469040	1473040	mild or serious, because there's nothing to do with a moderate patient. They're no use to them.
1473040	1478480	So this is, they can talk for hours about the moderate patient, but you know, it's in a sense
1478480	1484960	empty talk. It's completely sincere, well-meaning to be empty in terms of motivation. And do you
1484960	1491760	have any sort of tips about how you would detect in the way people talk about things, how to tell
1491760	1495520	sort of the weak from the chef, or if you think that's possible at all?
1497200	1500800	Well, I don't think there's any, I don't think there's any simple
1500800	1505120	way to detect the weak from the chef, but I do completely think it's right that
1505120	1511360	one should view the task of qualitative researchers as an interpretative task. So you,
1511360	1516240	as the qualitative researcher, with the knowledge and sophistication and understanding of people
1516240	1522080	you have, are the best place to have a sense of, well, this is the kind of thing everybody says,
1522080	1527360	or this doesn't sound quite sincere or whatever. There's no, there's no sort of methodology that
1527360	1533360	will do better than human judgment on that, I think. I think that's right. So I think, yeah,
1533360	1538880	so I think sometimes people who are keen on the value of qual from the quantitative end
1538880	1542080	sort of think that qual is a bit like quant, but it's just less of it.
1543040	1548880	Complete mistake. It's just totally, it's not that if you could only do lots and lots and lots of
1548880	1553680	qual and sort of do lots of statistical analysis of the things that people say and so on, that would
1553760	1558560	be better. I think that's completely, completely mistaken. I think what's very hard in what you
1558560	1566080	said there is, it is the ability to read other people is a human instinct or something we can do
1566080	1571280	and we can maybe hone that and get better at it and that is incredibly valuable as a research tool.
1572960	1576320	Even if we don't believe there is this deep mind, there are so many other things we can
1576320	1582640	detect in their usefulness and sincerity. Yeah, that's right. And so, I mean, the fact that there's
1582640	1588880	no, there's no sort of ground truth. There's no ground truth about, you know, am I, am I really
1588880	1592800	pro or anti charity or do I think giving to charities is good or bad? And the answer is going
1592800	1597440	to be, well, in some situations, I think it is a good idea and abstract. I think, of course,
1597440	1600960	charity is very important. People should give to them and perhaps I ought to give to them, but then
1601520	1606800	in reality, maybe I'm not giving as much as I say I should be. And yet sometimes in particular
1606800	1613360	context, I will and so I will be a jumble and we're all a jumble. So what the quality, I mean,
1613360	1617840	I think you qualitative researchers are all very aware of the sort of richness of this.
1617840	1624480	And I think the task is not to distill it down. I think, well, what's what's really going on with
1624480	1630560	this person is more to get a sense of what are the various perspectives and experiences and actions
1630560	1635520	and things that have happened to them that they embody. So what, so it will be a mixture. So I
1635600	1642160	think one thing that I think is particularly useful is getting people to talk about concrete
1642160	1650480	examples. So things have actually done. I think people can spin a good yarn in the general context,
1650480	1656480	which is fairly unconnected to the actual behavior. If you say charity, good or a bad thing,
1656480	1661120	of course, very good, of course they are. And you can talk at that level of generality forever.
1661200	1666880	But it gets much more, it's much more specific to me if you say, when did you last give to charity
1666880	1671760	and why was that? And what happens if you meet someone in the street with a tin or what do you
1671760	1677280	feel when people come to your door? When did that last happen? The more situation specific, the better.
1677920	1681520	I think that's because actually one of the questions that's come through on the the chatter
1681520	1687520	is do you have any sort of question stratagems and that would clearly be one to be as concrete
1687520	1692640	as possible and specific as possible. And I think one of the things I sort of always that comes up
1692640	1697920	in coal, I think it's interesting is what is called a FOAF, but a friend of a friend story.
1698560	1702480	And I think those are interesting because they circulate as folklore, but the person they actually
1702480	1708960	happen to, nobody has ever actually met. They're that distant. They have a certain quality that you
1708960	1713600	and you can say, well, does anyone really take them seriously or are they scare stories? So you
1713600	1718080	tend to hear them for example, say about credit card security, while somebody had their pocket
1718080	1723280	scanned on the tube and they lost thousands. And the actual occasions of this happening are
1723840	1730160	non-existent, but the belief is wide. And yeah, so you say, well, when did it actually happen to you?
1730160	1734240	It would be a very good way of shaking out that. And obviously people then double down,
1734240	1738240	they say, really did happen to them. And kind of tell when they're doing that.
1738720	1742800	Another thing to get some of the questions because I'm sort of heading towards the end of our time
1742800	1749840	is someone's asked, where in the sort of continuum of modern day psychology would you place yourself?
1749840	1753920	Because the mind of flat does seem, obviously, I realised it's the title of a book and it's
1753920	1757680	this idea of attention to a book. It seems quite a radical position.
1757680	1764720	Yeah, I think it is. It is. I was driven to write the book. So this goes back to your very first
1764720	1771360	question really, because I sort of struggled for all my academic life with two sort of contradictory
1772160	1779360	feelings. So on the one hand, the large amounts of academic psychology and artificial intelligence
1779360	1784080	and many other nearby disciplines basically do eschew and economics for that matter.
1784080	1787600	We have preferences and knowledge and they're pretty stable and they wobble around a bit of
1787600	1793040	the edges as it were. But that's basically the sort of stuff of the mind, the solid beliefs and
1793040	1797360	desires and so on. And yeah, every time I ever did an experiment and everybody else, this is
1797360	1802000	true for everybody else in judgment and decision making or social psychology or any other area of
1802000	1805360	cognitive psychology, every time you try and pin down one of these beliefs or desires, it shoots
1805360	1809360	around all over your place and change the context, change the experiment, change the instructions,
1809360	1814800	you just get totally different answers. So the struggle for me was thinking, well, what do I
1814800	1820560	make of this? Do I, how do I square this contradiction? And I think ultimately I've broken
1820560	1826560	one way rather than the other rather. So I've just come to the conclusion that the very idea
1826560	1830640	that there's any bedrock is a completely, that's just the fundamental mistake.
1831520	1835280	So this is quite a radical position. So a lot of the experiments I talk about in the book
1836000	1840320	are quite standard and indeed some of the explanations I give are quite standard. I don't
1840320	1846320	think there are very many people who are quite taking such a thoroughgoing line as I am and saying,
1846320	1850160	well, actually, it's sort of improvisation all the way down. But I think the reason one can,
1850160	1855680	that is a sustainable view and this is a sort of breakthrough in my thinking, hopefully productive
1855680	1860880	one, was thinking, ah, well, of course, the thing is that when you're improvising, you're always,
1860880	1864800	you can always improvise based on what all the other thoughts you've had before. And also the
1864800	1867600	thoughts you've heard from other people and the things they've said and things they've done.
1867600	1872800	So you're not starting from scratch, you've got this incredibly rich tapestry of previous
1872800	1877680	improvisational experiences and thoughts and things to draw on. And that's what's allowing you to
1877680	1883680	create as it were the next thought. It's not, so it's always on the surface, it's always constructed
1883680	1888320	in the moment, but every moment can refer back to all those other moments. It's not that you're
1888320	1893360	referring back to a sort of a deeper underlying, this is what I really think and who I really am
1893360	1899280	level, it's more, I'm more like a tradition, the traditional things that Nick tends to say and do.
1900240	1903600	Okay, that's it. Someone's just come to the question, it's very interesting,
1903600	1906640	whether we improvise our emotions as well as our beliefs?
1906640	1911920	Ah, yes. So there's some lovely examples of this. So I'll mention a couple from the book.
1912880	1918400	So I think the absolutely answer is yes. There's a lovely experiment where, this is by
1919280	1923200	Dutton and Aaron in 1974. So it's really an old experiment, but a beautiful experiment,
1923200	1929600	where they ask female, attractive female experiments as to interview male bridge
1929600	1933520	crosses. So people are walking across bridges. I should say this is an experiment from 1971,
1933520	1940880	isn't it? Hence the rather, sort of a pre-me to era nature of the experiment. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
1940880	1944560	absolutely. Yes, yes, yes, I should stress this. Yes, yes, it would all be done a bit differently
1944560	1951440	now. Careful. But it was a, so your female experimenters interviewed the male bridge
1951440	1956480	crosses who are crossing either a high wobbly suspension type bridge on the University of
1956480	1962000	British Columbia campus, or they have just crossed a low bridge, which is not scary at all.
1962000	1967920	And the important thing is that the experimenters give the bridge crosser their phone number to
1967920	1971200	say if there are any issues raised by this experiment, which is very unlikely because
1971200	1974800	it's not a very interesting experiment. If you want to, if you need to get back to any ethical
1974800	1979440	concerns, here's my number. And of course, quite a lot of the experimenters who are
1979440	1985040	undergraduates on campus do in fact call the, call the experimenters because they,
1985040	1990400	you know, they're interested in seeing more of them. The question, but the exciting prediction
1990400	1996720	that Dutton and Aaron made was that there would, they were predicted that there would be higher
1996720	2001840	numbers of phone calls if people had just crossed a high bridge, not a low bridge. And that turns
2001840	2007360	out to be true. So it's the way the prediction works is you say, well, if you just want to cross
2007360	2010960	a high bridge, you're full of adrenaline. When you're full of adrenaline, you're thinking,
2010960	2014720	ah, where's all this adrenaline come from? Ah, I've just met this person who's been running
2014720	2018640	me through this experiment. I guess I must kind of like them. I mean, you know, I didn't normally
2018640	2022560	have this much adrenaline. It must be because it's because of them. They've caused it. So you have
2022560	2028960	that interpretation of your physiological state of it being adrenalized. We interpret that as
2028960	2034160	attraction. And you get, and you get this absolutely everywhere. So, you know, you get,
2034160	2038400	so they get this if you go back even earlier in psychology, when you give people adrenaline
2038400	2044240	shocks, shots, the syringe, but you don't either you do tell them, I'm going to give you some
2044240	2049200	adrenaline now or you don't. If you don't tell them, then they have to sit and wait for the
2049200	2055120	experiment to begin. And then they interact with somebody who is a bit strangely and then the
2055120	2061600	person will either be more annoyed than normal by the person's behavior or more amused by the
2061600	2066000	behavior, whatever their behavior, the person who's in the waiting room with them, whatever
2066000	2070000	they do, the person who's got more adrenaline, it got adrenaline in their body, but doesn't
2070000	2074640	realize it reacts more strongly. But they don't realize that they're reacting more strongly
2074640	2078080	because of the adrenaline. Of course, they don't know anything about that. They were so annoying.
2078080	2081200	That person was just, I couldn't believe how annoying they were. And the reason they think
2081200	2085360	they're so, so annoying is because they're, the person's behaving a bit irritatingly,
2085360	2089200	but I've got lots of adrenaline. So I must be really annoyed about this because where's the
2089200	2093360	adrenaline coming from? But if you tell people, are you going to feel a bit weird? Yeah, if there's
2093360	2099600	adrenaline, there's adrenaline injection. So if you expected to be a bit, feel a bit peculiar,
2099600	2104320	then those effects don't completely disappear, but they're much reduced because then obviously I
2104320	2110160	think, oh, I'm feeling a bit strange because they told me I would. So I don't misinterpret my emotion.
2110160	2113520	So emotionally interpretation is just incredibly rich, incredibly complicated.
2113520	2119760	But it's the key, I think, to take the key taken message, and I think this is really quite standard
2119760	2124960	perspective in emotion research, is that you shouldn't think of emotions. We shouldn't think of
2124960	2131440	emotions as welling up from within that active interpretations. So what you have access to
2131440	2136960	is your physiological state. I'll know. I've got adrenaline. I haven't got adrenaline. I'm sleepy.
2136960	2142880	I'm waitful. But I'm then trying to interpret, well, why? Why am I feeling that? And that's
2142880	2148240	the emotion has been generated. And is that something where we can learn to, in a sense,
2148240	2154480	create our own emotions? Because I noticed that, despite your clear skepticism for sort of the
2154480	2162000	psychoanalysis of Freud, you speak favorably, I think, of the effects of CBT or other talking
2162000	2167040	cures. You believe those are real, that they can change people's lives for the better. So
2167040	2170880	they're not changing the deep person. What are they changing the patterns of response?
2171440	2177120	Yeah, I think what they're doing, and I think, actually, the virtues of CBT are quite closely,
2177120	2182000	closely connected to the virtues of qualitative research, actually. It's all about rich,
2182000	2186880	rich engagement with other human beings. And one of the things that CBT is doing is what I think
2186880	2193200	it's doing two key things. One is it's telling you that the experience and thoughts you have
2193200	2197120	should not be taking the face value. They're interpretations of the moment. So if you have
2197120	2202640	a feeling of, I'm hopeless, or I can't succeed, or you shouldn't think, oh, that's my inner self
2202640	2207040	speaking, it's told the real truth. Other people say I'm okay, but I've got the voice from within,
2207040	2210800	that's the one that's right. That should be treated with great skepticism, because it's
2210800	2214240	just one or more of those improvisations. And you should be able to step back from and say,
2214240	2217440	then take yourself, yeah, I improvise that sometimes, sometimes I come up with other stuff.
2218320	2224480	So that's one point, which is detaching yourself from a sense that there's some sort of gushing
2224480	2229360	inner truth bursting forth, which you just have to take, which it can be very dangerous if those
2229360	2235280	thoughts are negative. But the other thing is it's helping you create new habits and new structures
2235280	2242000	and new stories. I think sometimes therapists think of themselves as creating the true story or
2242000	2246560	uncovering the true story. And I would say that's not quite right. It's more like co-creation. We
2246560	2252160	together in this session, as it were, are trying to find a different way of interpreting your life,
2252160	2255040	maybe a more useful one, and one that will help you go forwards.
2256080	2259280	Okay, Llewela, you've reappeared. Does this mean we're out of time? Because someone has just asked
2259280	2265040	to actually what would be a brilliant question. Go ahead. Someone said, what do you think? I think
2265040	2269440	I remember your answer to this, and I think it was you just burst out laughing, actually. What do
2269440	2277200	you think of implicit association tests? Ah, right. Well, I think this is a tricky question,
2277200	2284240	really. I mean, implicit association tests do, you know, they are very powerful. They are powerful
2284240	2295680	measures of things like of unconscious bias. And I don't think that's right. Well, the implicitness,
2295680	2301280	I think, is, you might think, ah, they're implicit, these association tests, so they must
2301280	2306000	actually, these are, therefore, they must be contacting your unconscious. And I think that's
2306000	2316880	not the right way to look at it. So I think it is true that we do, we do have certain kind of
2316880	2321920	associative networks between different categories and concepts, which are very fluid and very
2321920	2328400	variable and jump around, but they nonetheless are there. And we're not aware of them. But, of
2328400	2332320	course, we're not aware of anything about our minds. We're always improvising in the moment.
2333040	2337360	So I suppose the thing I want to say, so I'm not a great skeptic of implicit association tests,
2337360	2341040	and they aren't genuinely interesting and useful. But I don't think that what they're not doing is
2341040	2347600	revealing your unconscious in any particularly particular way, because from my point of view,
2347600	2353840	you're never conscious of your inner workings of your brain. Your consciousness just doesn't work
2353840	2359600	that way. All you ever have is a stream of improvisation. And so if I say, I'll ask you
2359600	2365280	explicitly, what's your attitude to people in a particular group? I'll generate some stuff. You
2365280	2368880	might think, well, you must have been conscious of that. But the answer is no, no, you're conscious
2368880	2374480	of what you've just said. That's true. You weren't conscious of the processes underneath. And you
2374480	2379360	never are. So you're happy with the association part. It's the implicit part that you know.
2381360	2385840	That claim that you find troubling. Okay, well, I think, regrettably, because as I think I'm proving
2385840	2391680	I could talk to all day, there's a time has come to answer Luella has appeared to wrap us up. So
2391680	2398480	thank you so much for talking about your book, which I can warmly recommend to anyone. So Luella,
2398480	2402720	to you to wrap us up. Thank you very much, Nick. Well, thank you both very much. I mean,
2402720	2407040	it was fascinating. And I apologize for hanging around like a bad smell and not turning my video
2407040	2414400	off. Got there in the end. Just before we say goodbye, hope to see you at the next webinar.
2415840	2421680	Details will be coming out shortly. And just say or to remind members that there's just over a week
2421680	2429760	to go before the deadline for paper submissions to a qr's big day out. And through other little
2429760	2435440	bits and pieces, there are still a few tickets tickets left for a qr's, not the Christmas party
2435440	2443040	details on the website. There's a new breakfast bites coming up. And a qr spark returns
2443600	2450720	later on in February with transforming imposter syndrome, which sounds fascinating.
2451440	2457120	But again, thank you both very much. And I look forward to a rematch actually at some
2457120	2463920	point, because it seems to be an awful lot that didn't go said. So maybe maybe. Thank you. Thank you.
2463920	2465840	Bye. Bye.
