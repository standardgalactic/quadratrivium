0	8560	Trusses are everywhere. They are used in bridges, antenna towers, cranes,
11520	14080	even in parts of the International Space Station.
16720	20800	And for good reason. They allow us to create strong structures,
20800	24080	while using materials in a very efficient and cost-effective way.
25040	33840	So what exactly is a truss? It is essentially a rigid structure made up of a collection
33840	39280	of straight members, but that's not a complete definition. There are two important assumptions
39280	45200	we need to be able to make for a structure to be considered as a truss. First, we need to be able
45200	50160	to assume that all of the joints in the structure can be represented by a pinned connection,
50160	53040	meaning that members are free to rotate at the joints.
54400	59520	The members of a truss are often rigidly connected using what is known as a gusset plate.
60400	65120	But if the center lines of all the members at a joint intersect at the same point,
65120	70000	like they do here, it's reasonable to assume that the joint behaves like a pinned connection.
70880	75760	The second assumption we need to be able to make is that loads are only ever applied at the joints
75760	80240	of the truss. We never have loads acting in the middle of a member, for example.
82080	86240	Because all joints are pinned, the members cannot carry bending moments.
86240	93040	They can only carry axial loads. This simplifies the analysis of a truss significantly. Each
93040	98560	member has to be in equilibrium, so the forces acting at each end of a member must be equal
98560	102640	and opposite. Each member is either in tension or in compression.
106080	110640	These assumptions are what differentiate a truss from a frame.
113600	117360	Unlike trusses, frames don't necessarily have pinned joints,
117360	123600	and so members can carry bending moments. A frame can also have loads applied directly to its members.
130960	134880	The base shape of a truss is three members connected to form a triangle.
136560	141280	If a load is applied, the angles of the triangle won't be able to change if the length of each
141280	146960	of the members stays the same. This means that the triangle is a very stable shape which won't
146960	152320	deform when loads are applied to it, and so it is a great base from which to build a larger structure.
154000	157680	Joining four members together does not form a stable structure.
157680	162080	The angles between members can change without any change in the length of the members,
162080	166880	and so using a four-sided shape as the base for building a truss would be a terrible choice.
168480	173200	An easy way to stabilize this configuration is to add a diagonal bracing member to split
173200	179680	it into triangles. We can start with our triangle and build it out to form a structure.
180480	184960	There are a lot of different ways to build a truss, but there are some particularly popular
184960	190720	truss designs that you will see again and again, and so they are referred to by specific names.
190720	196080	The one shown here is a Fink Roof Truss, but there are many more as you can see here.
202080	206960	Later on in this video, I'll cover how these different designs carry loads in different ways.
208240	212080	The members of these trusses are all located in the same plane.
212080	216720	These are called planar trusses, and we can analyze them as two-dimensional structures.
217360	223200	Even seemingly three-dimensional structures can often be analyzed as planar trusses.
224160	226000	Take a look at this bridge, for example.
229760	234560	The loads are transmitted from the horizontal floor beams to the two vertical trusses on each
234560	239840	side of the bridge. Each of these trusses only carries loads acting in its plane,
239840	242640	and so we can analyze it as a two-dimensional structure.
243600	248480	To be able to design or analyze a truss, we need to be able to determine the force in
248480	252880	each of its members. This allows us to check that the member can carry the loads without
252880	257680	failing, or gives us the information we need to select the best cross-section for each of the
257680	264000	members. There are two main methods we can use to do this, the method of joints and the method of
264000	269520	sections. Let's look at the method of joints first, using the Fink Roof Truss we saw earlier.
269760	276320	The method is really simple. First, you draw a free-body diagram, showing all of the external
276320	281760	loads acting on the truss, and you use the three equilibrium equations to calculate the reaction
281760	288720	forces. Then, you draw a free-body diagram for every single joint, and work through them one by
288720	295120	one to solve the unknown forces acting at each joint. You solve the unknown forces using the
295120	300400	equilibrium equations. Since all of the joints are pinned connections, there are no moments,
300400	304800	and so you only need to consider equilibrium of the horizontal and vertical forces.
306320	312160	Remember that we are calculating the forces acting at each joint, not the forces in the member.
312160	317200	If a member is in tension, the internal forces will be acting to make the member longer.
317200	322480	For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which means that a member in tension
322480	328400	will be exerting a force on the joint which is acting away from the joint. For members in compression,
328400	330640	the force will be acting towards the joint.
336720	339760	Let's work through an example for a slightly simpler truss.
341360	346240	First, let's draw the free-body diagram and determine the reaction forces using our three
346240	352400	equilibrium equations. Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, the horizontal force at
352400	357200	joint A must be equal to zero, because it is the only force in the horizontal direction.
358240	363760	Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces, the reaction forces at joints A and E must
363760	369600	sum up to 20 kilonewtons. Both joints are located at the same distance from joint C,
369600	374720	so taking equilibrium of the moments acting about joint C, we can calculate that they both
374720	381200	equal 10 kilonewtons. Now let's determine the forces acting on each joint.
381200	385600	Since we don't know yet which members are in tension and which are in compression,
385600	390320	it's easiest to just assume that all of the members are in tension, and so we'll draw the
390320	396320	internal forces as pointing away from each joint. If we end up with negative values for these forces,
396320	400000	it just means that we guessed wrong, and the member is actually in compression.
400960	404240	Now we can work through each of the joints, starting with joint A.
408960	413360	Analyzing trusses involves a lot of resolving forces to different angles,
413360	417600	so if you want to be good at it, you're going to need to remember your trigonometry.
417600	418720	Here's a quick reminder.
427520	432720	Back to our joint. All we have to do is apply the equilibrium equations
432720	438400	to determine the unknown forces at joint A. Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces,
438400	444640	the 10 kilonewton reaction force must balance the vertical component of the force FAB,
444640	451360	and so we can calculate FAB as negative 10 divided by sine of the angle of 60 degrees.
452400	458160	Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, we get that the force FAC must balance the
458160	464080	horizontal component of the force FAB, and so is equal to 5.8 kilonewtons.
464960	468160	That's all of the forces acting on joint A calculated.
469200	474080	The force in each member is constant, and so we now also know the forces acting on
474080	478960	the joints at the other ends of these two members. We can repeat the process for joint B.
481600	485120	We can start by considering equilibrium of the vertical forces,
485120	488000	which allows us to calculate the force FBC.
490720	496000	And then we can consider equilibrium of the horizontal forces to calculate FBD.
504240	511600	We then need to work through all of the remaining joints, but we can save a bit of time by noticing
511600	516640	that the truss and the applied loads have an axis of symmetry, and so the forces on the other side
516640	522640	of the truss must be identical. That gives us all of the forces at the joints. We can show which
522640	529920	members are in tension and which are in compression, like this. One thing you'll notice as you analyze
529920	535520	trusses is that some members don't carry any loads at all. We call these zero force members.
536240	539920	There are two main configurations where we have zero force members.
541040	546000	The first is where we have three members connected at a single joint, and two of the members are
546000	552320	aligned. Here, only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so to maintain
552320	557760	equilibrium of forces at the joint in the vertical direction, the force in this member must be zero.
559920	567040	The second configuration is when we have only two members connected at a joint, and the members are
567040	572880	not aligned. Only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so both must be zero
572880	578720	force members. By the way, this is true regardless of how the members are oriented, because we can
578720	583440	rotate the orientation of the coordinate system we are using to apply the equilibrium equations.
584240	590240	These two configurations only contain zero force members if there are no external loads acting at
590240	596160	the joints. If we have external loads, there will be components in the vertical direction, and so
596160	603360	these will not be zero force members. Let's look at an example. At this joint here, we have two
603360	609360	connected members. The members are not collinear, and there are no external loads, so they must be
610240	618640	zero force members. And at this joint, we have three members, of which two are collinear. The
618640	624800	vertical member must be a zero force member. We can remove these members, and so have a much
624800	629920	easier starting point for solving the truss. You'll notice that we haven't removed the two members
629920	635680	at this joint. That is because there is an external load acting here, and so these can't be zero
635680	642080	force members. You might be wondering why anyone would bother including zero force members in a
642080	648480	truss if they carry no loads. They are definitely not useless. They are usually included to provide
648480	653040	stability. For example, to prevent buckling of long members, which are under compression,
653600	658160	or they may be used to make sure that unexpected loads won't cause the structure to fail.
660800	665440	We've covered the method of joints. Let's look at the other method we can use to solve trusses.
665680	672320	Which is the method of sections. The first step is the same as the method of joints. We draw the
672320	677360	free body diagram, and use the equilibrium equations to solve the reaction forces.
680240	684160	Next, we make an imaginary cut through the members of interest in our truss,
684160	686720	and we draw the internal forces in the cut members.
687440	693040	The internal and external forces must be in equilibrium, and so we can apply the equilibrium
693040	699200	equations to solve the internal forces. When choosing how to cut your truss, remember that we
699200	704880	only have three equilibrium equations. If you cut through too many members, you will have too many
704880	711200	unknowns and not enough equations. You can choose which side of the cut you want to assess. The left
711440	718400	side looks easier to solve because there are less forces, but we could have chosen to solve the right
718400	726240	side instead. The method of sections is best used when you have a truss which has a lot of members,
726240	731440	but you are only interested in the loading in a few specific members. Let's look at an example.
732960	736320	We need to determine the internal forces in these three members.
737040	741840	First, let's draw the free body diagram and apply the equilibrium equations to calculate
741840	748000	the reaction forces. The horizontal reaction force at joint A is the only force acting in
748000	754880	the horizontal direction, so it must be equal to zero. By considering equilibrium of forces in
754880	760400	the vertical direction and equilibrium of the moments acting about joint A, we can figure out
760400	768240	that FA is equal to 19 and FH is equal to 21. Next, let's make our imaginary cut through
768240	776000	members FD, FE, and GE and draw the internal forces. Like we did earlier for the method of joints,
776000	782240	we will assume that all unknown forces are tensile. Next, we just need to apply the equilibrium
782240	787920	equations. The force in member FE is the only unknown force with a component in the vertical
787920	794080	direction, so that's a good place to start. The diagonal members are all at 45 degree angles,
794080	799520	so by considering equilibrium in the vertical direction, we get that the force in member FE
799520	806720	is equal to 12.7 kN. Now let's consider equilibrium of moments acting about joint F.
806720	811840	This is a good joint to choose because three of the five forces in this free body diagram
811840	818240	have a line of action passing through F, and so only the force in member GE and the 21 kN
818240	824800	reaction force generate a moment about this joint. Both forces are located at a distance of two meters
824800	832320	from F, and so we can conclude that the force in member GE is equal to 21 kN. Finally, we can
832320	838000	take equilibrium in the horizontal direction to calculate that the force in member FD is equal
838080	844320	to negative 30 kN, and that's it. We've calculated the internal forces in the three members we were
844320	851280	interested in. One member is in compression, and two are in tension. If it is possible to determine
851280	856240	the reaction forces and the internal forces in the members of a truss by applying the equilibrium
856240	862560	equations, the truss is said to be statically determinant. Real-life structures sometimes
862560	867440	contain more members than are needed for the structure to be stable, as this makes them safer.
867440	871840	This means we may not be able to apply the method of joints or the method of sections,
871840	875680	because we have too many unknowns and not enough equilibrium equations,
875680	881120	either to determine the reaction forces or to determine the internal forces within the truss.
881120	886720	These trusses are said to be statically indeterminate, and would need to be solved using other methods
886720	891200	like the force method or the displacement method, which I won't get into in this video.
891760	900000	Now that we know how to calculate the loads in a truss, let's explore some of the differences
900000	905920	between truss designs. Here we have three different bridge trusses, the Howe, Pratt,
905920	911920	and Warren trusses. These trusses were all patented in the 1840s, at a time when new bridge
911920	916560	designs were being developed to accommodate the expansion of the railroad industry. They were
916560	922160	typically constructed from a combination of wood and iron. We can learn a lot about truss design
922160	926880	by figuring out which members are in tension and which are in compression. Let's start with the
926880	932400	Howe truss. We can see that its vertical members are in tension, and its diagonal members are in
932400	937440	compression. Members in compression usually need to be thicker than members in tension,
937440	942640	to reduce the risk of buckling. This means that the Howe truss isn't very cost effective,
942640	946320	since the diagonal members, which need to be thicker, are quite long.
946960	952000	The Pratt truss addresses this issue. Its vertical members are mostly in compression,
952000	957120	and its inner diagonal members are in tension. This is more cost effective than the Howe truss,
957120	962320	since the longer diagonal members can be thinner. Longer members are also more susceptible to
962320	967600	buckling under compressive loading than shorter ones. So it's a good idea for long members to
967600	974160	be in tension. The design of the Warren truss was based on equilateral triangles. The fact that
974160	978640	all of the members are the same length is an advantage for construction, and it uses less
978640	984640	members overall than the Howe and Pratt trusses. So it is more efficient. The diagonal members
984640	989680	alternate between tension and compression, so it does have some quite long members in compression.
991440	996400	It can also be interesting to observe how the loading in members changes as a load moves across
996400	1002000	a bridge. In this simplified model of a load moving across the Pratt bridge, we can see that some
1002000	1006720	members alternate between tension and compression, and so will need to be designed accordingly.
1009280	1012960	The three-dimensional bridge we looked at earlier could be assessed as a collection
1012960	1018160	of planar trusses, but this won't be possible for all structures, and sometimes a truss will
1018160	1023680	need to be assessed in three dimensions. This type of truss is called a space truss.
1024480	1028240	These can be analyzed in essentially the same way as planar trusses,
1028240	1032480	using the method of joints and the method of sections. The only difference will be in the
1032480	1036800	number of equilibrium equations. We will have six equations instead of three,
1037680	1040800	and at each joint we will have three equations instead of two.
1046480	1053520	That's it for now. Thanks for watching, and, as always, please remember to subscribe.
