00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Trusses are everywhere. They are used in bridges, antenna towers, cranes,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.080
even in parts of the International Space Station.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.800
And for good reason. They allow us to create strong structures,

00:20.800 --> 00:24.080
while using materials in a very efficient and cost-effective way.

00:25.040 --> 00:33.840
So what exactly is a truss? It is essentially a rigid structure made up of a collection

00:33.840 --> 00:39.280
of straight members, but that's not a complete definition. There are two important assumptions

00:39.280 --> 00:45.200
we need to be able to make for a structure to be considered as a truss. First, we need to be able

00:45.200 --> 00:50.160
to assume that all of the joints in the structure can be represented by a pinned connection,

00:50.160 --> 00:53.040
meaning that members are free to rotate at the joints.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.520
The members of a truss are often rigidly connected using what is known as a gusset plate.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.120
But if the center lines of all the members at a joint intersect at the same point,

01:05.120 --> 01:10.000
like they do here, it's reasonable to assume that the joint behaves like a pinned connection.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.760
The second assumption we need to be able to make is that loads are only ever applied at the joints

01:15.760 --> 01:20.240
of the truss. We never have loads acting in the middle of a member, for example.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.240
Because all joints are pinned, the members cannot carry bending moments.

01:26.240 --> 01:33.040
They can only carry axial loads. This simplifies the analysis of a truss significantly. Each

01:33.040 --> 01:38.560
member has to be in equilibrium, so the forces acting at each end of a member must be equal

01:38.560 --> 01:42.640
and opposite. Each member is either in tension or in compression.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.640
These assumptions are what differentiate a truss from a frame.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.360
Unlike trusses, frames don't necessarily have pinned joints,

01:57.360 --> 02:03.600
and so members can carry bending moments. A frame can also have loads applied directly to its members.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.880
The base shape of a truss is three members connected to form a triangle.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.280
If a load is applied, the angles of the triangle won't be able to change if the length of each

02:21.280 --> 02:26.960
of the members stays the same. This means that the triangle is a very stable shape which won't

02:26.960 --> 02:32.320
deform when loads are applied to it, and so it is a great base from which to build a larger structure.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.680
Joining four members together does not form a stable structure.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.080
The angles between members can change without any change in the length of the members,

02:42.080 --> 02:46.880
and so using a four-sided shape as the base for building a truss would be a terrible choice.

02:48.480 --> 02:53.200
An easy way to stabilize this configuration is to add a diagonal bracing member to split

02:53.200 --> 02:59.680
it into triangles. We can start with our triangle and build it out to form a structure.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.960
There are a lot of different ways to build a truss, but there are some particularly popular

03:04.960 --> 03:10.720
truss designs that you will see again and again, and so they are referred to by specific names.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.080
The one shown here is a Fink Roof Truss, but there are many more as you can see here.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.960
Later on in this video, I'll cover how these different designs carry loads in different ways.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.080
The members of these trusses are all located in the same plane.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.720
These are called planar trusses, and we can analyze them as two-dimensional structures.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.200
Even seemingly three-dimensional structures can often be analyzed as planar trusses.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.000
Take a look at this bridge, for example.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.560
The loads are transmitted from the horizontal floor beams to the two vertical trusses on each

03:54.560 --> 03:59.840
side of the bridge. Each of these trusses only carries loads acting in its plane,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.640
and so we can analyze it as a two-dimensional structure.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.480
To be able to design or analyze a truss, we need to be able to determine the force in

04:08.480 --> 04:12.880
each of its members. This allows us to check that the member can carry the loads without

04:12.880 --> 04:17.680
failing, or gives us the information we need to select the best cross-section for each of the

04:17.680 --> 04:24.000
members. There are two main methods we can use to do this, the method of joints and the method of

04:24.000 --> 04:29.520
sections. Let's look at the method of joints first, using the Fink Roof Truss we saw earlier.

04:29.760 --> 04:36.320
The method is really simple. First, you draw a free-body diagram, showing all of the external

04:36.320 --> 04:41.760
loads acting on the truss, and you use the three equilibrium equations to calculate the reaction

04:41.760 --> 04:48.720
forces. Then, you draw a free-body diagram for every single joint, and work through them one by

04:48.720 --> 04:55.120
one to solve the unknown forces acting at each joint. You solve the unknown forces using the

04:55.120 --> 05:00.400
equilibrium equations. Since all of the joints are pinned connections, there are no moments,

05:00.400 --> 05:04.800
and so you only need to consider equilibrium of the horizontal and vertical forces.

05:06.320 --> 05:12.160
Remember that we are calculating the forces acting at each joint, not the forces in the member.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.200
If a member is in tension, the internal forces will be acting to make the member longer.

05:17.200 --> 05:22.480
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which means that a member in tension

05:22.480 --> 05:28.400
will be exerting a force on the joint which is acting away from the joint. For members in compression,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.640
the force will be acting towards the joint.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.760
Let's work through an example for a slightly simpler truss.

05:41.360 --> 05:46.240
First, let's draw the free-body diagram and determine the reaction forces using our three

05:46.240 --> 05:52.400
equilibrium equations. Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, the horizontal force at

05:52.400 --> 05:57.200
joint A must be equal to zero, because it is the only force in the horizontal direction.

05:58.240 --> 06:03.760
Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces, the reaction forces at joints A and E must

06:03.760 --> 06:09.600
sum up to 20 kilonewtons. Both joints are located at the same distance from joint C,

06:09.600 --> 06:14.720
so taking equilibrium of the moments acting about joint C, we can calculate that they both

06:14.720 --> 06:21.200
equal 10 kilonewtons. Now let's determine the forces acting on each joint.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.600
Since we don't know yet which members are in tension and which are in compression,

06:25.600 --> 06:30.320
it's easiest to just assume that all of the members are in tension, and so we'll draw the

06:30.320 --> 06:36.320
internal forces as pointing away from each joint. If we end up with negative values for these forces,

06:36.320 --> 06:40.000
it just means that we guessed wrong, and the member is actually in compression.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.240
Now we can work through each of the joints, starting with joint A.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.360
Analyzing trusses involves a lot of resolving forces to different angles,

06:53.360 --> 06:57.600
so if you want to be good at it, you're going to need to remember your trigonometry.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.720
Here's a quick reminder.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.720
Back to our joint. All we have to do is apply the equilibrium equations

07:12.720 --> 07:18.400
to determine the unknown forces at joint A. Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces,

07:18.400 --> 07:24.640
the 10 kilonewton reaction force must balance the vertical component of the force FAB,

07:24.640 --> 07:31.360
and so we can calculate FAB as negative 10 divided by sine of the angle of 60 degrees.

07:32.400 --> 07:38.160
Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, we get that the force FAC must balance the

07:38.160 --> 07:44.080
horizontal component of the force FAB, and so is equal to 5.8 kilonewtons.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.160
That's all of the forces acting on joint A calculated.

07:49.200 --> 07:54.080
The force in each member is constant, and so we now also know the forces acting on

07:54.080 --> 07:58.960
the joints at the other ends of these two members. We can repeat the process for joint B.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.120
We can start by considering equilibrium of the vertical forces,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.000
which allows us to calculate the force FBC.

08:10.720 --> 08:16.000
And then we can consider equilibrium of the horizontal forces to calculate FBD.

08:24.240 --> 08:31.600
We then need to work through all of the remaining joints, but we can save a bit of time by noticing

08:31.600 --> 08:36.640
that the truss and the applied loads have an axis of symmetry, and so the forces on the other side

08:36.640 --> 08:42.640
of the truss must be identical. That gives us all of the forces at the joints. We can show which

08:42.640 --> 08:49.920
members are in tension and which are in compression, like this. One thing you'll notice as you analyze

08:49.920 --> 08:55.520
trusses is that some members don't carry any loads at all. We call these zero force members.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.920
There are two main configurations where we have zero force members.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.000
The first is where we have three members connected at a single joint, and two of the members are

09:06.000 --> 09:12.320
aligned. Here, only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so to maintain

09:12.320 --> 09:17.760
equilibrium of forces at the joint in the vertical direction, the force in this member must be zero.

09:19.920 --> 09:27.040
The second configuration is when we have only two members connected at a joint, and the members are

09:27.040 --> 09:32.880
not aligned. Only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so both must be zero

09:32.880 --> 09:38.720
force members. By the way, this is true regardless of how the members are oriented, because we can

09:38.720 --> 09:43.440
rotate the orientation of the coordinate system we are using to apply the equilibrium equations.

09:44.240 --> 09:50.240
These two configurations only contain zero force members if there are no external loads acting at

09:50.240 --> 09:56.160
the joints. If we have external loads, there will be components in the vertical direction, and so

09:56.160 --> 10:03.360
these will not be zero force members. Let's look at an example. At this joint here, we have two

10:03.360 --> 10:09.360
connected members. The members are not collinear, and there are no external loads, so they must be

10:10.240 --> 10:18.640
zero force members. And at this joint, we have three members, of which two are collinear. The

10:18.640 --> 10:24.800
vertical member must be a zero force member. We can remove these members, and so have a much

10:24.800 --> 10:29.920
easier starting point for solving the truss. You'll notice that we haven't removed the two members

10:29.920 --> 10:35.680
at this joint. That is because there is an external load acting here, and so these can't be zero

10:35.680 --> 10:42.080
force members. You might be wondering why anyone would bother including zero force members in a

10:42.080 --> 10:48.480
truss if they carry no loads. They are definitely not useless. They are usually included to provide

10:48.480 --> 10:53.040
stability. For example, to prevent buckling of long members, which are under compression,

10:53.600 --> 10:58.160
or they may be used to make sure that unexpected loads won't cause the structure to fail.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.440
We've covered the method of joints. Let's look at the other method we can use to solve trusses.

11:05.680 --> 11:12.320
Which is the method of sections. The first step is the same as the method of joints. We draw the

11:12.320 --> 11:17.360
free body diagram, and use the equilibrium equations to solve the reaction forces.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.160
Next, we make an imaginary cut through the members of interest in our truss,

11:24.160 --> 11:26.720
and we draw the internal forces in the cut members.

11:27.440 --> 11:33.040
The internal and external forces must be in equilibrium, and so we can apply the equilibrium

11:33.040 --> 11:39.200
equations to solve the internal forces. When choosing how to cut your truss, remember that we

11:39.200 --> 11:44.880
only have three equilibrium equations. If you cut through too many members, you will have too many

11:44.880 --> 11:51.200
unknowns and not enough equations. You can choose which side of the cut you want to assess. The left

11:51.440 --> 11:58.400
side looks easier to solve because there are less forces, but we could have chosen to solve the right

11:58.400 --> 12:06.240
side instead. The method of sections is best used when you have a truss which has a lot of members,

12:06.240 --> 12:11.440
but you are only interested in the loading in a few specific members. Let's look at an example.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.320
We need to determine the internal forces in these three members.

12:17.040 --> 12:21.840
First, let's draw the free body diagram and apply the equilibrium equations to calculate

12:21.840 --> 12:28.000
the reaction forces. The horizontal reaction force at joint A is the only force acting in

12:28.000 --> 12:34.880
the horizontal direction, so it must be equal to zero. By considering equilibrium of forces in

12:34.880 --> 12:40.400
the vertical direction and equilibrium of the moments acting about joint A, we can figure out

12:40.400 --> 12:48.240
that FA is equal to 19 and FH is equal to 21. Next, let's make our imaginary cut through

12:48.240 --> 12:56.000
members FD, FE, and GE and draw the internal forces. Like we did earlier for the method of joints,

12:56.000 --> 13:02.240
we will assume that all unknown forces are tensile. Next, we just need to apply the equilibrium

13:02.240 --> 13:07.920
equations. The force in member FE is the only unknown force with a component in the vertical

13:07.920 --> 13:14.080
direction, so that's a good place to start. The diagonal members are all at 45 degree angles,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.520
so by considering equilibrium in the vertical direction, we get that the force in member FE

13:19.520 --> 13:26.720
is equal to 12.7 kN. Now let's consider equilibrium of moments acting about joint F.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.840
This is a good joint to choose because three of the five forces in this free body diagram

13:31.840 --> 13:38.240
have a line of action passing through F, and so only the force in member GE and the 21 kN

13:38.240 --> 13:44.800
reaction force generate a moment about this joint. Both forces are located at a distance of two meters

13:44.800 --> 13:52.320
from F, and so we can conclude that the force in member GE is equal to 21 kN. Finally, we can

13:52.320 --> 13:58.000
take equilibrium in the horizontal direction to calculate that the force in member FD is equal

13:58.080 --> 14:04.320
to negative 30 kN, and that's it. We've calculated the internal forces in the three members we were

14:04.320 --> 14:11.280
interested in. One member is in compression, and two are in tension. If it is possible to determine

14:11.280 --> 14:16.240
the reaction forces and the internal forces in the members of a truss by applying the equilibrium

14:16.240 --> 14:22.560
equations, the truss is said to be statically determinant. Real-life structures sometimes

14:22.560 --> 14:27.440
contain more members than are needed for the structure to be stable, as this makes them safer.

14:27.440 --> 14:31.840
This means we may not be able to apply the method of joints or the method of sections,

14:31.840 --> 14:35.680
because we have too many unknowns and not enough equilibrium equations,

14:35.680 --> 14:41.120
either to determine the reaction forces or to determine the internal forces within the truss.

14:41.120 --> 14:46.720
These trusses are said to be statically indeterminate, and would need to be solved using other methods

14:46.720 --> 14:51.200
like the force method or the displacement method, which I won't get into in this video.

14:51.760 --> 15:00.000
Now that we know how to calculate the loads in a truss, let's explore some of the differences

15:00.000 --> 15:05.920
between truss designs. Here we have three different bridge trusses, the Howe, Pratt,

15:05.920 --> 15:11.920
and Warren trusses. These trusses were all patented in the 1840s, at a time when new bridge

15:11.920 --> 15:16.560
designs were being developed to accommodate the expansion of the railroad industry. They were

15:16.560 --> 15:22.160
typically constructed from a combination of wood and iron. We can learn a lot about truss design

15:22.160 --> 15:26.880
by figuring out which members are in tension and which are in compression. Let's start with the

15:26.880 --> 15:32.400
Howe truss. We can see that its vertical members are in tension, and its diagonal members are in

15:32.400 --> 15:37.440
compression. Members in compression usually need to be thicker than members in tension,

15:37.440 --> 15:42.640
to reduce the risk of buckling. This means that the Howe truss isn't very cost effective,

15:42.640 --> 15:46.320
since the diagonal members, which need to be thicker, are quite long.

15:46.960 --> 15:52.000
The Pratt truss addresses this issue. Its vertical members are mostly in compression,

15:52.000 --> 15:57.120
and its inner diagonal members are in tension. This is more cost effective than the Howe truss,

15:57.120 --> 16:02.320
since the longer diagonal members can be thinner. Longer members are also more susceptible to

16:02.320 --> 16:07.600
buckling under compressive loading than shorter ones. So it's a good idea for long members to

16:07.600 --> 16:14.160
be in tension. The design of the Warren truss was based on equilateral triangles. The fact that

16:14.160 --> 16:18.640
all of the members are the same length is an advantage for construction, and it uses less

16:18.640 --> 16:24.640
members overall than the Howe and Pratt trusses. So it is more efficient. The diagonal members

16:24.640 --> 16:29.680
alternate between tension and compression, so it does have some quite long members in compression.

16:31.440 --> 16:36.400
It can also be interesting to observe how the loading in members changes as a load moves across

16:36.400 --> 16:42.000
a bridge. In this simplified model of a load moving across the Pratt bridge, we can see that some

16:42.000 --> 16:46.720
members alternate between tension and compression, and so will need to be designed accordingly.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.960
The three-dimensional bridge we looked at earlier could be assessed as a collection

16:52.960 --> 16:58.160
of planar trusses, but this won't be possible for all structures, and sometimes a truss will

16:58.160 --> 17:03.680
need to be assessed in three dimensions. This type of truss is called a space truss.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.240
These can be analyzed in essentially the same way as planar trusses,

17:08.240 --> 17:12.480
using the method of joints and the method of sections. The only difference will be in the

17:12.480 --> 17:16.800
number of equilibrium equations. We will have six equations instead of three,

17:17.680 --> 17:20.800
and at each joint we will have three equations instead of two.

17:26.480 --> 17:33.520
That's it for now. Thanks for watching, and, as always, please remember to subscribe.
