1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Trusses are everywhere. They are used in bridges, antenna towers, cranes,

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,080
even in parts of the International Space Station.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
And for good reason. They allow us to create strong structures,

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
while using materials in a very efficient and cost-effective way.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,840
So what exactly is a truss? It is essentially a rigid structure made up of a collection

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,280
of straight members, but that's not a complete definition. There are two important assumptions

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,200
we need to be able to make for a structure to be considered as a truss. First, we need to be able

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,160
to assume that all of the joints in the structure can be represented by a pinned connection,

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,040
meaning that members are free to rotate at the joints.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,520
The members of a truss are often rigidly connected using what is known as a gusset plate.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,120
But if the center lines of all the members at a joint intersect at the same point,

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,000
like they do here, it's reasonable to assume that the joint behaves like a pinned connection.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,760
The second assumption we need to be able to make is that loads are only ever applied at the joints

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,240
of the truss. We never have loads acting in the middle of a member, for example.

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
Because all joints are pinned, the members cannot carry bending moments.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,040
They can only carry axial loads. This simplifies the analysis of a truss significantly. Each

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
member has to be in equilibrium, so the forces acting at each end of a member must be equal

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
and opposite. Each member is either in tension or in compression.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,640
These assumptions are what differentiate a truss from a frame.

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
Unlike trusses, frames don't necessarily have pinned joints,

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,600
and so members can carry bending moments. A frame can also have loads applied directly to its members.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,880
The base shape of a truss is three members connected to form a triangle.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
If a load is applied, the angles of the triangle won't be able to change if the length of each

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,960
of the members stays the same. This means that the triangle is a very stable shape which won't

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,320
deform when loads are applied to it, and so it is a great base from which to build a larger structure.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
Joining four members together does not form a stable structure.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
The angles between members can change without any change in the length of the members,

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,880
and so using a four-sided shape as the base for building a truss would be a terrible choice.

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,200
An easy way to stabilize this configuration is to add a diagonal bracing member to split

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,680
it into triangles. We can start with our triangle and build it out to form a structure.

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,960
There are a lot of different ways to build a truss, but there are some particularly popular

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,720
truss designs that you will see again and again, and so they are referred to by specific names.

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,080
The one shown here is a Fink Roof Truss, but there are many more as you can see here.

34
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,960
Later on in this video, I'll cover how these different designs carry loads in different ways.

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,080
The members of these trusses are all located in the same plane.

36
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
These are called planar trusses, and we can analyze them as two-dimensional structures.

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,200
Even seemingly three-dimensional structures can often be analyzed as planar trusses.

38
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Take a look at this bridge, for example.

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,560
The loads are transmitted from the horizontal floor beams to the two vertical trusses on each

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
side of the bridge. Each of these trusses only carries loads acting in its plane,

41
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
and so we can analyze it as a two-dimensional structure.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,480
To be able to design or analyze a truss, we need to be able to determine the force in

43
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,880
each of its members. This allows us to check that the member can carry the loads without

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,680
failing, or gives us the information we need to select the best cross-section for each of the

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,000
members. There are two main methods we can use to do this, the method of joints and the method of

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
sections. Let's look at the method of joints first, using the Fink Roof Truss we saw earlier.

47
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,320
The method is really simple. First, you draw a free-body diagram, showing all of the external

48
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,760
loads acting on the truss, and you use the three equilibrium equations to calculate the reaction

49
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,720
forces. Then, you draw a free-body diagram for every single joint, and work through them one by

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,120
one to solve the unknown forces acting at each joint. You solve the unknown forces using the

51
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,400
equilibrium equations. Since all of the joints are pinned connections, there are no moments,

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,800
and so you only need to consider equilibrium of the horizontal and vertical forces.

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Remember that we are calculating the forces acting at each joint, not the forces in the member.

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,200
If a member is in tension, the internal forces will be acting to make the member longer.

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,480
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, which means that a member in tension

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,400
will be exerting a force on the joint which is acting away from the joint. For members in compression,

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,640
the force will be acting towards the joint.

58
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,760
Let's work through an example for a slightly simpler truss.

59
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
First, let's draw the free-body diagram and determine the reaction forces using our three

60
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,400
equilibrium equations. Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, the horizontal force at

61
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,200
joint A must be equal to zero, because it is the only force in the horizontal direction.

62
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces, the reaction forces at joints A and E must

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,600
sum up to 20 kilonewtons. Both joints are located at the same distance from joint C,

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,720
so taking equilibrium of the moments acting about joint C, we can calculate that they both

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,200
equal 10 kilonewtons. Now let's determine the forces acting on each joint.

66
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Since we don't know yet which members are in tension and which are in compression,

67
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,320
it's easiest to just assume that all of the members are in tension, and so we'll draw the

68
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,320
internal forces as pointing away from each joint. If we end up with negative values for these forces,

69
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,000
it just means that we guessed wrong, and the member is actually in compression.

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240
Now we can work through each of the joints, starting with joint A.

71
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Analyzing trusses involves a lot of resolving forces to different angles,

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,600
so if you want to be good at it, you're going to need to remember your trigonometry.

73
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Here's a quick reminder.

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Back to our joint. All we have to do is apply the equilibrium equations

75
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,400
to determine the unknown forces at joint A. Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces,

76
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,640
the 10 kilonewton reaction force must balance the vertical component of the force FAB,

77
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,360
and so we can calculate FAB as negative 10 divided by sine of the angle of 60 degrees.

78
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,160
Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces, we get that the force FAC must balance the

79
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,080
horizontal component of the force FAB, and so is equal to 5.8 kilonewtons.

80
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
That's all of the forces acting on joint A calculated.

81
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,080
The force in each member is constant, and so we now also know the forces acting on

82
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,960
the joints at the other ends of these two members. We can repeat the process for joint B.

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,120
We can start by considering equilibrium of the vertical forces,

84
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
which allows us to calculate the force FBC.

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,000
And then we can consider equilibrium of the horizontal forces to calculate FBD.

86
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,600
We then need to work through all of the remaining joints, but we can save a bit of time by noticing

87
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,640
that the truss and the applied loads have an axis of symmetry, and so the forces on the other side

88
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,640
of the truss must be identical. That gives us all of the forces at the joints. We can show which

89
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,920
members are in tension and which are in compression, like this. One thing you'll notice as you analyze

90
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,520
trusses is that some members don't carry any loads at all. We call these zero force members.

91
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
There are two main configurations where we have zero force members.

92
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,000
The first is where we have three members connected at a single joint, and two of the members are

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,320
aligned. Here, only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so to maintain

94
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,760
equilibrium of forces at the joint in the vertical direction, the force in this member must be zero.

95
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,040
The second configuration is when we have only two members connected at a joint, and the members are

96
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,880
not aligned. Only one member has a component in the vertical direction, and so both must be zero

97
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,720
force members. By the way, this is true regardless of how the members are oriented, because we can

98
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
rotate the orientation of the coordinate system we are using to apply the equilibrium equations.

99
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,240
These two configurations only contain zero force members if there are no external loads acting at

100
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,160
the joints. If we have external loads, there will be components in the vertical direction, and so

101
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,360
these will not be zero force members. Let's look at an example. At this joint here, we have two

102
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
connected members. The members are not collinear, and there are no external loads, so they must be

103
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:18,640
zero force members. And at this joint, we have three members, of which two are collinear. The

104
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,800
vertical member must be a zero force member. We can remove these members, and so have a much

105
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
easier starting point for solving the truss. You'll notice that we haven't removed the two members

106
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,680
at this joint. That is because there is an external load acting here, and so these can't be zero

107
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,080
force members. You might be wondering why anyone would bother including zero force members in a

108
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,480
truss if they carry no loads. They are definitely not useless. They are usually included to provide

109
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,040
stability. For example, to prevent buckling of long members, which are under compression,

110
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,160
or they may be used to make sure that unexpected loads won't cause the structure to fail.

111
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,440
We've covered the method of joints. Let's look at the other method we can use to solve trusses.

112
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,320
Which is the method of sections. The first step is the same as the method of joints. We draw the

113
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
free body diagram, and use the equilibrium equations to solve the reaction forces.

114
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,160
Next, we make an imaginary cut through the members of interest in our truss,

115
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,720
and we draw the internal forces in the cut members.

116
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,040
The internal and external forces must be in equilibrium, and so we can apply the equilibrium

117
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,200
equations to solve the internal forces. When choosing how to cut your truss, remember that we

118
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,880
only have three equilibrium equations. If you cut through too many members, you will have too many

119
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,200
unknowns and not enough equations. You can choose which side of the cut you want to assess. The left

120
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,400
side looks easier to solve because there are less forces, but we could have chosen to solve the right

121
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,240
side instead. The method of sections is best used when you have a truss which has a lot of members,

122
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,440
but you are only interested in the loading in a few specific members. Let's look at an example.

123
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,320
We need to determine the internal forces in these three members.

124
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,840
First, let's draw the free body diagram and apply the equilibrium equations to calculate

125
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,000
the reaction forces. The horizontal reaction force at joint A is the only force acting in

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,880
the horizontal direction, so it must be equal to zero. By considering equilibrium of forces in

127
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,400
the vertical direction and equilibrium of the moments acting about joint A, we can figure out

128
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:48,240
that FA is equal to 19 and FH is equal to 21. Next, let's make our imaginary cut through

129
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,000
members FD, FE, and GE and draw the internal forces. Like we did earlier for the method of joints,

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,240
we will assume that all unknown forces are tensile. Next, we just need to apply the equilibrium

131
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,920
equations. The force in member FE is the only unknown force with a component in the vertical

132
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,080
direction, so that's a good place to start. The diagonal members are all at 45 degree angles,

133
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,520
so by considering equilibrium in the vertical direction, we get that the force in member FE

134
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,720
is equal to 12.7 kN. Now let's consider equilibrium of moments acting about joint F.

135
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,840
This is a good joint to choose because three of the five forces in this free body diagram

136
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,240
have a line of action passing through F, and so only the force in member GE and the 21 kN

137
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,800
reaction force generate a moment about this joint. Both forces are located at a distance of two meters

138
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,320
from F, and so we can conclude that the force in member GE is equal to 21 kN. Finally, we can

139
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,000
take equilibrium in the horizontal direction to calculate that the force in member FD is equal

140
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,320
to negative 30 kN, and that's it. We've calculated the internal forces in the three members we were

141
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,280
interested in. One member is in compression, and two are in tension. If it is possible to determine

142
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,240
the reaction forces and the internal forces in the members of a truss by applying the equilibrium

143
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,560
equations, the truss is said to be statically determinant. Real-life structures sometimes

144
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
contain more members than are needed for the structure to be stable, as this makes them safer.

145
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,840
This means we may not be able to apply the method of joints or the method of sections,

146
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,680
because we have too many unknowns and not enough equilibrium equations,

147
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,120
either to determine the reaction forces or to determine the internal forces within the truss.

148
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,720
These trusses are said to be statically indeterminate, and would need to be solved using other methods

149
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,200
like the force method or the displacement method, which I won't get into in this video.

150
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,000
Now that we know how to calculate the loads in a truss, let's explore some of the differences

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,920
between truss designs. Here we have three different bridge trusses, the Howe, Pratt,

152
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,920
and Warren trusses. These trusses were all patented in the 1840s, at a time when new bridge

153
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
designs were being developed to accommodate the expansion of the railroad industry. They were

154
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,160
typically constructed from a combination of wood and iron. We can learn a lot about truss design

155
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,880
by figuring out which members are in tension and which are in compression. Let's start with the

156
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,400
Howe truss. We can see that its vertical members are in tension, and its diagonal members are in

157
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,440
compression. Members in compression usually need to be thicker than members in tension,

158
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,640
to reduce the risk of buckling. This means that the Howe truss isn't very cost effective,

159
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,320
since the diagonal members, which need to be thicker, are quite long.

160
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,000
The Pratt truss addresses this issue. Its vertical members are mostly in compression,

161
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,120
and its inner diagonal members are in tension. This is more cost effective than the Howe truss,

162
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
since the longer diagonal members can be thinner. Longer members are also more susceptible to

163
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,600
buckling under compressive loading than shorter ones. So it's a good idea for long members to

164
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,160
be in tension. The design of the Warren truss was based on equilateral triangles. The fact that

165
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,640
all of the members are the same length is an advantage for construction, and it uses less

166
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,640
members overall than the Howe and Pratt trusses. So it is more efficient. The diagonal members

167
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,680
alternate between tension and compression, so it does have some quite long members in compression.

168
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,400
It can also be interesting to observe how the loading in members changes as a load moves across

169
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,000
a bridge. In this simplified model of a load moving across the Pratt bridge, we can see that some

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,720
members alternate between tension and compression, and so will need to be designed accordingly.

171
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,960
The three-dimensional bridge we looked at earlier could be assessed as a collection

172
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,160
of planar trusses, but this won't be possible for all structures, and sometimes a truss will

173
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,680
need to be assessed in three dimensions. This type of truss is called a space truss.

174
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,240
These can be analyzed in essentially the same way as planar trusses,

175
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,480
using the method of joints and the method of sections. The only difference will be in the

176
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,800
number of equilibrium equations. We will have six equations instead of three,

177
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
and at each joint we will have three equations instead of two.

178
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,520
That's it for now. Thanks for watching, and, as always, please remember to subscribe.
