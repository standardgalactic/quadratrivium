00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,760
Welcome to the future you guys happy Friday I'm super pumped up today because

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,320
we have people on the show you know contain myself so all you guys that are tuning in you are in

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,560
for a real treat I want to tell you a couple things I know about people right off the front here

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,320
he's from Wisconsin but now he's currently resides in Charleston South Carolina he produces VJ clips

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,040
for concerts and I want to talk to him about that I also found out he's a family man he's got two

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,600
kids and he's been doing every day's every day for 10 years some of you guys know him as people

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
but we now know him as Mike Winkleman and he's going to be on the show doing the math before

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,200
10 years an image a day through 365 days a year that equates to more than 3650 images it's so big I

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,680
can't even contain it in one slide bananas guys so what we know is he's super consistent and this

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
is daunting because I just started a challenge myself so hard to do I looked up consistent what

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,200
does that mean unchanging in nature standard or effect over time he's also super prolific and

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,480
that means producing in large quantities or with great frequency highly productive I'm not sure he

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,200
would use those words to describe himself but as an outside observer that's all I can tell you

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,360
this is how I see it now if you're not familiar with his work you got to get to know this man

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,280
he's producing work all over the place and it's very easy to find check this out now many of us

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,680
would be thrilled to be able to produce maybe four five six twelve of these kinds of images

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,080
but he's this is just two of 3650 images that he's producing a day here's some other images that

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,400
he's produced incredible now I've noticed some themes we're going to get into this with him

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,920
about why he chooses certain compositions certain color palates and most oftentimes he'll put a

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
person in this in the frame too so I want to talk to him about that check out this amazing artwork

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Greg and Caleb what do you guys think about this beautiful it's stunning I don't know how you

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,680
do this every day well we're gonna find out shortly it's pretty cool and we'll make him

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,920
uncomfortable by flattering him a little bit he's got that midwestern modesty thing going so you

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,760
know we'll turn it up a little bit but gosh look at these images and for me the hardest thing was

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,680
like which image do I put together to encapsulate the volume the prodigious volume of work that

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,120
he's been able to produce super cool how do you even get the ideas on how to produce this day in

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,360
and day out I'm stuck on day seven of a 30-day challenge right now so this is incredible but

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,440
these these images aren't just static he's moving cameras he's animating there's there's walk cycles

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,760
that we've seen check this stuff out and the original music to these things are pretty aggro and

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,640
let's see let's try to close the music up okay I know that's a little weird

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,240
wow

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
this one feels more appropriate

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,320
pretty kind of music

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,320
I love this one Greg

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:00,320
all right you guys we're gonna keep this real we're gonna keep this raw Erica please roll the titles

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,800
all right Mike welcome to the show and before we have you say anything I just want to warn everybody

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,880
there's going to be explicit language on the show today Mike he's got a foul mouth what can we say

38
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,760
what can we say and we want him to be himself so you have sensitive ears or you're easily kind of

39
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
insulted by these kinds of things you could tune out right now but you're gonna be missing

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
something incredible and I just want to let you guys know we'll be monitoring your questions on

41
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,480
Facebook and on YouTube Greg and Caleb will be doing that they're joining us in the in the podcast

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,280
or the broadcast today there they are boom you guys look great today you guys oh shucks

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,160
you guys get dressed up for people I feel like you did no whatever Greg that was a little short

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,440
there Greg all right Mike how you doing man good good how are you I'm good now we understand

45
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
you're at home and you have two little ones running around possibly so if they jump into the scene

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,600
let's just celebrate the whole fact that you're a family man you're doing this thing I guess the way

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,520
I want to kick this off the bat is um how do you find time in the day to do these personal projects

48
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,960
like how are you how's it you can even do this um I mean I get that question a lot but I don't

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,200
think there's any like magical answer to it I think it's just one of those things that if you get

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,040
into the habit of it you'll keep doing it and it's just something that you have to on some level

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,800
just sort of like commit to doing at some point and then I think I've gotten lucky that the momentum

52
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,320
of doing it so long just makes it completely feel like it's not like a choice at all like it's just

53
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,240
something I have to do most days I do not want to do it I'd rather like like today it's definitely

54
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
not convenient and I just took a trip it was definitely not convenient any of the days I was

55
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,880
on that trip so I think it's just something that you just kind of um you know once you if you're

56
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
lucky enough to be able to get into you know sort of uh routine and have some momentum with it they

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,120
kind of carry you forward with it was there a point in in the in the cycle of doing this where

58
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,040
you felt like yeah I can do this now and I can get through that like when you run a marathon when

59
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,160
you hit the wall but you break through and you know you're gonna be able to finish um not really to

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:37,840
be honest I think it was something that uh I just started doing um and I'd seen another artist who

61
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,360
did every day is Tom Judd um and he did drawings a day and that was how I started um and I just

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,760
kind of started and then it just kind of like kept going there was no point where it was like

63
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,680
any sort of like epiphany of like oh man I could do this forever and I don't know if I will do it

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,200
forever I'm just saying like it just kind of kept going I did not expect it to like keep going this

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,320
long so on the days that you don't feel like doing it or there's a lot of stuff going on how

66
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,880
do you find the motivation to to just set aside what you're doing and get something done um that's

67
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,000
again where it's sort of like motivation doesn't really like factor into it because it's sort of

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,200
like there's never something that's so important that it's like I'm gonna break this you know 11

69
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,720
year streak yeah because it's like I don't feel like it I want to watch fucking Game of Thrones or

70
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,960
whatever like there's no it's it would have to be a real real good excuse and I mean at this point

71
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,240
it wouldn't really be an excuse it would be like something like physically stops me from like doing

72
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,280
it and which case or I haven't planned ahead and something like that um or just some like stupid

73
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,920
shit because the other thing is it has to be done by midnight and there's times when I've gotten very

74
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,880
close to midnight and if I go over by midnight I will be very very pissed at myself like beyond

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,680
pissed at myself so and it'll happen eventually but it hasn't happened do you start stressing out

76
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,880
when it's like 11 50 p.m yeah well I mean by 11 50 p.m yeah I'm definitely like fucking

77
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,920
attention focused and there's been times where it's gone to 11 50 p.m like I'm fucking

78
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,480
left I get pixel fucking whatever it's done with this like it's gone to 11 50 p.m and the power

79
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,640
is going to go out or something and I'm going to be really really fucking pissed yeah all right well

80
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,800
Greg is a person who did like a mythical monday for for a whole year I'm sure you can relate is

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,960
there something that you want to ask people I mean I I don't know if relate is even comes close to

82
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,240
imagine the anxiety you feel like mythical monday oh so okay it was a it was an animated gift

83
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
project that I did and um this sounds it's not like such a weiner comparing it to your

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,080
everyday's but I made one animated gift a week for a year nice and that like stressed me out like

85
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:18,080
crazy and my my thing was yeah I had to go live um at midnight on on sunday right because it's monday

86
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
so sure enough I would always wait until like 11 50 and I'd just be like oh damn it what am I going

87
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,640
to do no sorry what were you saying no that's that's that's the story

88
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,040
really I know that's one thing a lot of people like ask me like well why don't you just do like

89
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
one thing like a week like a longer thing but if I was doing that I would just wait till the last

90
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,680
second I wouldn't work on yeah oh it's definitely I would definitely work far less I guarantee that

91
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,080
if I was just doing one thing like a week so I think a lot of designers and creative people can

92
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,480
relate to this part which is I think we need the pressure to make something like no pressure no

93
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,800
diamonds right my wife is always wondering why are you waiting two days before you have to get on

94
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,520
an airplane to write your talk I like I can't produce under any other circumstance it doesn't

95
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,040
the urgency isn't there the fire the the need to make something isn't there so you know I think

96
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
there's a whole bunch of people already loving you somebody's like oh no no swearing please like I

97
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,560
think sarcastically and and somebody's like people for president in all caps and they're loving your

98
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,600
accent too so like play it up man just play it up yeah I guess a lot of people the Wisconsin

99
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,160
thing I don't really it doesn't feel like an accent to me but we can hear it though it's lovely I like

100
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,320
it can hear it everybody else can all right um Caleb do you have a question for him or Erica

101
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,520
yeah uh what what is the most time that you've spent on a single daily before oh that's a good

102
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:56,160
question um there's been times uh I usually try and spend a little more time on the like um

103
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,560
May 1st which is like a anniversary date each year and um and the end of the year

104
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,520
and the beginning of the year so on the 31st and the first I try and spend more time on those

105
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,160
and there's other times where if I have like not often but there's times where I have like an idea

106
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,400
like oh this could be cool if I do you know x y z but it's like a lot to do and I just so happen to

107
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,480
have a bunch of time usually if it's like the weekend um there's been times where I've spent

108
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,160
like probably like 10 hours on one oh my goodness yeah there's definitely been times there's times

109
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,680
where it's like I'll sit down at four o'clock on the weekends and it'll be like I'm just gonna like

110
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,480
spend you know just a little bit of time then we're gonna watch a movie and we'll watch a movie in a

111
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,240
little bit and then I'll fucking spend like eight hours and like go home or something do you find

112
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,400
that there's any correlation between the amount of time you spend on something and the quality or

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:12:01,920
your satisfaction of the work uh there's a small correlation sometimes there's a correlation there's

114
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,080
times where it's like I'll put in a bunch of time and I'll be like oh that's like decent or like

115
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,440
sucks a little less than the other ones but there's also many times where I'll put in a

116
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,040
shit ton of work and I'm like this fucking blows like that was a goddamn waste of time like or

117
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,960
there's times where I'll do something super quick and it'll just like I'll get lucky and I'll be like

118
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,720
oh fuck it's done and you know uh half hour or something like that so uh that does not happen

119
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
very often but well you're you're a living testament to this idea this experiment that was run I think

120
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
it was in a book called the fear of art that my business coach had me had me read many many years

121
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,000
ago I mean it they they took a hundred artists they split them in half they told 50 artists in a month

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,400
produce as many pieces as you can don't worry about quality or anything and then they set them off on

123
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,280
their way and the other group of 50 artists that make a masterpiece just make one piece that you

124
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,920
think is going to be amazing and the results were quite surprising not to you but maybe to some of

125
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,720
our audience in that the group who was who were directed to just create one masterpiece many of

126
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,640
them didn't produce anything and and there were higher and better quality pieces of work from the

127
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,880
group who were just told just to make stuff all day long and so that that is the testament to

128
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,520
this whole fear of art thing and you've been able to do that wonderfully and and I think you're a

129
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,840
role model for everybody who's just holding on to that precious idea of perfection that your

130
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,840
deadline of midnight like you got to get it done and you got to release it into the world

131
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:39,040
yeah I don't know I mean that's the thing the that that experiment is interesting but it's

132
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,160
kind of subjective I mean there's definitely people who I see who spend a shit ton of time

133
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,360
on one image and it turns out fucking awesome and it's something that I could look at for like

134
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,360
an insane amount of time because it's got so much detail and it's just fucking framed perfectly and

135
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,880
the color and composition everything so I do think that art in general is a bit of a numbers

136
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,520
game in terms of just if you're putting out more stuff you know there's found a like hit because

137
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,560
I think there's a lot of luck to it I think there's a lot of like you know you just get lucky

138
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,560
times and if you're putting out more stuff there's a lot better chance that you're gonna get lucky

139
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,360
and something might sort of click. Pedro is saying Beeple is the Bill Gates of every day

140
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,240
and he does look a little like Bill Gates right now. There's a lot of people who said I look like

141
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,520
Bill Gates there was a picture that Zed posted with me next to Zed and he's got you know millions

142
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,080
of followers on Instagram or whatever and all the fucking comments Bill Gates Bill Gates Bill Gates

143
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,080
you just need a sweater man get a nice sweater with a collar and you're set

144
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,080
but again you're good to pull up a side by side of Bill Gates.

145
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
All right so I have to ask another question as you've been doing this for so long

146
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,560
are you a super organized person do you have all your assets like just super just there it is

147
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,920
everything I want is there come on lie to me lie to me. The people I used to work with well

148
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,960
don't remember this I have on my desktop a crud folder that is like kind of a spill all of like

149
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,320
just general bullshit so no I'm definitely not organized anybody who's like yeah I'm not organized.

150
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,080
So do you find that you spent a lot of your time just digging through your assets like oh I need

151
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,800
that building or that water tower or whatever it is that you're looking for or that that model or

152
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,960
that tree I mean how are you even combing through your stuff. So in terms of that stuff I am I really

153
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,960
didn't start building a like database of stuff because before I hit 10 years like a year ago

154
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,160
I had tried to like model most things because when I started out I didn't know 3D at all I wanted

155
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,120
to learn to model and so I started out I would model everything in the scene every single thing

156
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,400
and over the course of 10 years it kind of slowly I would introduce more and more things where it's

157
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,400
like okay I don't really want to model a tree it doesn't really make sense I'm just going to use a

158
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,120
tree model but then when I hit 10 years I kind of sort of completely took the sort of limitation

159
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,320
off myself and I'll use models from anything now because I want to focus on color and composition

160
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,840
and just like more narrative things and I don't really want to like model a fucking little crate

161
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,400
or whatever. Right. So I just really started building a like true library of assets a year ago

162
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,680
and I would say that is fairly organized actually that I can quickly like pull things in but in

163
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,600
terms of like my things like where to save something or where to like you know directory

164
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,480
structures it's definitely like a bit of a claustrophobic. It's just one giant folder with 3000

165
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,240
images or models. It's not that disorganized but it definitely be more organized I will say not.

166
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,800
So I'm curious because I think I I'm not saying this from my point of view but for people who

167
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,440
are watching or saying well isn't that like cheating like don't you need to make everything

168
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,280
yourself look why have you come to the realization that maybe it's more about the art and the

169
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,360
composition of the idea that you're you want to share with the world versus actually building

170
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,680
every screw and that bolt that's in the scene. Sure I think it's you could consider it cheating

171
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,080
and if your goal is to make everything from scratch then yes this would be like cheating but if

172
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,920
that's not your goal then it's not cheating that's not my goal. So to me I think I would rather use

173
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,240
all the tools available. I think clients are demanding more and more and if you're holding

174
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,560
your back holding yourself back from using things especially on client projects like clients do not

175
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,640
give a fuck how you built it like who wastes all day modeling something they're gonna be like what

176
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,480
the fuck did you do why didn't you buy that from TurboSquid or Adobe stock or Adobe stock.

177
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,160
Why didn't you just buy that you know instead of wasting all day fucking modeling and texturing

178
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,760
and all this shit. So I think it's it's definitely something that it depends on what your goal is.

179
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,640
My goal is not to recreate the wheel if I can you know use something that I can get for you know

180
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,880
much cheaper than I could make it. I mean the most expensive models are only a couple thousand

181
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,040
dollars and that's something that would like take you like months to like make. So it almost never

182
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,000
unless you need something custom it almost never makes sense to like make it yourself. Now

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,520
something really stuff wise or weird or whatever then obviously you have to make it or you need a

184
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,960
certain topology or this or that but if you just need a fucking tree don't model that fucking tree

185
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,440
download a goddamn tree like that. Definitely for client work don't fucking model that tree.

186
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
Now we're going to get into client work how you make money how you make a living and

187
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,040
your whole financial empire if you will in a second but I do want to share a little story

188
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,280
with you and maybe some other people can relate to this because when I was getting started in

189
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,000
motion design I was painting style frames right using Photoshop and doing photocomping photo

190
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
mashing things together but what I was doing was I was creating all my own assets like if there

191
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,040
was something I needed I would run out and shoot it with a camera because I thought the rules were

192
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,680
you had to make everything in your frame and then I go and meet one of my clients and there's a

193
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,080
designer there his name is Ron Padua and Ron is showing me his set of storyboards instead of doing

194
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,640
one set of boards he has seven complete boards with ideas and I was sitting there scratching my

195
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,280
head thinking how is that you are able to create so much in the same amount of time and I just

196
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,040
barely got my first idea out and he's dude I just went in and I grabbed frames from anywhere

197
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,240
and everywhere and I cut things up I just want to get the idea out and if we were to be awarded the

198
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,800
job we'd actually have to hire an art director a production designer we'd have to do casting

199
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,640
and lighting and all this kind of stuff I'm not really worried about that and that was a giant

200
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,920
shift for me I remember getting into my car driving home thinking what a cheating little bastard

201
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,360
like that mother you know how could he do that and I'm sitting here and then I started to think

202
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,400
like what is my hang up with this at the end of the day I want to win the work and I want to

203
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,120
be able to tell stories and I want to learn how to be a director that's what mattered to me the most

204
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,800
so I'm just kind of jumping in on what you're saying there yeah I think it's I think these

205
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,960
tools like I'm interested in using the most advanced tools available like I want to use the

206
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
most advanced render I want to use the most advanced plugins because I want to be able to do

207
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,880
like things as quick as possible and get my ideas out there as quick as possible so to me I see like

208
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,640
using stock things is just an extension of that it's another tool like a plugin or like the new

209
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,440
version of octane or something like that that it's like why wouldn't I use that right it's available

210
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,480
to me it's like it's available to everyone so I think it's it's one of those things that it's

211
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
just another tool for me okay since we're on the subject of tools and I think there are a

212
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,560
bunch of people wondering what tools you are using can you give us a breakdown of the tools that

213
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:16,560
using the software um most of the stuff I use is cinema 4d and then um octane I've been using

214
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,600
some redshift lately um but mostly mostly octane still um and then just like after effects and

215
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,560
owner shop okay okay cool I noticed when you were talking about turbo squid and then you

216
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,200
mentioned oh I'm sorry adobe great adobe stock are you sponsored by adobe or something

217
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:48,800
yeah

218
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,120
no can do right hey uh yeah adobe are you listening we we use adobe stock or is that what it's called

219
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,240
stock loving it love adobe stock number one adobe stock right now hashtag adobe stock you guys

220
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
all right we gotta pay the bills I get it I get it we need some adobe love ourselves so we'll get

221
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,240
into that a little bit later so those are the tools hey Greg and Caleb any questions from the

222
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,280
internet that you guys want to throw at people yeah yeah there's a couple from youtube so um

223
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,040
gustav asks on average how long does it take to make one of these every day uh I would say on

224
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,240
average it's probably like two hours two hours okay how much work I have that day in terms of like

225
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,120
client work and how much uh ambition I have or if I have an idea that's like oh this could be like

226
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,960
decent or it could be interesting to explore then I might spend more time or if I don't have

227
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,520
you know that much time than I've spent last time but I would say that average and to to follow that

228
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,440
up like in my mind one of the scariest things is just a blank canvas right so where do where do you

229
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,560
even start like do you have a sketchbook full of crazy ideas that you you know pluck things from

230
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,840
and use every day or what you know you're staring at the screen what happens draw at all so I don't

231
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:14,480
sketch um I usually will go on like um like Pinterest or I've got like a Pinterest board of like

232
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,520
everyday sort of general ideas um it's not like I've got it like okay Tuesday I'm doing this Wednesday

233
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,800
I got this blah blah blah it's definitely just kind of like what sort of like can get me at all

234
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,360
sort of motivated to just kind of uh just start uh and sometimes it's something very small it's just

235
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,880
like a general shape or a color scheme or a camera angle or something like that um but I find if I have

236
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,160
some sort of like nudge in a certain direction it will turn out better than just like literally

237
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,800
opening up Cinema 40 with no ideas then it will usually kind of uh just turn into more of like a

238
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,960
super abstract pile of crap that I've like done a million times it's not like the other days it's

239
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:08,320
like insane the original every day but it seems to be uh a little easier if I have some nudge in

240
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,720
a direction right yeah some sort of theme or something to build on yeah do you wait for that

241
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,240
nudge to happen before you sit down and do your every day I wait to a certain extent but I usually

242
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,760
don't I don't have the luxury of just like I'm just gonna wait till I'm inspired because I have like

243
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,280
it's like okay I've got like an hour and a half to do this so I can sit there and

244
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,080
dick around for five minutes but it's like I can't sit here and wait for an hour till the

245
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,680
magical muse comes down and you know kisses my forehead I gotta just fucking sit down and put

246
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:50,480
some shit out so uh I try to like you know get an idea but sometimes it's just kind of like

247
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,160
okay fuck this I gotta go right right okay I think everybody that watches our channel knows

248
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,680
that we don't just talk about creative things you're a super creative guy but we talk about

249
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,400
business stuff too and we were having a conversation before we went live about this very thing so I

250
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,080
got a lot of questions for you and I and if you feel like I'm throwing a question at you that you

251
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,120
don't want to answer uh because that that whole midwestern modesty thing I get it we'll cover it

252
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
up we won't have to talk about it and we'll we'll just say pass okay so I'm gonna throw some things

253
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,440
at you I asked Aaron Draplin this question on the podcast and I want to ask you it's like

254
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,720
where does your money come from like you sell you do freelance work I know that you sell prints and

255
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,280
tell us how what does the financial empire look like from percentages like where does it all come

256
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,880
from the buckets almost entirely freelance um the prince is not very much it's maybe

257
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,800
10% of the money if less than 10% of the money actually far less than 10% of the money that I

258
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,280
make is from France it's definitely almost entirely freelance work do you speak a lot do you get

259
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,320
invited to speak and are you paid to speak um so that's a good question um I have done some

260
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,120
speaking gigs in the last couple years um I've kind of started to do more of them just because

261
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,840
it's I found it's uh you know just a fun way to like meet people and just like because I work from

262
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,160
home to like get out in like I don't know any I would just move to Charleston yeah like six

263
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,160
eight months ago and I don't know anybody here uh so and I just like honestly don't have a ton of

264
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,520
time to like hang out with people on like a day-to-day basis um so you know going to these events I

265
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,800
find is like really great for connecting with people um so yeah I've started to do those more I

266
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,320
haven't gotten paid for any of them so I don't know I should be asking for money for these you

267
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
should be thinking about that question for you yeah we'll talk about that I'll help you I mean I

268
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,240
think not not that you're asking for my help or anything but I I think I'm I'm one of those weirdos

269
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,760
where I think I enjoyed math and the idea of running a business as much as I enjoyed doing the creative

270
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,560
aspect some some weird hybrid right I'm just smashing those two worlds together I honestly

271
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,560
enjoyed like the money aspect of it as well uh that's what drew me to like you're looking at your

272
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,560
stuff or you know the the content you guys are putting out is because I think you know like

273
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,720
you're saying a lot of people don't like talking about that or are scared to talk about it whereas

274
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,000
to me that's interesting because it's like that's all these projects happen like if you see like a

275
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,960
big movie or some shit like that like that didn't fucking just come out of nowhere like somebody had

276
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,400
to pay for that like and if it doesn't make money it's not gonna happen again so it's like to me I

277
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,640
find that interesting because it's what facilitates a lot of what we do mm-hmm well we we kind of

278
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,880
actually bumped into it but you you make some money via sponsorship right yeah I there is a

279
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,040
couple things that I've done um that are like sponsorships through um Adobe and then I just

280
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:06,400
did a thing with Wix um uh with the new website that I have um and I just went and spoke at Wix

281
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:14,720
actually last week uh so yeah there's been a few things like that just more recently mm-hmm okay

282
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,040
and what percentage of that does that represent your financial empire still small they're small

283
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,920
still yeah it's definitely still mostly just freelance okay and can can I ask that like are

284
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,680
you the uh the sole breadwinner for the family is your wife work yeah my wife stays home she was a

285
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,520
school teacher uh and when we had our first kids we got two kids two and four and um as soon as we

286
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,880
had kids she stays stable mm-hmm and do you ever feel like potentially that that's a lot of pressure

287
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,440
to put on you in terms of like being able to rely on a freelance income that you don't have much of

288
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,320
in terms of passive income set up so if something like if you were to get sick or hit get hit by a

289
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,480
bus and like oh my god uh now what are your what is your wife and your kids going to do um not

290
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:11,200
really because to be honest I was very fortunate enough to have a dad who was a fucking super tight

291
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,960
ass and he very much instilled in us and this again is maybe you know the midwest thing of saving

292
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,440
money yeah so very much since uh I started working I'm 36 um I was definitely saving at least 10%

293
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:37,200
of my money the 10% oh good for you and another 401k and then you know I got thrown to side effects

294
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,080
you know yeah my dad does that too but he only did that because he's an accountant and that's how he

295
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,720
do no my dad was not an accountant he was just he was just tight as shit with money and he was

296
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,560
very much so you don't talk to us about investing and you know buying stocks so that's actually

297
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,600
probably the thing I'm more most interested in and I I don't honestly get a chance to talk about it

298
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,800
with any other designers is like stocks and investing um is another thing that I'm like

299
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:16,240
really interested in so um yeah if something happened and I got you know whatever that we've

300
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,640
got some money that would be fine that's good that's great to hear that's fantastic like you're

301
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,400
you're a responsible adult father and a husband I like that I'm a responsible adult but do you

302
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:34,320
have life insurance I do not have life insurance that might be something you consider yeah we'd be

303
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:42,320
fine you don't want to give anybody incentive to like knock off the old man huh no no my uh

304
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,720
yeah it's just I don't have life insurance but um we've got enough money saved that we'd be fine

305
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,200
very good okay well you know I was thinking about this because I noticed when I was downloading

306
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,880
your clips off Vimeo you're like these clips you can download for free these vj clips I was thinking

307
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,480
okay that's super cool we'll be able to use these and I don't have to go through some weird

308
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,840
way to download the videos just for the presentation of your work but I was thinking why aren't you

309
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,720
charging for these vj clips these are awesome they're fantastic yeah to be honest I don't

310
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,160
there's sites where you can buy vj clips yeah um but like adobe stock

311
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,080
to be honest I don't think that revenue model

312
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,000
to me has never been that appealing for one I don't really like trying to like sell stuff

313
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,920
I don't really like I already kind of feel like I'm spamming people with just the like work that

314
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm putting out uh just the like every day so like being like buy this thing blah blah blah blah

315
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,840
like I don't know I just I don't like that like a lot of people don't even know that I sell prints

316
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,840
like people are constantly I'll see comments were like oh you got so pretty since like I've been

317
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,920
fucking my selling prints for years like but because I just don't like I'll usually send out one

318
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,880
like tweet per year right before black friday or whatever right like I've got prints other than

319
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,080
that I like pretty much never like sell things so that's one part of it too I feel like vj clips

320
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,000
in general is something where um like if you're a vj I think you need a lot of clips and so

321
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,600
they're kind of like devalued in a sense like on these sites they're really like they don't

322
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:52,400
do not sell for much so I it would I don't know that personally um at least for me that I think

323
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:00,560
it makes more sense as a marketing tool than a direct sales tool if that makes sense yeah

324
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:06,000
because to be honest how I got you know I don't I don't honestly I've never had a demo reel

325
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,480
if you go to my site now you will see none of the like commercial work that I've done

326
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,760
so everything that I've gotten has been from the personal work that I've done

327
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,280
so I look at that as one just shit I want to do and I just happen to be lucky enough that

328
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:28,560
that is like something that brings in you know freelance okay all right well if you ever change

329
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,840
your mind I know the internet's gonna hate me for this but we could probably talk about how you can

330
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,440
maybe put your images together and put it into a book and launch a Kickstarter campaign and sell

331
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,800
art prints right definitely thought about doing it selling a book um like there's a lot of these

332
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,880
things where it's just like there's not enough like day hours in the day to like you know try and

333
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,200
put this together and monetize this and blah blah blah so I think it's you know I'm not opposed to

334
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,680
making money like you can just fucking make money for this shit that I've already done I'm

335
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:09,120
certainly fine with that um um but yeah I think it's just been kind of a swamp with the day-to-day

336
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,160
kind of stuff that hasn't pushed me to sort of like like specifically put a book together

337
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
do you ever record or film your process in those two hours that you're cranking out a

338
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,560
personal piece oh that's another thing that I should be doing you should easy content for you

339
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,800
that's a layup oh I know I definitely should I definitely to be honest thought of like

340
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,400
different like patreon models I have a couple like I have an idea for one model and I'm not

341
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,280
gonna say it here but I think would be like a really like nobody's doing it and I think it would be uh

342
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,960
I don't know there I I again it just comes down to like hours in the fucking day and like

343
00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:00,160
yeah all right uh Greg and Caleb Erica you guys have any questions for people yeah um so how's

344
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,520
how's your location impacted oh good one your work uh have you been able to get enough freelance work

345
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:13,840
to support yourself or have you ever had to have an additional job so I actually had a full-time job

346
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:21,520
up until uh less than four years ago um I worked when I I went to school for computer science and

347
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,920
like halfway through it was like you know fuck this this is boring as hell uh and so I started

348
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,320
doing design shit and then when I got out of school I got a job doing web design and um so I

349
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:40,000
had a long stretch and well the job was super super easy and I was able to do like a shit like most

350
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,560
of the freelance that I did was at work I would be working on like work for her M&M or like you know

351
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:58,080
fucking uh a bunch of different like big artists and uh like people would come over and just I kind

352
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,880
of like hide the logos on kind of like this sort of time they're like what do you work on it's like

353
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:16,160
this is just nothing I don't know so when I quit my job um I was actually making more money about

354
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,720
50% more money doing freelance than the actual day job so I was fairly like I had a good like

355
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,200
kind of ramp up there in terms of like freelance and to be honest like freelance was never something

356
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,280
that I like uh kind of like sought out to do like it was never really like a goal like I want to

357
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,480
like eventually like do freelance I really liked being in an office and the people that I like

358
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,600
worked with were like really good friends so it was like and I actually asked the like place that

359
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,800
I worked was like is there any way I could still like come in here and just like do my own thing

360
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,960
in the corner and they're like no because they were like a software company it was all like

361
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,280
programmers just like what the fuck are you talking about no you can't do that you quit like so anyway

362
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:07,120
so like I uh and this was back in Wisconsin like all the clients that I worked for were like LA

363
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:13,600
New York wherever like none of them were in Wisconsin so um yeah I think I've been lucky enough

364
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:21,840
that there's always kind of been enough work coming in and it the location never made a difference

365
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:31,600
like I've never gone into a place to work um so yeah well you know you could find the a

366
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,840
co-working space these things exist and you could be around the human beings there was one in

367
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Appleton where I lived because I was in a small town and it was kind of gross to be honest like I

368
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,880
went and looked at it and it was kind of like this is kind of nasty a little bit uh and there is one

369
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,920
in Charleston I just haven't gone there part of the reason is um like I need a lot of like

370
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,040
rendering power so I can work off a laptop but it's really like kind of tying my hands behind

371
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:12,640
my back to like go sit and work off the laptop uh so that's one reason that I kind of don't love it

372
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,120
I say it's not as established in smaller towns as like we don't have like we works and shit like

373
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,760
or what we work yeah we work very well yeah we don't have those like here like I'm not like

374
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,320
downtown Charleston I'm like way the fuck out in the like suburbs where it's like super cheap like

375
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,280
yeah because that's where you're keeping all the money well that's another honestly that's

376
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,760
another thing that I don't think people like recognize is like these big cities are so fucking

377
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:51,520
expensive like I you know it's just like like people are like why don't you like move to LA and

378
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,880
it's like I will never move to LA as much as this was back when I was living in Wisconsin

379
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,400
as much as you would never move to Wisconsin that's how much I'll never wait let's get into this

380
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,920
discussion a little bit here now let's not assume I would never move to Wisconsin I know it's cold

381
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,760
there sometimes you wouldn't fucking move to where I live why wouldn't you move to LA

382
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,200
because it's just too expensive it's just way too expensive I just like the the you know

383
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,680
buddies that I have there and I love I like LA the fucking weather is beautiful it's like

384
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,320
never fucking rains like what there's tons of jobs like I I totally get the draw right

385
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,960
there's a lot going on there's tons of work there's tons of cool shit like weather's beautiful

386
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,520
everybody's beautiful like

387
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,680
it's paradise but it comes at a fucking price it does come at a price like to me like you know I

388
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,320
want to have a yard the kids can run around and I can have a you know office and shit and we can

389
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,720
not feel like we're like crammed in you know this and that like when I the amount that you know

390
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,520
I got buddies that are paying for apartments it's just like oh my god gotta be fucking kidding me

391
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:21,200
never okay okay hold on but if you were uh you landed some big sponsorship deals if you

392
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
had printed this book that everybody's saying here like I take my money shut up and take my money

393
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
already and somebody's like I'll put it together and then I will buy it from you after I work on it

394
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
so there's that if you actually taped or recorded your screen while you're working in and grew your

395
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,080
YouTube channel I'm sure there's a lot of people who would get in on it because I was thinking I

396
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,400
forget the guy's name I want to say his name is Dean but I'm not sure but he's an ultra marathon

397
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,680
runner like he runs marathon like night after night I see you as that guy there's there's only a few

398
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,720
human beings who could do the things that you do so consistently for so long maybe it's going to be a

399
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,000
Guinness world record at some point but there's going to be people who are going to want to get

400
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,640
behind and support you maybe red bull wants to support you you know because you're just jamming

401
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,440
dude or an energizer as the as a battery company or Duracell you know if you can hook those up I'll

402
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,760
hook it up you got my fucking email address all right we will talk after this check look check it

403
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,560
out my LA agent it's going to call your Wisconsin agent or your Charleston agent all right we're

404
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,480
going to get this to happen so it's been an interesting thing so I have a couple other

405
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,360
questions because I hear this a lot I hear this from our community so much do you think your

406
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:42,080
clients care where you live um my clients specifically yeah no they don't it's never so here the other

407
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:51,120
thing is I don't like um taking on new clients to be honest I like working with people that uh there's

408
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:58,640
no drama that it's like um just going to be some like chill thing where it's not like this like

409
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,440
you know I don't want to work with assholes where it turns into this big

410
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,320
you know the fucking bullshit and the clients you know last second expectations like no I don't

411
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,080
want to work I don't want that shit like I would rather work on something boring than with like

412
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:22,800
people cool people who are like chill like some crazy fucking you know prestigious thing and the

413
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,640
people are assholes and it's super stressful I don't want that like bullshit stress um so I don't

414
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,760
really take on like a huge amount of like new clients um so the people that I've worked with I've

415
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,280
worked with for years super good friends with and you know I'd rather like work with a company that

416
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,960
you know I've worked with uh over a long period of time and like all the companies that I work with

417
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,760
that I have like existing relationships with they don't give a shit like where I live

418
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,200
so there's a lot of people it's not something that's ever like it's never like oh you know are you

419
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,360
going to move to LA it's like they know I'm not moving to LA so it's it's not even on the like

420
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,120
radar I guess well you had mentioned this before that you don't even have a demo reel that you

421
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,200
go to your site it's like this is your personal work you don't put up your commercial work so

422
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,960
most of the people I assume that are finding you are finding you through one of your many social

423
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,200
media outlets and you're just blown away by the work that you do the spam that you put out there

424
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,520
as you call it that's the most artful spam I've ever seen that doesn't ask you for anything it

425
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,480
doesn't want your money your spam is I'll give you this stuff for free that's incredible spam so

426
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,960
they're onboarded and the reason why I want to make a point of this is because there are people

427
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,120
from all over the world that watch our channel and our show and they think oh I need to be in

428
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,520
New York or LA or I need to be in Germany or London or wherever it is and the truth of matter is

429
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,400
it is you don't and and that's a cop out I think it's because if you were people and you lived in

430
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,720
Cairo you could pull this off if you were people and you lived in some remote part of town which

431
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,880
actually you do live in a remote part of town you could still pull this off and it's you have to

432
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,800
start looking inward and saying are you making something that's valuable that's inspiring are you

433
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,440
consistently out there and been and somewhat vulnerable by putting this stuff out there

434
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,280
and that's the problem that a lot of people in our creative community have which is

435
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
they they want to get it perfect and so a year goes by two years go by and the site hasn't

436
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,680
launched and the the reel wasn't finished or that personal project was never done and I say this

437
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,640
from experience we've suffered from this too you know we hang on to this be honest like I think

438
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,160
well thank that it's like I'm this you know I just do whatever I've set my mind to and it's like

439
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,840
no I'm like really like strong like I've been working on a short film and I like fucking

440
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,600
struggled if I should have worked on it this morning and I fucking didn't so I there's I think

441
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,800
that every day's are kind of its own little sort of like bubble like I totally get that like oh

442
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,760
fuck I should have done XYZ and I didn't do it because of motivation to be honest and I also

443
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,440
kind of like get the whole like I want to move to like LA or New York or whatever I'm not like

444
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,880
trying to like say that that's like dumb um I think it's I think there's something to be said like

445
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,040
those places have a lot of opportunities and there's a lot of companies where they do want

446
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,920
you to come in and to be honest if you are somebody who is like starting out uh like

447
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,920
right out of school or something like that I would recommend that you do not go freelance

448
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,320
right away that you go to one of those companies because I think you're gonna learn a lot more

449
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:30,560
I never got that I think I uh took the long way the long path um but I think there's so much to

450
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,600
learn being around people who like no more it's like no no no click on this this morning I just

451
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,040
struggled with something for like fucking hours that I guarantee somebody like a senior level

452
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,360
person who knows this program or been like just click this and it's like I don't have that person

453
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:52,000
here so I recommend that young people go to like a good studio and like work there for a couple

454
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
years before you like do freelance that's what I would good advice I don't know if you know

455
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,880
Joshua Davis but he's saying oh hi there handsome I'm assuming he's not talking about me you must

456
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,360
be talking about you yeah you guys those of you guys that know Mike personally go ahead and give

457
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,680
him a hard time in the chat right now uh bring up some embarrassing stories things that he would

458
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,320
rather sooner forget and we'll discuss that live on air right now please do us a favor

459
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,800
Greg Caleb look out for those comments right now let's get those stories in there the time you

460
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,880
got drunk and did something stupid um Brenda is asking has your wife ever been like this everyday

461
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:37,920
thing it's enough now no not remotely my my um family is like insanely supportive and they have

462
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,560
been from day one but now even more so like my mom will be like it's time to do it like we're just

463
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,840
sitting around shooting the shit and it's like nine o'clock it's like don't you have to do your

464
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:56,960
everyday like they're insanely insanely like supportive because they've seen what's come from

465
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,080
it and they've seen they know how important it is to me they know how you know serious I take uh

466
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,280
you know the project as a whole I think it's it's this tough sort of mix between like taking uh

467
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,520
the entire thing like super fucking serious that you're gonna commit to putting in like hours a day

468
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,640
but not taking each sort of day so serious that it paralyzes you from like putting out work

469
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:32,000
that it's like that's soft tomorrow's another day yeah so this weird kind of like balance between

470
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,800
those two things um but no my wife is insanely insanely supportive um and to be honest I mean

471
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,760
every day is her was put on a table so it's kind of like uh I mean she gets that for sure the like

472
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:55,280
personal work is what brings in uh you know client work uh so she she kind of sees the whole

473
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,400
sort of picture there right and I think the part about that is not being like a douche lord about

474
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:09,520
like doing something like this not being like I'm an artist like you need to fuck that like you need

475
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,080
to be like a human and like a fucking person first and like you know if I have to do it at this

476
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,360
on community in community time where I get you know uh interrupted because kids had a

477
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:27,040
fucking blowout or some shit then it's like okay well then you know I I think trying to like

478
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:34,160
accommodate your family schedule will give them a lot make it they're buying a lot easier

479
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,000
will make it a lot easier for you to like stick with something like that good advice good advice

480
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,160
and I'm I'm speaking from experience my wife fully supports the endeavor that we do call the

481
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,720
future because there were many years we did this when it was a giant time suck and there was no

482
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,280
return on it at all and now it's starting to pay off and everybody's seeing if you do something

483
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
that you love your passion you share openly good things can happen now I do want to tell you

484
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,800
a couple of comments in here because there's there's a funny little dialogue going on in chat

485
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,680
so Catherine Adams is saying hey buy a house in East LA it's still affordable and Joshua Davis

486
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,640
quickly responds no because he's going to want to move to suburbers in New York with me so they're

487
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,360
like fighting for what city you're going to move to right and then Perfect Hue comes back LA is

488
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:23,600
where it's at so you know uh oh we got a little east coast west coast where do we start all right

489
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,600
what else is going on you guys anything else yeah so there's a question on YouTube from Rowan

490
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,120
who's asking you know Mike how do you balance your time with all these different things with

491
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:41,840
family um with client projects and freelance and with having to put out every day every day

492
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,440
I would say not well I feel like I wasted a ton of time I feel like I'm like extremely goddamn

493
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:59,360
distracted all day like just fucking news and dumb Trump bullshit and just I feel like it's

494
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:08,160
definitely a struggle to like stay focused do the thing like uh so yeah I I I don't really have any

495
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,480
sort of like get up and blah blah blah and do this and then drink a protein shake and like I don't

496
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:22,720
have like some like like how do you how do you bring your focus back to what you're doing or what

497
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:30,480
you need to do um bad lines again that's what is sort of like having a deadline by the end of the

498
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,840
day it kind of forces focus because it's sort of like what's got to be done by midnight so

499
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:44,000
10 o'clock I have to focus like uh so yeah I think if you can get in this like habit that

500
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,920
you've got something that is like a deadline like that like deadlines I feel like are uh just

501
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:57,600
insanely um insanely good I don't know what the right word is but they really like

502
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,680
help put work out and when I have you have a deadline that's literally every single day

503
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,160
you will produce something right and I tons of other people like who started it every

504
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,960
days and it's like I've seen like a huge amount of growth from like you know a bunch of different

505
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:21,360
people so it's definitely you know not just you know me right right I think there's a saying

506
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,240
like creativity expands or contracts to meet deadlines so deadlines help you get stuff done

507
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,880
right yeah because it's sort of like there's you know especially with a personal project there's an

508
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,120
infinite amount of choices you have nothing like holding your fucking you know nose to the whatever

509
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,920
then it's sort of like you're just floating around in artists world fucking whatever versus okay I

510
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,840
gotta put some shit down here it's it's 11 o'clock like let's what are we doing today uh you know it

511
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,760
kind of narrows your your focus I'm gonna ask this question because Brendan keeps typing this in and

512
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,280
I want to make sure he gets his question answered here is do you have any particular strategy when

513
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,920
you were first starting out how you were able to get critical mass and grow a following any tips

514
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,000
for people who are trying to do the same thing uh not really come on dig deep dude come on give

515
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,200
us some tips well so here's the thing uh when I started out this was before Facebook the first

516
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,600
probably two years I was just posting a website and literally nobody fucking saw that shit

517
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:38,080
fucking nobody so uh there's been no sort of like I would say the epiphany is do something for

518
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:47,760
10 years and just have patience with it um I I think posting on all of the sites um regularly

519
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,560
I think helps um because I think with a lot of these sites you don't really know which um

520
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:02,000
is gonna be popular you know years from now like I didn't I didn't think Instagram was gonna be as

521
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,880
popular as it is now like back when you know it was like oh here's this cool filter app um you know

522
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,720
I didn't see that coming until like not real popular um so I think kind of not putting all

523
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,800
of your eggs in one basket I would say I guess is some advice um beyond that though I feel like I'm

524
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:30,400
not very good at sort of like engaging with uh like audience on social media um just because

525
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,600
it takes a lot of time um it's just not something that I've like done that much or feel

526
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:48,720
uh I don't know I just don't engage as much as I probably should or could to kind of like

527
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,080
grow my audience more I guess so it sounds to me like you're you're saying like you've been doing

528
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:00,640
this for a long time and it wasn't necessarily uh to to get famous or to grow following you did it

529
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,120
and then when the platforms became available and you you did this more consistently than most artists

530
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,680
which is you post on pretty much every platform you can find which it makes it very easy to find

531
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,920
you every day I post on Facebook all these by hand that I don't have any like aggregator that's one

532
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,280
aggregator that's one other thing that I would recommend is and I asked somebody that actually

533
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,600
at adobe about this and because I always suspected this that if you use like an aggregator it will

534
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:36,320
kind of like ding uh you'll you'll get dinged a little bit on um on how much it will be shown to

535
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,760
people if they see that you like push it out to all the platforms it wants so I post natively on

536
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:49,120
each one of the platforms Facebook Twitter Tumblr uh my website Instagram

537
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,680
yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow that I was going to give you a bell for every

538
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,400
platform that you mentioned and I'm there with you I really believe in posting natively

539
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,040
well you have to I mean you will definitely get dinged which I always suspected and he was like

540
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,000
yes that's definitely true that if you're not posting natively to the platform if it concedes

541
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,720
you're using some aggregator it will like ding it and show your posts to less people

542
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,760
and you mentioned before when you went to school can you tell us what you studied in school and

543
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,360
where you went to school I went to Purdue University and studied computer science oh wow

544
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:38,240
Purdue University is not really that like prestigious of a school nothing against people

545
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,040
went to Purdue there goes this uh the sponsorship from the school

546
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,480
I think people have just used Purdue that it's a lot more prestigious than it is because especially

547
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:00,960
in Wisconsin too it was like oh my gosh wow oh jeez you got into Purdue from UW Madison like it's not

548
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:08,080
it was not as prestigious as you would think it's not private it's not like it's not really

549
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:14,880
that prestigious it's got a good computer science uh um and a good engineering like program but

550
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:22,800
it's not like fucking MIT or one of these things it's definitely like it's pretty good okay Mike I

551
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,160
have to say something I feel like midwesterners make a sport out of self-deprecation you guys

552
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,640
really like let's try to one up each other on that kind of stuff I'm just curious about that mindset

553
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,720
like oh cool you studied computer science you went to Purdue you're like nah it's not that good

554
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,600
they let anybody in it's not really good it's not as good as Madison and I got fucking rejected for

555
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,680
Madison I think they're regretting it now though let me tell you they're regretting it

556
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:57,600
no no I mean to be honest I was never never gonna be like a programmer it just was immediately like

557
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,880
in school I was immediately just doing little artful shit like and before school too like I

558
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,360
don't know what I was thinking with that so what yeah like why did you study computer science

559
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,120
were you told by your your video games like I want to make video games and then I like realized

560
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,400
that it's like I remember specifically when I was like nope I saw this kid and he was just

561
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:26,640
so far fucking more advanced than everybody and was just like nope not doing that like that

562
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,320
kid's gonna do that that kid's gonna do whatever the fuck he wants but I'm not gonna do that because

563
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,360
I don't want to compete against that kid I can't compete against that kid and to be honest like he

564
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,080
was spending all of his free time making video games I wasn't doing that I was spending all my

565
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:47,680
free time doing like design shit so I kind of realized that it's like okay well it seems like

566
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,520
this design shit is what I really want to do uh maybe I should try and do that did you wind up

567
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,480
graduating from Purdue yeah I it was definitely fucking tough I'm not going to say it was not

568
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:08,480
tough it was definitely very hard but I felt like I would have that to fall back on if the design

569
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,200
thing right yeah I had no portfolio out of school uh luckily the design scene in Wisconsin is not as

570
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,400
uh competitive as you might imagine so I was able to get a job

571
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:31,680
relatively little experience but again I kind of I mean I say that but I did actually have

572
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,200
a decent amount of experience because I spent a lot of time doing personal work in college so I did

573
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:44,880
definitely have like some shit to show even though you know I kind of didn't go to a design school

574
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,680
that's interesting I mean I think people are going to be able to jump into your storyline here

575
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,440
in a number of ways because you did what most people do um you you pursue the safe route the

576
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,640
thing that is supposed to make you financially stable you did something respectable and studied

577
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,480
computer science you graduated but you had that burning thing inside of you that said you wanted

578
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,160
to make art you're living kind of in a not exactly the hotbed of whatever it is that you're doing

579
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,040
yet you're able to carve your way through make your own thing get a job figure out that

580
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,040
you're you're more you're destined for more things and so you wind up going freelance you're

581
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,840
like living the dream man congratulations man I don't I don't know about that but yeah I think if

582
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:34,320
I I don't think it's um yeah I think it's just about fucking persistence like I think uh

583
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,280
not persistent patience I think that it's it's been I'm like me preaching all patients is like

584
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,480
the fucking dumbest most just absolute give me a break thing because I feel like I have very very

585
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,960
little patience but I think it's definitely especially for people starting out uh you know

586
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,080
and it's tough especially with social media I think it would have been I don't know how this

587
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:10,480
like that this would have happened had this started in the age of social media I would be

588
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,120
I don't know I wonder about that a lot if if I would have stuck with this or if it would have

589
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:20,080
even like started at all to be honest or how it would have been different had I like started this

590
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,480
in an era of like Instagram and Tumblr and all this other bullshit um because I think those

591
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:35,440
companies are they're very I think people don't realize how uh like how much they shape a lot of

592
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,960
what we do I mean look at this like future that you guys are building this platform almost entirely

593
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:50,800
on the backs of Google Facebook like that's a big a piece of what we're like how we like interact

594
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:57,040
with each other every single day so I don't know I don't know I I don't know how that would have

595
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:03,120
turned out differently okay um all right uh Matt Kendall and in I think a lot of people on the

596
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:07,440
internet want to know this because you mentioned this before but what's your rendering rig

597
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:17,680
like let's see if we can get another sponsor um so I just bought two new computers um because it

598
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,080
was a long time and I kind of put it off for a while because it was this damn crypto bullshit

599
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:29,520
it was just driving up the fucking price of cards I just bought two new computers um with

600
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:40,080
four uh 1080 ti's in each of them um so it was a little price for four 1080 ti's that's the video

601
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:49,040
card yeah who makes the 1080 ti what's up who makes that uh navidia in media or navidia is that you

602
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,720
say it navidia yeah you never heard of navidia I thought you said I thought you say nvidia but

603
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,360
navidia oh maybe yeah okay I'm probably I don't know no I don't know I know probably nvidia yeah

604
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:10,800
maybe I don't know and did you build your own box or is it uh so yes and no um it's put together I've

605
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:20,480
got a buddy who um helped me fry baker shout out um you kind of like pick components um and then uh my

606
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:27,280
dad actually like physically put it together because my hands are dumb uh and I'm like not

607
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,960
remotely like mechanically sort of minded but yeah they're like custom boxes or whatever okay

608
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,560
that wasn't a great sponsorship opportunity right there you could have really just

609
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:46,400
gotten all specked out on us but okay I'm not gonna push you there yeah I yeah no I'm like

610
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,360
you got the contacts bring them back you have to plant the seeds first before that you can uh

611
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,000
take harvest the fruit if you will it's the same components as like everything else you know an

612
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,800
intel processor and blah blah blah no no that blah blah blah won't sponsor you so I don't know

613
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,400
what the f*** gate is on me I don't know what the f*** and I don't know what the ram is

614
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:15,680
it's f***ing ram I'm trying to set you up for this and it's not working okay fine now you know

615
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:22,560
Matt Kendall there's your answer it's uh NVIDIA 4 4 1080 Ti boards that he's got in there and

616
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:30,560
intel processors and something computers yeah something like that all right um that's here

617
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:39,840
are you doing anything in AR VR uh yeah I'm doing uh concept work for magically right now

618
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:48,080
and I've done a couple um VR projects in the past so yeah it's definitely something that I'm

619
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:54,000
interested in okay I know some people in LA and I told them that after I talked to you today that

620
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,280
I'll introduce you to them because they do a lot of concert stuff and they do 3D stereoscopic

621
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,480
interactive stuff it's super cool um and they do it really well so I'll connect you guys in case

622
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,160
there's an opportunity for you guys to to work together they're big fans of yours what's that

623
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:16,880
what's the name of the company it's called 3D live I'll connect you later I think I don't

624
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,640
did they reach out to you maybe I can't there's one that's like that uh Nate what's the guy's name

625
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:28,880
uh Nate Huber and who's the other guy you Ryan Ryan Ryan and Nate

626
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,600
don't worry I'll connect you after the show all right okay let's see what else we got going on

627
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,960
in the chat are you guys monitoring Facebook is anybody asking anything on Facebook yeah yeah

628
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,800
we're showing some love we have a question from Owen and he was wondering how do you keep the

629
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:49,840
everyday's from causing you stress and anxiety um because you're talking about your mindset a little

630
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,800
bit earlier about not taking it too seriously but how do you keep yourself from taking it so seriously

631
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:02,320
um again I think it's one of those things where I I feel like I've been lucky that the like sort of

632
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:08,480
like audience is kind of like ramped up slowly over you know 11 years um because it's one of those

633
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,360
things where I see people like you know push it a couple things on Instagram and it's just blown

634
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:18,960
off and now suddenly they've got you know 100,000 followers I'm sure that's got to be like a bit

635
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:25,120
freaky to like uh you know post something like is this good blah blah blah and there again I think

636
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:32,080
the format of project I don't have any like time to like stress out over it is this good it's like

637
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:40,400
not socks but 11 o'clock I have to post it so there's it takes that like self doubt out of it

638
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,360
because it's just like there's no choice I have to post it um so you know and after I post something

639
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,640
and it's like oh it's fucking terrible it's definitely like there's some sense of like god

640
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,560
damn it like because it's always like you're you're always gonna fall short when you put two hours

641
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:04,000
into something you're never gonna be like oh my god fucking crushed it Don you don't even know like

642
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,400
it's it's just it's just a such a short period of time it's just gonna be a sketch um so I think

643
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,720
it's always gonna be tough but there again you've got the next day so it's like okay well

644
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,880
today I'm gonna fucking buckle down and we're gonna fucking crush it today so I think it's

645
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,240
it's one of those things where you can only get so butt hurt about you know two days ago

646
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,360
when you've already made you know it's out of the next thing it's like there's no like

647
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,480
you can't regret the last thing because you have to like be focused on what the fuck am I doing

648
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,640
today like fuck yesterday yesterday sucked whatever what let's try make today not suck

649
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,680
um you can't get too in your head with it I guess

650
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:51,280
I love that that thinking that's that's so refreshing to hear it's like I don't know that's

651
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:58,480
really great um I have a question on YouTube it's from Andy and Andy asks what would you

652
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:05,520
do every day if you didn't have to do every day's if you couldn't do every day's not have to because

653
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,200
one day it was your question yeah I get it if I wasn't doing every day's

654
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,520
you'd be doing every other day's what was what would I be doing I'd just be watching tv or some

655
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:24,400
shit more I don't know I would just be like lazy or fair enough yeah

656
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,920
okay ask and answer yeah there it is yeah I'm done now you know what else is um so this question

657
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,120
and I'm almost kind of scared to ask this question although I I don't think it'll matter at all

658
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:47,280
but quite a few people at least on YouTube have asked um do you ever plan on stopping um why would

659
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,760
you be scared to ask that no then other people are like don't don't ask him that because maybe he'll

660
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,520
stop real think like that's never crossed your mind before I don't understand the mentality of like

661
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:05,920
don't ask me that like it's gonna break me uh no I uh I don't have a plan to stop but I

662
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,600
I can't like I'm gonna do this forever like that sounds like a fucking long time like

663
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:18,560
I'm gonna do it today pretty sure I'm gonna do it tomorrow you know being like I'm gonna do this

664
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:26,080
for the next 30 years whatever like that seems a little like daunting so uh I think to be honest

665
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:33,760
the reason I started doing this was to get better and that need to get better and that

666
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,560
desire and that like looking at other people's work and just feeling that they're absolutely

667
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,520
fucking crushing me and that I really like need to like do whatever I can to get better that has

668
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,320
not changed at all like I still go on the internet and look at people's work and it's like fuck I

669
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:56,640
can't do that so like uh so the whole reason I started this like nothing's changed I I've gotten

670
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,880
better for sure I've gotten better I've seen improvement but I still look at people's work

671
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:06,720
and it's like no not they're not even close like so many people's work like not even close

672
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,440
all right people I have a new segment I want to play with you it's called verses but before I get

673
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,480
the verses I want to read something from the internet here they're saying that man won't you

674
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,280
just do a training course or something and how dare they mention some competing network

675
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,440
oh there you guys watch this channel mention somebody else no that's cool what did they mention

676
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:33,680
no we're not gonna talk about them come on you can read the comments after the show guys

677
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,240
you guys you're about to whoever wrote that comment you're gonna be putting a timeout box

678
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,880
any second right now if you do that again but having said that I want to I want to mention to people

679
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,320
that we actually offer courses and relevant relevant to what we're talking about here

680
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:56,080
we teach a motion design course style frames and Matthew does a really great job of breaking down

681
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,240
how to do this in case you're not a genius like people who study computer science but can still

682
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:07,520
make amazing computer art we're trying to help you with what we are the courses that we're offering

683
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,520
you see how I did that so smoothly that's super super smooth see how a pitch man like me does it

684
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:20,160
people that's how you do it and just just for a couple of like the the guys that are watching on

685
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,800
there when they're like oh what a freaking idiot he doesn't know what the video card is I'm the one

686
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,920
who pronounced it correctly it is Nvidia not the video Nvidia somebody's like I work down the street

687
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:39,200
from them it's called Nvidia and Christmas right thank you that one's on me boom all right

688
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,200
all right now we're gonna do this thing it's a very short segment it's called versus let me hit play

689
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,320
here boom let me get some let me get some belfry here all right here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna

690
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,160
present you two scenarios oh I need to share this with you don't know who cares you don't need to see

691
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,760

693
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:17,680
say it fast here we go you ready all right PC or Mac PC okay pen or a mouse mouse mm-hmm two wheels

694
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,800
or four wheels four wheels Targaryen or Stark

695
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,920
I don't their names I don't remember all their oh my god I thought you're Game of Thrones fan

700
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:17,920
I'm trying to get sponsors here man oh shoot that applause you guys got a little out of control

701
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,920
there easy with the applause you guys easy all right let's see if we start up let's take a couple

702
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,720
more questions and I think we've taken up enough of this good man's time I know he's got an every

703
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:37,680
day to do a lot of work right he's got children to raise a wife to to talk to and things to do so

704
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,440
a couple more questions and let's wrap this part up but I have one last question I mean

705
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,800
uh one more segment but you guys what do you got for me um yeah I have a question myself um so in

706
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,320
some of your personal work you have actually created your own music um for for some of your videos

707
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,800
and I'm kind of wondering um do you think it's important to take these interests that you have

708
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:03,840
outside of design and combine them with your work um I think it will be good I feel like I'm I used to

709
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,480
do music I kind of stopped just because I wanted to focus mostly on design and I thought the music

710
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:14,400
was just pretty shitty and I just wanted to kind of leave that to the experts um I feel like I'm

711
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:22,160
not very like well-rounded um I'm interested in like investing and I'm interested in the news

712
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,960
and then pretty much like 99 percent just like design shit um so yeah I would say probably being

713
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,160
more well-rounded with other outside interests would be better

714
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,360
was that it is that what you wanted yeah yeah that's great all right Andy Nicholson is saying

715
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:44,880
thank you and all caps people Mike not just for this but for your attitude and inspiration

716
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,400
I appreciate that we didn't hear any embarrassing stories I'm a little bit disappointed in Mike's

717
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,480
friends right now me too guys you did not come through for us I thought you guys gonna tell

718
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,840
some weird stories and put them on the spot oh you know what okay a couple of people have asked

719
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,920
since you're into investing in technology and uh 1080 what are your thoughts on crypto

720
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,960
oh the show just went to a weird place okay go and answer the question Mike

721
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:22,640
now I feel like it's I've got a little money uh a tiny amount of money in uh Ethereum just as like I

722
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,800
yeah a kind of super hedge um but I would say overall I would put money I would put money into

723
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,520
Amazon if that but you have one thing you should put money into I would say put money in the Amazon

724
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:43,360
I think that's all that I think it's very um I would do that or index funds I think are

725
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:51,680
like BTI or spy I think are good ones but I think Amazon has a lot more room to run

726
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:57,040
I think they're advertising businesses just getting off the ground and I think they're

727
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:05,280
too big to fail solid investment advice from Mike boom I have one quick follow-up question

728
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:11,600
because super interesting too um where do you go to read up on on investments like is there a

729
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:18,640
subreddit or something you're into or a website um I've got a couple other um bodies that I uh

730
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,280
worked with at the uh in Wisconsin who are super into investing and there's a site um

731
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,480
that we've got a subscription to I think there's no one good place because nobody knows this

732
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,280
that's what like to me makes it interesting is there's no like you can have two fucking harvard

733
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,120
trained people and one's gonna say stock market's about to crash the other one's gonna say oh we're

734
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:46,080
gonna have a huge run here and nobody knows um but there's a site uh fool dot com motley fool

735
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,600
that has like stock picks and you can get their newsletters and it's maybe I don't even know it's

736
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,000
like a hundred bucks a year or something like that and they've got they've got some ideas but um

737
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,600
that's like hosted by kramer right is that the guy's name kramer on tnn or something like that or ms

738
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:08,400
nbc he's always yelling out the camera and it's not that guy but I mean my idea is too I mean

739
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,440
that's the thing I think taking a broad range and I think having your money in like a lot of different

740
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,240
things is another thing and I think the biggest thing is just saving your money in the first place

741
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:24,960
that's the good thing is like uh you know not having a car payment like if you're not into cars

742
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:32,800
buy a super cheap car like my car that I uh had had three hundred and fifteen thousand miles on it

743
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,880
it was a piece of shit like absolute piece of fucking trash like uh I think that's not a thing

744
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,280
but just like trying to like save as much money as possible because that's what gives you like

745
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,920
the flexibility to say no to projects and to do personal things if you're super fucking like

746
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,720
strapped every last penny is going to something then when that like kind of sketchy job where

747
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:59,920
you're like this is gonna be a shit show and I know I should not take this but I gotta fucking roll

748
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:06,080
the dice on it because I really need that fucking like money like you're gonna have to take it um so

749
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:12,800
I think having that cushion will really like allow you to say no to things and it will give you

750
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,640
more bargaining power too if you're like if you don't need to take a job then when you quote a job

751
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,840
you're gonna be quoting that job from like a position of power and like confidence and you'd

752
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,120
be like fuck this this is so much you I want for the job and they can take it or they cannot take

753
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,360
it and a lot of times they will take it um so I think uh having a cushion and just saving money

754
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,640
in the first place is definitely the biggest piece of that from that putting it into anything in the

755
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:48,240
stock market as long as it's not crypto I think you'll probably be in a good spot nice all right

756
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,200
I want to say this I think you just wrote the first chapter of the independent artist manifesto

757
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:58,080
right there don't spend a lot of money save it that way you have the power come on man

758
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,080
all right that's another project that we may or may not wind up doing after this show you guys

759
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,920
we're gonna now enter into lightning round I'm gonna ask you a few questions okay and feel free

01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,240
ice cream right they're out there somewhere and we just lost another sponsor you guys

792
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,720
he's like who cares about cars Wisconsin sucks I can't even do the review on this show

793
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,200
I'm gonna offend so many people my my mouth is hurting right now from laughing oh all right okay

794
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,200
before we say goodbye to you I want to let everybody know how to get in touch with you your name is

795
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,920
Beeple but your real name is Mike Winkleman and you can be found just about in every social

796
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:25,840
platform that's out there BeepleCrap.com because you know it's it's keeping in with his self-deprecating

797
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,800
tone and he's on Instagram at Beeple underscore crap I guess you couldn't just get Beeple on Twitter

798
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,640
and Facebook is at Beeple and he's also Beeple.tumblr and just so many other platforms I think

799
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:48,560
are you also on Pinterest on Pinterest yeah I've got you are everywhere okay art station

800
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:56,000
yep okay so um is there any last final parting thoughts a a book or sponsorship thing that you

801
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,200
don't want to promote I think you've heard enough bullshit from me

802
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:08,240
I didn't even get to all my questions for you okay okay I'll let you ask one question before we wrap

803
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,480
let's do this ask that's a hard-hitting question right now you guys this is bonus time you guys

804
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:21,360
okay let's see the industry in 10 years what's the industry going to be like in 10 years yeah it's

805
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,360
going to be dark for the people who work in advertising and in posts because the margins

806
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,400
are getting smaller and tighter every day we seem to be reading about another VFX company going under

807
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,600
and it's a sad place if you work in the commercial space but if you work in a place where you're able

808
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:40,320
to work directly with clients and consumers where you've built up a community around the things that

809
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,760
you love I mean Beeple super low-hanging fruit for you to build an audience around what you do put

810
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,480
together a book let people love and celebrate you man you can even call a Beeple crap on the cover

811
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:55,440
and I think people want to support you they want to see you succeed you are their hero so that's

812
01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:00,160
what I would suggest everybody do the world is shrinking take advantage of it don't run away

813
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:09,120
from it is that okay got advice it's stay away from all that cryptocurrency oh my god stay away

814
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:16,720
with that kid don't no black tar heroine and no cryptocurrency and that's it Mike thanks very much

815
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:23,600
for joining us today guys just give him a big round of applause thank you all right I'm gonna take

816
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:35,040
us out to the end of the show I think it goes something like this

817
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:05,040
so

818
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,040
