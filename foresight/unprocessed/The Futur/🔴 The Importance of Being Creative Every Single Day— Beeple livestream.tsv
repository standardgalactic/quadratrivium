0	29760	Welcome to the future you guys happy Friday I'm super pumped up today because
29760	36320	we have people on the show you know contain myself so all you guys that are tuning in you are in
36320	40560	for a real treat I want to tell you a couple things I know about people right off the front here
40560	46320	he's from Wisconsin but now he's currently resides in Charleston South Carolina he produces VJ clips
46320	51040	for concerts and I want to talk to him about that I also found out he's a family man he's got two
51040	57600	kids and he's been doing every day's every day for 10 years some of you guys know him as people
57600	61920	but we now know him as Mike Winkleman and he's going to be on the show doing the math before
62560	69200	10 years an image a day through 365 days a year that equates to more than 3650 images it's so big I
69200	75680	can't even contain it in one slide bananas guys so what we know is he's super consistent and this
75680	80000	is daunting because I just started a challenge myself so hard to do I looked up consistent what
80000	87200	does that mean unchanging in nature standard or effect over time he's also super prolific and
87280	92480	that means producing in large quantities or with great frequency highly productive I'm not sure he
92480	97200	would use those words to describe himself but as an outside observer that's all I can tell you
97200	101360	this is how I see it now if you're not familiar with his work you got to get to know this man
101360	107280	he's producing work all over the place and it's very easy to find check this out now many of us
107280	113680	would be thrilled to be able to produce maybe four five six twelve of these kinds of images
113680	120080	but he's this is just two of 3650 images that he's producing a day here's some other images that
120080	124400	he's produced incredible now I've noticed some themes we're going to get into this with him
124400	129920	about why he chooses certain compositions certain color palates and most oftentimes he'll put a
129920	134400	person in this in the frame too so I want to talk to him about that check out this amazing artwork
136320	141200	Greg and Caleb what do you guys think about this beautiful it's stunning I don't know how you
141200	145680	do this every day well we're gonna find out shortly it's pretty cool and we'll make him
145680	149920	uncomfortable by flattering him a little bit he's got that midwestern modesty thing going so you
149920	155760	know we'll turn it up a little bit but gosh look at these images and for me the hardest thing was
155760	161680	like which image do I put together to encapsulate the volume the prodigious volume of work that
161680	167120	he's been able to produce super cool how do you even get the ideas on how to produce this day in
167120	173360	and day out I'm stuck on day seven of a 30-day challenge right now so this is incredible but
174000	179440	these these images aren't just static he's moving cameras he's animating there's there's walk cycles
179440	185760	that we've seen check this stuff out and the original music to these things are pretty aggro and
185760	188640	let's see let's try to close the music up okay I know that's a little weird
193920	194240	wow
197360	200720	this one feels more appropriate
201680	204320	pretty kind of music
225760	230320	I love this one Greg
230880	240320	all right you guys we're gonna keep this real we're gonna keep this raw Erica please roll the titles
251760	256800	all right Mike welcome to the show and before we have you say anything I just want to warn everybody
256800	262880	there's going to be explicit language on the show today Mike he's got a foul mouth what can we say
262880	267760	what can we say and we want him to be himself so you have sensitive ears or you're easily kind of
269360	273840	insulted by these kinds of things you could tune out right now but you're gonna be missing
273840	277520	something incredible and I just want to let you guys know we'll be monitoring your questions on
277520	282480	Facebook and on YouTube Greg and Caleb will be doing that they're joining us in the in the podcast
282480	287280	or the broadcast today there they are boom you guys look great today you guys oh shucks
289040	296160	you guys get dressed up for people I feel like you did no whatever Greg that was a little short
296160	303440	there Greg all right Mike how you doing man good good how are you I'm good now we understand
303440	307440	you're at home and you have two little ones running around possibly so if they jump into the scene
307440	311600	let's just celebrate the whole fact that you're a family man you're doing this thing I guess the way
311600	319520	I want to kick this off the bat is um how do you find time in the day to do these personal projects
319520	326960	like how are you how's it you can even do this um I mean I get that question a lot but I don't
326960	333200	think there's any like magical answer to it I think it's just one of those things that if you get
333200	339040	into the habit of it you'll keep doing it and it's just something that you have to on some level
339040	346800	just sort of like commit to doing at some point and then I think I've gotten lucky that the momentum
346800	352320	of doing it so long just makes it completely feel like it's not like a choice at all like it's just
352320	358240	something I have to do most days I do not want to do it I'd rather like like today it's definitely
358240	362800	not convenient and I just took a trip it was definitely not convenient any of the days I was
362800	368880	on that trip so I think it's just something that you just kind of um you know once you if you're
368880	373840	lucky enough to be able to get into you know sort of uh routine and have some momentum with it they
374640	379120	kind of carry you forward with it was there a point in in the in the cycle of doing this where
379120	383040	you felt like yeah I can do this now and I can get through that like when you run a marathon when
383040	388160	you hit the wall but you break through and you know you're gonna be able to finish um not really to
388160	397840	be honest I think it was something that uh I just started doing um and I'd seen another artist who
397840	405360	did every day is Tom Judd um and he did drawings a day and that was how I started um and I just
405360	409760	kind of started and then it just kind of like kept going there was no point where it was like
410320	415680	any sort of like epiphany of like oh man I could do this forever and I don't know if I will do it
415680	421200	forever I'm just saying like it just kind of kept going I did not expect it to like keep going this
421200	426320	long so on the days that you don't feel like doing it or there's a lot of stuff going on how
426320	432880	do you find the motivation to to just set aside what you're doing and get something done um that's
432880	438000	again where it's sort of like motivation doesn't really like factor into it because it's sort of
438000	443200	like there's never something that's so important that it's like I'm gonna break this you know 11
443200	448720	year streak yeah because it's like I don't feel like it I want to watch fucking Game of Thrones or
448720	456960	whatever like there's no it's it would have to be a real real good excuse and I mean at this point
456960	462240	it wouldn't really be an excuse it would be like something like physically stops me from like doing
462240	469280	it and which case or I haven't planned ahead and something like that um or just some like stupid
469280	473920	shit because the other thing is it has to be done by midnight and there's times when I've gotten very
474000	482880	close to midnight and if I go over by midnight I will be very very pissed at myself like beyond
482880	489680	pissed at myself so and it'll happen eventually but it hasn't happened do you start stressing out
489680	496880	when it's like 11 50 p.m yeah well I mean by 11 50 p.m yeah I'm definitely like fucking
496880	501920	attention focused and there's been times where it's gone to 11 50 p.m like I'm fucking
501920	510480	left I get pixel fucking whatever it's done with this like it's gone to 11 50 p.m and the power
510480	516640	is going to go out or something and I'm going to be really really fucking pissed yeah all right well
519360	524800	Greg is a person who did like a mythical monday for for a whole year I'm sure you can relate is
524800	530960	there something that you want to ask people I mean I I don't know if relate is even comes close to
531120	538240	imagine the anxiety you feel like mythical monday oh so okay it was a it was an animated gift
538240	543360	project that I did and um this sounds it's not like such a weiner comparing it to your
543360	550080	everyday's but I made one animated gift a week for a year nice and that like stressed me out like
550080	558080	crazy and my my thing was yeah I had to go live um at midnight on on sunday right because it's monday
558160	562560	so sure enough I would always wait until like 11 50 and I'd just be like oh damn it what am I going
562560	566640	to do no sorry what were you saying no that's that's that's the story
568640	573040	really I know that's one thing a lot of people like ask me like well why don't you just do like
573040	577760	one thing like a week like a longer thing but if I was doing that I would just wait till the last
577760	585680	second I wouldn't work on yeah oh it's definitely I would definitely work far less I guarantee that
585680	592080	if I was just doing one thing like a week so I think a lot of designers and creative people can
592080	596480	relate to this part which is I think we need the pressure to make something like no pressure no
596480	600800	diamonds right my wife is always wondering why are you waiting two days before you have to get on
600800	605520	an airplane to write your talk I like I can't produce under any other circumstance it doesn't
605520	611040	the urgency isn't there the fire the the need to make something isn't there so you know I think
611040	615920	there's a whole bunch of people already loving you somebody's like oh no no swearing please like I
615920	622560	think sarcastically and and somebody's like people for president in all caps and they're loving your
622560	629600	accent too so like play it up man just play it up yeah I guess a lot of people the Wisconsin
629600	636160	thing I don't really it doesn't feel like an accent to me but we can hear it though it's lovely I like
636160	642320	it can hear it everybody else can all right um Caleb do you have a question for him or Erica
643040	647520	yeah uh what what is the most time that you've spent on a single daily before oh that's a good
647520	656160	question um there's been times uh I usually try and spend a little more time on the like um
657280	664560	May 1st which is like a anniversary date each year and um and the end of the year
665280	669520	and the beginning of the year so on the 31st and the first I try and spend more time on those
670240	676160	and there's other times where if I have like not often but there's times where I have like an idea
676160	682400	like oh this could be cool if I do you know x y z but it's like a lot to do and I just so happen to
682400	686480	have a bunch of time usually if it's like the weekend um there's been times where I've spent
686480	692160	like probably like 10 hours on one oh my goodness yeah there's definitely been times there's times
692160	697680	where it's like I'll sit down at four o'clock on the weekends and it'll be like I'm just gonna like
697680	702480	spend you know just a little bit of time then we're gonna watch a movie and we'll watch a movie in a
702480	708240	little bit and then I'll fucking spend like eight hours and like go home or something do you find
708240	712400	that there's any correlation between the amount of time you spend on something and the quality or
712400	721920	your satisfaction of the work uh there's a small correlation sometimes there's a correlation there's
722720	728080	times where it's like I'll put in a bunch of time and I'll be like oh that's like decent or like
728640	733440	sucks a little less than the other ones but there's also many times where I'll put in a
733440	739040	shit ton of work and I'm like this fucking blows like that was a goddamn waste of time like or
739040	742960	there's times where I'll do something super quick and it'll just like I'll get lucky and I'll be like
742960	750720	oh fuck it's done and you know uh half hour or something like that so uh that does not happen
750800	756320	very often but well you're you're a living testament to this idea this experiment that was run I think
756320	761680	it was in a book called the fear of art that my business coach had me had me read many many years
761680	768000	ago I mean it they they took a hundred artists they split them in half they told 50 artists in a month
768000	772400	produce as many pieces as you can don't worry about quality or anything and then they set them off on
772400	777280	their way and the other group of 50 artists that make a masterpiece just make one piece that you
777280	781920	think is going to be amazing and the results were quite surprising not to you but maybe to some of
781920	786720	our audience in that the group who was who were directed to just create one masterpiece many of
786720	792640	them didn't produce anything and and there were higher and better quality pieces of work from the
792640	796880	group who were just told just to make stuff all day long and so that that is the testament to
796880	801520	this whole fear of art thing and you've been able to do that wonderfully and and I think you're a
801520	805840	role model for everybody who's just holding on to that precious idea of perfection that your
805840	809840	deadline of midnight like you got to get it done and you got to release it into the world
810640	819040	yeah I don't know I mean that's the thing the that that experiment is interesting but it's
819040	824160	kind of subjective I mean there's definitely people who I see who spend a shit ton of time
824160	829360	on one image and it turns out fucking awesome and it's something that I could look at for like
829360	835360	an insane amount of time because it's got so much detail and it's just fucking framed perfectly and
835440	842880	the color and composition everything so I do think that art in general is a bit of a numbers
842880	849520	game in terms of just if you're putting out more stuff you know there's found a like hit because
849520	854560	I think there's a lot of luck to it I think there's a lot of like you know you just get lucky
855680	860560	times and if you're putting out more stuff there's a lot better chance that you're gonna get lucky
860560	865360	and something might sort of click. Pedro is saying Beeple is the Bill Gates of every day
866000	870240	and he does look a little like Bill Gates right now. There's a lot of people who said I look like
870240	877520	Bill Gates there was a picture that Zed posted with me next to Zed and he's got you know millions
877520	882080	of followers on Instagram or whatever and all the fucking comments Bill Gates Bill Gates Bill Gates
884400	888080	you just need a sweater man get a nice sweater with a collar and you're set
888640	892080	but again you're good to pull up a side by side of Bill Gates.
894320	897600	All right so I have to ask another question as you've been doing this for so long
897600	902560	are you a super organized person do you have all your assets like just super just there it is
902560	909920	everything I want is there come on lie to me lie to me. The people I used to work with well
909920	918960	don't remember this I have on my desktop a crud folder that is like kind of a spill all of like
918960	926320	just general bullshit so no I'm definitely not organized anybody who's like yeah I'm not organized.
926320	930080	So do you find that you spent a lot of your time just digging through your assets like oh I need
930080	934800	that building or that water tower or whatever it is that you're looking for or that that model or
934800	942960	that tree I mean how are you even combing through your stuff. So in terms of that stuff I am I really
942960	948960	didn't start building a like database of stuff because before I hit 10 years like a year ago
948960	954160	I had tried to like model most things because when I started out I didn't know 3D at all I wanted
954160	959120	to learn to model and so I started out I would model everything in the scene every single thing
959120	964400	and over the course of 10 years it kind of slowly I would introduce more and more things where it's
964560	968400	like okay I don't really want to model a tree it doesn't really make sense I'm just going to use a
968400	975120	tree model but then when I hit 10 years I kind of sort of completely took the sort of limitation
975120	980320	off myself and I'll use models from anything now because I want to focus on color and composition
980320	985840	and just like more narrative things and I don't really want to like model a fucking little crate
985840	992400	or whatever. Right. So I just really started building a like true library of assets a year ago
992400	997680	and I would say that is fairly organized actually that I can quickly like pull things in but in
997680	1003600	terms of like my things like where to save something or where to like you know directory
1003600	1010480	structures it's definitely like a bit of a claustrophobic. It's just one giant folder with 3000
1010480	1016240	images or models. It's not that disorganized but it definitely be more organized I will say not.
1017200	1022800	So I'm curious because I think I I'm not saying this from my point of view but for people who
1022800	1027440	are watching or saying well isn't that like cheating like don't you need to make everything
1027440	1031280	yourself look why have you come to the realization that maybe it's more about the art and the
1031280	1035360	composition of the idea that you're you want to share with the world versus actually building
1035360	1041680	every screw and that bolt that's in the scene. Sure I think it's you could consider it cheating
1041680	1048080	and if your goal is to make everything from scratch then yes this would be like cheating but if
1048080	1055920	that's not your goal then it's not cheating that's not my goal. So to me I think I would rather use
1055920	1062240	all the tools available. I think clients are demanding more and more and if you're holding
1062240	1068560	your back holding yourself back from using things especially on client projects like clients do not
1068560	1072640	give a fuck how you built it like who wastes all day modeling something they're gonna be like what
1072640	1078480	the fuck did you do why didn't you buy that from TurboSquid or Adobe stock or Adobe stock.
1080240	1086160	Why didn't you just buy that you know instead of wasting all day fucking modeling and texturing
1086160	1093760	and all this shit. So I think it's it's definitely something that it depends on what your goal is.
1093760	1100640	My goal is not to recreate the wheel if I can you know use something that I can get for you know
1101520	1106880	much cheaper than I could make it. I mean the most expensive models are only a couple thousand
1106880	1113040	dollars and that's something that would like take you like months to like make. So it almost never
1113040	1118000	unless you need something custom it almost never makes sense to like make it yourself. Now
1118000	1121520	something really stuff wise or weird or whatever then obviously you have to make it or you need a
1121520	1126960	certain topology or this or that but if you just need a fucking tree don't model that fucking tree
1126960	1133440	download a goddamn tree like that. Definitely for client work don't fucking model that tree.
1135200	1138480	Now we're going to get into client work how you make money how you make a living and
1138480	1143040	your whole financial empire if you will in a second but I do want to share a little story
1143040	1149280	with you and maybe some other people can relate to this because when I was getting started in
1149280	1154000	motion design I was painting style frames right using Photoshop and doing photocomping photo
1154000	1158720	mashing things together but what I was doing was I was creating all my own assets like if there
1158720	1163040	was something I needed I would run out and shoot it with a camera because I thought the rules were
1163040	1167680	you had to make everything in your frame and then I go and meet one of my clients and there's a
1167680	1172080	designer there his name is Ron Padua and Ron is showing me his set of storyboards instead of doing
1172080	1176640	one set of boards he has seven complete boards with ideas and I was sitting there scratching my
1176640	1181280	head thinking how is that you are able to create so much in the same amount of time and I just
1181280	1187040	barely got my first idea out and he's dude I just went in and I grabbed frames from anywhere
1187040	1192240	and everywhere and I cut things up I just want to get the idea out and if we were to be awarded the
1192240	1196800	job we'd actually have to hire an art director a production designer we'd have to do casting
1196800	1200640	and lighting and all this kind of stuff I'm not really worried about that and that was a giant
1200640	1205920	shift for me I remember getting into my car driving home thinking what a cheating little bastard
1206000	1211360	like that mother you know how could he do that and I'm sitting here and then I started to think
1211360	1216400	like what is my hang up with this at the end of the day I want to win the work and I want to
1216400	1221120	be able to tell stories and I want to learn how to be a director that's what mattered to me the most
1221120	1226800	so I'm just kind of jumping in on what you're saying there yeah I think it's I think these
1226800	1232960	tools like I'm interested in using the most advanced tools available like I want to use the
1232960	1237200	most advanced render I want to use the most advanced plugins because I want to be able to do
1237200	1242880	like things as quick as possible and get my ideas out there as quick as possible so to me I see like
1242880	1248640	using stock things is just an extension of that it's another tool like a plugin or like the new
1248640	1253440	version of octane or something like that that it's like why wouldn't I use that right it's available
1253440	1260480	to me it's like it's available to everyone so I think it's it's one of those things that it's
1260480	1264000	just another tool for me okay since we're on the subject of tools and I think there are a
1264000	1268560	bunch of people wondering what tools you are using can you give us a breakdown of the tools that
1268560	1276560	using the software um most of the stuff I use is cinema 4d and then um octane I've been using
1276560	1283600	some redshift lately um but mostly mostly octane still um and then just like after effects and
1284480	1290560	owner shop okay okay cool I noticed when you were talking about turbo squid and then you
1290560	1295200	mentioned oh I'm sorry adobe great adobe stock are you sponsored by adobe or something
1295200	1308800	yeah
1309520	1315120	no can do right hey uh yeah adobe are you listening we we use adobe stock or is that what it's called
1315120	1322240	stock loving it love adobe stock number one adobe stock right now hashtag adobe stock you guys
1322320	1326480	all right we gotta pay the bills I get it I get it we need some adobe love ourselves so we'll get
1326480	1332240	into that a little bit later so those are the tools hey Greg and Caleb any questions from the
1332240	1337280	internet that you guys want to throw at people yeah yeah there's a couple from youtube so um
1338080	1345040	gustav asks on average how long does it take to make one of these every day uh I would say on
1345040	1350240	average it's probably like two hours two hours okay how much work I have that day in terms of like
1350240	1357120	client work and how much uh ambition I have or if I have an idea that's like oh this could be like
1357120	1362960	decent or it could be interesting to explore then I might spend more time or if I don't have
1362960	1369520	you know that much time than I've spent last time but I would say that average and to to follow that
1369520	1375440	up like in my mind one of the scariest things is just a blank canvas right so where do where do you
1375440	1380560	even start like do you have a sketchbook full of crazy ideas that you you know pluck things from
1380560	1385840	and use every day or what you know you're staring at the screen what happens draw at all so I don't
1385840	1394480	sketch um I usually will go on like um like Pinterest or I've got like a Pinterest board of like
1395360	1401520	everyday sort of general ideas um it's not like I've got it like okay Tuesday I'm doing this Wednesday
1401520	1406800	I got this blah blah blah it's definitely just kind of like what sort of like can get me at all
1406800	1413360	sort of motivated to just kind of uh just start uh and sometimes it's something very small it's just
1413360	1420880	like a general shape or a color scheme or a camera angle or something like that um but I find if I have
1420880	1426160	some sort of like nudge in a certain direction it will turn out better than just like literally
1426160	1432800	opening up Cinema 40 with no ideas then it will usually kind of uh just turn into more of like a
1433520	1438960	super abstract pile of crap that I've like done a million times it's not like the other days it's
1438960	1448320	like insane the original every day but it seems to be uh a little easier if I have some nudge in
1448320	1454720	a direction right yeah some sort of theme or something to build on yeah do you wait for that
1454720	1460240	nudge to happen before you sit down and do your every day I wait to a certain extent but I usually
1460240	1465760	don't I don't have the luxury of just like I'm just gonna wait till I'm inspired because I have like
1465760	1469280	it's like okay I've got like an hour and a half to do this so I can sit there and
1469280	1474080	dick around for five minutes but it's like I can't sit here and wait for an hour till the
1474800	1481680	magical muse comes down and you know kisses my forehead I gotta just fucking sit down and put
1481840	1490480	some shit out so uh I try to like you know get an idea but sometimes it's just kind of like
1490480	1496160	okay fuck this I gotta go right right okay I think everybody that watches our channel knows
1496160	1499680	that we don't just talk about creative things you're a super creative guy but we talk about
1499680	1504400	business stuff too and we were having a conversation before we went live about this very thing so I
1504400	1508080	got a lot of questions for you and I and if you feel like I'm throwing a question at you that you
1508080	1513120	don't want to answer uh because that that whole midwestern modesty thing I get it we'll cover it
1513120	1516960	up we won't have to talk about it and we'll we'll just say pass okay so I'm gonna throw some things
1516960	1521440	at you I asked Aaron Draplin this question on the podcast and I want to ask you it's like
1521440	1526720	where does your money come from like you sell you do freelance work I know that you sell prints and
1526720	1531280	tell us how what does the financial empire look like from percentages like where does it all come
1531280	1538880	from the buckets almost entirely freelance um the prince is not very much it's maybe
1541840	1546800	10% of the money if less than 10% of the money actually far less than 10% of the money that I
1546800	1553280	make is from France it's definitely almost entirely freelance work do you speak a lot do you get
1554000	1562320	invited to speak and are you paid to speak um so that's a good question um I have done some
1562320	1569120	speaking gigs in the last couple years um I've kind of started to do more of them just because
1569120	1575840	it's I found it's uh you know just a fun way to like meet people and just like because I work from
1575840	1582160	home to like get out in like I don't know any I would just move to Charleston yeah like six
1582160	1588160	eight months ago and I don't know anybody here uh so and I just like honestly don't have a ton of
1588160	1595520	time to like hang out with people on like a day-to-day basis um so you know going to these events I
1595520	1600800	find is like really great for connecting with people um so yeah I've started to do those more I
1600800	1606320	haven't gotten paid for any of them so I don't know I should be asking for money for these you
1606320	1611120	should be thinking about that question for you yeah we'll talk about that I'll help you I mean I
1611120	1616240	think not not that you're asking for my help or anything but I I think I'm I'm one of those weirdos
1616240	1621760	where I think I enjoyed math and the idea of running a business as much as I enjoyed doing the creative
1621760	1626560	aspect some some weird hybrid right I'm just smashing those two worlds together I honestly
1626560	1632560	enjoyed like the money aspect of it as well uh that's what drew me to like you're looking at your
1632560	1638560	stuff or you know the the content you guys are putting out is because I think you know like
1638560	1642720	you're saying a lot of people don't like talking about that or are scared to talk about it whereas
1642720	1648000	to me that's interesting because it's like that's all these projects happen like if you see like a
1648000	1652960	big movie or some shit like that like that didn't fucking just come out of nowhere like somebody had
1652960	1658400	to pay for that like and if it doesn't make money it's not gonna happen again so it's like to me I
1658400	1664640	find that interesting because it's what facilitates a lot of what we do mm-hmm well we we kind of
1664720	1670880	actually bumped into it but you you make some money via sponsorship right yeah I there is a
1670880	1677040	couple things that I've done um that are like sponsorships through um Adobe and then I just
1677040	1686400	did a thing with Wix um uh with the new website that I have um and I just went and spoke at Wix
1686400	1694720	actually last week uh so yeah there's been a few things like that just more recently mm-hmm okay
1694720	1701040	and what percentage of that does that represent your financial empire still small they're small
1701040	1705920	still yeah it's definitely still mostly just freelance okay and can can I ask that like are
1705920	1711680	you the uh the sole breadwinner for the family is your wife work yeah my wife stays home she was a
1712640	1719520	school teacher uh and when we had our first kids we got two kids two and four and um as soon as we
1719520	1726880	had kids she stays stable mm-hmm and do you ever feel like potentially that that's a lot of pressure
1726880	1731440	to put on you in terms of like being able to rely on a freelance income that you don't have much of
1731440	1736320	in terms of passive income set up so if something like if you were to get sick or hit get hit by a
1736400	1742480	bus and like oh my god uh now what are your what is your wife and your kids going to do um not
1742480	1751200	really because to be honest I was very fortunate enough to have a dad who was a fucking super tight
1751200	1758960	ass and he very much instilled in us and this again is maybe you know the midwest thing of saving
1758960	1767440	money yeah so very much since uh I started working I'm 36 um I was definitely saving at least 10%
1767440	1777200	of my money the 10% oh good for you and another 401k and then you know I got thrown to side effects
1777200	1784080	you know yeah my dad does that too but he only did that because he's an accountant and that's how he
1784080	1790720	do no my dad was not an accountant he was just he was just tight as shit with money and he was
1790720	1796560	very much so you don't talk to us about investing and you know buying stocks so that's actually
1796560	1801600	probably the thing I'm more most interested in and I I don't honestly get a chance to talk about it
1801600	1806800	with any other designers is like stocks and investing um is another thing that I'm like
1806800	1816240	really interested in so um yeah if something happened and I got you know whatever that we've
1816240	1820640	got some money that would be fine that's good that's great to hear that's fantastic like you're
1820640	1826400	you're a responsible adult father and a husband I like that I'm a responsible adult but do you
1826400	1834320	have life insurance I do not have life insurance that might be something you consider yeah we'd be
1834320	1842320	fine you don't want to give anybody incentive to like knock off the old man huh no no my uh
1843360	1850720	yeah it's just I don't have life insurance but um we've got enough money saved that we'd be fine
1850720	1855200	very good okay well you know I was thinking about this because I noticed when I was downloading
1855200	1860880	your clips off Vimeo you're like these clips you can download for free these vj clips I was thinking
1860880	1864480	okay that's super cool we'll be able to use these and I don't have to go through some weird
1864480	1869840	way to download the videos just for the presentation of your work but I was thinking why aren't you
1869840	1876720	charging for these vj clips these are awesome they're fantastic yeah to be honest I don't
1876720	1882160	there's sites where you can buy vj clips yeah um but like adobe stock
1890080	1896080	to be honest I don't think that revenue model
1898880	1906000	to me has never been that appealing for one I don't really like trying to like sell stuff
1906720	1911920	I don't really like I already kind of feel like I'm spamming people with just the like work that
1911920	1918480	I'm putting out uh just the like every day so like being like buy this thing blah blah blah blah
1918480	1923840	like I don't know I just I don't like that like a lot of people don't even know that I sell prints
1923840	1929840	like people are constantly I'll see comments were like oh you got so pretty since like I've been
1929840	1935920	fucking my selling prints for years like but because I just don't like I'll usually send out one
1936560	1942880	like tweet per year right before black friday or whatever right like I've got prints other than
1942880	1950080	that I like pretty much never like sell things so that's one part of it too I feel like vj clips
1950080	1958000	in general is something where um like if you're a vj I think you need a lot of clips and so
1958000	1963600	they're kind of like devalued in a sense like on these sites they're really like they don't
1963600	1972400	do not sell for much so I it would I don't know that personally um at least for me that I think
1972400	1980560	it makes more sense as a marketing tool than a direct sales tool if that makes sense yeah
1980560	1986000	because to be honest how I got you know I don't I don't honestly I've never had a demo reel
1986160	1990480	if you go to my site now you will see none of the like commercial work that I've done
1990480	1993760	so everything that I've gotten has been from the personal work that I've done
1994880	2001280	so I look at that as one just shit I want to do and I just happen to be lucky enough that
2001280	2008560	that is like something that brings in you know freelance okay all right well if you ever change
2008560	2013840	your mind I know the internet's gonna hate me for this but we could probably talk about how you can
2013840	2019440	maybe put your images together and put it into a book and launch a Kickstarter campaign and sell
2019440	2024800	art prints right definitely thought about doing it selling a book um like there's a lot of these
2024800	2030880	things where it's just like there's not enough like day hours in the day to like you know try and
2030880	2037200	put this together and monetize this and blah blah blah so I think it's you know I'm not opposed to
2037200	2041680	making money like you can just fucking make money for this shit that I've already done I'm
2041680	2049120	certainly fine with that um um but yeah I think it's just been kind of a swamp with the day-to-day
2049120	2054160	kind of stuff that hasn't pushed me to sort of like like specifically put a book together
2054960	2059040	do you ever record or film your process in those two hours that you're cranking out a
2059040	2064560	personal piece oh that's another thing that I should be doing you should easy content for you
2064560	2070800	that's a layup oh I know I definitely should I definitely to be honest thought of like
2070800	2076400	different like patreon models I have a couple like I have an idea for one model and I'm not
2076400	2083280	gonna say it here but I think would be like a really like nobody's doing it and I think it would be uh
2085200	2090960	I don't know there I I again it just comes down to like hours in the fucking day and like
2092480	2100160	yeah all right uh Greg and Caleb Erica you guys have any questions for people yeah um so how's
2100160	2105520	how's your location impacted oh good one your work uh have you been able to get enough freelance work
2105520	2113840	to support yourself or have you ever had to have an additional job so I actually had a full-time job
2113840	2121520	up until uh less than four years ago um I worked when I I went to school for computer science and
2121520	2125920	like halfway through it was like you know fuck this this is boring as hell uh and so I started
2125920	2132320	doing design shit and then when I got out of school I got a job doing web design and um so I
2132320	2140000	had a long stretch and well the job was super super easy and I was able to do like a shit like most
2140000	2148560	of the freelance that I did was at work I would be working on like work for her M&M or like you know
2148560	2158080	fucking uh a bunch of different like big artists and uh like people would come over and just I kind
2158080	2164880	of like hide the logos on kind of like this sort of time they're like what do you work on it's like
2164880	2176160	this is just nothing I don't know so when I quit my job um I was actually making more money about
2176160	2184720	50% more money doing freelance than the actual day job so I was fairly like I had a good like
2184720	2189200	kind of ramp up there in terms of like freelance and to be honest like freelance was never something
2189200	2195280	that I like uh kind of like sought out to do like it was never really like a goal like I want to
2195280	2200480	like eventually like do freelance I really liked being in an office and the people that I like
2200560	2205600	worked with were like really good friends so it was like and I actually asked the like place that
2205600	2208800	I worked was like is there any way I could still like come in here and just like do my own thing
2208800	2214960	in the corner and they're like no because they were like a software company it was all like
2214960	2219280	programmers just like what the fuck are you talking about no you can't do that you quit like so anyway
2219280	2227120	so like I uh and this was back in Wisconsin like all the clients that I worked for were like LA
2227120	2233600	New York wherever like none of them were in Wisconsin so um yeah I think I've been lucky enough
2233600	2241840	that there's always kind of been enough work coming in and it the location never made a difference
2241840	2251600	like I've never gone into a place to work um so yeah well you know you could find the a
2251680	2257840	co-working space these things exist and you could be around the human beings there was one in
2257840	2262640	Appleton where I lived because I was in a small town and it was kind of gross to be honest like I
2262640	2268880	went and looked at it and it was kind of like this is kind of nasty a little bit uh and there is one
2268880	2275920	in Charleston I just haven't gone there part of the reason is um like I need a lot of like
2276720	2283040	rendering power so I can work off a laptop but it's really like kind of tying my hands behind
2283040	2292640	my back to like go sit and work off the laptop uh so that's one reason that I kind of don't love it
2293280	2299120	I say it's not as established in smaller towns as like we don't have like we works and shit like
2299120	2305760	or what we work yeah we work very well yeah we don't have those like here like I'm not like
2305760	2310320	downtown Charleston I'm like way the fuck out in the like suburbs where it's like super cheap like
2311200	2317280	yeah because that's where you're keeping all the money well that's another honestly that's
2317280	2323760	another thing that I don't think people like recognize is like these big cities are so fucking
2323840	2331520	expensive like I you know it's just like like people are like why don't you like move to LA and
2331520	2336880	it's like I will never move to LA as much as this was back when I was living in Wisconsin
2336880	2342400	as much as you would never move to Wisconsin that's how much I'll never wait let's get into this
2342400	2347920	discussion a little bit here now let's not assume I would never move to Wisconsin I know it's cold
2348000	2353760	there sometimes you wouldn't fucking move to where I live why wouldn't you move to LA
2354480	2361200	because it's just too expensive it's just way too expensive I just like the the you know
2361200	2365680	buddies that I have there and I love I like LA the fucking weather is beautiful it's like
2365680	2372320	never fucking rains like what there's tons of jobs like I I totally get the draw right
2373040	2378960	there's a lot going on there's tons of work there's tons of cool shit like weather's beautiful
2379680	2381520	everybody's beautiful like
2385200	2391680	it's paradise but it comes at a fucking price it does come at a price like to me like you know I
2391680	2398320	want to have a yard the kids can run around and I can have a you know office and shit and we can
2399120	2404720	not feel like we're like crammed in you know this and that like when I the amount that you know
2404720	2411520	I got buddies that are paying for apartments it's just like oh my god gotta be fucking kidding me
2411520	2421200	never okay okay hold on but if you were uh you landed some big sponsorship deals if you
2421760	2425920	had printed this book that everybody's saying here like I take my money shut up and take my money
2425920	2430480	already and somebody's like I'll put it together and then I will buy it from you after I work on it
2430480	2435920	so there's that if you actually taped or recorded your screen while you're working in and grew your
2435920	2440080	YouTube channel I'm sure there's a lot of people who would get in on it because I was thinking I
2440080	2444400	forget the guy's name I want to say his name is Dean but I'm not sure but he's an ultra marathon
2444400	2449680	runner like he runs marathon like night after night I see you as that guy there's there's only a few
2449680	2454720	human beings who could do the things that you do so consistently for so long maybe it's going to be a
2454720	2458000	Guinness world record at some point but there's going to be people who are going to want to get
2458000	2462640	behind and support you maybe red bull wants to support you you know because you're just jamming
2462640	2469440	dude or an energizer as the as a battery company or Duracell you know if you can hook those up I'll
2469440	2475760	hook it up you got my fucking email address all right we will talk after this check look check it
2475760	2480560	out my LA agent it's going to call your Wisconsin agent or your Charleston agent all right we're
2480560	2484480	going to get this to happen so it's been an interesting thing so I have a couple other
2484480	2489360	questions because I hear this a lot I hear this from our community so much do you think your
2489360	2502080	clients care where you live um my clients specifically yeah no they don't it's never so here the other
2502160	2511120	thing is I don't like um taking on new clients to be honest I like working with people that uh there's
2511120	2518640	no drama that it's like um just going to be some like chill thing where it's not like this like
2520400	2523440	you know I don't want to work with assholes where it turns into this big
2524400	2530320	you know the fucking bullshit and the clients you know last second expectations like no I don't
2530320	2536080	want to work I don't want that shit like I would rather work on something boring than with like
2536080	2542800	people cool people who are like chill like some crazy fucking you know prestigious thing and the
2542800	2548640	people are assholes and it's super stressful I don't want that like bullshit stress um so I don't
2548640	2553760	really take on like a huge amount of like new clients um so the people that I've worked with I've
2553760	2559280	worked with for years super good friends with and you know I'd rather like work with a company that
2559280	2564960	you know I've worked with uh over a long period of time and like all the companies that I work with
2564960	2569760	that I have like existing relationships with they don't give a shit like where I live
2571840	2577200	so there's a lot of people it's not something that's ever like it's never like oh you know are you
2577200	2583360	going to move to LA it's like they know I'm not moving to LA so it's it's not even on the like
2583360	2587120	radar I guess well you had mentioned this before that you don't even have a demo reel that you
2587120	2591200	go to your site it's like this is your personal work you don't put up your commercial work so
2591200	2594960	most of the people I assume that are finding you are finding you through one of your many social
2594960	2599200	media outlets and you're just blown away by the work that you do the spam that you put out there
2599200	2603520	as you call it that's the most artful spam I've ever seen that doesn't ask you for anything it
2603520	2608480	doesn't want your money your spam is I'll give you this stuff for free that's incredible spam so
2608480	2612960	they're onboarded and the reason why I want to make a point of this is because there are people
2612960	2617120	from all over the world that watch our channel and our show and they think oh I need to be in
2617120	2621520	New York or LA or I need to be in Germany or London or wherever it is and the truth of matter is
2621520	2626400	it is you don't and and that's a cop out I think it's because if you were people and you lived in
2626400	2630720	Cairo you could pull this off if you were people and you lived in some remote part of town which
2630720	2634880	actually you do live in a remote part of town you could still pull this off and it's you have to
2634880	2638800	start looking inward and saying are you making something that's valuable that's inspiring are you
2638800	2643440	consistently out there and been and somewhat vulnerable by putting this stuff out there
2643440	2647280	and that's the problem that a lot of people in our creative community have which is
2647280	2650960	they they want to get it perfect and so a year goes by two years go by and the site hasn't
2650960	2655680	launched and the the reel wasn't finished or that personal project was never done and I say this
2655680	2660640	from experience we've suffered from this too you know we hang on to this be honest like I think
2660640	2666160	well thank that it's like I'm this you know I just do whatever I've set my mind to and it's like
2666160	2671840	no I'm like really like strong like I've been working on a short film and I like fucking
2671840	2677600	struggled if I should have worked on it this morning and I fucking didn't so I there's I think
2677600	2682800	that every day's are kind of its own little sort of like bubble like I totally get that like oh
2682800	2689760	fuck I should have done XYZ and I didn't do it because of motivation to be honest and I also
2689760	2695440	kind of like get the whole like I want to move to like LA or New York or whatever I'm not like
2695440	2702880	trying to like say that that's like dumb um I think it's I think there's something to be said like
2702880	2707040	those places have a lot of opportunities and there's a lot of companies where they do want
2707040	2713920	you to come in and to be honest if you are somebody who is like starting out uh like
2713920	2717920	right out of school or something like that I would recommend that you do not go freelance
2717920	2722320	right away that you go to one of those companies because I think you're gonna learn a lot more
2722400	2730560	I never got that I think I uh took the long way the long path um but I think there's so much to
2730560	2735600	learn being around people who like no more it's like no no no click on this this morning I just
2735600	2741040	struggled with something for like fucking hours that I guarantee somebody like a senior level
2741040	2745360	person who knows this program or been like just click this and it's like I don't have that person
2745360	2752000	here so I recommend that young people go to like a good studio and like work there for a couple
2752000	2758000	years before you like do freelance that's what I would good advice I don't know if you know
2758000	2762880	Joshua Davis but he's saying oh hi there handsome I'm assuming he's not talking about me you must
2762880	2769360	be talking about you yeah you guys those of you guys that know Mike personally go ahead and give
2769360	2773680	him a hard time in the chat right now uh bring up some embarrassing stories things that he would
2773680	2778320	rather sooner forget and we'll discuss that live on air right now please do us a favor
2778400	2782800	Greg Caleb look out for those comments right now let's get those stories in there the time you
2782800	2788880	got drunk and did something stupid um Brenda is asking has your wife ever been like this everyday
2788880	2797920	thing it's enough now no not remotely my my um family is like insanely supportive and they have
2797920	2804560	been from day one but now even more so like my mom will be like it's time to do it like we're just
2804560	2807840	sitting around shooting the shit and it's like nine o'clock it's like don't you have to do your
2807840	2816960	everyday like they're insanely insanely like supportive because they've seen what's come from
2816960	2824080	it and they've seen they know how important it is to me they know how you know serious I take uh
2824080	2831280	you know the project as a whole I think it's it's this tough sort of mix between like taking uh
2831280	2837520	the entire thing like super fucking serious that you're gonna commit to putting in like hours a day
2837520	2844640	but not taking each sort of day so serious that it paralyzes you from like putting out work
2844640	2852000	that it's like that's soft tomorrow's another day yeah so this weird kind of like balance between
2852000	2858800	those two things um but no my wife is insanely insanely supportive um and to be honest I mean
2858880	2865760	every day is her was put on a table so it's kind of like uh I mean she gets that for sure the like
2865760	2875280	personal work is what brings in uh you know client work uh so she she kind of sees the whole
2875280	2880400	sort of picture there right and I think the part about that is not being like a douche lord about
2880400	2889520	like doing something like this not being like I'm an artist like you need to fuck that like you need
2889520	2896080	to be like a human and like a fucking person first and like you know if I have to do it at this
2896080	2901360	on community in community time where I get you know uh interrupted because kids had a
2901360	2907040	fucking blowout or some shit then it's like okay well then you know I I think trying to like
2907840	2914160	accommodate your family schedule will give them a lot make it they're buying a lot easier
2914160	2920000	will make it a lot easier for you to like stick with something like that good advice good advice
2920000	2924160	and I'm I'm speaking from experience my wife fully supports the endeavor that we do call the
2924160	2928720	future because there were many years we did this when it was a giant time suck and there was no
2928720	2933280	return on it at all and now it's starting to pay off and everybody's seeing if you do something
2933280	2936880	that you love your passion you share openly good things can happen now I do want to tell you
2936880	2940800	a couple of comments in here because there's there's a funny little dialogue going on in chat
2940800	2945680	so Catherine Adams is saying hey buy a house in East LA it's still affordable and Joshua Davis
2945680	2950640	quickly responds no because he's going to want to move to suburbers in New York with me so they're
2950640	2955360	like fighting for what city you're going to move to right and then Perfect Hue comes back LA is
2955360	2963600	where it's at so you know uh oh we got a little east coast west coast where do we start all right
2964320	2969600	what else is going on you guys anything else yeah so there's a question on YouTube from Rowan
2969600	2975120	who's asking you know Mike how do you balance your time with all these different things with
2975120	2981840	family um with client projects and freelance and with having to put out every day every day
2982560	2989440	I would say not well I feel like I wasted a ton of time I feel like I'm like extremely goddamn
2989440	2999360	distracted all day like just fucking news and dumb Trump bullshit and just I feel like it's
2999360	3008160	definitely a struggle to like stay focused do the thing like uh so yeah I I I don't really have any
3008160	3014480	sort of like get up and blah blah blah and do this and then drink a protein shake and like I don't
3014480	3022720	have like some like like how do you how do you bring your focus back to what you're doing or what
3022720	3030480	you need to do um bad lines again that's what is sort of like having a deadline by the end of the
3030480	3035840	day it kind of forces focus because it's sort of like what's got to be done by midnight so
3036480	3044000	10 o'clock I have to focus like uh so yeah I think if you can get in this like habit that
3044000	3049920	you've got something that is like a deadline like that like deadlines I feel like are uh just
3050640	3057600	insanely um insanely good I don't know what the right word is but they really like
3058560	3063680	help put work out and when I have you have a deadline that's literally every single day
3063680	3068160	you will produce something right and I tons of other people like who started it every
3068160	3072960	days and it's like I've seen like a huge amount of growth from like you know a bunch of different
3072960	3081360	people so it's definitely you know not just you know me right right I think there's a saying
3081360	3086240	like creativity expands or contracts to meet deadlines so deadlines help you get stuff done
3086240	3090880	right yeah because it's sort of like there's you know especially with a personal project there's an
3090880	3097120	infinite amount of choices you have nothing like holding your fucking you know nose to the whatever
3097680	3103920	then it's sort of like you're just floating around in artists world fucking whatever versus okay I
3103920	3111840	gotta put some shit down here it's it's 11 o'clock like let's what are we doing today uh you know it
3111840	3117760	kind of narrows your your focus I'm gonna ask this question because Brendan keeps typing this in and
3117760	3123280	I want to make sure he gets his question answered here is do you have any particular strategy when
3123280	3127920	you were first starting out how you were able to get critical mass and grow a following any tips
3127920	3134000	for people who are trying to do the same thing uh not really come on dig deep dude come on give
3134000	3141200	us some tips well so here's the thing uh when I started out this was before Facebook the first
3142000	3147600	probably two years I was just posting a website and literally nobody fucking saw that shit
3147600	3158080	fucking nobody so uh there's been no sort of like I would say the epiphany is do something for
3158080	3167760	10 years and just have patience with it um I I think posting on all of the sites um regularly
3167760	3174560	I think helps um because I think with a lot of these sites you don't really know which um
3175520	3182000	is gonna be popular you know years from now like I didn't I didn't think Instagram was gonna be as
3182000	3188880	popular as it is now like back when you know it was like oh here's this cool filter app um you know
3188880	3194720	I didn't see that coming until like not real popular um so I think kind of not putting all
3194720	3200800	of your eggs in one basket I would say I guess is some advice um beyond that though I feel like I'm
3200800	3210400	not very good at sort of like engaging with uh like audience on social media um just because
3210400	3217600	it takes a lot of time um it's just not something that I've like done that much or feel
3219760	3228720	uh I don't know I just don't engage as much as I probably should or could to kind of like
3228960	3234080	grow my audience more I guess so it sounds to me like you're you're saying like you've been doing
3234080	3240640	this for a long time and it wasn't necessarily uh to to get famous or to grow following you did it
3240640	3245120	and then when the platforms became available and you you did this more consistently than most artists
3245120	3249680	which is you post on pretty much every platform you can find which it makes it very easy to find
3249680	3255920	you every day I post on Facebook all these by hand that I don't have any like aggregator that's one
3256000	3261280	aggregator that's one other thing that I would recommend is and I asked somebody that actually
3261280	3267600	at adobe about this and because I always suspected this that if you use like an aggregator it will
3267600	3276320	kind of like ding uh you'll you'll get dinged a little bit on um on how much it will be shown to
3276320	3281760	people if they see that you like push it out to all the platforms it wants so I post natively on
3281760	3289120	each one of the platforms Facebook Twitter Tumblr uh my website Instagram
3294480	3297680	yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow that I was going to give you a bell for every
3297680	3302400	platform that you mentioned and I'm there with you I really believe in posting natively
3303360	3309040	well you have to I mean you will definitely get dinged which I always suspected and he was like
3309040	3314000	yes that's definitely true that if you're not posting natively to the platform if it concedes
3314000	3318720	you're using some aggregator it will like ding it and show your posts to less people
3320080	3323760	and you mentioned before when you went to school can you tell us what you studied in school and
3323760	3329360	where you went to school I went to Purdue University and studied computer science oh wow
3331520	3338240	Purdue University is not really that like prestigious of a school nothing against people
3338240	3343040	went to Purdue there goes this uh the sponsorship from the school
3346720	3352480	I think people have just used Purdue that it's a lot more prestigious than it is because especially
3352480	3360960	in Wisconsin too it was like oh my gosh wow oh jeez you got into Purdue from UW Madison like it's not
3361120	3368080	it was not as prestigious as you would think it's not private it's not like it's not really
3368080	3374880	that prestigious it's got a good computer science uh um and a good engineering like program but
3375680	3382800	it's not like fucking MIT or one of these things it's definitely like it's pretty good okay Mike I
3382800	3388160	have to say something I feel like midwesterners make a sport out of self-deprecation you guys
3388160	3392640	really like let's try to one up each other on that kind of stuff I'm just curious about that mindset
3392640	3396720	like oh cool you studied computer science you went to Purdue you're like nah it's not that good
3396720	3401600	they let anybody in it's not really good it's not as good as Madison and I got fucking rejected for
3401600	3407680	Madison I think they're regretting it now though let me tell you they're regretting it
3409520	3417600	no no I mean to be honest I was never never gonna be like a programmer it just was immediately like
3417600	3422880	in school I was immediately just doing little artful shit like and before school too like I
3422880	3427360	don't know what I was thinking with that so what yeah like why did you study computer science
3427360	3433120	were you told by your your video games like I want to make video games and then I like realized
3433120	3438400	that it's like I remember specifically when I was like nope I saw this kid and he was just
3439120	3446640	so far fucking more advanced than everybody and was just like nope not doing that like that
3446640	3452320	kid's gonna do that that kid's gonna do whatever the fuck he wants but I'm not gonna do that because
3452320	3457360	I don't want to compete against that kid I can't compete against that kid and to be honest like he
3457360	3462080	was spending all of his free time making video games I wasn't doing that I was spending all my
3462080	3467680	free time doing like design shit so I kind of realized that it's like okay well it seems like
3467680	3473520	this design shit is what I really want to do uh maybe I should try and do that did you wind up
3473520	3480480	graduating from Purdue yeah I it was definitely fucking tough I'm not going to say it was not
3480480	3488480	tough it was definitely very hard but I felt like I would have that to fall back on if the design
3488480	3495200	thing right yeah I had no portfolio out of school uh luckily the design scene in Wisconsin is not as
3495680	3502400	uh competitive as you might imagine so I was able to get a job
3504400	3511680	relatively little experience but again I kind of I mean I say that but I did actually have
3511680	3517200	a decent amount of experience because I spent a lot of time doing personal work in college so I did
3517200	3524880	definitely have like some shit to show even though you know I kind of didn't go to a design school
3525920	3529680	that's interesting I mean I think people are going to be able to jump into your storyline here
3529680	3535440	in a number of ways because you did what most people do um you you pursue the safe route the
3535440	3540640	thing that is supposed to make you financially stable you did something respectable and studied
3540640	3544480	computer science you graduated but you had that burning thing inside of you that said you wanted
3544480	3550160	to make art you're living kind of in a not exactly the hotbed of whatever it is that you're doing
3550160	3555040	yet you're able to carve your way through make your own thing get a job figure out that
3555040	3559040	you're you're more you're destined for more things and so you wind up going freelance you're
3559040	3565840	like living the dream man congratulations man I don't I don't know about that but yeah I think if
3565840	3574320	I I don't think it's um yeah I think it's just about fucking persistence like I think uh
3576000	3583280	not persistent patience I think that it's it's been I'm like me preaching all patients is like
3583280	3590480	the fucking dumbest most just absolute give me a break thing because I feel like I have very very
3590480	3596960	little patience but I think it's definitely especially for people starting out uh you know
3596960	3602080	and it's tough especially with social media I think it would have been I don't know how this
3602080	3610480	like that this would have happened had this started in the age of social media I would be
3610480	3615120	I don't know I wonder about that a lot if if I would have stuck with this or if it would have
3615120	3620080	even like started at all to be honest or how it would have been different had I like started this
3620800	3626480	in an era of like Instagram and Tumblr and all this other bullshit um because I think those
3626480	3635440	companies are they're very I think people don't realize how uh like how much they shape a lot of
3635440	3640960	what we do I mean look at this like future that you guys are building this platform almost entirely
3640960	3650800	on the backs of Google Facebook like that's a big a piece of what we're like how we like interact
3650800	3657040	with each other every single day so I don't know I don't know I I don't know how that would have
3657040	3663120	turned out differently okay um all right uh Matt Kendall and in I think a lot of people on the
3663120	3667440	internet want to know this because you mentioned this before but what's your rendering rig
3667440	3677680	like let's see if we can get another sponsor um so I just bought two new computers um because it
3677680	3682080	was a long time and I kind of put it off for a while because it was this damn crypto bullshit
3682080	3689520	it was just driving up the fucking price of cards I just bought two new computers um with
3689520	3700080	four uh 1080 ti's in each of them um so it was a little price for four 1080 ti's that's the video
3700080	3709040	card yeah who makes the 1080 ti what's up who makes that uh navidia in media or navidia is that you
3709040	3714720	say it navidia yeah you never heard of navidia I thought you said I thought you say nvidia but
3714720	3721360	navidia oh maybe yeah okay I'm probably I don't know no I don't know I know probably nvidia yeah
3721360	3730800	maybe I don't know and did you build your own box or is it uh so yes and no um it's put together I've
3730800	3740480	got a buddy who um helped me fry baker shout out um you kind of like pick components um and then uh my
3740480	3747280	dad actually like physically put it together because my hands are dumb uh and I'm like not
3747280	3752960	remotely like mechanically sort of minded but yeah they're like custom boxes or whatever okay

3810560	3819840	are you doing anything in AR VR uh yeah I'm doing uh concept work for magically right now
3820560	3828080	and I've done a couple um VR projects in the past so yeah it's definitely something that I'm
3828880	3834000	interested in okay I know some people in LA and I told them that after I talked to you today that
3834000	3839280	I'll introduce you to them because they do a lot of concert stuff and they do 3D stereoscopic
3839280	3844480	interactive stuff it's super cool um and they do it really well so I'll connect you guys in case
3844480	3850160	there's an opportunity for you guys to to work together they're big fans of yours what's that
3850160	3856880	what's the name of the company it's called 3D live I'll connect you later I think I don't
3856880	3862640	did they reach out to you maybe I can't there's one that's like that uh Nate what's the guy's name
3863360	3868880	uh Nate Huber and who's the other guy you Ryan Ryan Ryan and Nate
3870720	3875600	don't worry I'll connect you after the show all right okay let's see what else we got going on
3875600	3878960	in the chat are you guys monitoring Facebook is anybody asking anything on Facebook yeah yeah
3878960	3884800	we're showing some love we have a question from Owen and he was wondering how do you keep the
3884800	3889840	everyday's from causing you stress and anxiety um because you're talking about your mindset a little
3889920	3894800	bit earlier about not taking it too seriously but how do you keep yourself from taking it so seriously
3896320	3902320	um again I think it's one of those things where I I feel like I've been lucky that the like sort of
3902320	3908480	like audience is kind of like ramped up slowly over you know 11 years um because it's one of those
3908480	3913360	things where I see people like you know push it a couple things on Instagram and it's just blown
3913360	3918960	off and now suddenly they've got you know 100,000 followers I'm sure that's got to be like a bit
3919040	3925120	freaky to like uh you know post something like is this good blah blah blah and there again I think
3925120	3932080	the format of project I don't have any like time to like stress out over it is this good it's like
3932080	3940400	not socks but 11 o'clock I have to post it so there's it takes that like self doubt out of it
3940400	3947360	because it's just like there's no choice I have to post it um so you know and after I post something
3947360	3952640	and it's like oh it's fucking terrible it's definitely like there's some sense of like god
3952640	3958560	damn it like because it's always like you're you're always gonna fall short when you put two hours
3958560	3964000	into something you're never gonna be like oh my god fucking crushed it Don you don't even know like
3964000	3972400	it's it's just it's just a such a short period of time it's just gonna be a sketch um so I think
3973200	3976720	it's always gonna be tough but there again you've got the next day so it's like okay well
3976720	3980880	today I'm gonna fucking buckle down and we're gonna fucking crush it today so I think it's
3980880	3986240	it's one of those things where you can only get so butt hurt about you know two days ago
3987040	3991360	when you've already made you know it's out of the next thing it's like there's no like
3992720	3996480	you can't regret the last thing because you have to like be focused on what the fuck am I doing
3996480	4000640	today like fuck yesterday yesterday sucked whatever what let's try make today not suck
4001200	4003680	um you can't get too in your head with it I guess
4005760	4011280	I love that that thinking that's that's so refreshing to hear it's like I don't know that's
4011280	4018480	really great um I have a question on YouTube it's from Andy and Andy asks what would you
4018480	4025520	do every day if you didn't have to do every day's if you couldn't do every day's not have to because
4026080	4031200	one day it was your question yeah I get it if I wasn't doing every day's
4032560	4037520	you'd be doing every other day's what was what would I be doing I'd just be watching tv or some
4037520	4044400	shit more I don't know I would just be like lazy or fair enough yeah
4047520	4053920	okay ask and answer yeah there it is yeah I'm done now you know what else is um so this question
4053920	4059120	and I'm almost kind of scared to ask this question although I I don't think it'll matter at all
4059120	4067280	but quite a few people at least on YouTube have asked um do you ever plan on stopping um why would
4067280	4071760	you be scared to ask that no then other people are like don't don't ask him that because maybe he'll
4071760	4077520	stop real think like that's never crossed your mind before I don't understand the mentality of like
4077520	4085920	don't ask me that like it's gonna break me uh no I uh I don't have a plan to stop but I
4086880	4091600	I can't like I'm gonna do this forever like that sounds like a fucking long time like
4091600	4098560	I'm gonna do it today pretty sure I'm gonna do it tomorrow you know being like I'm gonna do this
4098560	4106080	for the next 30 years whatever like that seems a little like daunting so uh I think to be honest
4106560	4113760	the reason I started doing this was to get better and that need to get better and that
4113760	4118560	desire and that like looking at other people's work and just feeling that they're absolutely
4118560	4123520	fucking crushing me and that I really like need to like do whatever I can to get better that has
4123520	4128320	not changed at all like I still go on the internet and look at people's work and it's like fuck I
4128320	4136640	can't do that so like uh so the whole reason I started this like nothing's changed I I've gotten
4136640	4140880	better for sure I've gotten better I've seen improvement but I still look at people's work
4140880	4146720	and it's like no not they're not even close like so many people's work like not even close
4148480	4153440	all right people I have a new segment I want to play with you it's called verses but before I get
4153440	4158480	the verses I want to read something from the internet here they're saying that man won't you
4158480	4163280	just do a training course or something and how dare they mention some competing network
4163280	4167440	oh there you guys watch this channel mention somebody else no that's cool what did they mention
4168160	4173680	no we're not gonna talk about them come on you can read the comments after the show guys
4173680	4178240	you guys you're about to whoever wrote that comment you're gonna be putting a timeout box
4178240	4182880	any second right now if you do that again but having said that I want to I want to mention to people
4183440	4188320	that we actually offer courses and relevant relevant to what we're talking about here
4189760	4196080	we teach a motion design course style frames and Matthew does a really great job of breaking down
4196080	4200240	how to do this in case you're not a genius like people who study computer science but can still
4200240	4207520	make amazing computer art we're trying to help you with what we are the courses that we're offering
4207520	4213520	you see how I did that so smoothly that's super super smooth see how a pitch man like me does it
4213520	4220160	people that's how you do it and just just for a couple of like the the guys that are watching on
4220160	4224800	there when they're like oh what a freaking idiot he doesn't know what the video card is I'm the one
4224800	4231920	who pronounced it correctly it is Nvidia not the video Nvidia somebody's like I work down the street
4231920	4239200	from them it's called Nvidia and Christmas right thank you that one's on me boom all right
4240480	4245200	all right now we're gonna do this thing it's a very short segment it's called versus let me hit play
4245200	4250320	here boom let me get some let me get some belfry here all right here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna
4250320	4256160	present you two scenarios oh I need to share this with you don't know who cares you don't need to see
4256160	4261760	it I'm gonna throw up two words and you just pick one or the other okay see if we can stir up some
4261760	4266160	controversy pick one or the other pick one or the other or say whatever you want but you have to
4266160	4277680	say it fast here we go you ready all right PC or Mac PC okay pen or a mouse mouse mm-hmm two wheels
4277680	4282800	or four wheels four wheels Targaryen or Stark
4288640	4293920	I don't their names I don't remember all their oh my god I thought you're Game of Thrones fan
4294480	4299520	oh no I am a Game of Thrones fan but their fucking names are so fucking weird that I can't remember
4299840	4308240	Targaryen house of blah blah blah okay I'll give you one pass okay Targaryen good all right
4308240	4317360	good okay next one Marvel or DC Marvel nice good choice last one last one Pepsi or Coke
4319920	4325120	Coke I guess oh come on you gotta say it more emphatically than that all right there you go
4329840	4337920	I'm trying to get sponsors here man oh shoot that applause you guys got a little out of control
4337920	4343920	there easy with the applause you guys easy all right let's see if we start up let's take a couple
4343920	4348720	more questions and I think we've taken up enough of this good man's time I know he's got an every
4348720	4357680	day to do a lot of work right he's got children to raise a wife to to talk to and things to do so
4357680	4361440	a couple more questions and let's wrap this part up but I have one last question I mean
4361440	4366800	uh one more segment but you guys what do you got for me um yeah I have a question myself um so in
4366800	4372320	some of your personal work you have actually created your own music um for for some of your videos
4372320	4376800	and I'm kind of wondering um do you think it's important to take these interests that you have
4376800	4383840	outside of design and combine them with your work um I think it will be good I feel like I'm I used to
4383840	4388480	do music I kind of stopped just because I wanted to focus mostly on design and I thought the music
4388480	4394400	was just pretty shitty and I just wanted to kind of leave that to the experts um I feel like I'm
4394400	4402160	not very like well-rounded um I'm interested in like investing and I'm interested in the news
4402880	4408960	and then pretty much like 99 percent just like design shit um so yeah I would say probably being
4408960	4412160	more well-rounded with other outside interests would be better
4414960	4419360	was that it is that what you wanted yeah yeah that's great all right Andy Nicholson is saying
4419360	4424880	thank you and all caps people Mike not just for this but for your attitude and inspiration
4426240	4430400	I appreciate that we didn't hear any embarrassing stories I'm a little bit disappointed in Mike's
4430400	4434480	friends right now me too guys you did not come through for us I thought you guys gonna tell
4434480	4439840	some weird stories and put them on the spot oh you know what okay a couple of people have asked
4439840	4445920	since you're into investing in technology and uh 1080 what are your thoughts on crypto
4447840	4450960	oh the show just went to a weird place okay go and answer the question Mike
4451680	4462640	now I feel like it's I've got a little money uh a tiny amount of money in uh Ethereum just as like I
4463600	4470800	yeah a kind of super hedge um but I would say overall I would put money I would put money into
4470800	4475520	Amazon if that but you have one thing you should put money into I would say put money in the Amazon
4475520	4483360	I think that's all that I think it's very um I would do that or index funds I think are
4484480	4491680	like BTI or spy I think are good ones but I think Amazon has a lot more room to run
4491680	4497040	I think they're advertising businesses just getting off the ground and I think they're
4497040	4505280	too big to fail solid investment advice from Mike boom I have one quick follow-up question
4505280	4511600	because super interesting too um where do you go to read up on on investments like is there a
4511600	4518640	subreddit or something you're into or a website um I've got a couple other um bodies that I uh
4519360	4525280	worked with at the uh in Wisconsin who are super into investing and there's a site um
4525280	4530480	that we've got a subscription to I think there's no one good place because nobody knows this
4530480	4535280	that's what like to me makes it interesting is there's no like you can have two fucking harvard
4535280	4539120	trained people and one's gonna say stock market's about to crash the other one's gonna say oh we're
4539120	4546080	gonna have a huge run here and nobody knows um but there's a site uh fool dot com motley fool
4546080	4551600	that has like stock picks and you can get their newsletters and it's maybe I don't even know it's
4551600	4556000	like a hundred bucks a year or something like that and they've got they've got some ideas but um
4556560	4561600	that's like hosted by kramer right is that the guy's name kramer on tnn or something like that or ms
4561600	4568400	nbc he's always yelling out the camera and it's not that guy but I mean my idea is too I mean
4568400	4573440	that's the thing I think taking a broad range and I think having your money in like a lot of different
4573440	4578240	things is another thing and I think the biggest thing is just saving your money in the first place
4578240	4584960	that's the good thing is like uh you know not having a car payment like if you're not into cars
4584960	4592800	buy a super cheap car like my car that I uh had had three hundred and fifteen thousand miles on it
4592800	4598880	it was a piece of shit like absolute piece of fucking trash like uh I think that's not a thing
4598880	4603280	but just like trying to like save as much money as possible because that's what gives you like
4604320	4609920	the flexibility to say no to projects and to do personal things if you're super fucking like
4609920	4614720	strapped every last penny is going to something then when that like kind of sketchy job where
4614720	4619920	you're like this is gonna be a shit show and I know I should not take this but I gotta fucking roll
4619920	4626080	the dice on it because I really need that fucking like money like you're gonna have to take it um so
4626160	4632800	I think having that cushion will really like allow you to say no to things and it will give you
4632800	4638640	more bargaining power too if you're like if you don't need to take a job then when you quote a job
4638640	4643840	you're gonna be quoting that job from like a position of power and like confidence and you'd
4643840	4649120	be like fuck this this is so much you I want for the job and they can take it or they cannot take
4649120	4655360	it and a lot of times they will take it um so I think uh having a cushion and just saving money
4655360	4660640	in the first place is definitely the biggest piece of that from that putting it into anything in the
4660640	4668240	stock market as long as it's not crypto I think you'll probably be in a good spot nice all right
4668240	4673200	I want to say this I think you just wrote the first chapter of the independent artist manifesto
4673200	4678080	right there don't spend a lot of money save it that way you have the power come on man
4680480	4684080	all right that's another project that we may or may not wind up doing after this show you guys
4684080	4689920	we're gonna now enter into lightning round I'm gonna ask you a few questions okay and feel free
4689920	4695280	to say whatever comes to your mind I only have five prompts for you band your favorite band

4988720	4992480	let's do this ask that's a hard-hitting question right now you guys this is bonus time you guys
4993120	5001360	okay let's see the industry in 10 years what's the industry going to be like in 10 years yeah it's
5001360	5005360	going to be dark for the people who work in advertising and in posts because the margins
5005360	5010400	are getting smaller and tighter every day we seem to be reading about another VFX company going under
