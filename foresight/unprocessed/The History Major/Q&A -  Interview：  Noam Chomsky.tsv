0	13400	Today we were able to speak to Professor Noam Chomsky on a wide range of questions coming
13400	14840	from our members.
14840	19720	His topics went from JFK to anarchism and even health care to history censorship.
19720	24280	He's the father of modern linguistics, Professor Emeritus at MIT, he's the author of well
24280	25280	over 100 books.
25960	28520	He's a world renowned and leading dissident.
28520	33880	He has a huge critic of US foreign policy and he specializes on a wide range of topics
33880	39880	such as history, politics, technology, freedom of speech, socioeconomic systems, philosophy
39880	44640	and ethics, media, propaganda, psychology and the list goes on.
44640	47760	If you're interested in learning more about him and his work you can check out his web
47760	51920	page, you're able to purchase any number of his books, you can find him all over YouTube
51920	56400	with different talks and even clips covering many different social studies related topics.
56400	62000	You can even find some major video work online such as Requiem for the American Dream, Manufacturing
62000	65680	Consent and even a Vietnam debate on firing line.
65680	70080	We were very grateful to have such a high profile figure like Noam Chomsky on and someone
70080	73680	who is really a wealth of knowledge on different social studies related topics.
73680	77520	I hope you all enjoy the talk and be sure to check out more of his work.
77520	79200	Hello Professor Chomsky!
79280	80080	Uh, hi.
81520	82240	How are you doing?
83120	85120	Okay, can you hear me?
85920	86960	Yeah, we can hear you great.
88160	88480	Good.
89520	94640	So this is our history club, a bunch of different students, grades 9 through 12.
96560	102640	It was great to see that some are big fans and you know we meet with different guest speakers
102640	104560	and we're excited to talk to you.
104640	106720	We live in Shemokin.
106720	111440	It's kind of a poor area and it's an old coal mining town.
111440	115760	So there's a lot of interesting history and yeah, we're just excited to talk to you, so.
117040	118160	Okay, great.
118880	119920	Glad to be with you.
120640	124720	Would you like us to just get into questions or is there anything that you would like?
125520	131040	Why don't you just raise questions about what you're interested in instead of
131040	133040	my talking about what's on my mind?
134480	137040	Well, they're excited for just your mind too, but yeah.
140160	141760	Okay, let's go.
142560	144000	Somebody break the ice.
146000	149200	I'll break the ice with one kid that had basketball practice.
149200	150320	He was unable to make it.
151040	158080	He did a whole project on JFK and the history and a lot of kids asked about your take on
158640	162960	conspiracy theories in general and the JFK one because he did a ton of research.
162960	164800	Obviously these files are still being leaked.
165520	167360	He checked out all of our stone stuff.
168240	172560	I'm not sure how you feel about all that, but that could be one to break the ice.
173520	181840	Well, there's I think we have to distinguish between two different kinds of questions about the
182640	184320	JFK assassination.
185280	190240	One is the question, who carried it out?
190240	191200	Who killed him?
191200	192880	And how was that done?
192880	194000	That's one question.
194640	199600	It's like a question about any other murder that took place.
200320	200960	Who did it?
201520	202480	Why'd they do it?
202480	203280	How was it done?
203280	203920	And so on.
204560	209200	So the fact that he was a president doesn't change that question.
209280	216320	It's just the forensic question that a police investigation would try to answer.
217280	225280	The other question is, did it have an impact on policy and society?
226160	227440	It's a separate question.
228000	230480	What was the effect of the assassination?
231680	237760	Was it a high level assassination that had policy consequences?
238720	240240	That's a different question.
241840	247440	About the first question, who did it, why'd they do it, and so on.
249760	252160	I don't have any particular opinion.
252160	261440	I don't see any reason much to question the standard story that it was Oswald and did it
261440	262800	for whatever reason he did.
263520	266400	But if that's wrong, okay, so it's wrong.
266400	268080	Let's find out who did do it.
268640	271200	As far as I can see, it's like any other crime.
272080	276400	You want to know who did it, why, who was responsible.
276400	278800	But I have no special insight into that.
279440	282960	The so-called conspiracy theories are mostly about that.
283520	285120	In fact, almost all about that.
285920	289440	And so you can look into them and decide what you think.
290240	294000	The other question is the one that interests me, and I've written a lot about it.
294000	299760	In fact, was it a high level plot with policy consequences?
300640	301920	Well, you can check that.
302480	305360	Take a look at the policies before and after.
305360	307520	Take a look at his positions and so on.
308320	313680	And my own view, I've written about it extensively, if you're interested in looking into it,
314400	319440	is that it basically had no serious policy consequences.
320080	324640	Policies continued as they were, same people carrying them out.
325680	335120	There are a lot of, if you look at the theories about the assassination, Oliver Stone, many others,
335920	345200	they're all motivated and based on the idea that somehow this changed the world and changed policy
345200	351040	and Kennedy was going to do all sorts of wonderful things and he was killed to try to prevent him
351040	351840	from doing them.
352720	357840	Well, we don't have evidence, any reason to believe he was planning to do all any
358560	361440	wonderful things or anything different from what was done.
363120	367440	The main issue was that point the Vietnam War was raging.
368320	376400	And so there's a huge industry trying to show that Kennedy was planning to end the war
378880	382640	and he was killed to prevent him from doing that.
383280	385440	There's not a particle of evidence for that.
386320	392320	We have a huge documentary record, internal record planning and everything.
393200	399360	It turns out that Kennedy himself was sort of towards the hawkish end of his administration.
400240	411120	He was certainly willing to end the war, but he insisted after victory, after the United States
411120	419760	wins the war, takes over South Vietnam, puts in the regime that we want and if it's stable,
419760	425440	then we can pull out. He never veered from that up until the day of the assassination
426400	433760	and the policies that were then carried out were by his advisors and they continued the same way.
434720	441440	There were claims that he was planning to do sorts of things about world peace, but
442720	444320	there's no evidence for it.
444880	449600	I mean, you can believe it if you like, but it's basically based on faith.
450400	457520	So my own view at least, and as I say, I've written extensively about it if you want to look
457520	467600	into it, but my own conclusion is that it was not a high level conspiracy with policy consequences
468400	472160	as to who killed him, who carried it out.
473040	482640	I have no special insight. I haven't looked. In fact, I've read many of the theories, but
483760	490720	they're conceivable, but I don't think they're very convincing. In fact, the Warren commission,
490720	497840	the official commission, that's not all that convincing either, but you expect that.
498560	506240	I mean, if you look at investigations of questions like this, it's not very easy to determine
507280	517520	there, unless even if you look at the court cases for killing, there are always lots of
517520	524880	questions. Life is not a simple matter. You rarely have absolutely definitive evidence.
525760	529120	It's one of the reasons, one of the many reasons I think why
530080	537600	my feeling is the United States should join most of the rest of the world and ban the death
537600	545440	sins. The United States is one of the few countries that has the death sins. I don't think it's legitimate.
547920	554320	And we have many cases where people have been in jail for 50 years on death row, and then it
554320	561760	turned out they were not guilty. There's something called the Innocence Project, run I think by a
561760	569600	law school in Chicago, which has used the DNA and other techniques to investigate
572000	578800	convictions by methods that weren't available at the time. And it turned out a fair number of cases
578800	585200	of false conviction, even when the evidence looked fairly circumstantial, evidence
586480	590400	moderately convincing. But that's a different question.
601440	605840	Is there any correlation between difference in language and culture when it comes to the
606080	607520	political point of view of stuff evil?
612240	621200	Well, that's a question that has been studied for almost a century. There's an
621920	631200	idea. It's called the Warf hypothesis, Benjamin Lee Warf, which is that a language,
631280	637120	your language determines the way you perceive and understand the world. And
640080	646640	sounds plausible on the surface, but it's been very hard to find any experimental evidence for it,
647360	657760	except in very superficial ways. So for example, there are languages that draw the
657840	666000	color spectrum is divided somewhat differently, not totally differently in different languages.
666800	674640	So some languages don't have a distinction between orange and red, let's say.
675920	682800	They just use the same word for both orange and red. And it turns out if you do perceptual
682880	691120	experiments and you present people with a stimulus that's on the red-orange border,
692400	696720	close to one, it turns out that if you ask them later what they saw,
698480	704880	people in a language like ours, which distinguishes them, will remember better what they saw than
704880	713040	people with no distinction. But that's almost trivial. When we saw something that was red,
713040	720400	we coded in our minds as red, so we'll remember who cares. But it's hard to find anything much
720400	727600	beyond that. There's been a lot of efforts and there is debate and discussion about it. So
728560	737360	it's not a settled question by any means, but for things like perception and so on,
737920	743840	very little evidence. What about beyond that? The people have a different conception of
744720	751600	one of the early proposals that was by Worf himself, which was considered very
751600	758480	significant. He was studying the Hopi language and culture and he argued that they have a
758480	769040	different conception of time. All of us think of time as kind of like a line with ourselves
769040	775200	standing at one point on the line, looking forward to the future, looking backward to the past.
775920	782240	He argued that the Hopi don't think of it that way because they don't have past, present, and
782240	788320	future in their language. They think about it in some relativistic terms and so on.
790320	797040	Problem with that proposal is that English doesn't have past, present, and future.
798160	803280	We don't have future tense in English. If you want to talk about the future, you use
804080	810640	what's called a modal word, like will or shall, which is just one of a class of modals, may,
811440	820080	might, can, will, shall. So if you apply his reasoning, we shouldn't have the
820080	825680	conception that we do have. And as far as we know that Hopi have the same conception.
826480	834960	So that just collapsed and other efforts have been made and they haven't been very successful.
834960	841760	When we get to your point, social and political consequences, it's very hard to find anything.
842720	851600	It's even for simple perceptual things, it's hard. There's a lot of loose talk about these
851680	860320	topics, but when you look into them, the arguments don't make much sense and it's
860320	866960	very hard to find evidence. But I don't think of any particular reason that we know of to think that
867920	873440	there are social and political consequences to the language that we use. You could have
874320	880160	totally different languages and have the same social, political systems. In fact, that's true
880160	888560	to an extent. Take the United States. There are people whose first language is different.
890240	898160	Take my parents, for example. My father grew up in the Ukraine. His first language was Yiddish.
898960	904880	It's the language of Jews in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe. But he had the same, he lived,
905680	914400	he came to the United States when he was 17, so he's already grown. But he had the same social,
914400	920080	he lived in the United States the same way anybody else did. I'm sure you know people who have
920880	928080	immigrant backgrounds who have different, his native language is different, but they live in
928160	947280	the same society we do. So I wanted to ask, because it's my understanding that you consider yourself
948240	953760	an anarchist, which is on the left side of the spectrum. I know it's kind of a
954720	958720	people don't like to look too much into the spectrum, but I was wondering if you could explain
958720	964080	what your definition of anarchism is or where exactly you consider yourself to be.
971280	980960	Well, at its root, anarchism grew out of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism
981520	990400	collapsed because it ran into capitalism. Capitalism is inconsistent with liberal ideas,
990400	998960	classical liberal ideas. Capitalism is based on the principle that for most of your waking life,
999920	1005760	you should be a servant who follows a master. That's called having a job.
1005760	1016880	Suppose you have a job in a factory or a McDonald's or wherever. Most of your waking life is spent
1017600	1026160	following orders, and the orders are very strict. What you can wear when you're allowed to go to
1026160	1032240	the restroom, who you're allowed to talk to, what motions you have to make, and so on.
1032880	1039920	If you're working in an Amazon warehouse, what path you have to go through to get the fastest way
1039920	1047120	from here to there and so on. So that's capitalism. It's based on the idea that there are masters
1047120	1056480	and servants. You look back at labor history, U.S. labor history, 19th century, when the industrial
1056480	1064080	system was established. Working people were bitterly opposed to it. It was an attack on their
1064720	1071440	rights and their dignity to have to follow orders. Having a job was called wage slavery.
1072160	1078800	This was such a common idea that it was a slogan of the Republican Party. The Republican Party then
1078800	1086400	was nothing like what it is today. Republican Party and Lincoln's Day, one of its principles
1086400	1094880	was that wage labor is intolerable. It's an intolerable attack on rights and freedom.
1095680	1102400	People can be wage laborers only temporarily until they can regain their freedom somehow.
1103040	1110160	That was a standard conception of American working people in the 19th century. Capitalism had to be
1110160	1118720	imposed by force. In fact, if you look back at U.S. history, the United States had a very violent
1118720	1127680	labor history, much more so than other comparable countries. Until the late 1930s, workers were
1127680	1134000	being murdered by security forces in labor actions. It didn't happen anywhere else in
1134960	1142240	the advanced countries, at least. We have a violent labor history, which in fact,
1143760	1151200	the modern period since Reagan, one of the major goals of the government, has been to
1151200	1159440	destroy the labor movement in many different ways. What's called neoliberal globalization under
1159440	1164960	Clinton, the way it was designed, was basically designed to undermine American labor,
1167120	1174720	and this goes way back. So, capitalism was inconsistent with liberal ideas,
1175280	1182240	liberal humane conceptions, working people hated it. Finally, they've come to accept it,
1182240	1187600	but I think opposition is right below the surface. Well, what's anarchism?
1188240	1196800	Anarchism says, you know, let's take the traditional ideas that authority, hierarchy,
1196800	1205360	domination are illegitimate and have a burden of proof. They have to prove their legitimacy,
1206400	1213520	show that we're legitimate. Well, sometimes you can do that. Like if I'm walking down the street
1213520	1221120	with my grandchild and the kid runs into the street and I grab his arm and pull him back,
1221120	1228320	that's authority, but I think you can give an argument for it. But any kind of dominance or
1228320	1234400	authority, whether it's in the family, whether it's patriarchal family, parents and children,
1235200	1246320	schools, social systems, economic structures and so on, political systems, unless authority can be
1246320	1252800	justified, it should be eliminated. And it can very rarely be justified when you think it through
1254000	1261520	any more than employment can. Well, anarchism just says, let's, when you find illegitimate
1261520	1269600	authority, let's dismantle it and move in towards a more free, just social arrangement.
1270160	1274720	My own feeling is that almost everybody's an anarchist when they think about it,
1275280	1280720	when they think about the kinds of structures of authority and domination that they accept
1281360	1288480	and ask, should we accept them? Is there a justification for them? They very rarely is.
1289200	1296160	Uh, you can think that through for yourself. What kinds of authority, domination and hierarchy are
1296160	1304400	legitimate? And if they're not, you should be doing something to work to get rid of them.
1305280	1307040	That's basically anarchism.
1309280	1315600	I'm touching into something you mentioned at the end there. Could you give some examples of
1315680	1319520	legitimized authority or like just authority?
1322960	1335360	I suppose, let's take Indigenous American society. If there was a conflict between two tribes,
1336320	1346960	which turned into a war, a tribe would pick a leader to determine how the fighting should
1346960	1352800	proceed during the war in particular, but they'd be picked. Then when it's over, they have no more
1352800	1357680	authority. But during the period of the war, you could say that's legitimate authority.
1358640	1364320	I think you could argue about it, but I think so. And there are other cases of legitimate
1364400	1373200	authority. So I suppose you had a democratic society. Our society is very limited democracy,
1373200	1381600	but a true democratic society in which decisions about the nature of what's happening are made by
1381600	1390560	the public and public deliberation, public thought, and then you pick somebody to administer your
1390560	1397440	decisions. Well, submitting to the authority of the administrator may make some sense, may be
1397440	1405440	legitimate as long as they're under popular control. There are other structures which I think can be
1405440	1416880	regarded as legitimate. So class, like say, your classes in school. There's a hierarchical
1416880	1425920	relation, but I think it's legitimate as long as the educational authorities themselves are
1426640	1433840	basically picked by a democratic public and kept when they're performing the tasks that
1433840	1439360	they were chosen for. Then you can say, well, under these circumstances, I'll accept the
1440080	1445760	position of authority. It's useful. That's teacher knows things I want to learn. So fine,
1445840	1450800	I'll go along with it. So I think you can find plenty of structures and societies that are
1450800	1458640	legitimate, but most of them aren't. A lot of the ones we take for granted, like having a job,
1459920	1465920	I agree with the 19th century Republican Party. That seems to be illegitimate.
1466080	1479120	So in a society like America's, right, where it's considered a capitalist structure,
1479840	1484880	how do you suggest we move away from something like capitalism and something like
1485120	1489920	syndicalism or like anarchism, where we kind of dig away from these?
1491200	1498000	Well, there are about 6,000 enterprises in the United States with
1500240	1508240	value, a couple trillion dollars, which are owned and run by the workforce. That's a step towards it.
1509120	1515360	So instead of being somebody who follows the order of a master,
1516800	1524000	you yourselves, the workforce themselves, runs the enterprise in a democratic fashion.
1524880	1531120	It's not very much developed in cooperatives. Cooperatives work sort of the same way.
1531840	1542000	People like a farming community can set up cooperatives for planting, marketing, and so on,
1542000	1548560	where there's, that's a step toward, all of these are steps towards democratic societies.
1550320	1555760	Societies where decisions that matter to people are made by the people themselves.
1556720	1565440	We don't really have, our political system is not like that. If you look at the political,
1565440	1571920	the way the political system works, it's basically run by concentrated private power.
1573360	1580720	Take something as simple as medical care. In most countries of the world, medical care is
1580720	1587040	just considered a right. You look at the universal declaration of human rights, health care is
1587040	1594000	considered a right, like a right to food and so on. The United States is an outlier. We don't have
1594000	1600800	universal medical care. Actually, we have it in a sense. We have the worst kind you can imagine.
1601840	1608880	If you're injured or you're ill and you don't have enough money for the private system,
1609440	1617200	you can go to the emergency room in the nearby hospital and they'll take care of you if they can.
1618080	1625520	Maybe give you good care. That's our universal medical system. It's the cruelest, most expensive
1626160	1635040	one that you can imagine. The cruelty is obvious. If you go to an ER in your local hospital, you'll
1635120	1641760	probably see plenty of people there who basically need a nurse practitioner, but can't get to see
1641760	1647760	a doctor because they can't afford it and don't have health insurance. So they sit around there
1647760	1655600	for a couple of days until someone takes care of them. It's very expensive. US costs, health costs
1655600	1664160	are about twice as high as comparable countries have some of the worst outcomes. You look at
1664160	1670640	infant mortality and other measures. We're down at the bottom, but that's because we're an unusually
1670640	1679280	capitalist society. The population generally favors universal health care, but you can't get it through
1679280	1686720	Congress because the people in Congress are basically paid by donors and they don't want
1686720	1693120	universal health care. They want private systems that make profit for the rich and valuable.
1694160	1699920	This is very strong in American society, so you take the less, sometimes it's worse, sometimes
1699920	1707600	it's better, but the last 40 years since Reagan have been unusually severe. There are even some
1707600	1716000	measures of it. One of the major research institutions, the Rand Corporation, is quite
1716080	1725120	conservative. It's part of basically quasi-governmental. I recently did a study on how much money was,
1725920	1732880	as they put it, transferred, I'd say robbed, but how much money was transferred from the lower
1732880	1745520	90% if the income spectrum to the top 1% since Reagan. It's about 50 trillion dollars,
1746720	1754320	basically stolen from the large majority of the population put in the pockets of the super rich
1754320	1765120	and the corporate structure. That's pretty effective highway robbery, 50 trillion dollars
1765120	1772720	out of your pockets. Well, that's the result of having a social and political system that's
1772720	1781760	dominated by concentrated private power, which essentially, if you look at, I mean,
1781760	1788960	they're very good studies of this. Turns out you can predict elections, electability,
1788960	1796480	with remarkable precision. Just by looking at campaign funding, and campaign funding mostly
1796480	1803200	comes from the very rich, the corporate structure. There are good studies on this and political,
1803200	1808400	mainstream political science. Turns out that if you look at these studies carefully,
1808400	1817120	about 70% of the population in the United States is simply not represented in Congress
1817920	1826480	in the sense that there's almost no relation between the attitudes and desires of the voters
1826480	1833680	and their own representatives. Virtually no correlation. As you move up the income scale,
1833760	1839280	you get closer relations. When you get to the very top, they're the ones who basically buy the
1841440	1849200	representatives. That's extreme distortion of political democracy. It's not that we have none.
1849200	1855680	I mean, it's not a totalitarian state. You can have a lot of freedom, a lot of things you can do,
1855680	1870000	but the United States unusually moves in this capitalist direction. You see that in a lot of
1870000	1883520	things. Take something as simple as maternal leave, care for a mother after birth. Every society
1884080	1894880	has paid maternal leave for societies, Mexico, everybody. There's the only country that doesn't
1894880	1903680	is the United States. No guaranteed maternal leave. Somebody may have it by accident or by
1903680	1908880	insurance, but you don't have it guaranteed. Aside from the United States and a couple of
1908880	1919440	Pacific islands, everybody has it. It takes a paid vacation. Americans work on average about a
1919440	1927120	month more a year than comparable societies because they have paid vacation. We don't
1928640	1935040	guarantee. You may get it by accident. Maybe your employer grants it, but it's not required.
1935760	1943440	Well, we're just kind of off the spectrum in that respect. That's because of the unusual power
1944240	1950160	of private capital, which is much more than in most other comparable societies.
1951280	1957520	It's not always been like this. During the New Deal period, when I was growing up, there were
1957520	1963360	changes in the opposite direction. They lasted through the early post-war period,
1964320	1973840	but when you get to Reagan and since they're gone, decline seriously. There are variations,
1973840	1983200	but the basic structure of the society has what I would regard, you can make your own judgments
1983200	1987280	as illegitimate structures of authority and domination.
1988080	1997680	But think it through yourself and think with you. It's interesting that a lot of what the public
1997680	2006000	wants, they just can't get because it can't get through the Congress and executive, which
2006000	2012720	is largely dominated by private capital like universal health care, for example.
2013280	2022400	So we have about six minutes, 50 seconds left. I wanted to run through a couple questions that
2022400	2027760	we tried to ask every speaker. And it's okay if you only answer one. Don't feel like rushed at all.
2028800	2034720	It does abruptly just hang up. So when there's a minute left, I'll talk to you and let you know.
2035440	2037920	But your favorite part of history and why?
2038800	2050720	I can't say. I find almost every part of history, including prehistoric human life,
2050720	2055200	very fascinating. We're an interesting species.
2057440	2064720	One of the most interesting books I've read recently is David Graber's book on prehistory,
2065600	2069280	prehistorical societies, very rich and complex.
2070880	2074880	So why is it that you're so interested and fascinated by everything then?
2077280	2084640	Because human beings are quite interesting. Biologists sometimes say that every species
2084640	2091760	is unique, but humans are the uniqueness of all. There's no other species, for example,
2091760	2097840	that can do what we're doing right now. It's a very interesting fact, if you think about it,
2098400	2105200	because humans arrived on Earth very recently. Humans emerged maybe a couple hundred thousand
2105200	2112000	years ago in evolutionary time. That's like the blink of an eye, but we're radically different
2112000	2119520	from every other species in all sorts of ways. For example, with the only species that has language
2120400	2130240	or anything like thought, reasoning capacity. I mean, I've got a couple of dogs that happen to
2130240	2136400	be sitting under the desk right now. They do all kind of complicated and interesting things, but
2136400	2145680	nothing like what any infant can do. We're just a very special species, and it's quite fascinating
2145680	2152480	to find out what's special about us. Why would you say history is important?
2155360	2163120	Well, if we want to understand, I'm not the only one who does take the Republican Party today.
2163920	2169040	They think history is very important, so important that it has to be banned.
2169280	2177920	One of the top policy programs of the Republican Party is to ban the teaching of history.
2178640	2186560	With an executive order from Trump, some being legislated by states, teachers are not allowed
2186560	2195200	to teach American history. The argument is it's divisive. It makes some people feel uncomfortable.
2195520	2202640	That's what history is. History isn't in nice fairy tales. It's the truth of what happened in
2202640	2213360	the society and why the society is the way it is today. Those who are basically fascist in mentality
2213360	2218880	don't want to talk. They understand why history is important, and we should understand too
2219600	2222400	what they're trying to ban is what we ought to try to know.
2226000	2231200	Can it be more specific?
2235200	2250880	There are two. The United States has had 400 years of brutal harsh treatment of Afro-Americans.
2251600	2257040	A couple hundred years of sheer slavery followed by a period which was
2257920	2265280	scholar, sometimes called slavery by another name, the Jim Crow period, up until the 1960s.
2265280	2275680	It's not that far back. Federal housing banned blacks. Black workers couldn't own a house,
2276240	2282160	and it comes right up to the day. That's a core part of American history.
2283840	2288640	The Republican Party is trying to ban it. They don't want you to know that because it's divisive.
2290560	2300320	That's one example. What about indigenous history? There was a rich complex indigenous society
2300320	2307760	before the white colonists came. We wiped it out. It's almost a total genocide.
2308480	2318080	We should learn about that. That's their history. We want to know about contemporary history.
2318560	2328960	It takes a Kennedy, again. Kennedy radically escalated the war in Vietnam.
2329760	2337120	It led to a war in which millions of people were killed in three countries. Vietnam, Cambodia,
2337120	2343840	Laos were practically destroyed. Should we know something about that? I think so. We want to know
2343840	2349840	our position in the world, how the world looks at us, why they do. We should know about those things.
2350880	2355600	You could just say, well, let's just repeat patriotic slogans and forget about everything.
2356320	2362800	Okay, that's a possibility. We could try to understand ourselves, who we are, why we are this
2362800	2368080	way and how we got this way, what we can do to change it, what we can do to make a better world.
2369040	2371440	Those are two choices you make your own.
2372800	2378240	We have less than one minute, probably about 50 seconds. What's your advice to high school history
2378240	2387200	students and do you have any resources to share to help us? There are plenty of resources, documentation,
2387200	2396800	oral history, tons of it. The lesson is, use your minds, critical minds. Think about
2397520	2404160	the doctrines that you hear and that are imposed. Challenge them, question them.
2405040	2411600	Maybe some of them are right. Maybe some of them are wrong. But try to find out what kind of society
2411600	2418320	we live in. Why is it this way? Can we make it better? That's the job of history.
2418320	2422400	Thank you so much for meeting with us, Professor Chomsky.
