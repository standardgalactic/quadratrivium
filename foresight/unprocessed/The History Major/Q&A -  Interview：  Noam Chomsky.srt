1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Today we were able to speak to Professor Noam Chomsky on a wide range of questions coming

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,840
from our members.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,720
His topics went from JFK to anarchism and even health care to history censorship.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,280
He's the father of modern linguistics, Professor Emeritus at MIT, he's the author of well

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
over 100 books.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,520
He's a world renowned and leading dissident.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,880
He has a huge critic of US foreign policy and he specializes on a wide range of topics

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,880
such as history, politics, technology, freedom of speech, socioeconomic systems, philosophy

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,640
and ethics, media, propaganda, psychology and the list goes on.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
If you're interested in learning more about him and his work you can check out his web

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
page, you're able to purchase any number of his books, you can find him all over YouTube

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,400
with different talks and even clips covering many different social studies related topics.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,000
You can even find some major video work online such as Requiem for the American Dream, Manufacturing

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
Consent and even a Vietnam debate on firing line.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
We were very grateful to have such a high profile figure like Noam Chomsky on and someone

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,680
who is really a wealth of knowledge on different social studies related topics.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
I hope you all enjoy the talk and be sure to check out more of his work.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
Hello Professor Chomsky!

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
Uh, hi.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,240
How are you doing?

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Okay, can you hear me?

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,960
Yeah, we can hear you great.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,480
Good.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
So this is our history club, a bunch of different students, grades 9 through 12.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,640
It was great to see that some are big fans and you know we meet with different guest speakers

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
and we're excited to talk to you.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
We live in Shemokin.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,440
It's kind of a poor area and it's an old coal mining town.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,760
So there's a lot of interesting history and yeah, we're just excited to talk to you, so.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
Okay, great.

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
Glad to be with you.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,720
Would you like us to just get into questions or is there anything that you would like?

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,040
Why don't you just raise questions about what you're interested in instead of

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
my talking about what's on my mind?

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Well, they're excited for just your mind too, but yeah.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay, let's go.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Somebody break the ice.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
I'll break the ice with one kid that had basketball practice.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
He was unable to make it.

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,080
He did a whole project on JFK and the history and a lot of kids asked about your take on

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,960
conspiracy theories in general and the JFK one because he did a ton of research.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,800
Obviously these files are still being leaked.

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
He checked out all of our stone stuff.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm not sure how you feel about all that, but that could be one to break the ice.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Well, there's I think we have to distinguish between two different kinds of questions about the

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,320
JFK assassination.

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,240
One is the question, who carried it out?

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,200
Who killed him?

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,880
And how was that done?

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,000
That's one question.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,600
It's like a question about any other murder that took place.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Who did it?

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,480
Why'd they do it?

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
How was it done?

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,920
And so on.

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
So the fact that he was a president doesn't change that question.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,320
It's just the forensic question that a police investigation would try to answer.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,280
The other question is, did it have an impact on policy and society?

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,440
It's a separate question.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,480
What was the effect of the assassination?

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,760
Was it a high level assassination that had policy consequences?

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
That's a different question.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,440
About the first question, who did it, why'd they do it, and so on.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,160
I don't have any particular opinion.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:21,440
I don't see any reason much to question the standard story that it was Oswald and did it

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
for whatever reason he did.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
But if that's wrong, okay, so it's wrong.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's find out who did do it.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,200
As far as I can see, it's like any other crime.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
You want to know who did it, why, who was responsible.

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
But I have no special insight into that.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,960
The so-called conspiracy theories are mostly about that.

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
In fact, almost all about that.

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,440
And so you can look into them and decide what you think.

75
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
The other question is the one that interests me, and I've written a lot about it.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,760
In fact, was it a high level plot with policy consequences?

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
Well, you can check that.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,360
Take a look at the policies before and after.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
Take a look at his positions and so on.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,680
And my own view, I've written about it extensively, if you're interested in looking into it,

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
is that it basically had no serious policy consequences.

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,640
Policies continued as they were, same people carrying them out.

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:35,120
There are a lot of, if you look at the theories about the assassination, Oliver Stone, many others,

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:45,200
they're all motivated and based on the idea that somehow this changed the world and changed policy

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,040
and Kennedy was going to do all sorts of wonderful things and he was killed to try to prevent him

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,840
from doing them.

87
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, we don't have evidence, any reason to believe he was planning to do all any

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,440
wonderful things or anything different from what was done.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,440
The main issue was that point the Vietnam War was raging.

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,400
And so there's a huge industry trying to show that Kennedy was planning to end the war

91
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,640
and he was killed to prevent him from doing that.

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
There's not a particle of evidence for that.

93
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,320
We have a huge documentary record, internal record planning and everything.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,360
It turns out that Kennedy himself was sort of towards the hawkish end of his administration.

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:51,120
He was certainly willing to end the war, but he insisted after victory, after the United States

96
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,760
wins the war, takes over South Vietnam, puts in the regime that we want and if it's stable,

97
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,440
then we can pull out. He never veered from that up until the day of the assassination

98
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,760
and the policies that were then carried out were by his advisors and they continued the same way.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,440
There were claims that he was planning to do sorts of things about world peace, but

100
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,320
there's no evidence for it.

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,600
I mean, you can believe it if you like, but it's basically based on faith.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,520
So my own view at least, and as I say, I've written extensively about it if you want to look

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:47,600
into it, but my own conclusion is that it was not a high level conspiracy with policy consequences

104
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,160
as to who killed him, who carried it out.

105
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:02,640
I have no special insight. I haven't looked. In fact, I've read many of the theories, but

106
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,720
they're conceivable, but I don't think they're very convincing. In fact, the Warren commission,

107
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,840
the official commission, that's not all that convincing either, but you expect that.

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,240
I mean, if you look at investigations of questions like this, it's not very easy to determine

109
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:37,520
there, unless even if you look at the court cases for killing, there are always lots of

110
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,880
questions. Life is not a simple matter. You rarely have absolutely definitive evidence.

111
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
It's one of the reasons, one of the many reasons I think why

112
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,600
my feeling is the United States should join most of the rest of the world and ban the death

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,440
sins. The United States is one of the few countries that has the death sins. I don't think it's legitimate.

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,320
And we have many cases where people have been in jail for 50 years on death row, and then it

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,760
turned out they were not guilty. There's something called the Innocence Project, run I think by a

116
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,600
law school in Chicago, which has used the DNA and other techniques to investigate

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,800
convictions by methods that weren't available at the time. And it turned out a fair number of cases

118
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,200
of false conviction, even when the evidence looked fairly circumstantial, evidence

119
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,400
moderately convincing. But that's a different question.

120
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,840
Is there any correlation between difference in language and culture when it comes to the

121
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
political point of view of stuff evil?

122
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Well, that's a question that has been studied for almost a century. There's an

123
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:31,200
idea. It's called the Warf hypothesis, Benjamin Lee Warf, which is that a language,

124
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,120
your language determines the way you perceive and understand the world. And

125
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,640
sounds plausible on the surface, but it's been very hard to find any experimental evidence for it,

126
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:57,760
except in very superficial ways. So for example, there are languages that draw the

127
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:06,000
color spectrum is divided somewhat differently, not totally differently in different languages.

128
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,640
So some languages don't have a distinction between orange and red, let's say.

129
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,800
They just use the same word for both orange and red. And it turns out if you do perceptual

130
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:31,120
experiments and you present people with a stimulus that's on the red-orange border,

131
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,720
close to one, it turns out that if you ask them later what they saw,

132
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,880
people in a language like ours, which distinguishes them, will remember better what they saw than

133
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:53,040
people with no distinction. But that's almost trivial. When we saw something that was red,

134
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,400
we coded in our minds as red, so we'll remember who cares. But it's hard to find anything much

135
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,600
beyond that. There's been a lot of efforts and there is debate and discussion about it. So

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,360
it's not a settled question by any means, but for things like perception and so on,

137
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,840
very little evidence. What about beyond that? The people have a different conception of

138
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,600
one of the early proposals that was by Worf himself, which was considered very

139
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,480
significant. He was studying the Hopi language and culture and he argued that they have a

140
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:49,040
different conception of time. All of us think of time as kind of like a line with ourselves

141
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,200
standing at one point on the line, looking forward to the future, looking backward to the past.

142
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,240
He argued that the Hopi don't think of it that way because they don't have past, present, and

143
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,320
future in their language. They think about it in some relativistic terms and so on.

144
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,040
Problem with that proposal is that English doesn't have past, present, and future.

145
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,280
We don't have future tense in English. If you want to talk about the future, you use

146
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,640
what's called a modal word, like will or shall, which is just one of a class of modals, may,

147
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:40,080
might, can, will, shall. So if you apply his reasoning, we shouldn't have the

148
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,680
conception that we do have. And as far as we know that Hopi have the same conception.

149
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,960
So that just collapsed and other efforts have been made and they haven't been very successful.

150
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,760
When we get to your point, social and political consequences, it's very hard to find anything.

151
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:11,600
It's even for simple perceptual things, it's hard. There's a lot of loose talk about these

152
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:20,320
topics, but when you look into them, the arguments don't make much sense and it's

153
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,960
very hard to find evidence. But I don't think of any particular reason that we know of to think that

154
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,440
there are social and political consequences to the language that we use. You could have

155
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,160
totally different languages and have the same social, political systems. In fact, that's true

156
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,560
to an extent. Take the United States. There are people whose first language is different.

157
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:58,160
Take my parents, for example. My father grew up in the Ukraine. His first language was Yiddish.

158
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,880
It's the language of Jews in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe. But he had the same, he lived,

159
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:14,400
he came to the United States when he was 17, so he's already grown. But he had the same social,

160
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,080
he lived in the United States the same way anybody else did. I'm sure you know people who have

161
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,080
immigrant backgrounds who have different, his native language is different, but they live in

162
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:47,280
the same society we do. So I wanted to ask, because it's my understanding that you consider yourself

163
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,760
an anarchist, which is on the left side of the spectrum. I know it's kind of a

164
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
people don't like to look too much into the spectrum, but I was wondering if you could explain

165
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,080
what your definition of anarchism is or where exactly you consider yourself to be.

166
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:20,960
Well, at its root, anarchism grew out of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism

167
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:30,400
collapsed because it ran into capitalism. Capitalism is inconsistent with liberal ideas,

168
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:38,960
classical liberal ideas. Capitalism is based on the principle that for most of your waking life,

169
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,760
you should be a servant who follows a master. That's called having a job.

170
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:56,880
Suppose you have a job in a factory or a McDonald's or wherever. Most of your waking life is spent

171
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:06,160
following orders, and the orders are very strict. What you can wear when you're allowed to go to

172
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
the restroom, who you're allowed to talk to, what motions you have to make, and so on.

173
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,920
If you're working in an Amazon warehouse, what path you have to go through to get the fastest way

174
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,120
from here to there and so on. So that's capitalism. It's based on the idea that there are masters

175
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:36,480
and servants. You look back at labor history, U.S. labor history, 19th century, when the industrial

176
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:44,080
system was established. Working people were bitterly opposed to it. It was an attack on their

177
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,440
rights and their dignity to have to follow orders. Having a job was called wage slavery.

178
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,800
This was such a common idea that it was a slogan of the Republican Party. The Republican Party then

179
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:06,400
was nothing like what it is today. Republican Party and Lincoln's Day, one of its principles

180
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,880
was that wage labor is intolerable. It's an intolerable attack on rights and freedom.

181
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,400
People can be wage laborers only temporarily until they can regain their freedom somehow.

182
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,160
That was a standard conception of American working people in the 19th century. Capitalism had to be

183
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:38,720
imposed by force. In fact, if you look back at U.S. history, the United States had a very violent

184
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:47,680
labor history, much more so than other comparable countries. Until the late 1930s, workers were

185
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,000
being murdered by security forces in labor actions. It didn't happen anywhere else in

186
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:02,240
the advanced countries, at least. We have a violent labor history, which in fact,

187
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,200
the modern period since Reagan, one of the major goals of the government, has been to

188
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:19,440
destroy the labor movement in many different ways. What's called neoliberal globalization under

189
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,960
Clinton, the way it was designed, was basically designed to undermine American labor,

190
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,720
and this goes way back. So, capitalism was inconsistent with liberal ideas,

191
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,240
liberal humane conceptions, working people hated it. Finally, they've come to accept it,

192
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,600
but I think opposition is right below the surface. Well, what's anarchism?

193
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,800
Anarchism says, you know, let's take the traditional ideas that authority, hierarchy,

194
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:05,360
domination are illegitimate and have a burden of proof. They have to prove their legitimacy,

195
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:13,520
show that we're legitimate. Well, sometimes you can do that. Like if I'm walking down the street

196
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:21,120
with my grandchild and the kid runs into the street and I grab his arm and pull him back,

197
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,320
that's authority, but I think you can give an argument for it. But any kind of dominance or

198
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,400
authority, whether it's in the family, whether it's patriarchal family, parents and children,

199
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:46,320
schools, social systems, economic structures and so on, political systems, unless authority can be

200
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,800
justified, it should be eliminated. And it can very rarely be justified when you think it through

201
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,520
any more than employment can. Well, anarchism just says, let's, when you find illegitimate

202
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,600
authority, let's dismantle it and move in towards a more free, just social arrangement.

203
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,720
My own feeling is that almost everybody's an anarchist when they think about it,

204
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,720
when they think about the kinds of structures of authority and domination that they accept

205
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,480
and ask, should we accept them? Is there a justification for them? They very rarely is.

206
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Uh, you can think that through for yourself. What kinds of authority, domination and hierarchy are

207
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:44,400
legitimate? And if they're not, you should be doing something to work to get rid of them.

208
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,040
That's basically anarchism.

209
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,600
I'm touching into something you mentioned at the end there. Could you give some examples of

210
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,520
legitimized authority or like just authority?

211
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:15,360
I suppose, let's take Indigenous American society. If there was a conflict between two tribes,

212
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:26,960
which turned into a war, a tribe would pick a leader to determine how the fighting should

213
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,800
proceed during the war in particular, but they'd be picked. Then when it's over, they have no more

214
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,680
authority. But during the period of the war, you could say that's legitimate authority.

215
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,320
I think you could argue about it, but I think so. And there are other cases of legitimate

216
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:53,200
authority. So I suppose you had a democratic society. Our society is very limited democracy,

217
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:01,600
but a true democratic society in which decisions about the nature of what's happening are made by

218
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:10,560
the public and public deliberation, public thought, and then you pick somebody to administer your

219
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:17,440
decisions. Well, submitting to the authority of the administrator may make some sense, may be

220
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:25,440
legitimate as long as they're under popular control. There are other structures which I think can be

221
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:36,880
regarded as legitimate. So class, like say, your classes in school. There's a hierarchical

222
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,920
relation, but I think it's legitimate as long as the educational authorities themselves are

223
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,840
basically picked by a democratic public and kept when they're performing the tasks that

224
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,360
they were chosen for. Then you can say, well, under these circumstances, I'll accept the

225
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,760
position of authority. It's useful. That's teacher knows things I want to learn. So fine,

226
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,800
I'll go along with it. So I think you can find plenty of structures and societies that are

227
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:18,640
legitimate, but most of them aren't. A lot of the ones we take for granted, like having a job,

228
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,920
I agree with the 19th century Republican Party. That seems to be illegitimate.

229
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:39,120
So in a society like America's, right, where it's considered a capitalist structure,

230
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,880
how do you suggest we move away from something like capitalism and something like

231
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,920
syndicalism or like anarchism, where we kind of dig away from these?

232
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, there are about 6,000 enterprises in the United States with

233
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:08,240
value, a couple trillion dollars, which are owned and run by the workforce. That's a step towards it.

234
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,360
So instead of being somebody who follows the order of a master,

235
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,000
you yourselves, the workforce themselves, runs the enterprise in a democratic fashion.

236
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,120
It's not very much developed in cooperatives. Cooperatives work sort of the same way.

237
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:42,000
People like a farming community can set up cooperatives for planting, marketing, and so on,

238
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,560
where there's, that's a step toward, all of these are steps towards democratic societies.

239
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,760
Societies where decisions that matter to people are made by the people themselves.

240
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:05,440
We don't really have, our political system is not like that. If you look at the political,

241
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,920
the way the political system works, it's basically run by concentrated private power.

242
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,720
Take something as simple as medical care. In most countries of the world, medical care is

243
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,040
just considered a right. You look at the universal declaration of human rights, health care is

244
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:34,000
considered a right, like a right to food and so on. The United States is an outlier. We don't have

245
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,800
universal medical care. Actually, we have it in a sense. We have the worst kind you can imagine.

246
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,880
If you're injured or you're ill and you don't have enough money for the private system,

247
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,200
you can go to the emergency room in the nearby hospital and they'll take care of you if they can.

248
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,520
Maybe give you good care. That's our universal medical system. It's the cruelest, most expensive

249
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:15,040
one that you can imagine. The cruelty is obvious. If you go to an ER in your local hospital, you'll

250
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,760
probably see plenty of people there who basically need a nurse practitioner, but can't get to see

251
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,760
a doctor because they can't afford it and don't have health insurance. So they sit around there

252
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,600
for a couple of days until someone takes care of them. It's very expensive. US costs, health costs

253
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:44,160
are about twice as high as comparable countries have some of the worst outcomes. You look at

254
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,640
infant mortality and other measures. We're down at the bottom, but that's because we're an unusually

255
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:59,280
capitalist society. The population generally favors universal health care, but you can't get it through

256
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:06,720
Congress because the people in Congress are basically paid by donors and they don't want

257
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,120
universal health care. They want private systems that make profit for the rich and valuable.

258
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,920
This is very strong in American society, so you take the less, sometimes it's worse, sometimes

259
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:27,600
it's better, but the last 40 years since Reagan have been unusually severe. There are even some

260
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:36,000
measures of it. One of the major research institutions, the Rand Corporation, is quite

261
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:45,120
conservative. It's part of basically quasi-governmental. I recently did a study on how much money was,

262
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,880
as they put it, transferred, I'd say robbed, but how much money was transferred from the lower

263
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:05,520
90% if the income spectrum to the top 1% since Reagan. It's about 50 trillion dollars,

264
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,320
basically stolen from the large majority of the population put in the pockets of the super rich

265
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:25,120
and the corporate structure. That's pretty effective highway robbery, 50 trillion dollars

266
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,720
out of your pockets. Well, that's the result of having a social and political system that's

267
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,760
dominated by concentrated private power, which essentially, if you look at, I mean,

268
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,960
they're very good studies of this. Turns out you can predict elections, electability,

269
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,480
with remarkable precision. Just by looking at campaign funding, and campaign funding mostly

270
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,200
comes from the very rich, the corporate structure. There are good studies on this and political,

271
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,400
mainstream political science. Turns out that if you look at these studies carefully,

272
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:17,120
about 70% of the population in the United States is simply not represented in Congress

273
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:26,480
in the sense that there's almost no relation between the attitudes and desires of the voters

274
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,680
and their own representatives. Virtually no correlation. As you move up the income scale,

275
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,280
you get closer relations. When you get to the very top, they're the ones who basically buy the

276
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,200
representatives. That's extreme distortion of political democracy. It's not that we have none.

277
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,680
I mean, it's not a totalitarian state. You can have a lot of freedom, a lot of things you can do,

278
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:10,000
but the United States unusually moves in this capitalist direction. You see that in a lot of

279
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:23,520
things. Take something as simple as maternal leave, care for a mother after birth. Every society

280
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:34,880
has paid maternal leave for societies, Mexico, everybody. There's the only country that doesn't

281
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:43,680
is the United States. No guaranteed maternal leave. Somebody may have it by accident or by

282
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,880
insurance, but you don't have it guaranteed. Aside from the United States and a couple of

283
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:59,440
Pacific islands, everybody has it. It takes a paid vacation. Americans work on average about a

284
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:07,120
month more a year than comparable societies because they have paid vacation. We don't

285
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,040
guarantee. You may get it by accident. Maybe your employer grants it, but it's not required.

286
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,440
Well, we're just kind of off the spectrum in that respect. That's because of the unusual power

287
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,160
of private capital, which is much more than in most other comparable societies.

288
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,520
It's not always been like this. During the New Deal period, when I was growing up, there were

289
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,360
changes in the opposite direction. They lasted through the early post-war period,

290
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:53,840
but when you get to Reagan and since they're gone, decline seriously. There are variations,

291
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:03,200
but the basic structure of the society has what I would regard, you can make your own judgments

292
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,280
as illegitimate structures of authority and domination.

293
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:17,680
But think it through yourself and think with you. It's interesting that a lot of what the public

294
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:26,000
wants, they just can't get because it can't get through the Congress and executive, which

295
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,720
is largely dominated by private capital like universal health care, for example.

296
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:42,400
So we have about six minutes, 50 seconds left. I wanted to run through a couple questions that

297
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,760
we tried to ask every speaker. And it's okay if you only answer one. Don't feel like rushed at all.

298
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,720
It does abruptly just hang up. So when there's a minute left, I'll talk to you and let you know.

299
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,920
But your favorite part of history and why?

300
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:10,720
I can't say. I find almost every part of history, including prehistoric human life,

301
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,200
very fascinating. We're an interesting species.

302
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,720
One of the most interesting books I've read recently is David Graber's book on prehistory,

303
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,280
prehistorical societies, very rich and complex.

304
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,880
So why is it that you're so interested and fascinated by everything then?

305
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,640
Because human beings are quite interesting. Biologists sometimes say that every species

306
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,760
is unique, but humans are the uniqueness of all. There's no other species, for example,

307
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,840
that can do what we're doing right now. It's a very interesting fact, if you think about it,

308
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,200
because humans arrived on Earth very recently. Humans emerged maybe a couple hundred thousand

309
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,000
years ago in evolutionary time. That's like the blink of an eye, but we're radically different

310
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,520
from every other species in all sorts of ways. For example, with the only species that has language

311
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:30,240
or anything like thought, reasoning capacity. I mean, I've got a couple of dogs that happen to

312
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,400
be sitting under the desk right now. They do all kind of complicated and interesting things, but

313
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:45,680
nothing like what any infant can do. We're just a very special species, and it's quite fascinating

314
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,480
to find out what's special about us. Why would you say history is important?

315
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:03,120
Well, if we want to understand, I'm not the only one who does take the Republican Party today.

316
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,040
They think history is very important, so important that it has to be banned.

317
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:17,920
One of the top policy programs of the Republican Party is to ban the teaching of history.

318
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,560
With an executive order from Trump, some being legislated by states, teachers are not allowed

319
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:35,200
to teach American history. The argument is it's divisive. It makes some people feel uncomfortable.

320
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,640
That's what history is. History isn't in nice fairy tales. It's the truth of what happened in

321
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:53,360
the society and why the society is the way it is today. Those who are basically fascist in mentality

322
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,880
don't want to talk. They understand why history is important, and we should understand too

323
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
what they're trying to ban is what we ought to try to know.

324
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Can it be more specific?

325
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:30,880
There are two. The United States has had 400 years of brutal harsh treatment of Afro-Americans.

326
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,040
A couple hundred years of sheer slavery followed by a period which was

327
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,280
scholar, sometimes called slavery by another name, the Jim Crow period, up until the 1960s.

328
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:55,680
It's not that far back. Federal housing banned blacks. Black workers couldn't own a house,

329
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,160
and it comes right up to the day. That's a core part of American history.

330
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,640
The Republican Party is trying to ban it. They don't want you to know that because it's divisive.

331
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:20,320
That's one example. What about indigenous history? There was a rich complex indigenous society

332
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,760
before the white colonists came. We wiped it out. It's almost a total genocide.

333
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:38,080
We should learn about that. That's their history. We want to know about contemporary history.

334
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:48,960
It takes a Kennedy, again. Kennedy radically escalated the war in Vietnam.

335
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,120
It led to a war in which millions of people were killed in three countries. Vietnam, Cambodia,

336
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,840
Laos were practically destroyed. Should we know something about that? I think so. We want to know

337
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,840
our position in the world, how the world looks at us, why they do. We should know about those things.

338
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,600
You could just say, well, let's just repeat patriotic slogans and forget about everything.

339
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,800
Okay, that's a possibility. We could try to understand ourselves, who we are, why we are this

340
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,080
way and how we got this way, what we can do to change it, what we can do to make a better world.

341
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,440
Those are two choices you make your own.

342
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,240
We have less than one minute, probably about 50 seconds. What's your advice to high school history

343
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:47,200
students and do you have any resources to share to help us? There are plenty of resources, documentation,

344
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:56,800
oral history, tons of it. The lesson is, use your minds, critical minds. Think about

345
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,160
the doctrines that you hear and that are imposed. Challenge them, question them.

346
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,600
Maybe some of them are right. Maybe some of them are wrong. But try to find out what kind of society

347
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:18,320
we live in. Why is it this way? Can we make it better? That's the job of history.

348
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,400
Thank you so much for meeting with us, Professor Chomsky.
