00:00.000 --> 00:13.400
Today we were able to speak to Professor Noam Chomsky on a wide range of questions coming

00:13.400 --> 00:14.840
from our members.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.720
His topics went from JFK to anarchism and even health care to history censorship.

00:19.720 --> 00:24.280
He's the father of modern linguistics, Professor Emeritus at MIT, he's the author of well

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
over 100 books.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.520
He's a world renowned and leading dissident.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.880
He has a huge critic of US foreign policy and he specializes on a wide range of topics

00:33.880 --> 00:39.880
such as history, politics, technology, freedom of speech, socioeconomic systems, philosophy

00:39.880 --> 00:44.640
and ethics, media, propaganda, psychology and the list goes on.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.760
If you're interested in learning more about him and his work you can check out his web

00:47.760 --> 00:51.920
page, you're able to purchase any number of his books, you can find him all over YouTube

00:51.920 --> 00:56.400
with different talks and even clips covering many different social studies related topics.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.000
You can even find some major video work online such as Requiem for the American Dream, Manufacturing

01:02.000 --> 01:05.680
Consent and even a Vietnam debate on firing line.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.080
We were very grateful to have such a high profile figure like Noam Chomsky on and someone

01:10.080 --> 01:13.680
who is really a wealth of knowledge on different social studies related topics.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.520
I hope you all enjoy the talk and be sure to check out more of his work.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.200
Hello Professor Chomsky!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.080
Uh, hi.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.240
How are you doing?

01:23.120 --> 01:25.120
Okay, can you hear me?

01:25.920 --> 01:26.960
Yeah, we can hear you great.

01:28.160 --> 01:28.480
Good.

01:29.520 --> 01:34.640
So this is our history club, a bunch of different students, grades 9 through 12.

01:36.560 --> 01:42.640
It was great to see that some are big fans and you know we meet with different guest speakers

01:42.640 --> 01:44.560
and we're excited to talk to you.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.720
We live in Shemokin.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.440
It's kind of a poor area and it's an old coal mining town.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.760
So there's a lot of interesting history and yeah, we're just excited to talk to you, so.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.160
Okay, great.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.920
Glad to be with you.

02:00.640 --> 02:04.720
Would you like us to just get into questions or is there anything that you would like?

02:05.520 --> 02:11.040
Why don't you just raise questions about what you're interested in instead of

02:11.040 --> 02:13.040
my talking about what's on my mind?

02:14.480 --> 02:17.040
Well, they're excited for just your mind too, but yeah.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.760
Okay, let's go.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.000
Somebody break the ice.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.200
I'll break the ice with one kid that had basketball practice.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.320
He was unable to make it.

02:31.040 --> 02:38.080
He did a whole project on JFK and the history and a lot of kids asked about your take on

02:38.640 --> 02:42.960
conspiracy theories in general and the JFK one because he did a ton of research.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.800
Obviously these files are still being leaked.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.360
He checked out all of our stone stuff.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.560
I'm not sure how you feel about all that, but that could be one to break the ice.

02:53.520 --> 03:01.840
Well, there's I think we have to distinguish between two different kinds of questions about the

03:02.640 --> 03:04.320
JFK assassination.

03:05.280 --> 03:10.240
One is the question, who carried it out?

03:10.240 --> 03:11.200
Who killed him?

03:11.200 --> 03:12.880
And how was that done?

03:12.880 --> 03:14.000
That's one question.

03:14.640 --> 03:19.600
It's like a question about any other murder that took place.

03:20.320 --> 03:20.960
Who did it?

03:21.520 --> 03:22.480
Why'd they do it?

03:22.480 --> 03:23.280
How was it done?

03:23.280 --> 03:23.920
And so on.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.200
So the fact that he was a president doesn't change that question.

03:29.280 --> 03:36.320
It's just the forensic question that a police investigation would try to answer.

03:37.280 --> 03:45.280
The other question is, did it have an impact on policy and society?

03:46.160 --> 03:47.440
It's a separate question.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.480
What was the effect of the assassination?

03:51.680 --> 03:57.760
Was it a high level assassination that had policy consequences?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.240
That's a different question.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.440
About the first question, who did it, why'd they do it, and so on.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.160
I don't have any particular opinion.

04:12.160 --> 04:21.440
I don't see any reason much to question the standard story that it was Oswald and did it

04:21.440 --> 04:22.800
for whatever reason he did.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.400
But if that's wrong, okay, so it's wrong.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.080
Let's find out who did do it.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.200
As far as I can see, it's like any other crime.

04:32.080 --> 04:36.400
You want to know who did it, why, who was responsible.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.800
But I have no special insight into that.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.960
The so-called conspiracy theories are mostly about that.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.120
In fact, almost all about that.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.440
And so you can look into them and decide what you think.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.000
The other question is the one that interests me, and I've written a lot about it.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.760
In fact, was it a high level plot with policy consequences?

05:00.640 --> 05:01.920
Well, you can check that.

05:02.480 --> 05:05.360
Take a look at the policies before and after.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.520
Take a look at his positions and so on.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.680
And my own view, I've written about it extensively, if you're interested in looking into it,

05:14.400 --> 05:19.440
is that it basically had no serious policy consequences.

05:20.080 --> 05:24.640
Policies continued as they were, same people carrying them out.

05:25.680 --> 05:35.120
There are a lot of, if you look at the theories about the assassination, Oliver Stone, many others,

05:35.920 --> 05:45.200
they're all motivated and based on the idea that somehow this changed the world and changed policy

05:45.200 --> 05:51.040
and Kennedy was going to do all sorts of wonderful things and he was killed to try to prevent him

05:51.040 --> 05:51.840
from doing them.

05:52.720 --> 05:57.840
Well, we don't have evidence, any reason to believe he was planning to do all any

05:58.560 --> 06:01.440
wonderful things or anything different from what was done.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.440
The main issue was that point the Vietnam War was raging.

06:08.320 --> 06:16.400
And so there's a huge industry trying to show that Kennedy was planning to end the war

06:18.880 --> 06:22.640
and he was killed to prevent him from doing that.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.440
There's not a particle of evidence for that.

06:26.320 --> 06:32.320
We have a huge documentary record, internal record planning and everything.

06:33.200 --> 06:39.360
It turns out that Kennedy himself was sort of towards the hawkish end of his administration.

06:40.240 --> 06:51.120
He was certainly willing to end the war, but he insisted after victory, after the United States

06:51.120 --> 06:59.760
wins the war, takes over South Vietnam, puts in the regime that we want and if it's stable,

06:59.760 --> 07:05.440
then we can pull out. He never veered from that up until the day of the assassination

07:06.400 --> 07:13.760
and the policies that were then carried out were by his advisors and they continued the same way.

07:14.720 --> 07:21.440
There were claims that he was planning to do sorts of things about world peace, but

07:22.720 --> 07:24.320
there's no evidence for it.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.600
I mean, you can believe it if you like, but it's basically based on faith.

07:30.400 --> 07:37.520
So my own view at least, and as I say, I've written extensively about it if you want to look

07:37.520 --> 07:47.600
into it, but my own conclusion is that it was not a high level conspiracy with policy consequences

07:48.400 --> 07:52.160
as to who killed him, who carried it out.

07:53.040 --> 08:02.640
I have no special insight. I haven't looked. In fact, I've read many of the theories, but

08:03.760 --> 08:10.720
they're conceivable, but I don't think they're very convincing. In fact, the Warren commission,

08:10.720 --> 08:17.840
the official commission, that's not all that convincing either, but you expect that.

08:18.560 --> 08:26.240
I mean, if you look at investigations of questions like this, it's not very easy to determine

08:27.280 --> 08:37.520
there, unless even if you look at the court cases for killing, there are always lots of

08:37.520 --> 08:44.880
questions. Life is not a simple matter. You rarely have absolutely definitive evidence.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.120
It's one of the reasons, one of the many reasons I think why

08:50.080 --> 08:57.600
my feeling is the United States should join most of the rest of the world and ban the death

08:57.600 --> 09:05.440
sins. The United States is one of the few countries that has the death sins. I don't think it's legitimate.

09:07.920 --> 09:14.320
And we have many cases where people have been in jail for 50 years on death row, and then it

09:14.320 --> 09:21.760
turned out they were not guilty. There's something called the Innocence Project, run I think by a

09:21.760 --> 09:29.600
law school in Chicago, which has used the DNA and other techniques to investigate

09:32.000 --> 09:38.800
convictions by methods that weren't available at the time. And it turned out a fair number of cases

09:38.800 --> 09:45.200
of false conviction, even when the evidence looked fairly circumstantial, evidence

09:46.480 --> 09:50.400
moderately convincing. But that's a different question.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.840
Is there any correlation between difference in language and culture when it comes to the

10:06.080 --> 10:07.520
political point of view of stuff evil?

10:12.240 --> 10:21.200
Well, that's a question that has been studied for almost a century. There's an

10:21.920 --> 10:31.200
idea. It's called the Warf hypothesis, Benjamin Lee Warf, which is that a language,

10:31.280 --> 10:37.120
your language determines the way you perceive and understand the world. And

10:40.080 --> 10:46.640
sounds plausible on the surface, but it's been very hard to find any experimental evidence for it,

10:47.360 --> 10:57.760
except in very superficial ways. So for example, there are languages that draw the

10:57.840 --> 11:06.000
color spectrum is divided somewhat differently, not totally differently in different languages.

11:06.800 --> 11:14.640
So some languages don't have a distinction between orange and red, let's say.

11:15.920 --> 11:22.800
They just use the same word for both orange and red. And it turns out if you do perceptual

11:22.880 --> 11:31.120
experiments and you present people with a stimulus that's on the red-orange border,

11:32.400 --> 11:36.720
close to one, it turns out that if you ask them later what they saw,

11:38.480 --> 11:44.880
people in a language like ours, which distinguishes them, will remember better what they saw than

11:44.880 --> 11:53.040
people with no distinction. But that's almost trivial. When we saw something that was red,

11:53.040 --> 12:00.400
we coded in our minds as red, so we'll remember who cares. But it's hard to find anything much

12:00.400 --> 12:07.600
beyond that. There's been a lot of efforts and there is debate and discussion about it. So

12:08.560 --> 12:17.360
it's not a settled question by any means, but for things like perception and so on,

12:17.920 --> 12:23.840
very little evidence. What about beyond that? The people have a different conception of

12:24.720 --> 12:31.600
one of the early proposals that was by Worf himself, which was considered very

12:31.600 --> 12:38.480
significant. He was studying the Hopi language and culture and he argued that they have a

12:38.480 --> 12:49.040
different conception of time. All of us think of time as kind of like a line with ourselves

12:49.040 --> 12:55.200
standing at one point on the line, looking forward to the future, looking backward to the past.

12:55.920 --> 13:02.240
He argued that the Hopi don't think of it that way because they don't have past, present, and

13:02.240 --> 13:08.320
future in their language. They think about it in some relativistic terms and so on.

13:10.320 --> 13:17.040
Problem with that proposal is that English doesn't have past, present, and future.

13:18.160 --> 13:23.280
We don't have future tense in English. If you want to talk about the future, you use

13:24.080 --> 13:30.640
what's called a modal word, like will or shall, which is just one of a class of modals, may,

13:31.440 --> 13:40.080
might, can, will, shall. So if you apply his reasoning, we shouldn't have the

13:40.080 --> 13:45.680
conception that we do have. And as far as we know that Hopi have the same conception.

13:46.480 --> 13:54.960
So that just collapsed and other efforts have been made and they haven't been very successful.

13:54.960 --> 14:01.760
When we get to your point, social and political consequences, it's very hard to find anything.

14:02.720 --> 14:11.600
It's even for simple perceptual things, it's hard. There's a lot of loose talk about these

14:11.680 --> 14:20.320
topics, but when you look into them, the arguments don't make much sense and it's

14:20.320 --> 14:26.960
very hard to find evidence. But I don't think of any particular reason that we know of to think that

14:27.920 --> 14:33.440
there are social and political consequences to the language that we use. You could have

14:34.320 --> 14:40.160
totally different languages and have the same social, political systems. In fact, that's true

14:40.160 --> 14:48.560
to an extent. Take the United States. There are people whose first language is different.

14:50.240 --> 14:58.160
Take my parents, for example. My father grew up in the Ukraine. His first language was Yiddish.

14:58.960 --> 15:04.880
It's the language of Jews in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe. But he had the same, he lived,

15:05.680 --> 15:14.400
he came to the United States when he was 17, so he's already grown. But he had the same social,

15:14.400 --> 15:20.080
he lived in the United States the same way anybody else did. I'm sure you know people who have

15:20.880 --> 15:28.080
immigrant backgrounds who have different, his native language is different, but they live in

15:28.160 --> 15:47.280
the same society we do. So I wanted to ask, because it's my understanding that you consider yourself

15:48.240 --> 15:53.760
an anarchist, which is on the left side of the spectrum. I know it's kind of a

15:54.720 --> 15:58.720
people don't like to look too much into the spectrum, but I was wondering if you could explain

15:58.720 --> 16:04.080
what your definition of anarchism is or where exactly you consider yourself to be.

16:11.280 --> 16:20.960
Well, at its root, anarchism grew out of classical liberalism. Classical liberalism

16:21.520 --> 16:30.400
collapsed because it ran into capitalism. Capitalism is inconsistent with liberal ideas,

16:30.400 --> 16:38.960
classical liberal ideas. Capitalism is based on the principle that for most of your waking life,

16:39.920 --> 16:45.760
you should be a servant who follows a master. That's called having a job.

16:45.760 --> 16:56.880
Suppose you have a job in a factory or a McDonald's or wherever. Most of your waking life is spent

16:57.600 --> 17:06.160
following orders, and the orders are very strict. What you can wear when you're allowed to go to

17:06.160 --> 17:12.240
the restroom, who you're allowed to talk to, what motions you have to make, and so on.

17:12.880 --> 17:19.920
If you're working in an Amazon warehouse, what path you have to go through to get the fastest way

17:19.920 --> 17:27.120
from here to there and so on. So that's capitalism. It's based on the idea that there are masters

17:27.120 --> 17:36.480
and servants. You look back at labor history, U.S. labor history, 19th century, when the industrial

17:36.480 --> 17:44.080
system was established. Working people were bitterly opposed to it. It was an attack on their

17:44.720 --> 17:51.440
rights and their dignity to have to follow orders. Having a job was called wage slavery.

17:52.160 --> 17:58.800
This was such a common idea that it was a slogan of the Republican Party. The Republican Party then

17:58.800 --> 18:06.400
was nothing like what it is today. Republican Party and Lincoln's Day, one of its principles

18:06.400 --> 18:14.880
was that wage labor is intolerable. It's an intolerable attack on rights and freedom.

18:15.680 --> 18:22.400
People can be wage laborers only temporarily until they can regain their freedom somehow.

18:23.040 --> 18:30.160
That was a standard conception of American working people in the 19th century. Capitalism had to be

18:30.160 --> 18:38.720
imposed by force. In fact, if you look back at U.S. history, the United States had a very violent

18:38.720 --> 18:47.680
labor history, much more so than other comparable countries. Until the late 1930s, workers were

18:47.680 --> 18:54.000
being murdered by security forces in labor actions. It didn't happen anywhere else in

18:54.960 --> 19:02.240
the advanced countries, at least. We have a violent labor history, which in fact,

19:03.760 --> 19:11.200
the modern period since Reagan, one of the major goals of the government, has been to

19:11.200 --> 19:19.440
destroy the labor movement in many different ways. What's called neoliberal globalization under

19:19.440 --> 19:24.960
Clinton, the way it was designed, was basically designed to undermine American labor,

19:27.120 --> 19:34.720
and this goes way back. So, capitalism was inconsistent with liberal ideas,

19:35.280 --> 19:42.240
liberal humane conceptions, working people hated it. Finally, they've come to accept it,

19:42.240 --> 19:47.600
but I think opposition is right below the surface. Well, what's anarchism?

19:48.240 --> 19:56.800
Anarchism says, you know, let's take the traditional ideas that authority, hierarchy,

19:56.800 --> 20:05.360
domination are illegitimate and have a burden of proof. They have to prove their legitimacy,

20:06.400 --> 20:13.520
show that we're legitimate. Well, sometimes you can do that. Like if I'm walking down the street

20:13.520 --> 20:21.120
with my grandchild and the kid runs into the street and I grab his arm and pull him back,

20:21.120 --> 20:28.320
that's authority, but I think you can give an argument for it. But any kind of dominance or

20:28.320 --> 20:34.400
authority, whether it's in the family, whether it's patriarchal family, parents and children,

20:35.200 --> 20:46.320
schools, social systems, economic structures and so on, political systems, unless authority can be

20:46.320 --> 20:52.800
justified, it should be eliminated. And it can very rarely be justified when you think it through

20:54.000 --> 21:01.520
any more than employment can. Well, anarchism just says, let's, when you find illegitimate

21:01.520 --> 21:09.600
authority, let's dismantle it and move in towards a more free, just social arrangement.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.720
My own feeling is that almost everybody's an anarchist when they think about it,

21:15.280 --> 21:20.720
when they think about the kinds of structures of authority and domination that they accept

21:21.360 --> 21:28.480
and ask, should we accept them? Is there a justification for them? They very rarely is.

21:29.200 --> 21:36.160
Uh, you can think that through for yourself. What kinds of authority, domination and hierarchy are

21:36.160 --> 21:44.400
legitimate? And if they're not, you should be doing something to work to get rid of them.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.040
That's basically anarchism.

21:49.280 --> 21:55.600
I'm touching into something you mentioned at the end there. Could you give some examples of

21:55.680 --> 21:59.520
legitimized authority or like just authority?

22:02.960 --> 22:15.360
I suppose, let's take Indigenous American society. If there was a conflict between two tribes,

22:16.320 --> 22:26.960
which turned into a war, a tribe would pick a leader to determine how the fighting should

22:26.960 --> 22:32.800
proceed during the war in particular, but they'd be picked. Then when it's over, they have no more

22:32.800 --> 22:37.680
authority. But during the period of the war, you could say that's legitimate authority.

22:38.640 --> 22:44.320
I think you could argue about it, but I think so. And there are other cases of legitimate

22:44.400 --> 22:53.200
authority. So I suppose you had a democratic society. Our society is very limited democracy,

22:53.200 --> 23:01.600
but a true democratic society in which decisions about the nature of what's happening are made by

23:01.600 --> 23:10.560
the public and public deliberation, public thought, and then you pick somebody to administer your

23:10.560 --> 23:17.440
decisions. Well, submitting to the authority of the administrator may make some sense, may be

23:17.440 --> 23:25.440
legitimate as long as they're under popular control. There are other structures which I think can be

23:25.440 --> 23:36.880
regarded as legitimate. So class, like say, your classes in school. There's a hierarchical

23:36.880 --> 23:45.920
relation, but I think it's legitimate as long as the educational authorities themselves are

23:46.640 --> 23:53.840
basically picked by a democratic public and kept when they're performing the tasks that

23:53.840 --> 23:59.360
they were chosen for. Then you can say, well, under these circumstances, I'll accept the

24:00.080 --> 24:05.760
position of authority. It's useful. That's teacher knows things I want to learn. So fine,

24:05.840 --> 24:10.800
I'll go along with it. So I think you can find plenty of structures and societies that are

24:10.800 --> 24:18.640
legitimate, but most of them aren't. A lot of the ones we take for granted, like having a job,

24:19.920 --> 24:25.920
I agree with the 19th century Republican Party. That seems to be illegitimate.

24:26.080 --> 24:39.120
So in a society like America's, right, where it's considered a capitalist structure,

24:39.840 --> 24:44.880
how do you suggest we move away from something like capitalism and something like

24:45.120 --> 24:49.920
syndicalism or like anarchism, where we kind of dig away from these?

24:51.200 --> 24:58.000
Well, there are about 6,000 enterprises in the United States with

25:00.240 --> 25:08.240
value, a couple trillion dollars, which are owned and run by the workforce. That's a step towards it.

25:09.120 --> 25:15.360
So instead of being somebody who follows the order of a master,

25:16.800 --> 25:24.000
you yourselves, the workforce themselves, runs the enterprise in a democratic fashion.

25:24.880 --> 25:31.120
It's not very much developed in cooperatives. Cooperatives work sort of the same way.

25:31.840 --> 25:42.000
People like a farming community can set up cooperatives for planting, marketing, and so on,

25:42.000 --> 25:48.560
where there's, that's a step toward, all of these are steps towards democratic societies.

25:50.320 --> 25:55.760
Societies where decisions that matter to people are made by the people themselves.

25:56.720 --> 26:05.440
We don't really have, our political system is not like that. If you look at the political,

26:05.440 --> 26:11.920
the way the political system works, it's basically run by concentrated private power.

26:13.360 --> 26:20.720
Take something as simple as medical care. In most countries of the world, medical care is

26:20.720 --> 26:27.040
just considered a right. You look at the universal declaration of human rights, health care is

26:27.040 --> 26:34.000
considered a right, like a right to food and so on. The United States is an outlier. We don't have

26:34.000 --> 26:40.800
universal medical care. Actually, we have it in a sense. We have the worst kind you can imagine.

26:41.840 --> 26:48.880
If you're injured or you're ill and you don't have enough money for the private system,

26:49.440 --> 26:57.200
you can go to the emergency room in the nearby hospital and they'll take care of you if they can.

26:58.080 --> 27:05.520
Maybe give you good care. That's our universal medical system. It's the cruelest, most expensive

27:06.160 --> 27:15.040
one that you can imagine. The cruelty is obvious. If you go to an ER in your local hospital, you'll

27:15.120 --> 27:21.760
probably see plenty of people there who basically need a nurse practitioner, but can't get to see

27:21.760 --> 27:27.760
a doctor because they can't afford it and don't have health insurance. So they sit around there

27:27.760 --> 27:35.600
for a couple of days until someone takes care of them. It's very expensive. US costs, health costs

27:35.600 --> 27:44.160
are about twice as high as comparable countries have some of the worst outcomes. You look at

27:44.160 --> 27:50.640
infant mortality and other measures. We're down at the bottom, but that's because we're an unusually

27:50.640 --> 27:59.280
capitalist society. The population generally favors universal health care, but you can't get it through

27:59.280 --> 28:06.720
Congress because the people in Congress are basically paid by donors and they don't want

28:06.720 --> 28:13.120
universal health care. They want private systems that make profit for the rich and valuable.

28:14.160 --> 28:19.920
This is very strong in American society, so you take the less, sometimes it's worse, sometimes

28:19.920 --> 28:27.600
it's better, but the last 40 years since Reagan have been unusually severe. There are even some

28:27.600 --> 28:36.000
measures of it. One of the major research institutions, the Rand Corporation, is quite

28:36.080 --> 28:45.120
conservative. It's part of basically quasi-governmental. I recently did a study on how much money was,

28:45.920 --> 28:52.880
as they put it, transferred, I'd say robbed, but how much money was transferred from the lower

28:52.880 --> 29:05.520
90% if the income spectrum to the top 1% since Reagan. It's about 50 trillion dollars,

29:06.720 --> 29:14.320
basically stolen from the large majority of the population put in the pockets of the super rich

29:14.320 --> 29:25.120
and the corporate structure. That's pretty effective highway robbery, 50 trillion dollars

29:25.120 --> 29:32.720
out of your pockets. Well, that's the result of having a social and political system that's

29:32.720 --> 29:41.760
dominated by concentrated private power, which essentially, if you look at, I mean,

29:41.760 --> 29:48.960
they're very good studies of this. Turns out you can predict elections, electability,

29:48.960 --> 29:56.480
with remarkable precision. Just by looking at campaign funding, and campaign funding mostly

29:56.480 --> 30:03.200
comes from the very rich, the corporate structure. There are good studies on this and political,

30:03.200 --> 30:08.400
mainstream political science. Turns out that if you look at these studies carefully,

30:08.400 --> 30:17.120
about 70% of the population in the United States is simply not represented in Congress

30:17.920 --> 30:26.480
in the sense that there's almost no relation between the attitudes and desires of the voters

30:26.480 --> 30:33.680
and their own representatives. Virtually no correlation. As you move up the income scale,

30:33.760 --> 30:39.280
you get closer relations. When you get to the very top, they're the ones who basically buy the

30:41.440 --> 30:49.200
representatives. That's extreme distortion of political democracy. It's not that we have none.

30:49.200 --> 30:55.680
I mean, it's not a totalitarian state. You can have a lot of freedom, a lot of things you can do,

30:55.680 --> 31:10.000
but the United States unusually moves in this capitalist direction. You see that in a lot of

31:10.000 --> 31:23.520
things. Take something as simple as maternal leave, care for a mother after birth. Every society

31:24.080 --> 31:34.880
has paid maternal leave for societies, Mexico, everybody. There's the only country that doesn't

31:34.880 --> 31:43.680
is the United States. No guaranteed maternal leave. Somebody may have it by accident or by

31:43.680 --> 31:48.880
insurance, but you don't have it guaranteed. Aside from the United States and a couple of

31:48.880 --> 31:59.440
Pacific islands, everybody has it. It takes a paid vacation. Americans work on average about a

31:59.440 --> 32:07.120
month more a year than comparable societies because they have paid vacation. We don't

32:08.640 --> 32:15.040
guarantee. You may get it by accident. Maybe your employer grants it, but it's not required.

32:15.760 --> 32:23.440
Well, we're just kind of off the spectrum in that respect. That's because of the unusual power

32:24.240 --> 32:30.160
of private capital, which is much more than in most other comparable societies.

32:31.280 --> 32:37.520
It's not always been like this. During the New Deal period, when I was growing up, there were

32:37.520 --> 32:43.360
changes in the opposite direction. They lasted through the early post-war period,

32:44.320 --> 32:53.840
but when you get to Reagan and since they're gone, decline seriously. There are variations,

32:53.840 --> 33:03.200
but the basic structure of the society has what I would regard, you can make your own judgments

33:03.200 --> 33:07.280
as illegitimate structures of authority and domination.

33:08.080 --> 33:17.680
But think it through yourself and think with you. It's interesting that a lot of what the public

33:17.680 --> 33:26.000
wants, they just can't get because it can't get through the Congress and executive, which

33:26.000 --> 33:32.720
is largely dominated by private capital like universal health care, for example.

33:33.280 --> 33:42.400
So we have about six minutes, 50 seconds left. I wanted to run through a couple questions that

33:42.400 --> 33:47.760
we tried to ask every speaker. And it's okay if you only answer one. Don't feel like rushed at all.

33:48.800 --> 33:54.720
It does abruptly just hang up. So when there's a minute left, I'll talk to you and let you know.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.920
But your favorite part of history and why?

33:58.800 --> 34:10.720
I can't say. I find almost every part of history, including prehistoric human life,

34:10.720 --> 34:15.200
very fascinating. We're an interesting species.

34:17.440 --> 34:24.720
One of the most interesting books I've read recently is David Graber's book on prehistory,

34:25.600 --> 34:29.280
prehistorical societies, very rich and complex.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.880
So why is it that you're so interested and fascinated by everything then?

34:37.280 --> 34:44.640
Because human beings are quite interesting. Biologists sometimes say that every species

34:44.640 --> 34:51.760
is unique, but humans are the uniqueness of all. There's no other species, for example,

34:51.760 --> 34:57.840
that can do what we're doing right now. It's a very interesting fact, if you think about it,

34:58.400 --> 35:05.200
because humans arrived on Earth very recently. Humans emerged maybe a couple hundred thousand

35:05.200 --> 35:12.000
years ago in evolutionary time. That's like the blink of an eye, but we're radically different

35:12.000 --> 35:19.520
from every other species in all sorts of ways. For example, with the only species that has language

35:20.400 --> 35:30.240
or anything like thought, reasoning capacity. I mean, I've got a couple of dogs that happen to

35:30.240 --> 35:36.400
be sitting under the desk right now. They do all kind of complicated and interesting things, but

35:36.400 --> 35:45.680
nothing like what any infant can do. We're just a very special species, and it's quite fascinating

35:45.680 --> 35:52.480
to find out what's special about us. Why would you say history is important?

35:55.360 --> 36:03.120
Well, if we want to understand, I'm not the only one who does take the Republican Party today.

36:03.920 --> 36:09.040
They think history is very important, so important that it has to be banned.

36:09.280 --> 36:17.920
One of the top policy programs of the Republican Party is to ban the teaching of history.

36:18.640 --> 36:26.560
With an executive order from Trump, some being legislated by states, teachers are not allowed

36:26.560 --> 36:35.200
to teach American history. The argument is it's divisive. It makes some people feel uncomfortable.

36:35.520 --> 36:42.640
That's what history is. History isn't in nice fairy tales. It's the truth of what happened in

36:42.640 --> 36:53.360
the society and why the society is the way it is today. Those who are basically fascist in mentality

36:53.360 --> 36:58.880
don't want to talk. They understand why history is important, and we should understand too

36:59.600 --> 37:02.400
what they're trying to ban is what we ought to try to know.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.200
Can it be more specific?

37:15.200 --> 37:30.880
There are two. The United States has had 400 years of brutal harsh treatment of Afro-Americans.

37:31.600 --> 37:37.040
A couple hundred years of sheer slavery followed by a period which was

37:37.920 --> 37:45.280
scholar, sometimes called slavery by another name, the Jim Crow period, up until the 1960s.

37:45.280 --> 37:55.680
It's not that far back. Federal housing banned blacks. Black workers couldn't own a house,

37:56.240 --> 38:02.160
and it comes right up to the day. That's a core part of American history.

38:03.840 --> 38:08.640
The Republican Party is trying to ban it. They don't want you to know that because it's divisive.

38:10.560 --> 38:20.320
That's one example. What about indigenous history? There was a rich complex indigenous society

38:20.320 --> 38:27.760
before the white colonists came. We wiped it out. It's almost a total genocide.

38:28.480 --> 38:38.080
We should learn about that. That's their history. We want to know about contemporary history.

38:38.560 --> 38:48.960
It takes a Kennedy, again. Kennedy radically escalated the war in Vietnam.

38:49.760 --> 38:57.120
It led to a war in which millions of people were killed in three countries. Vietnam, Cambodia,

38:57.120 --> 39:03.840
Laos were practically destroyed. Should we know something about that? I think so. We want to know

39:03.840 --> 39:09.840
our position in the world, how the world looks at us, why they do. We should know about those things.

39:10.880 --> 39:15.600
You could just say, well, let's just repeat patriotic slogans and forget about everything.

39:16.320 --> 39:22.800
Okay, that's a possibility. We could try to understand ourselves, who we are, why we are this

39:22.800 --> 39:28.080
way and how we got this way, what we can do to change it, what we can do to make a better world.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.440
Those are two choices you make your own.

39:32.800 --> 39:38.240
We have less than one minute, probably about 50 seconds. What's your advice to high school history

39:38.240 --> 39:47.200
students and do you have any resources to share to help us? There are plenty of resources, documentation,

39:47.200 --> 39:56.800
oral history, tons of it. The lesson is, use your minds, critical minds. Think about

39:57.520 --> 40:04.160
the doctrines that you hear and that are imposed. Challenge them, question them.

40:05.040 --> 40:11.600
Maybe some of them are right. Maybe some of them are wrong. But try to find out what kind of society

40:11.600 --> 40:18.320
we live in. Why is it this way? Can we make it better? That's the job of history.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.400
Thank you so much for meeting with us, Professor Chomsky.
