1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
The promise of AI has led to a flood of investment, but the chaotic rise has produced a dramatic

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,400
stretch of events.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,640
A heavily funded startup led by a leading AI entrepreneur gets stripped for parts, severe

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,960
instability threatens a promising open source company, and revenue from a leading generative

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,640
chat startup points to a reality the industry has to face.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,120
Is this the beginning of a broken AI startup landscape?

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Is it a sign that AIR is coming out of the AI funding balloon?

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,040
And what does all of this mean?

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:45,240
For the future of AI?

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,160
Some optimistic researchers and economists claim that AI has the potential to supercharge

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,120
growth to 20% a year, a significant bump from the 3.2% growth average the US has experienced

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,560
since World War II.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,920
If that supercharged growth materializes even slightly, that's an amazing change in society.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,120
A Northwestern economist found that the typical American is 100 times richer than in 1870

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,360
when growth was stalled at 0%.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,080
With growth at 20%, the typical American would be a thousand times richer than they are today

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,440
in a relatively short time window.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,160
This is the promise of exponential technology meeting exponential times.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,960
But there's a lot of things that would have to go right to meet that growth dream.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,920
And AI is entering a turbulent phase in the hype cycle.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,080
The head of Amazon Web Services, Adam Salipsky, who has overseen much of the company's massive

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,040
investment in generative AI, has made connections to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
The internet in the long term was underhyped, but a slew of companies trying to cash in

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,120
were gravely overhyped.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,680
And those companies led to a bubble that popped, hurting everyone else.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
We may be at the point where the needle is starting to pierce the balloon, with three

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,200
big examples to investigate in this video.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
We're going to start with stability AI.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,880
Emod Mestak started stability AI in late 2020, and based on research from a project called

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,400
latent diffusion, stability released a model called stable diffusion in August 2022.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,160
The model used a denoising process in its architecture that enabled unique image generation.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,560
The result was a really effective open source model capable of creating great images and

33
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,480
enabling users to train the model on their own dataset.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Stability AI raised $101 million at a billion dollar valuation in 2022, just days after

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,120
launching stable diffusion.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,720
Buied by AI interest and a growing base that featured tens of millions of active users,

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,880
2023 promised to be a big year for the company.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,320
And Emod had an engaging vision for what AI could do for the world.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,400
If we do it right, then we can really uplift the entire of humanity, which I think is pretty

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
crazy and pretty awesome.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,880
It's the first time we've ever had the tools to do that.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,480
He wanted to create AI models that could help governments, poor and underserved communities,

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
and aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
And he took zoom selfies with Microsoft CEOs.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,900
Emod was ambitious and creative, but also unfocused and unprepared.

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,840
Stability has had serious issues across business operations, funding and talent retention.

47
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
The company was burning through cash at an alarming rate next to the compute needed to

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,000
power its models and overwhelming research spend.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In 2023 alone, stability spent almost $100 million on cloud services and the company

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,960
generated a grand total of $11 million.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Unpaid debts started to accelerate.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,080
Stability was $1 million short of its AWS bill in July 2023 and didn't even have a

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,800
plan to pay the $7 million it owed for its usage in August.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,640
They're kind of lucky Amazon doesn't run on mafia rules.

55
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,400
It also had an outstanding bill of $1 million to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU data center

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
CoreWeave.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,280
Despite this foundational financial issue, Emod continued to make promises he couldn't

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
keep.

59
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,200
He told prospective customers, including the Singaporean government, that he could deliver

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,880
custom national AI models within 60 days.

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,760
All of us are engaged with governments.

62
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
We're trying to help them.

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,880
It's a bit difficult when they're just catching up to the internet right now.

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,040
The timeline was untenable and confused the company's leading researchers.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,320
Stability was unable to develop a model for Singapore, which never became a customer.

66
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,160
A viable business model was failing to materialize.

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,180
They tried to monetize through an API, then a managed service arm, both of which have

68
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,800
struggled to gain traction and the service may have infringed on their contract with

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
AWS.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,440
Emod scrambled to come up with funding that would pay off debts and retain talent.

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,960
In July 2023, he shared a plan to raise $500 million in cash and $750 million in computing

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,720
credits from marquee investors like Nvidia, Google, Intel, and the World Bank.

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,320
However, most of these investments did not materialize, with only a small fraction of

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
the targeted funding being secured.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,520
The debts and empty promises led to an even bigger issue.

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,600
These at Stability AI grew increasingly unhappy with the company and its leadership.

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,000
The whiplash shifts in priorities and resources, often based on Emod's changing whims, demoralized

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,320
and infuriated workers.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Projects were abruptly reallocated and researchers were reassigned.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,680
One former executive described Emod as the most disorganized leader I have ever worked

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,440
with in my career.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,560
Problems over the company's financial situation and Emod's leadership led to a steady stream

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
of executive departures.

84
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,560
Some departed over worries about cash flow and potential legal liabilities, such as Emod's

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
reportedly lax approach to preventing the generation of sexually abusive imagery.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,400
The final blow came in March 2024 when the star research team behind Stable Diffusion,

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
including lead researcher Robin Romback, turned in their resignations.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Other senior leaders issued an ultimatum to Emod, resign or they would walk as well.

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,600
The departure of the researchers, widely viewed as the company's crown jewels, underscored

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,700
the depth of dysfunction and discontent within Stability AI under Emod's leadership.

91
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,760
Just days later, Emod announced that he would step down as CEO, claiming he wanted to decentralize

92
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280
power in AI.

93
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,780
However, sources say he fought to maintain control until the very end, despite mounting

94
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,020
pressure to leave.

95
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,260
Emod also resigned from the board, which has initiated a search for a permanent replacement.

96
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,260
The temporary leaders put in the role have inherited a company in crisis.

97
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,540
Stability continues to burn cash much faster than it generates revenue, making only $5.4

98
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,700
million in February 2023 against $8 million in costs.

99
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,820
It faces ongoing concerns about making payroll for its 150 remaining employees.

100
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,520
Just existentially, Stability has been hit with a trio of copyright lawsuits alleging

101
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,860
its AI models were trained on unlicensed art and photography.

102
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,380
The litigation could drag on for years and threaten the entire generative AI industry

103
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,940
if Stability puts up an insufficient fight.

104
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,700
Once flush with over $100 million in funding, Stability is now in a deep hole, needing not

105
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,480
just more cash but a viable business model in a fast-moving competitive space.

106
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,840
Some employees have expressed optimism that Emod's exit could make the company more appealing

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,960
to investors or acquirers, but after his disastrous tenure, any savior will have their work cut

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,600
out for them to write the ship before the money runs out.

109
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,000
The entire Stability situation points out some really key takeaways about the state

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
of the AI industry.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,480
So far, our audience has brought up some great points, so be sure to check it out.

115
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
1.

116
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Open-source models without a strong underlying business can be tricky to monetize.

117
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,040
Stability diffusion's open-source nature allowed it to be used by millions worldwide

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,820
in a highly creative way.

119
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,400
But Stability struggled to translate this popularity into a sustainable revenue stream.

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,640
The massive computational power required to train and run AI models is costly.

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,160
Stability's expense is far outpaced its revenue.

122
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:49,000
You need not only strong upfront funding, but a clear path to monetizing.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Popularity alone won't keep the boat afloat.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
2.

125
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,160
AI ethics need to be smartly thought out and readily addressed.

126
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,160
The beauty of the models that Stability has released is that they put full creativity

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,520
in the hands of the users rather than keeping them in a system with strict guardrails created

128
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,640
and enforced by tech giants.

129
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,600
But there's also pretty clear drawbacks in the form of explicit and illegal content.

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,360
Furthermore, Stability hasn't had an overwhelmingly strong response to the copyright infringement

131
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,640
claims made by Getty Images and others.

132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
3.

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,940
Talent acquisition is the name of the game right now.

134
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,540
With a floundering business plan, insufficient funding, and a lack of direction, great talent

135
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,140
from research to business operations will leave.

136
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,420
This brings us to the ultimate example of the AI war for talent.

137
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,180
Inflection AI.

138
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,780
Inflection came out of nowhere to raise $1.5 billion and launch a chat GPT competitor.

139
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,900
At the time, the $1.5 billion was the third largest round in the space, right behind Open

140
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,660
AI and Anthropic.

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,940
Now, it's stripped to the bones, and most of its key talent went to Microsoft.

142
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,900
This is the story of an unexpected acquisition that technically didn't happen.

143
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,700
Mustafa Suleyman is one of the most influential figures in AI.

144
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,660
Much of his mass influence comes from a great book called The Coming Wave, highly suggested,

145
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,860
which details the convergence of exponential technologies like AI, robotics, biotech, and

146
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
more.

147
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,980
In fact, their fusion will have on the world.

148
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,620
Based on his experience forming DeepMind, which eventually sold to Google in 2014 and

149
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,300
gave the company an AI boost, Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI in 2022.

150
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,420
The company quickly raised over $1.5 billion from big name investors like Microsoft, Bill

151
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,820
Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Nvidia at a valuation of $4 billion.

152
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,980
Suleyman's flagship project was Pi, an AI chatbot focused on providing emotional guidance

153
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,900
and companionship for users.

154
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:09,020
They also poured money into infrastructure, amassing 22,000 expensive Nvidia H100 GPU

155
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,060
chips, which recently just got outdated with the announcement of the new Blackwell chips.

156
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,220
Pi wasn't the original product that Suleyman imagined and pitched at the start of Inflection's

157
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
funding.

158
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,580
The big idea was creating an AI chief of staff for businesses that could carry out many of

159
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:31,140
the tasks across an organization that require adept staff planning, HR prowess, and a certain

160
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,380
level of emotional intelligence.

161
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,660
Pi was the first iteration of what that could look like, but its use case diverged quite

162
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,220
aggressively from something that would be integrated into a business.

163
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,380
It struggled to gain traction with consumers in the crowded AI chatbot market.

164
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,180
Then within a year of its bloated funding round, Suleyman, his co-founder, and many

165
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,780
key team members left the company to join Microsoft, and Suleyman would be named the

166
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,060
head of their consumer AI.

167
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,620
This move was highly unusual.

168
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,460
Typically if a company wants all of the key talent from a company, they'll buy it and

169
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,860
integrate the people or make it a subsidiary, but Microsoft didn't have to do that and

170
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,300
were able to bring on everyone that they wanted.

171
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,260
As for inflection, Microsoft agreed to pay the company $650 million to license the company's

172
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,660
technology as long as they agreed not to sue over Microsoft's hiring of its top talent.

173
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,540
This also allowed Microsoft to provide somewhat of a positive outcome for initial investors,

174
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,020
paying out $1.5 times the investment for the funders in the first $225 million round,

175
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,840
and $1.1 times the investment for those who participated in the round that was well north

176
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,680
of $1 billion.

177
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,840
As for what's left of inflection's business, they have pivoted to an AI studio helping

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,240
companies work with large language models, but then again, it's just a shell of what

179
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
was left.

180
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,460
There's a lot to dissect here, but let's start with Suleyman.

181
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,960
His book details some of the perils associated with AI that advances too quickly and without

182
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
guardrails.

183
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,280
He also makes a claim that it's unlikely that massive companies, such as, hmm, Microsoft,

184
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,880
move too slowly to curb potentially dangerous AI advancement, is becoming the head of consumer

185
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,760
AI at Microsoft his best chance at ensuring a safe AI future, or a damning example that

186
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,040
the economic drive to create bigger, better and faster, whittles away at the key values

187
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,080
held by AI thought leaders.

188
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,960
Then there's the Microsoft part of this.

189
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Overall, it's an example of how their CEO, Satya Nadella, plays the game like a chess

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
grandmaster.

191
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,600
He's been able to situate deals that keep key investors happy and accelerates his company's

192
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,760
AI ambitions.

193
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,600
He has built up a trove of impactful AI models running through his cloud, including models

194
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
from open AI, Mistral, and now inflection.

195
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,360
The creative acquisition is likely to come under scrutiny from the US government, which

196
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,680
is looking to prevent potentially monopolistic acquisitions and investments Microsoft has

197
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
carried out in the generative AI space.

198
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,640
While they avoided a lot of red tape that would follow an outright acquisition of inflection,

199
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,560
it matches many of the beats of an acquisition.

200
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,920
The government has already put Google and Apple under a close monopoly microscope.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,920
There's also an open AI part of this worth noting.

202
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Remember the insane couple of days when the open AI board kicked Sam Altman out of the

203
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,000
company he built?

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,680
At the time, Nadella moved quickly to offer Altman and his loyal followers at open AI

205
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,680
a home to continue their work at Microsoft.

206
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,360
Even though that backup plan never panned out and Altman returned victoriously to his

207
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,160
company, the event clearly led Nadella to rethink how he approaches the risk of relying

208
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,840
on a single AI innovator.

209
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,480
By adding Suleiman and inflection's key talent, Microsoft has mimicked the game plan they

210
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
set up in a time of crisis and bolstered their in-house efforts.

211
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Microsoft has spread out its bets rather than putting all their chips in the open AI basket.

212
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,160
For open AI, this could diminish their leverage and their $85 billion valuation.

213
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,960
The biggest and most important takeaway from the inflection situation is how competitive

214
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,320
the AI talent market is.

215
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,400
Tech Titans are offering huge compensation packages and equity to lure the best in the

216
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,520
industry to their projects.

217
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,040
They've even tried some personal tactics.

218
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,840
For example, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been personally crafting emails to some prospective

219
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,680
employees to show how committed he is to bringing them on board.

220
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,760
Google's Sergei Brin has reached out to employees that have left the company in hopes of getting

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,240
them to come back.

222
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,280
The overall pay range for AI talent has risen about 40% across the board.

223
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,600
Even those new to the industry with recent PhDs are getting salaries in the $800,000

224
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,560
range from open AI and Anthropic.

225
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,200
When things are this competitive and expensive, it may become a common tactic for the big

226
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,560
companies in the space to dismantle promising startups and consume their best talent.

227
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,160
For the future of AI, that's probably not a great thing.

228
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,040
Startups inject energy, competition, and innovation into the market and diversify power away from

229
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
incumbents.

230
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,160
This benefits users and therefore, in something as important as AI, the future of humanity.

231
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,080
The talent, models, and compute being stored in the hands of only a few companies threatens

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,080
a vibrant startup market and the story of inflection has so far demonstrated that path.

233
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,720
It's important to note that both stability and inflection are side effects of unsustainable

234
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,400
core business models despite huge funding.

235
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,640
This brings us to Cohere, which mimics much of the leading player's approach to generative

236
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
AI chat.

237
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,880
The Canadian AI startup was founded by some of the Google DeepMind researchers that pioneered

238
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
the transformer model, which has defined the current generative AI architecture.

239
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,960
They've attempted to position Cohere as the go-to enterprise AI chat provider.

240
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,480
Their models are customizable through fine-tuning and other techniques to provide businesses

241
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
with fast, accurate, and relatively cheap AI chats.

242
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,200
Their models also branch into business search solutions, classifying, and other functions

243
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,040
that have become mainstream offerings from LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropik.

244
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,200
The startup has raised $445 million and is seeking new funds that would push their valuation

245
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,160
to $6 billion.

246
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
But there is a huge, glaring issue that needs to be addressed.

247
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,580
The company brought in only $13 million last year.

248
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,840
That means the new valuation would be 450 times its annualized revenue.

249
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,760
In comparison, OpenAI generated 130 times what Cohere made last year.

250
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,520
And its beefy $85 billion valuation was a far more reasonable but still insane 50 times

251
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,960
annualized revenue.

252
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,840
And it's not like Cohere's product is bad, or it has struggled to onboard customers.

253
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,800
They're just playing a very expensive AI chat game that has some unclear economics.

254
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,960
This brings up a really key question that will define the next wave of AI investment.

255
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,680
Is generative AI a money pit?

256
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,840
That says nothing of its effectiveness or the incredible power of generative AI or the

257
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,520
fact that you should learn everything you can about AI as fast as you can.

258
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,480
But does it make sense for investors to keep pouring money into what has so far proven

259
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,440
to be an expensive endeavor with a shaky business model?

260
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,560
The answer could be a resounding yes.

261
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,920
And if AI is the definitive technology of the future, then throwing money at companies

262
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,640
leading the charge is a short term pain that could result in a huge windfall.

263
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,760
But that was also the thinking among many investors in the dot com bubble, as noted by the head

264
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,680
of AWS which has poured billions and billions into the generative AI race.

265
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,920
When the tide goes out, once promising startups with poor underlying financials or vision

266
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:42,560
or leadership or zoom selfies, go under, no matter how impactful the tech is.

267
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,880
So what do you think?

268
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,600
Are we starting to see the shoreline recede?
