00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
The promise of AI has led to a flood of investment, but the chaotic rise has produced a dramatic

00:06.240 --> 00:07.400
stretch of events.

00:07.400 --> 00:13.640
A heavily funded startup led by a leading AI entrepreneur gets stripped for parts, severe

00:13.640 --> 00:19.960
instability threatens a promising open source company, and revenue from a leading generative

00:19.960 --> 00:24.640
chat startup points to a reality the industry has to face.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.120
Is this the beginning of a broken AI startup landscape?

00:28.120 --> 00:32.120
Is it a sign that AIR is coming out of the AI funding balloon?

00:32.120 --> 00:34.040
And what does all of this mean?

00:34.040 --> 00:45.240
For the future of AI?

00:45.240 --> 00:50.160
Some optimistic researchers and economists claim that AI has the potential to supercharge

00:50.160 --> 00:57.120
growth to 20% a year, a significant bump from the 3.2% growth average the US has experienced

00:57.120 --> 00:58.560
since World War II.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.920
If that supercharged growth materializes even slightly, that's an amazing change in society.

01:04.920 --> 01:11.120
A Northwestern economist found that the typical American is 100 times richer than in 1870

01:11.120 --> 01:13.360
when growth was stalled at 0%.

01:13.360 --> 01:19.080
With growth at 20%, the typical American would be a thousand times richer than they are today

01:19.080 --> 01:21.440
in a relatively short time window.

01:21.440 --> 01:26.160
This is the promise of exponential technology meeting exponential times.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.960
But there's a lot of things that would have to go right to meet that growth dream.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.920
And AI is entering a turbulent phase in the hype cycle.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.080
The head of Amazon Web Services, Adam Salipsky, who has overseen much of the company's massive

01:39.080 --> 01:45.040
investment in generative AI, has made connections to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.240
The internet in the long term was underhyped, but a slew of companies trying to cash in

01:50.240 --> 01:52.120
were gravely overhyped.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.680
And those companies led to a bubble that popped, hurting everyone else.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.520
We may be at the point where the needle is starting to pierce the balloon, with three

02:01.520 --> 02:04.200
big examples to investigate in this video.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.000
We're going to start with stability AI.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.880
Emod Mestak started stability AI in late 2020, and based on research from a project called

02:12.880 --> 02:18.400
latent diffusion, stability released a model called stable diffusion in August 2022.

02:18.400 --> 02:24.160
The model used a denoising process in its architecture that enabled unique image generation.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.560
The result was a really effective open source model capable of creating great images and

02:29.560 --> 02:33.480
enabling users to train the model on their own dataset.

02:33.480 --> 02:40.480
Stability AI raised $101 million at a billion dollar valuation in 2022, just days after

02:40.480 --> 02:42.120
launching stable diffusion.

02:42.120 --> 02:47.720
Buied by AI interest and a growing base that featured tens of millions of active users,

02:47.720 --> 02:50.880
2023 promised to be a big year for the company.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.320
And Emod had an engaging vision for what AI could do for the world.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.400
If we do it right, then we can really uplift the entire of humanity, which I think is pretty

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
crazy and pretty awesome.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.880
It's the first time we've ever had the tools to do that.

03:02.880 --> 03:08.480
He wanted to create AI models that could help governments, poor and underserved communities,

03:08.480 --> 03:11.120
and aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.920
And he took zoom selfies with Microsoft CEOs.

03:13.920 --> 03:19.900
Emod was ambitious and creative, but also unfocused and unprepared.

03:19.900 --> 03:25.840
Stability has had serious issues across business operations, funding and talent retention.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.760
The company was burning through cash at an alarming rate next to the compute needed to

03:29.760 --> 03:33.000
power its models and overwhelming research spend.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
In 2023 alone, stability spent almost $100 million on cloud services and the company

03:39.000 --> 03:43.960
generated a grand total of $11 million.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.520
Unpaid debts started to accelerate.

03:46.520 --> 03:52.080
Stability was $1 million short of its AWS bill in July 2023 and didn't even have a

03:52.080 --> 03:55.800
plan to pay the $7 million it owed for its usage in August.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.640
They're kind of lucky Amazon doesn't run on mafia rules.

03:58.640 --> 04:05.400
It also had an outstanding bill of $1 million to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU data center

04:05.400 --> 04:06.880
CoreWeave.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.280
Despite this foundational financial issue, Emod continued to make promises he couldn't

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
keep.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.200
He told prospective customers, including the Singaporean government, that he could deliver

04:17.200 --> 04:20.880
custom national AI models within 60 days.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.760
All of us are engaged with governments.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
We're trying to help them.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.880
It's a bit difficult when they're just catching up to the internet right now.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.040
The timeline was untenable and confused the company's leading researchers.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.320
Stability was unable to develop a model for Singapore, which never became a customer.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.160
A viable business model was failing to materialize.

04:40.160 --> 04:45.180
They tried to monetize through an API, then a managed service arm, both of which have

04:45.180 --> 04:49.800
struggled to gain traction and the service may have infringed on their contract with

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
AWS.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.440
Emod scrambled to come up with funding that would pay off debts and retain talent.

04:55.440 --> 05:02.960
In July 2023, he shared a plan to raise $500 million in cash and $750 million in computing

05:02.960 --> 05:08.720
credits from marquee investors like Nvidia, Google, Intel, and the World Bank.

05:08.720 --> 05:14.320
However, most of these investments did not materialize, with only a small fraction of

05:14.320 --> 05:16.800
the targeted funding being secured.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.520
The debts and empty promises led to an even bigger issue.

05:21.520 --> 05:26.600
These at Stability AI grew increasingly unhappy with the company and its leadership.

05:26.600 --> 05:33.000
The whiplash shifts in priorities and resources, often based on Emod's changing whims, demoralized

05:33.000 --> 05:35.320
and infuriated workers.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.320
Projects were abruptly reallocated and researchers were reassigned.

05:39.320 --> 05:44.680
One former executive described Emod as the most disorganized leader I have ever worked

05:44.680 --> 05:46.440
with in my career.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.560
Problems over the company's financial situation and Emod's leadership led to a steady stream

05:51.560 --> 05:53.320
of executive departures.

05:53.320 --> 05:58.560
Some departed over worries about cash flow and potential legal liabilities, such as Emod's

05:58.560 --> 06:03.680
reportedly lax approach to preventing the generation of sexually abusive imagery.

06:03.680 --> 06:09.400
The final blow came in March 2024 when the star research team behind Stable Diffusion,

06:09.400 --> 06:13.400
including lead researcher Robin Romback, turned in their resignations.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.800
Other senior leaders issued an ultimatum to Emod, resign or they would walk as well.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.600
The departure of the researchers, widely viewed as the company's crown jewels, underscored

06:23.600 --> 06:29.700
the depth of dysfunction and discontent within Stability AI under Emod's leadership.

06:29.700 --> 06:35.760
Just days later, Emod announced that he would step down as CEO, claiming he wanted to decentralize

06:35.760 --> 06:37.280
power in AI.

06:37.280 --> 06:42.780
However, sources say he fought to maintain control until the very end, despite mounting

06:42.780 --> 06:44.020
pressure to leave.

06:44.020 --> 06:49.260
Emod also resigned from the board, which has initiated a search for a permanent replacement.

06:49.260 --> 06:54.260
The temporary leaders put in the role have inherited a company in crisis.

06:54.260 --> 06:59.540
Stability continues to burn cash much faster than it generates revenue, making only $5.4

06:59.540 --> 07:04.700
million in February 2023 against $8 million in costs.

07:04.700 --> 07:10.820
It faces ongoing concerns about making payroll for its 150 remaining employees.

07:10.820 --> 07:15.520
Just existentially, Stability has been hit with a trio of copyright lawsuits alleging

07:15.520 --> 07:19.860
its AI models were trained on unlicensed art and photography.

07:19.860 --> 07:25.380
The litigation could drag on for years and threaten the entire generative AI industry

07:25.380 --> 07:27.940
if Stability puts up an insufficient fight.

07:27.940 --> 07:34.700
Once flush with over $100 million in funding, Stability is now in a deep hole, needing not

07:34.700 --> 07:40.480
just more cash but a viable business model in a fast-moving competitive space.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.840
Some employees have expressed optimism that Emod's exit could make the company more appealing

07:45.840 --> 07:51.960
to investors or acquirers, but after his disastrous tenure, any savior will have their work cut

07:51.960 --> 07:55.600
out for them to write the ship before the money runs out.

07:55.600 --> 08:01.000
The entire Stability situation points out some really key takeaways about the state

08:01.000 --> 08:02.520
of the AI industry.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.920
But first, be sure to subscribe so you can catch all of our deeply researched videos

08:06.920 --> 08:08.720
on artificial intelligence.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.200
And if you have an opinion, we'd love to chat with you in the comments.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.480
So far, our audience has brought up some great points, so be sure to check it out.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
1.

08:17.480 --> 08:22.880
Open-source models without a strong underlying business can be tricky to monetize.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.040
Stability diffusion's open-source nature allowed it to be used by millions worldwide

08:27.040 --> 08:28.820
in a highly creative way.

08:28.820 --> 08:34.400
But Stability struggled to translate this popularity into a sustainable revenue stream.

08:34.400 --> 08:40.640
The massive computational power required to train and run AI models is costly.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.160
Stability's expense is far outpaced its revenue.

08:43.160 --> 08:49.000
You need not only strong upfront funding, but a clear path to monetizing.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.760
Popularity alone won't keep the boat afloat.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.760
2.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.160
AI ethics need to be smartly thought out and readily addressed.

08:57.160 --> 09:02.160
The beauty of the models that Stability has released is that they put full creativity

09:02.240 --> 09:07.520
in the hands of the users rather than keeping them in a system with strict guardrails created

09:07.520 --> 09:09.640
and enforced by tech giants.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.600
But there's also pretty clear drawbacks in the form of explicit and illegal content.

09:14.600 --> 09:20.360
Furthermore, Stability hasn't had an overwhelmingly strong response to the copyright infringement

09:20.360 --> 09:23.640
claims made by Getty Images and others.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.840
3.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.940
Talent acquisition is the name of the game right now.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.540
With a floundering business plan, insufficient funding, and a lack of direction, great talent

09:33.540 --> 09:37.140
from research to business operations will leave.

09:37.140 --> 09:42.420
This brings us to the ultimate example of the AI war for talent.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.180
Inflection AI.

09:44.180 --> 09:50.780
Inflection came out of nowhere to raise $1.5 billion and launch a chat GPT competitor.

09:50.780 --> 09:55.900
At the time, the $1.5 billion was the third largest round in the space, right behind Open

09:55.900 --> 09:57.660
AI and Anthropic.

09:57.660 --> 10:02.940
Now, it's stripped to the bones, and most of its key talent went to Microsoft.

10:02.940 --> 10:07.900
This is the story of an unexpected acquisition that technically didn't happen.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.700
Mustafa Suleyman is one of the most influential figures in AI.

10:12.700 --> 10:17.660
Much of his mass influence comes from a great book called The Coming Wave, highly suggested,

10:17.660 --> 10:23.860
which details the convergence of exponential technologies like AI, robotics, biotech, and

10:23.860 --> 10:24.860
more.

10:24.860 --> 10:27.980
In fact, their fusion will have on the world.

10:27.980 --> 10:32.620
Based on his experience forming DeepMind, which eventually sold to Google in 2014 and

10:32.620 --> 10:38.300
gave the company an AI boost, Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI in 2022.

10:38.300 --> 10:44.420
The company quickly raised over $1.5 billion from big name investors like Microsoft, Bill

10:44.420 --> 10:49.820
Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Nvidia at a valuation of $4 billion.

10:49.820 --> 10:54.980
Suleyman's flagship project was Pi, an AI chatbot focused on providing emotional guidance

10:54.980 --> 11:01.900
and companionship for users.

11:01.900 --> 11:09.020
They also poured money into infrastructure, amassing 22,000 expensive Nvidia H100 GPU

11:09.020 --> 11:13.060
chips, which recently just got outdated with the announcement of the new Blackwell chips.

11:13.060 --> 11:18.220
Pi wasn't the original product that Suleyman imagined and pitched at the start of Inflection's

11:18.220 --> 11:19.220
funding.

11:19.220 --> 11:24.580
The big idea was creating an AI chief of staff for businesses that could carry out many of

11:24.580 --> 11:31.140
the tasks across an organization that require adept staff planning, HR prowess, and a certain

11:31.140 --> 11:33.380
level of emotional intelligence.

11:33.380 --> 11:38.660
Pi was the first iteration of what that could look like, but its use case diverged quite

11:38.660 --> 11:42.220
aggressively from something that would be integrated into a business.

11:42.220 --> 11:47.380
It struggled to gain traction with consumers in the crowded AI chatbot market.

11:47.380 --> 11:53.180
Then within a year of its bloated funding round, Suleyman, his co-founder, and many

11:53.180 --> 11:58.780
key team members left the company to join Microsoft, and Suleyman would be named the

11:58.780 --> 12:01.060
head of their consumer AI.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.620
This move was highly unusual.

12:03.620 --> 12:08.460
Typically if a company wants all of the key talent from a company, they'll buy it and

12:08.460 --> 12:13.860
integrate the people or make it a subsidiary, but Microsoft didn't have to do that and

12:13.860 --> 12:16.300
were able to bring on everyone that they wanted.

12:16.300 --> 12:22.260
As for inflection, Microsoft agreed to pay the company $650 million to license the company's

12:22.260 --> 12:27.660
technology as long as they agreed not to sue over Microsoft's hiring of its top talent.

12:27.660 --> 12:32.540
This also allowed Microsoft to provide somewhat of a positive outcome for initial investors,

12:32.540 --> 12:39.020
paying out $1.5 times the investment for the funders in the first $225 million round,

12:39.020 --> 12:43.840
and $1.1 times the investment for those who participated in the round that was well north

12:43.840 --> 12:45.680
of $1 billion.

12:45.680 --> 12:50.840
As for what's left of inflection's business, they have pivoted to an AI studio helping

12:50.840 --> 12:55.240
companies work with large language models, but then again, it's just a shell of what

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
was left.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.460
There's a lot to dissect here, but let's start with Suleyman.

13:00.460 --> 13:05.960
His book details some of the perils associated with AI that advances too quickly and without

13:05.960 --> 13:06.960
guardrails.

13:06.960 --> 13:13.280
He also makes a claim that it's unlikely that massive companies, such as, hmm, Microsoft,

13:13.280 --> 13:18.880
move too slowly to curb potentially dangerous AI advancement, is becoming the head of consumer

13:18.880 --> 13:25.760
AI at Microsoft his best chance at ensuring a safe AI future, or a damning example that

13:25.760 --> 13:32.040
the economic drive to create bigger, better and faster, whittles away at the key values

13:32.040 --> 13:35.080
held by AI thought leaders.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.960
Then there's the Microsoft part of this.

13:37.960 --> 13:44.000
Overall, it's an example of how their CEO, Satya Nadella, plays the game like a chess

13:44.000 --> 13:45.320
grandmaster.

13:45.320 --> 13:50.600
He's been able to situate deals that keep key investors happy and accelerates his company's

13:50.600 --> 13:51.760
AI ambitions.

13:51.760 --> 13:57.600
He has built up a trove of impactful AI models running through his cloud, including models

13:57.600 --> 14:01.360
from open AI, Mistral, and now inflection.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.360
The creative acquisition is likely to come under scrutiny from the US government, which

14:06.360 --> 14:11.680
is looking to prevent potentially monopolistic acquisitions and investments Microsoft has

14:11.680 --> 14:14.320
carried out in the generative AI space.

14:14.320 --> 14:19.640
While they avoided a lot of red tape that would follow an outright acquisition of inflection,

14:19.640 --> 14:22.560
it matches many of the beats of an acquisition.

14:22.560 --> 14:27.920
The government has already put Google and Apple under a close monopoly microscope.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.920
There's also an open AI part of this worth noting.

14:30.920 --> 14:35.760
Remember the insane couple of days when the open AI board kicked Sam Altman out of the

14:35.760 --> 14:37.000
company he built?

14:37.000 --> 14:42.680
At the time, Nadella moved quickly to offer Altman and his loyal followers at open AI

14:42.680 --> 14:45.680
a home to continue their work at Microsoft.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.360
Even though that backup plan never panned out and Altman returned victoriously to his

14:50.360 --> 14:56.160
company, the event clearly led Nadella to rethink how he approaches the risk of relying

14:56.160 --> 14:58.840
on a single AI innovator.

14:58.840 --> 15:04.480
By adding Suleiman and inflection's key talent, Microsoft has mimicked the game plan they

15:04.480 --> 15:08.920
set up in a time of crisis and bolstered their in-house efforts.

15:08.920 --> 15:14.880
Microsoft has spread out its bets rather than putting all their chips in the open AI basket.

15:14.880 --> 15:21.160
For open AI, this could diminish their leverage and their $85 billion valuation.

15:21.160 --> 15:26.960
The biggest and most important takeaway from the inflection situation is how competitive

15:26.960 --> 15:29.320
the AI talent market is.

15:29.320 --> 15:35.400
Tech Titans are offering huge compensation packages and equity to lure the best in the

15:35.400 --> 15:37.520
industry to their projects.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.040
They've even tried some personal tactics.

15:40.040 --> 15:45.840
For example, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been personally crafting emails to some prospective

15:45.840 --> 15:49.680
employees to show how committed he is to bringing them on board.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.760
Google's Sergei Brin has reached out to employees that have left the company in hopes of getting

15:54.760 --> 15:56.240
them to come back.

15:56.240 --> 16:02.280
The overall pay range for AI talent has risen about 40% across the board.

16:02.280 --> 16:08.600
Even those new to the industry with recent PhDs are getting salaries in the $800,000

16:08.600 --> 16:11.560
range from open AI and Anthropic.

16:11.560 --> 16:17.200
When things are this competitive and expensive, it may become a common tactic for the big

16:17.200 --> 16:22.560
companies in the space to dismantle promising startups and consume their best talent.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.160
For the future of AI, that's probably not a great thing.

16:27.160 --> 16:33.040
Startups inject energy, competition, and innovation into the market and diversify power away from

16:33.040 --> 16:34.040
incumbents.

16:34.040 --> 16:40.160
This benefits users and therefore, in something as important as AI, the future of humanity.

16:40.160 --> 16:46.080
The talent, models, and compute being stored in the hands of only a few companies threatens

16:46.080 --> 16:52.080
a vibrant startup market and the story of inflection has so far demonstrated that path.

16:52.080 --> 16:57.720
It's important to note that both stability and inflection are side effects of unsustainable

16:57.720 --> 17:01.400
core business models despite huge funding.

17:01.400 --> 17:06.640
This brings us to Cohere, which mimics much of the leading player's approach to generative

17:06.640 --> 17:07.760
AI chat.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.880
The Canadian AI startup was founded by some of the Google DeepMind researchers that pioneered

17:12.880 --> 17:17.520
the transformer model, which has defined the current generative AI architecture.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.960
They've attempted to position Cohere as the go-to enterprise AI chat provider.

17:22.960 --> 17:28.480
Their models are customizable through fine-tuning and other techniques to provide businesses

17:28.480 --> 17:32.720
with fast, accurate, and relatively cheap AI chats.

17:32.720 --> 17:38.200
Their models also branch into business search solutions, classifying, and other functions

17:38.200 --> 17:44.040
that have become mainstream offerings from LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropik.

17:44.040 --> 17:50.200
The startup has raised $445 million and is seeking new funds that would push their valuation

17:50.200 --> 17:52.160
to $6 billion.

17:52.160 --> 17:56.400
But there is a huge, glaring issue that needs to be addressed.

17:56.400 --> 18:01.580
The company brought in only $13 million last year.

18:01.580 --> 18:07.840
That means the new valuation would be 450 times its annualized revenue.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.760
In comparison, OpenAI generated 130 times what Cohere made last year.

18:13.760 --> 18:20.520
And its beefy $85 billion valuation was a far more reasonable but still insane 50 times

18:20.520 --> 18:21.960
annualized revenue.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.840
And it's not like Cohere's product is bad, or it has struggled to onboard customers.

18:26.840 --> 18:32.800
They're just playing a very expensive AI chat game that has some unclear economics.

18:32.800 --> 18:38.960
This brings up a really key question that will define the next wave of AI investment.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.680
Is generative AI a money pit?

18:41.680 --> 18:46.840
That says nothing of its effectiveness or the incredible power of generative AI or the

18:46.840 --> 18:52.520
fact that you should learn everything you can about AI as fast as you can.

18:52.520 --> 18:58.480
But does it make sense for investors to keep pouring money into what has so far proven

18:58.480 --> 19:02.440
to be an expensive endeavor with a shaky business model?

19:02.440 --> 19:05.560
The answer could be a resounding yes.

19:05.560 --> 19:10.920
And if AI is the definitive technology of the future, then throwing money at companies

19:10.920 --> 19:16.640
leading the charge is a short term pain that could result in a huge windfall.

19:16.640 --> 19:22.760
But that was also the thinking among many investors in the dot com bubble, as noted by the head

19:22.760 --> 19:28.680
of AWS which has poured billions and billions into the generative AI race.

19:28.680 --> 19:34.920
When the tide goes out, once promising startups with poor underlying financials or vision

19:34.920 --> 19:42.560
or leadership or zoom selfies, go under, no matter how impactful the tech is.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.880
So what do you think?

19:43.880 --> 19:46.600
Are we starting to see the shoreline recede?
