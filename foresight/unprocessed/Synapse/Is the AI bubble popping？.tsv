0	6240	The promise of AI has led to a flood of investment, but the chaotic rise has produced a dramatic
6240	7400	stretch of events.
7400	13640	A heavily funded startup led by a leading AI entrepreneur gets stripped for parts, severe
13640	19960	instability threatens a promising open source company, and revenue from a leading generative
19960	24640	chat startup points to a reality the industry has to face.
24640	28120	Is this the beginning of a broken AI startup landscape?
28120	32120	Is it a sign that AIR is coming out of the AI funding balloon?
32120	34040	And what does all of this mean?
34040	45240	For the future of AI?
45240	50160	Some optimistic researchers and economists claim that AI has the potential to supercharge
50160	57120	growth to 20% a year, a significant bump from the 3.2% growth average the US has experienced
57120	58560	since World War II.
58560	64920	If that supercharged growth materializes even slightly, that's an amazing change in society.
64920	71120	A Northwestern economist found that the typical American is 100 times richer than in 1870
71120	73360	when growth was stalled at 0%.
73360	79080	With growth at 20%, the typical American would be a thousand times richer than they are today
79080	81440	in a relatively short time window.
81440	86160	This is the promise of exponential technology meeting exponential times.
86160	89960	But there's a lot of things that would have to go right to meet that growth dream.
89960	93920	And AI is entering a turbulent phase in the hype cycle.
93920	99080	The head of Amazon Web Services, Adam Salipsky, who has overseen much of the company's massive
99080	105040	investment in generative AI, has made connections to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s.
105040	110240	The internet in the long term was underhyped, but a slew of companies trying to cash in
110240	112120	were gravely overhyped.
112120	117680	And those companies led to a bubble that popped, hurting everyone else.
117680	121520	We may be at the point where the needle is starting to pierce the balloon, with three
121520	124200	big examples to investigate in this video.
124200	127000	We're going to start with stability AI.
127000	132880	Emod Mestak started stability AI in late 2020, and based on research from a project called
132880	138400	latent diffusion, stability released a model called stable diffusion in August 2022.
138400	144160	The model used a denoising process in its architecture that enabled unique image generation.
144160	149560	The result was a really effective open source model capable of creating great images and
149560	153480	enabling users to train the model on their own dataset.
153480	160480	Stability AI raised $101 million at a billion dollar valuation in 2022, just days after
160480	162120	launching stable diffusion.
162120	167720	Buied by AI interest and a growing base that featured tens of millions of active users,
167720	170880	2023 promised to be a big year for the company.
170880	175320	And Emod had an engaging vision for what AI could do for the world.
175320	179400	If we do it right, then we can really uplift the entire of humanity, which I think is pretty
179400	180400	crazy and pretty awesome.
180400	182880	It's the first time we've ever had the tools to do that.
182880	188480	He wanted to create AI models that could help governments, poor and underserved communities,
188480	191120	and aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe.
191120	193920	And he took zoom selfies with Microsoft CEOs.
193920	199900	Emod was ambitious and creative, but also unfocused and unprepared.
199900	205840	Stability has had serious issues across business operations, funding and talent retention.
205840	209760	The company was burning through cash at an alarming rate next to the compute needed to
209760	213000	power its models and overwhelming research spend.
213000	219000	In 2023 alone, stability spent almost $100 million on cloud services and the company
219000	223960	generated a grand total of $11 million.
223960	226520	Unpaid debts started to accelerate.
226520	232080	Stability was $1 million short of its AWS bill in July 2023 and didn't even have a
232080	235800	plan to pay the $7 million it owed for its usage in August.
235800	238640	They're kind of lucky Amazon doesn't run on mafia rules.
238640	245400	It also had an outstanding bill of $1 million to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU data center
245400	246880	CoreWeave.
246880	252280	Despite this foundational financial issue, Emod continued to make promises he couldn't
252280	253280	keep.
253280	257200	He told prospective customers, including the Singaporean government, that he could deliver
257200	260880	custom national AI models within 60 days.
260880	262760	All of us are engaged with governments.
262760	263760	We're trying to help them.
263760	266880	It's a bit difficult when they're just catching up to the internet right now.
266880	272040	The timeline was untenable and confused the company's leading researchers.
272040	276320	Stability was unable to develop a model for Singapore, which never became a customer.
276320	280160	A viable business model was failing to materialize.
280160	285180	They tried to monetize through an API, then a managed service arm, both of which have
285180	289800	struggled to gain traction and the service may have infringed on their contract with
289800	290800	AWS.
290800	295440	Emod scrambled to come up with funding that would pay off debts and retain talent.
295440	302960	In July 2023, he shared a plan to raise $500 million in cash and $750 million in computing
302960	308720	credits from marquee investors like Nvidia, Google, Intel, and the World Bank.
308720	314320	However, most of these investments did not materialize, with only a small fraction of
314320	316800	the targeted funding being secured.
316800	321520	The debts and empty promises led to an even bigger issue.
321520	326600	These at Stability AI grew increasingly unhappy with the company and its leadership.
326600	333000	The whiplash shifts in priorities and resources, often based on Emod's changing whims, demoralized
333000	335320	and infuriated workers.
335320	339320	Projects were abruptly reallocated and researchers were reassigned.
339320	344680	One former executive described Emod as the most disorganized leader I have ever worked
344680	346440	with in my career.
346440	351560	Problems over the company's financial situation and Emod's leadership led to a steady stream
351560	353320	of executive departures.
353320	358560	Some departed over worries about cash flow and potential legal liabilities, such as Emod's
358560	363680	reportedly lax approach to preventing the generation of sexually abusive imagery.
363680	369400	The final blow came in March 2024 when the star research team behind Stable Diffusion,
369400	373400	including lead researcher Robin Romback, turned in their resignations.
373400	378800	Other senior leaders issued an ultimatum to Emod, resign or they would walk as well.
378800	383600	The departure of the researchers, widely viewed as the company's crown jewels, underscored
383600	389700	the depth of dysfunction and discontent within Stability AI under Emod's leadership.
389700	395760	Just days later, Emod announced that he would step down as CEO, claiming he wanted to decentralize
395760	397280	power in AI.
397280	402780	However, sources say he fought to maintain control until the very end, despite mounting
402780	404020	pressure to leave.
404020	409260	Emod also resigned from the board, which has initiated a search for a permanent replacement.
409260	414260	The temporary leaders put in the role have inherited a company in crisis.
414260	419540	Stability continues to burn cash much faster than it generates revenue, making only $5.4
419540	424700	million in February 2023 against $8 million in costs.
424700	430820	It faces ongoing concerns about making payroll for its 150 remaining employees.
430820	435520	Just existentially, Stability has been hit with a trio of copyright lawsuits alleging
435520	439860	its AI models were trained on unlicensed art and photography.
439860	445380	The litigation could drag on for years and threaten the entire generative AI industry
445380	447940	if Stability puts up an insufficient fight.
447940	454700	Once flush with over $100 million in funding, Stability is now in a deep hole, needing not
454700	460480	just more cash but a viable business model in a fast-moving competitive space.
460480	465840	Some employees have expressed optimism that Emod's exit could make the company more appealing
465840	471960	to investors or acquirers, but after his disastrous tenure, any savior will have their work cut
471960	475600	out for them to write the ship before the money runs out.
475600	481000	The entire Stability situation points out some really key takeaways about the state
481000	482520	of the AI industry.

486920	488720	on artificial intelligence.
488720	492200	And if you have an opinion, we'd love to chat with you in the comments.
492200	496480	So far, our audience has brought up some great points, so be sure to check it out.
496480	497480	1.
497480	502880	Open-source models without a strong underlying business can be tricky to monetize.
502880	507040	Stability diffusion's open-source nature allowed it to be used by millions worldwide
507040	508820	in a highly creative way.
508820	514400	But Stability struggled to translate this popularity into a sustainable revenue stream.
514400	520640	The massive computational power required to train and run AI models is costly.
520640	523160	Stability's expense is far outpaced its revenue.
523160	529000	You need not only strong upfront funding, but a clear path to monetizing.
529000	531760	Popularity alone won't keep the boat afloat.
531760	532760	2.
532760	537160	AI ethics need to be smartly thought out and readily addressed.
537160	542160	The beauty of the models that Stability has released is that they put full creativity
542240	547520	in the hands of the users rather than keeping them in a system with strict guardrails created
547520	549640	and enforced by tech giants.
549640	554600	But there's also pretty clear drawbacks in the form of explicit and illegal content.
554600	560360	Furthermore, Stability hasn't had an overwhelmingly strong response to the copyright infringement
560360	563640	claims made by Getty Images and others.
563640	564840	3.
564840	567940	Talent acquisition is the name of the game right now.
567940	573540	With a floundering business plan, insufficient funding, and a lack of direction, great talent
573540	577140	from research to business operations will leave.
577140	582420	This brings us to the ultimate example of the AI war for talent.
582420	584180	Inflection AI.
584180	590780	Inflection came out of nowhere to raise $1.5 billion and launch a chat GPT competitor.
590780	595900	At the time, the $1.5 billion was the third largest round in the space, right behind Open
595900	597660	AI and Anthropic.
597660	602940	Now, it's stripped to the bones, and most of its key talent went to Microsoft.
602940	607900	This is the story of an unexpected acquisition that technically didn't happen.
607900	612700	Mustafa Suleyman is one of the most influential figures in AI.
612700	617660	Much of his mass influence comes from a great book called The Coming Wave, highly suggested,
617660	623860	which details the convergence of exponential technologies like AI, robotics, biotech, and
623860	624860	more.
624860	627980	In fact, their fusion will have on the world.
627980	632620	Based on his experience forming DeepMind, which eventually sold to Google in 2014 and
632620	638300	gave the company an AI boost, Suleyman co-founded Inflection AI in 2022.
638300	644420	The company quickly raised over $1.5 billion from big name investors like Microsoft, Bill
644420	649820	Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Nvidia at a valuation of $4 billion.
649820	654980	Suleyman's flagship project was Pi, an AI chatbot focused on providing emotional guidance
654980	661900	and companionship for users.
661900	669020	They also poured money into infrastructure, amassing 22,000 expensive Nvidia H100 GPU
669020	673060	chips, which recently just got outdated with the announcement of the new Blackwell chips.
673060	678220	Pi wasn't the original product that Suleyman imagined and pitched at the start of Inflection's
678220	679220	funding.
679220	684580	The big idea was creating an AI chief of staff for businesses that could carry out many of
684580	691140	the tasks across an organization that require adept staff planning, HR prowess, and a certain
691140	693380	level of emotional intelligence.
693380	698660	Pi was the first iteration of what that could look like, but its use case diverged quite
698660	702220	aggressively from something that would be integrated into a business.
702220	707380	It struggled to gain traction with consumers in the crowded AI chatbot market.
707380	713180	Then within a year of its bloated funding round, Suleyman, his co-founder, and many
713180	718780	key team members left the company to join Microsoft, and Suleyman would be named the
718780	721060	head of their consumer AI.
721060	723620	This move was highly unusual.
723620	728460	Typically if a company wants all of the key talent from a company, they'll buy it and
728460	733860	integrate the people or make it a subsidiary, but Microsoft didn't have to do that and
733860	736300	were able to bring on everyone that they wanted.
736300	742260	As for inflection, Microsoft agreed to pay the company $650 million to license the company's
742260	747660	technology as long as they agreed not to sue over Microsoft's hiring of its top talent.
747660	752540	This also allowed Microsoft to provide somewhat of a positive outcome for initial investors,
752540	759020	paying out $1.5 times the investment for the funders in the first $225 million round,
759020	763840	and $1.1 times the investment for those who participated in the round that was well north
763840	765680	of $1 billion.
765680	770840	As for what's left of inflection's business, they have pivoted to an AI studio helping
770840	775240	companies work with large language models, but then again, it's just a shell of what
775240	777240	was left.
777240	780460	There's a lot to dissect here, but let's start with Suleyman.
780460	785960	His book details some of the perils associated with AI that advances too quickly and without
785960	786960	guardrails.
786960	793280	He also makes a claim that it's unlikely that massive companies, such as, hmm, Microsoft,
793280	798880	move too slowly to curb potentially dangerous AI advancement, is becoming the head of consumer
798880	805760	AI at Microsoft his best chance at ensuring a safe AI future, or a damning example that
805760	812040	the economic drive to create bigger, better and faster, whittles away at the key values
812040	815080	held by AI thought leaders.
815080	817960	Then there's the Microsoft part of this.
817960	824000	Overall, it's an example of how their CEO, Satya Nadella, plays the game like a chess
824000	825320	grandmaster.
825320	830600	He's been able to situate deals that keep key investors happy and accelerates his company's
830600	831760	AI ambitions.
831760	837600	He has built up a trove of impactful AI models running through his cloud, including models
837600	841360	from open AI, Mistral, and now inflection.
841360	846360	The creative acquisition is likely to come under scrutiny from the US government, which
846360	851680	is looking to prevent potentially monopolistic acquisitions and investments Microsoft has
851680	854320	carried out in the generative AI space.
854320	859640	While they avoided a lot of red tape that would follow an outright acquisition of inflection,
859640	862560	it matches many of the beats of an acquisition.
862560	867920	The government has already put Google and Apple under a close monopoly microscope.
867920	870920	There's also an open AI part of this worth noting.
870920	875760	Remember the insane couple of days when the open AI board kicked Sam Altman out of the
875760	877000	company he built?
877000	882680	At the time, Nadella moved quickly to offer Altman and his loyal followers at open AI
882680	885680	a home to continue their work at Microsoft.
885680	890360	Even though that backup plan never panned out and Altman returned victoriously to his
890360	896160	company, the event clearly led Nadella to rethink how he approaches the risk of relying
896160	898840	on a single AI innovator.
898840	904480	By adding Suleiman and inflection's key talent, Microsoft has mimicked the game plan they
904480	908920	set up in a time of crisis and bolstered their in-house efforts.
908920	914880	Microsoft has spread out its bets rather than putting all their chips in the open AI basket.
914880	921160	For open AI, this could diminish their leverage and their $85 billion valuation.
921160	926960	The biggest and most important takeaway from the inflection situation is how competitive
926960	929320	the AI talent market is.
929320	935400	Tech Titans are offering huge compensation packages and equity to lure the best in the
935400	937520	industry to their projects.
937520	940040	They've even tried some personal tactics.
940040	945840	For example, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has been personally crafting emails to some prospective
945840	949680	employees to show how committed he is to bringing them on board.
949680	954760	Google's Sergei Brin has reached out to employees that have left the company in hopes of getting
954760	956240	them to come back.
956240	962280	The overall pay range for AI talent has risen about 40% across the board.
962280	968600	Even those new to the industry with recent PhDs are getting salaries in the $800,000
968600	971560	range from open AI and Anthropic.
971560	977200	When things are this competitive and expensive, it may become a common tactic for the big
977200	982560	companies in the space to dismantle promising startups and consume their best talent.
982560	987160	For the future of AI, that's probably not a great thing.
987160	993040	Startups inject energy, competition, and innovation into the market and diversify power away from
993040	994040	incumbents.
994040	1000160	This benefits users and therefore, in something as important as AI, the future of humanity.
1000160	1006080	The talent, models, and compute being stored in the hands of only a few companies threatens
1006080	1012080	a vibrant startup market and the story of inflection has so far demonstrated that path.
1012080	1017720	It's important to note that both stability and inflection are side effects of unsustainable
1017720	1021400	core business models despite huge funding.
1021400	1026640	This brings us to Cohere, which mimics much of the leading player's approach to generative
1026640	1027760	AI chat.
1027760	1032880	The Canadian AI startup was founded by some of the Google DeepMind researchers that pioneered
1032880	1037520	the transformer model, which has defined the current generative AI architecture.
1037520	1042960	They've attempted to position Cohere as the go-to enterprise AI chat provider.
1042960	1048480	Their models are customizable through fine-tuning and other techniques to provide businesses
1048480	1052720	with fast, accurate, and relatively cheap AI chats.
1052720	1058200	Their models also branch into business search solutions, classifying, and other functions
1058200	1064040	that have become mainstream offerings from LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropik.
1064040	1070200	The startup has raised $445 million and is seeking new funds that would push their valuation
1070200	1072160	to $6 billion.
1072160	1076400	But there is a huge, glaring issue that needs to be addressed.
1076400	1081580	The company brought in only $13 million last year.
1081580	1087840	That means the new valuation would be 450 times its annualized revenue.
1087840	1093760	In comparison, OpenAI generated 130 times what Cohere made last year.
1093760	1100520	And its beefy $85 billion valuation was a far more reasonable but still insane 50 times
1100520	1101960	annualized revenue.
1101960	1106840	And it's not like Cohere's product is bad, or it has struggled to onboard customers.
1106840	1112800	They're just playing a very expensive AI chat game that has some unclear economics.
1112800	1118960	This brings up a really key question that will define the next wave of AI investment.
1118960	1121680	Is generative AI a money pit?
1121680	1126840	That says nothing of its effectiveness or the incredible power of generative AI or the
1126840	1132520	fact that you should learn everything you can about AI as fast as you can.
1132520	1138480	But does it make sense for investors to keep pouring money into what has so far proven
1138480	1142440	to be an expensive endeavor with a shaky business model?
1142440	1145560	The answer could be a resounding yes.
1145560	1150920	And if AI is the definitive technology of the future, then throwing money at companies
1150920	1156640	leading the charge is a short term pain that could result in a huge windfall.
