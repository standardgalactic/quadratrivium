00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Hi everybody, welcome back to the front room. I'm Kai and I'm here with my dad today.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.240
Hi guys, hope you're having a good day. Thanks for joining us again.

00:07.360 --> 00:12.400
Maybe, maybe you won't have a good day after listening to this song.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.360
Oh, I'm gonna show you at least. Okay. Great, good to hear that.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.920
This is a highly requested song and artist.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.080
I could take a stab at who it might be, but I won't.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.360
Okay, yeah. We're gonna be listening to a song called

00:31.360 --> 00:34.320
Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.520
Thought it might be that one. I really did.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.960
Yeah, because people have asked for it for a long, long time.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.600
Yeah, a long time. Yeah, Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.

00:45.600 --> 00:53.200
Yes, it's an underground classic, but it's so popular in the underground, you know,

00:53.840 --> 00:58.400
people that maybe don't listen to rap that much or, you know, might have come across it.

00:59.280 --> 01:09.760
It's got released in 2001 and it's a pretty epic song, but I was gonna say, you know,

01:09.760 --> 01:13.040
I've listened to some other Immortal Technique. I haven't been the biggest fan.

01:13.040 --> 01:16.720
This song sticks out for me as one of his better ones that I've heard.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.880
Okay. But definitely, I was gonna say I'm a fan of the song,

01:20.960 --> 01:25.120
but I don't know if that's the right word to describe appreciating the song.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.680
So you'll see that. Usually, I give you the lyrics, but this time,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.240
I'm gonna hold off because he's pretty easy to understand.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.160
If you need the lyrics halfway through when I pause or something,

01:36.160 --> 01:38.400
yeah, just let me know and then I can give them to you.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.400
I'll do that. But just focus in and just get ready.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.600
Dance with the devil?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.840
Yeah. Oh boy. Okay.

01:48.880 --> 01:49.760
Here we go.

01:49.760 --> 01:50.560
All right.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.120
Theme from the movie Love Story.

01:58.800 --> 01:59.280
Yeah.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.440
Mellow and...

02:49.760 --> 02:52.480
So criminals, he chilled with didn't think he was real.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.200
You see me and niggas like this have never been equal.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.840
I don't project my insecurities on other people.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.640
He feeding for props like addicts with pipes and needles.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.280
And so he felt he had to prove that everyone he was evil.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.920
A feeble minded young man with infinite potential.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.720
The product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.520
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.000
Dancing with the devil smoke till his eyes would bleed.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.720
But he was sick of selling trees and gave him to his greed.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.720
Yeah. Very easy to understand.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.120
That was a good line.

03:49.840 --> 03:53.200
Rob and niggas anything you could do to get his respect back

03:53.200 --> 03:54.480
in the eyes of his crew.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.120
Starting fights over little shit up on the block.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.920
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers to crack rock.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.560
Working overtime making money for the crack spot.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.120
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.000
Fulfilling the scar face fantasy stuck in his brain.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.560
Tired of the black niggas treating him the same.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.200
He wanted to be major like the cutthroats and the thugs.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.920
But when he tried to step to him niggas showed him no love.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.800
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.440
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.080
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.560
Even puffy smoke the motherfucker up in the club.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.440
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.240
Standing in front of them staring straight into their eyes.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.720
Billy realized that these men were well guarded.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.520
And they wanted to test him before business started.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.160
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cohorted.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.800
So now he had a choice between going back to his life.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.360
Or making money with made men up in the site.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.160
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.800
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.520
And so he met through Friday night at a quarter to three.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.040
I'm just going to pause it there.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.840
Well I can totally understand it.

05:04.400 --> 05:04.960
That's good.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.920
Yeah it's telling the story of this guy.

05:07.920 --> 05:16.160
Just trying to, guy who's trying to make it in the world.

05:16.160 --> 05:22.320
In terms of selling drugs and then trying to move up through the ranks I guess.

05:23.040 --> 05:31.280
But people are saying what have you got that a thousand other guys don't have right?

05:31.280 --> 05:32.320
Yeah exactly.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.680
And even if you do get that money he said you can't buy respect with money.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.160
So yeah he was dealing drugs.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.680
Then did he catch the end of that verse where they said you know if you really want to

05:44.400 --> 05:50.240
move up the ranks and be on our level be part of the you know part of the club I suppose.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.160
You have to rape somebody.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.760
God no I missed that.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.800
Do you want to rewind that a little bit?

05:57.680 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.760
Sounds like it's kind of important.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.260
Yes.

06:13.680 --> 06:40.400
Right right and before that they said

06:43.680 --> 06:50.640
they say or he says uh yeah um you know if you're hardcore you can actually stab someone

06:50.640 --> 06:54.160
and stab them repeatedly and stand over them until they die.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.360
Right yeah and also rape somebody.

06:57.360 --> 06:57.840
Yeah.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.480
Show that you're really uh tough that you're really you're worthy to be one of us.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.440
Wow yeah.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.880
Yeah so I think um initiation into the.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.320
Yeah exactly you know any they said basically anybody can shoot a gun.

07:11.120 --> 07:11.520
Right.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.720
Anybody can sell drugs.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.200
But you want to actually be a ruthless.

07:15.200 --> 07:15.920
Yeah.

07:15.920 --> 07:16.480
Person.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.280
Yeah.

07:17.280 --> 07:17.920
Like us.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.240
Yeah.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.320
You got to do these things so it's a tale of whether or not he wants to do it.

07:22.320 --> 07:29.840
Yeah you know and before this uh this um stanza or yeah this portion of the song uh started up

07:29.840 --> 07:36.320
there was a drop in the music did you notice that sort of a it went down a notch I don't know

07:36.320 --> 07:37.520
how to explain it.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.640
Where he wasn't rapping or no when he was yeah there was a change and there's no piano

07:42.640 --> 07:47.680
it was um yeah there's a some sort of strings yeah and it almost sounded like there was the

07:47.680 --> 07:53.280
music got kind of a little more um not ominous but there was a there was a drop in the music

07:53.280 --> 07:58.320
and I thought immediately okay there's a change here and something something's coming up.

07:58.320 --> 07:58.960
Right.

07:58.960 --> 07:59.440
Yeah.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.720
I think um I'm not sure exactly what the change was there.

08:02.720 --> 08:02.880
Yeah.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.160
But I think it was just leading up to this this sort of pivotal moment.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.680
Yeah it was it was.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.960
So that might have been that.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.760
Yeah neat.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.000
Do you want the lyrics or you think you're good.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.040
I don't think I need them.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.520
Okay.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.520
Yeah.

08:18.160 --> 08:42.000
I love that.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.600
That is the best line in the song.

08:44.400 --> 08:50.000
They drove around the project slow while it was raining smoking plunge drinking and joking

08:50.000 --> 08:54.480
for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walking alone three in the morning

08:54.480 --> 08:59.200
coming back from work on the way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her

08:59.200 --> 09:02.800
walking through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped their shirt around

09:02.800 --> 09:07.360
their head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw

09:07.360 --> 09:11.680
so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had

09:11.680 --> 09:16.160
nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof

09:16.160 --> 09:20.880
and then held her down on the ground screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around the

09:20.880 --> 09:25.040
shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch till he

09:25.040 --> 09:29.520
broke in a jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing they kicked her until

09:29.520 --> 09:34.320
they cracked the ribs and she stopped moving blood leaking through the cloth she cried silently

09:34.320 --> 09:38.880
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took

09:38.880 --> 09:43.760
a turn ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned a broken jaw mumbled for god but

09:43.760 --> 09:47.760
they weren't concerned when they were done and she was lying bloody broken and bruised one of

09:47.760 --> 09:52.560
them niggas pulled out a brand new 22 they told them that she was a witness for what she'd gone

09:52.560 --> 09:57.040
through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute

09:57.040 --> 10:00.800
she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

10:01.520 --> 10:06.160
I'm falling and I can't turn back

10:09.840 --> 10:14.720
I'm falling and I can't turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought

10:14.720 --> 10:19.360
about the cold pain with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standing along with his new

10:19.360 --> 10:23.760
brothers cocked the gap to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him

10:23.760 --> 10:28.400
start to cringe and stutter because he was staring into the eyes of his own mother she looked back

10:28.480 --> 10:33.200
at him and cried because he had forsaken her she cried more painfully and when they were raping her

10:33.200 --> 10:38.560
his whole world stopped he couldn't even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate

10:38.560 --> 10:43.440
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late working hard for nothing because now what was

10:43.440 --> 10:47.920
he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and crying out to the sky

10:47.920 --> 10:52.480
because he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded because god wasn't there and right

10:52.480 --> 10:57.440
then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul

10:57.440 --> 11:01.680
they say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it after that they killed his mother

11:01.680 --> 11:06.080
and never spoke about it and listen because the story that I'm telling is true because I was there

11:06.080 --> 11:10.800
with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go

11:10.800 --> 11:15.280
in fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows in every street cipher listening to

11:15.280 --> 11:19.600
little thugs flow you could be standing right next to you and you wouldn't know the devil grows

11:19.600 --> 11:24.320
inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked white brown yellow and black color is not restricted

11:24.320 --> 11:28.560
you have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted and you'll be one of god's children

11:28.560 --> 11:32.800
it fell from the top there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot so when the

11:32.800 --> 11:37.760
devil wants to dance with you you better say never because a dance with the devil might last you forever

11:37.760 --> 11:51.440
wow

11:56.560 --> 12:00.160
oh wow gosh what a story told it so well

12:00.480 --> 12:03.120
wow that was

12:05.520 --> 12:11.840
that was mind-blowing that was hard to listen to yeah that that's the reason why I've only you

12:11.840 --> 12:15.760
know when people said you gotta show your dad this I was like you know I listened to the song but

12:16.480 --> 12:21.600
after the first time I never really wanted to listen to it again it's so graphic it's so clear

12:21.680 --> 12:27.440
and but there's such a big message attached to this you know

12:29.200 --> 12:32.960
it's so it's so apparent the message is apparent I don't really have to go over it right but just

12:34.240 --> 12:43.520
yeah and it just but I imagine that there are a lot of people who who are trying to get out of

12:43.520 --> 12:51.920
their situation who may be tempted to follow uh who may be attempted to go against their better

12:51.920 --> 12:58.560
judgment of what they believe in and and they get caught up in things right that leads them to do

12:58.560 --> 13:10.320
crazy things yeah and uh yeah wow wow tough song yeah geez and uh I guess something important

13:10.320 --> 13:19.120
to to know like his mother right yeah so so is this true is this true yeah well well the thing is

13:19.120 --> 13:27.440
there's a lot of sort of it could be true but well he says it is a true story uh but a true story in

13:27.440 --> 13:34.720
the sense that maybe it didn't exactly happen the way it did but you know because it's so

13:35.680 --> 13:45.920
so like um graphic and you know you it's like watching a train crash as they say yeah it is

13:45.920 --> 13:50.640
you know that things just escalating and out of control yeah and it's going to be bad situation

13:50.640 --> 13:55.760
but you just it has your attention locked on it yeah so he said the reason some people said you

13:55.760 --> 14:02.240
know he didn't need to make it that graphic and things like that but he said it just captures

14:02.320 --> 14:08.400
your attention oh no I disagree yeah it captures your attention and and that's why it's become the

14:08.400 --> 14:15.040
song has become into sort of uh it has its own lore to it no it catches you oh really yeah where

14:15.040 --> 14:19.680
people say you know they hadn't heard a song like this before yeah and wherever they were in the world

14:20.160 --> 14:25.120
yeah um they were like you know stuff like this happens and yeah and I didn't realize that other

14:25.200 --> 14:32.480
people sort of it made them realize that it's a universal thing where people want to sacrifice

14:32.480 --> 14:38.480
possibly their morality yeah for riches and power and why not well he mentioned it he says I think

14:38.480 --> 14:45.840
he says black white he mentioned you know this could happen to anybody right yes yeah oh no I I

14:45.840 --> 14:55.040
think um no I think um it's great that he spelled it out this way because you know I could imagine

14:55.200 --> 15:01.440
somebody who you know listens to rap hearing this someone who's maybe on the wrong path on the wrong

15:01.440 --> 15:08.320
direction and hearing this and possibly having this really sink in because it's so vivid right and

15:08.320 --> 15:16.160
using the uh the mother or his mother as a sort of a symbol not because it's not actually his

15:16.160 --> 15:21.040
mother that he raped right that'd be impossible for him to just realize that before he was gonna

15:21.680 --> 15:29.920
blow her brains out yeah um it's just symbolic for his society and his own mother right because if

15:29.920 --> 15:37.600
you are uh you're taking away that person's that person's innocence and and no respect towards them

15:37.600 --> 15:42.320
that's also gonna be destructive towards your own community so that's the reason why he said

15:42.320 --> 15:47.040
it's not he says it's not a song about rape like a lot of people think it is it's a song about

15:47.760 --> 15:54.880
making people realize that women are what he says the most important people in society and

15:54.880 --> 16:04.960
especially latino and latina and black women are often uh you know disrespected yeah so

16:05.680 --> 16:10.160
it's to sort of make people realize right it goes beyond just the story of rape right yeah

16:10.160 --> 16:19.360
to uh encompass the whole uh his his belief point of view yeah wow wow wow

16:21.520 --> 16:29.040
yeah it was really good really good and that last line there the last two i suppose uh starting

16:29.040 --> 16:33.120
here yeah so when the devil wants to dance through the you better say never because a dance for the

16:33.120 --> 16:42.240
devil might last you forever i like a lot of the lyrics i had said i love that lyric where he talks

16:42.240 --> 16:48.400
about the angels used to be up here and how they've fallen and the devils are down here and now it's

16:48.400 --> 16:56.480
one melting pot that's the chorus that's that's the chorus the chorus is is is um it's not delineated

16:56.480 --> 17:02.160
strongly as a chorus is it yeah not not exactly there's a little bit of a pause before he starts

17:02.240 --> 17:09.360
rapping and that shows that it's a new section uh huh uh huh yeah that was great devils used to be

17:09.360 --> 17:18.080
gods angels that fell from the top um yeah there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting

17:18.080 --> 17:23.920
pot yeah i love that and i think possibly the most powerful um thing in the song you're not

17:23.920 --> 17:28.400
powerful it's hard to say what's the most powerful in this song yeah but one of the most powerful

17:28.400 --> 17:38.720
things is that he eventually kills himself oh i know and um and but he won't go to heaven

17:38.720 --> 17:44.160
he's going straight to hell and he knows it yet he does it because once you do something that bad

17:44.160 --> 17:52.800
you can't escape it what's done is done right mm-hmm oh yeah wow this is quite something quite

17:52.800 --> 17:59.040
something um so this is 2001 i noticed that the rhymes come in at the end of the line

17:59.040 --> 18:05.520
yeah he's not um the most technical rapper from what and he actually is slightly messy

18:06.320 --> 18:11.680
in terms of his technical ability all right uh but that allows it to be more of a stream of

18:11.680 --> 18:15.680
consciousness thing where he's just telling a story or talking to you and that's why it's

18:15.680 --> 18:22.000
easy to fall in i got that's the feeling i got yeah he's telling a story i found the music was good

18:22.000 --> 18:28.080
because it didn't take you away from the story at all yeah it's just there and a beautiful piano

18:30.640 --> 18:37.520
beautiful suddenly haunting at least when it's paired with this melancholy story yeah oh wow

18:40.800 --> 18:44.560
so that is dance with the devil i could see why everybody wanted me to hear that

18:45.520 --> 18:51.120
um uh and i didn't need any i didn't need Kleenex but uh

18:54.880 --> 19:03.680
it was uh quite something yeah people are saying you know don't show him this

19:03.680 --> 19:12.720
because he will be destroyed by it no i think i i think this is a really really well done song

19:12.720 --> 19:20.800
and i feel that this song was you know almost necessary to spell these things out what why

19:20.800 --> 19:26.480
