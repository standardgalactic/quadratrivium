1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Hi everybody, welcome back to the front room. I'm Kai and I'm here with my dad today.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
Hi guys, hope you're having a good day. Thanks for joining us again.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,400
Maybe, maybe you won't have a good day after listening to this song.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,360
Oh, I'm gonna show you at least. Okay. Great, good to hear that.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
This is a highly requested song and artist.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,080
I could take a stab at who it might be, but I won't.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,360
Okay, yeah. We're gonna be listening to a song called

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,320
Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
Thought it might be that one. I really did.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,960
Yeah, because people have asked for it for a long, long time.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,600
Yeah, a long time. Yeah, Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Yes, it's an underground classic, but it's so popular in the underground, you know,

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,400
people that maybe don't listen to rap that much or, you know, might have come across it.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:09,760
It's got released in 2001 and it's a pretty epic song, but I was gonna say, you know,

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
I've listened to some other Immortal Technique. I haven't been the biggest fan.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
This song sticks out for me as one of his better ones that I've heard.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,880
Okay. But definitely, I was gonna say I'm a fan of the song,

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,120
but I don't know if that's the right word to describe appreciating the song.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,680
So you'll see that. Usually, I give you the lyrics, but this time,

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm gonna hold off because he's pretty easy to understand.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,160
If you need the lyrics halfway through when I pause or something,

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,400
yeah, just let me know and then I can give them to you.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
I'll do that. But just focus in and just get ready.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Dance with the devil?

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
Yeah. Oh boy. Okay.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,760
Here we go.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
All right.

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Theme from the movie Love Story.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,280
Yeah.

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,440
Mellow and...

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
So criminals, he chilled with didn't think he was real.

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
You see me and niggas like this have never been equal.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
I don't project my insecurities on other people.

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
He feeding for props like addicts with pipes and needles.

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
And so he felt he had to prove that everyone he was evil.

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
A feeble minded young man with infinite potential.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
The product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental.

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,520
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed.

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Dancing with the devil smoke till his eyes would bleed.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
But he was sick of selling trees and gave him to his greed.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Yeah. Very easy to understand.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
That was a good line.

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
Rob and niggas anything you could do to get his respect back

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
in the eyes of his crew.

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
Starting fights over little shit up on the block.

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers to crack rock.

47
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
Working overtime making money for the crack spot.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine.

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Fulfilling the scar face fantasy stuck in his brain.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
Tired of the black niggas treating him the same.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
He wanted to be major like the cutthroats and the thugs.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,920
But when he tried to step to him niggas showed him no love.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,800
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,440
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood.

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Even puffy smoke the motherfucker up in the club.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,440
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die.

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
Standing in front of them staring straight into their eyes.

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
Billy realized that these men were well guarded.

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
And they wanted to test him before business started.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cohorted.

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
So now he had a choice between going back to his life.

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
Or making money with made men up in the site.

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree.

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,520
And so he met through Friday night at a quarter to three.

67
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm just going to pause it there.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,840
Well I can totally understand it.

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,960
That's good.

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,920
Yeah it's telling the story of this guy.

71
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Just trying to, guy who's trying to make it in the world.

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,320
In terms of selling drugs and then trying to move up through the ranks I guess.

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:31,280
But people are saying what have you got that a thousand other guys don't have right?

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,320
Yeah exactly.

75
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
And even if you do get that money he said you can't buy respect with money.

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
So yeah he was dealing drugs.

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Then did he catch the end of that verse where they said you know if you really want to

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,240
move up the ranks and be on our level be part of the you know part of the club I suppose.

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
You have to rape somebody.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
God no I missed that.

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Do you want to rewind that a little bit?

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
Sounds like it's kind of important.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,260
Yes.

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Right right and before that they said

86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,640
they say or he says uh yeah um you know if you're hardcore you can actually stab someone

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,160
and stab them repeatedly and stand over them until they die.

88
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
Right yeah and also rape somebody.

89
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,840
Yeah.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,480
Show that you're really uh tough that you're really you're worthy to be one of us.

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,440
Wow yeah.

92
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,880
Yeah so I think um initiation into the.

93
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah exactly you know any they said basically anybody can shoot a gun.

94
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Right.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Anybody can sell drugs.

96
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,200
But you want to actually be a ruthless.

97
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah.

98
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,480
Person.

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Yeah.

100
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,920
Like us.

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,320
You got to do these things so it's a tale of whether or not he wants to do it.

103
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah you know and before this uh this um stanza or yeah this portion of the song uh started up

104
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,320
there was a drop in the music did you notice that sort of a it went down a notch I don't know

105
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
how to explain it.

106
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Where he wasn't rapping or no when he was yeah there was a change and there's no piano

107
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,680
it was um yeah there's a some sort of strings yeah and it almost sounded like there was the

108
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,280
music got kind of a little more um not ominous but there was a there was a drop in the music

109
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,320
and I thought immediately okay there's a change here and something something's coming up.

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
Right.

111
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Yeah.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
I think um I'm not sure exactly what the change was there.

113
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Yeah.

114
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,160
But I think it was just leading up to this this sort of pivotal moment.

115
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Yeah it was it was.

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
So that might have been that.

117
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,760
Yeah neat.

118
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you want the lyrics or you think you're good.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
I don't think I need them.

120
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,520
Okay.

121
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Yeah.

122
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:42,000
I love that.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
That is the best line in the song.

124
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,000
They drove around the project slow while it was raining smoking plunge drinking and joking

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walking alone three in the morning

126
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,200
coming back from work on the way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her

127
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
walking through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped their shirt around

128
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,360
their head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,680
so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had

130
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,160
nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof

131
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
and then held her down on the ground screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around the

132
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch till he

133
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,520
broke in a jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing they kicked her until

134
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,320
they cracked the ribs and she stopped moving blood leaking through the cloth she cried silently

135
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,880
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
a turn ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned a broken jaw mumbled for god but

137
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,760
they weren't concerned when they were done and she was lying bloody broken and bruised one of

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,560
them niggas pulled out a brand new 22 they told them that she was a witness for what she'd gone

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,040
through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

141
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,160
I'm falling and I can't turn back

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm falling and I can't turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought

143
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,360
about the cold pain with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standing along with his new

144
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
brothers cocked the gap to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him

145
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,400
start to cringe and stutter because he was staring into the eyes of his own mother she looked back

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,200
at him and cried because he had forsaken her she cried more painfully and when they were raping her

147
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,560
his whole world stopped he couldn't even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate

148
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,440
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late working hard for nothing because now what was

149
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and crying out to the sky

150
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,480
because he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded because god wasn't there and right

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,440
then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul

152
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
they say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it after that they killed his mother

153
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,080
and never spoke about it and listen because the story that I'm telling is true because I was there

154
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,800
with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go

155
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,280
in fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows in every street cipher listening to

156
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,600
little thugs flow you could be standing right next to you and you wouldn't know the devil grows

157
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked white brown yellow and black color is not restricted

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
you have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted and you'll be one of god's children

159
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,800
it fell from the top there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot so when the

160
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,760
devil wants to dance with you you better say never because a dance with the devil might last you forever

161
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:51,440
wow

162
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
oh wow gosh what a story told it so well

163
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
wow that was

164
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,840
that was mind-blowing that was hard to listen to yeah that that's the reason why I've only you

165
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,760
know when people said you gotta show your dad this I was like you know I listened to the song but

166
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,600
after the first time I never really wanted to listen to it again it's so graphic it's so clear

167
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,440
and but there's such a big message attached to this you know

168
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,960
it's so it's so apparent the message is apparent I don't really have to go over it right but just

169
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:43,520
yeah and it just but I imagine that there are a lot of people who who are trying to get out of

170
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:51,920
their situation who may be tempted to follow uh who may be attempted to go against their better

171
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,560
judgment of what they believe in and and they get caught up in things right that leads them to do

172
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:10,320
crazy things yeah and uh yeah wow wow tough song yeah geez and uh I guess something important

173
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:19,120
to to know like his mother right yeah so so is this true is this true yeah well well the thing is

174
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:27,440
there's a lot of sort of it could be true but well he says it is a true story uh but a true story in

175
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,720
the sense that maybe it didn't exactly happen the way it did but you know because it's so

176
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:45,920
so like um graphic and you know you it's like watching a train crash as they say yeah it is

177
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,640
you know that things just escalating and out of control yeah and it's going to be bad situation

178
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,760
but you just it has your attention locked on it yeah so he said the reason some people said you

179
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,240
know he didn't need to make it that graphic and things like that but he said it just captures

180
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,400
your attention oh no I disagree yeah it captures your attention and and that's why it's become the

181
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:15,040
song has become into sort of uh it has its own lore to it no it catches you oh really yeah where

182
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,680
people say you know they hadn't heard a song like this before yeah and wherever they were in the world

183
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,120
yeah um they were like you know stuff like this happens and yeah and I didn't realize that other

184
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,480
people sort of it made them realize that it's a universal thing where people want to sacrifice

185
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,480
possibly their morality yeah for riches and power and why not well he mentioned it he says I think

186
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,840
he says black white he mentioned you know this could happen to anybody right yes yeah oh no I I

187
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:55,040
think um no I think um it's great that he spelled it out this way because you know I could imagine

188
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,440
somebody who you know listens to rap hearing this someone who's maybe on the wrong path on the wrong

189
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,320
direction and hearing this and possibly having this really sink in because it's so vivid right and

190
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,160
using the uh the mother or his mother as a sort of a symbol not because it's not actually his

191
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,040
mother that he raped right that'd be impossible for him to just realize that before he was gonna

192
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,920
blow her brains out yeah um it's just symbolic for his society and his own mother right because if

193
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,600
you are uh you're taking away that person's that person's innocence and and no respect towards them

194
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
that's also gonna be destructive towards your own community so that's the reason why he said

195
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
it's not he says it's not a song about rape like a lot of people think it is it's a song about

196
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,880
making people realize that women are what he says the most important people in society and

197
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:04,960
especially latino and latina and black women are often uh you know disrespected yeah so

198
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
it's to sort of make people realize right it goes beyond just the story of rape right yeah

199
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:19,360
to uh encompass the whole uh his his belief point of view yeah wow wow wow

200
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:29,040
yeah it was really good really good and that last line there the last two i suppose uh starting

201
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,120
here yeah so when the devil wants to dance through the you better say never because a dance for the

202
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:42,240
devil might last you forever i like a lot of the lyrics i had said i love that lyric where he talks

203
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,400
about the angels used to be up here and how they've fallen and the devils are down here and now it's

204
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,480
one melting pot that's the chorus that's that's the chorus the chorus is is is um it's not delineated

205
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,160
strongly as a chorus is it yeah not not exactly there's a little bit of a pause before he starts

206
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,360
rapping and that shows that it's a new section uh huh uh huh yeah that was great devils used to be

207
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,080
gods angels that fell from the top um yeah there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting

208
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,920
pot yeah i love that and i think possibly the most powerful um thing in the song you're not

209
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,400
powerful it's hard to say what's the most powerful in this song yeah but one of the most powerful

210
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:38,720
things is that he eventually kills himself oh i know and um and but he won't go to heaven

211
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,160
he's going straight to hell and he knows it yet he does it because once you do something that bad

212
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,800
you can't escape it what's done is done right mm-hmm oh yeah wow this is quite something quite

213
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,040
something um so this is 2001 i noticed that the rhymes come in at the end of the line

214
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,520
yeah he's not um the most technical rapper from what and he actually is slightly messy

215
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,680
in terms of his technical ability all right uh but that allows it to be more of a stream of

216
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,680
consciousness thing where he's just telling a story or talking to you and that's why it's

217
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,000
easy to fall in i got that's the feeling i got yeah he's telling a story i found the music was good

218
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,080
because it didn't take you away from the story at all yeah it's just there and a beautiful piano

219
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,520
beautiful suddenly haunting at least when it's paired with this melancholy story yeah oh wow

220
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,560
so that is dance with the devil i could see why everybody wanted me to hear that

221
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,120
um uh and i didn't need any i didn't need Kleenex but uh

222
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:03,680
it was uh quite something yeah people are saying you know don't show him this

223
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:12,720
because he will be destroyed by it no i think i i think this is a really really well done song

224
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,800
and i feel that this song was you know almost necessary to spell these things out what why

225
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,480
should we not say this type of stuff why should your music yeah why shouldn't we why should we not
