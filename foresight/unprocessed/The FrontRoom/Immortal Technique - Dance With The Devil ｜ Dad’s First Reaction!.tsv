0	3280	Hi everybody, welcome back to the front room. I'm Kai and I'm here with my dad today.
3280	6240	Hi guys, hope you're having a good day. Thanks for joining us again.
7360	12400	Maybe, maybe you won't have a good day after listening to this song.
12400	17360	Oh, I'm gonna show you at least. Okay. Great, good to hear that.
20160	23920	This is a highly requested song and artist.
25440	28080	I could take a stab at who it might be, but I won't.
28160	31360	Okay, yeah. We're gonna be listening to a song called
31360	34320	Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.
35360	37520	Thought it might be that one. I really did.
38560	40960	Yeah, because people have asked for it for a long, long time.
40960	45600	Yeah, a long time. Yeah, Dance with the Devil by Immortal Technique.
45600	53200	Yes, it's an underground classic, but it's so popular in the underground, you know,
53840	58400	people that maybe don't listen to rap that much or, you know, might have come across it.
59280	69760	It's got released in 2001 and it's a pretty epic song, but I was gonna say, you know,
69760	73040	I've listened to some other Immortal Technique. I haven't been the biggest fan.
73040	76720	This song sticks out for me as one of his better ones that I've heard.
76720	80880	Okay. But definitely, I was gonna say I'm a fan of the song,
80960	85120	but I don't know if that's the right word to describe appreciating the song.
86160	89680	So you'll see that. Usually, I give you the lyrics, but this time,
89680	92240	I'm gonna hold off because he's pretty easy to understand.
93120	96160	If you need the lyrics halfway through when I pause or something,
96160	98400	yeah, just let me know and then I can give them to you.
98400	102400	I'll do that. But just focus in and just get ready.
102400	103600	Dance with the devil?
103600	105840	Yeah. Oh boy. Okay.
108880	109760	Here we go.
109760	110560	All right.
115120	117120	Theme from the movie Love Story.
118800	119280	Yeah.
128640	129440	Mellow and...
169760	172480	So criminals, he chilled with didn't think he was real.
172480	175200	You see me and niggas like this have never been equal.
175200	177840	I don't project my insecurities on other people.
177840	180640	He feeding for props like addicts with pipes and needles.
180640	183280	And so he felt he had to prove that everyone he was evil.
183280	185920	A feeble minded young man with infinite potential.
185920	188720	The product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental.
188720	191520	Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed.
191520	194000	Dancing with the devil smoke till his eyes would bleed.
194000	196720	But he was sick of selling trees and gave him to his greed.
200720	202720	Yeah. Very easy to understand.
226240	227120	That was a good line.
229840	233200	Rob and niggas anything you could do to get his respect back
233200	234480	in the eyes of his crew.
234480	237120	Starting fights over little shit up on the block.
237120	239920	Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers to crack rock.
239920	242560	Working overtime making money for the crack spot.
242560	245120	Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine.
245120	248000	Fulfilling the scar face fantasy stuck in his brain.
248000	250560	Tired of the black niggas treating him the same.
250560	253200	He wanted to be major like the cutthroats and the thugs.
253200	255920	But when he tried to step to him niggas showed him no love.
255920	258800	They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs.
258800	261440	Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs.
261440	264080	Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood.
264080	266560	Even puffy smoke the motherfucker up in the club.
266560	269440	But only a real thug can stab someone till they die.
269440	272240	Standing in front of them staring straight into their eyes.
272240	274720	Billy realized that these men were well guarded.
274720	277520	And they wanted to test him before business started.
277520	280160	Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cohorted.
280160	282800	So now he had a choice between going back to his life.
282800	285360	Or making money with made men up in the site.
285360	288160	His dreams about cars and ice made him agree.
288160	290800	A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be.
290800	293520	And so he met through Friday night at a quarter to three.
300080	301040	I'm just going to pause it there.
301760	303840	Well I can totally understand it.
304400	304960	That's good.
305600	307920	Yeah it's telling the story of this guy.
307920	316160	Just trying to, guy who's trying to make it in the world.
316160	322320	In terms of selling drugs and then trying to move up through the ranks I guess.
323040	331280	But people are saying what have you got that a thousand other guys don't have right?
331280	332320	Yeah exactly.
332320	335680	And even if you do get that money he said you can't buy respect with money.
338240	340160	So yeah he was dealing drugs.
340160	343680	Then did he catch the end of that verse where they said you know if you really want to
344400	350240	move up the ranks and be on our level be part of the you know part of the club I suppose.
351120	352160	You have to rape somebody.
352800	353760	God no I missed that.
355680	356800	Do you want to rewind that a little bit?
357680	358000	Yeah.
358000	359760	Sounds like it's kind of important.
359760	360260	Yes.
373680	400400	Right right and before that they said
403680	410640	they say or he says uh yeah um you know if you're hardcore you can actually stab someone
410640	414160	and stab them repeatedly and stand over them until they die.
414160	417360	Right yeah and also rape somebody.
417360	417840	Yeah.
417840	422480	Show that you're really uh tough that you're really you're worthy to be one of us.
422480	423440	Wow yeah.
423440	426880	Yeah so I think um initiation into the.
426880	430320	Yeah exactly you know any they said basically anybody can shoot a gun.
431120	431520	Right.
431520	432720	Anybody can sell drugs.
432960	435200	But you want to actually be a ruthless.
435200	435920	Yeah.
435920	436480	Person.
436480	437280	Yeah.
437280	437920	Like us.
437920	438240	Yeah.
438240	442320	You got to do these things so it's a tale of whether or not he wants to do it.
442320	449840	Yeah you know and before this uh this um stanza or yeah this portion of the song uh started up
449840	456320	there was a drop in the music did you notice that sort of a it went down a notch I don't know
456320	457520	how to explain it.
457520	462640	Where he wasn't rapping or no when he was yeah there was a change and there's no piano
462640	467680	it was um yeah there's a some sort of strings yeah and it almost sounded like there was the
467680	473280	music got kind of a little more um not ominous but there was a there was a drop in the music
473280	478320	and I thought immediately okay there's a change here and something something's coming up.
478320	478960	Right.
478960	479440	Yeah.
479440	482720	I think um I'm not sure exactly what the change was there.
482720	482880	Yeah.
482880	486160	But I think it was just leading up to this this sort of pivotal moment.
486160	487680	Yeah it was it was.
487680	488960	So that might have been that.
488960	489760	Yeah neat.
489760	492000	Do you want the lyrics or you think you're good.
492000	493040	I don't think I need them.
493040	493520	Okay.
493520	497520	Yeah.
498160	522000	I love that.
522000	523600	That is the best line in the song.
524400	530000	They drove around the project slow while it was raining smoking plunge drinking and joking
530000	534480	for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walking alone three in the morning
534480	539200	coming back from work on the way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
539200	542800	walking through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped their shirt around
542800	547360	their head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
547360	551680	so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had
551680	556160	nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof
556160	560880	and then held her down on the ground screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around the
560880	565040	shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch till he
565040	569520	broke in a jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing they kicked her until
569520	574320	they cracked the ribs and she stopped moving blood leaking through the cloth she cried silently
574320	578880	and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took
578880	583760	a turn ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned a broken jaw mumbled for god but
583760	587760	they weren't concerned when they were done and she was lying bloody broken and bruised one of
587760	592560	them niggas pulled out a brand new 22 they told them that she was a witness for what she'd gone
592560	597040	through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute
597040	600800	she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
601520	606160	I'm falling and I can't turn back
609840	614720	I'm falling and I can't turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought
614720	619360	about the cold pain with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standing along with his new
619360	623760	brothers cocked the gap to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him
623760	628400	start to cringe and stutter because he was staring into the eyes of his own mother she looked back
628480	633200	at him and cried because he had forsaken her she cried more painfully and when they were raping her
633200	638560	his whole world stopped he couldn't even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate
638560	643440	and he remembered how his mom used to come home late working hard for nothing because now what was
643440	647920	he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and crying out to the sky
647920	652480	because he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded because god wasn't there and right
652480	657440	then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
657440	661680	they say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it after that they killed his mother
661680	666080	and never spoke about it and listen because the story that I'm telling is true because I was there
666080	670800	with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
670800	675280	in fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows in every street cipher listening to
675280	679600	little thugs flow you could be standing right next to you and you wouldn't know the devil grows
679600	684320	inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked white brown yellow and black color is not restricted
684320	688560	you have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted and you'll be one of god's children
688560	692800	it fell from the top there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot so when the
692800	697760	devil wants to dance with you you better say never because a dance with the devil might last you forever
697760	711440	wow
716560	720160	oh wow gosh what a story told it so well
720480	723120	wow that was
725520	731840	that was mind-blowing that was hard to listen to yeah that that's the reason why I've only you
731840	735760	know when people said you gotta show your dad this I was like you know I listened to the song but
736480	741600	after the first time I never really wanted to listen to it again it's so graphic it's so clear
741680	747440	and but there's such a big message attached to this you know
749200	752960	it's so it's so apparent the message is apparent I don't really have to go over it right but just
754240	763520	yeah and it just but I imagine that there are a lot of people who who are trying to get out of
763520	771920	their situation who may be tempted to follow uh who may be attempted to go against their better
771920	778560	judgment of what they believe in and and they get caught up in things right that leads them to do
778560	790320	crazy things yeah and uh yeah wow wow tough song yeah geez and uh I guess something important
790320	799120	to to know like his mother right yeah so so is this true is this true yeah well well the thing is
799120	807440	there's a lot of sort of it could be true but well he says it is a true story uh but a true story in
807440	814720	the sense that maybe it didn't exactly happen the way it did but you know because it's so
815680	825920	so like um graphic and you know you it's like watching a train crash as they say yeah it is
825920	830640	you know that things just escalating and out of control yeah and it's going to be bad situation
830640	835760	but you just it has your attention locked on it yeah so he said the reason some people said you
835760	842240	know he didn't need to make it that graphic and things like that but he said it just captures
842320	848400	your attention oh no I disagree yeah it captures your attention and and that's why it's become the
848400	855040	song has become into sort of uh it has its own lore to it no it catches you oh really yeah where
855040	859680	people say you know they hadn't heard a song like this before yeah and wherever they were in the world
860160	865120	yeah um they were like you know stuff like this happens and yeah and I didn't realize that other
865200	872480	people sort of it made them realize that it's a universal thing where people want to sacrifice
872480	878480	possibly their morality yeah for riches and power and why not well he mentioned it he says I think
878480	885840	he says black white he mentioned you know this could happen to anybody right yes yeah oh no I I
885840	895040	think um no I think um it's great that he spelled it out this way because you know I could imagine
895200	901440	somebody who you know listens to rap hearing this someone who's maybe on the wrong path on the wrong
901440	908320	direction and hearing this and possibly having this really sink in because it's so vivid right and
908320	916160	using the uh the mother or his mother as a sort of a symbol not because it's not actually his
916160	921040	mother that he raped right that'd be impossible for him to just realize that before he was gonna
921680	929920	blow her brains out yeah um it's just symbolic for his society and his own mother right because if
929920	937600	you are uh you're taking away that person's that person's innocence and and no respect towards them
937600	942320	that's also gonna be destructive towards your own community so that's the reason why he said
942320	947040	it's not he says it's not a song about rape like a lot of people think it is it's a song about
947760	954880	making people realize that women are what he says the most important people in society and
954880	964960	especially latino and latina and black women are often uh you know disrespected yeah so
965680	970160	it's to sort of make people realize right it goes beyond just the story of rape right yeah
970160	979360	to uh encompass the whole uh his his belief point of view yeah wow wow wow
981520	989040	yeah it was really good really good and that last line there the last two i suppose uh starting
989040	993120	here yeah so when the devil wants to dance through the you better say never because a dance for the
993120	1002240	devil might last you forever i like a lot of the lyrics i had said i love that lyric where he talks
1002240	1008400	about the angels used to be up here and how they've fallen and the devils are down here and now it's
1008400	1016480	one melting pot that's the chorus that's that's the chorus the chorus is is is um it's not delineated
1016480	1022160	strongly as a chorus is it yeah not not exactly there's a little bit of a pause before he starts
1022240	1029360	rapping and that shows that it's a new section uh huh uh huh yeah that was great devils used to be
1029360	1038080	gods angels that fell from the top um yeah there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting
1038080	1043920	pot yeah i love that and i think possibly the most powerful um thing in the song you're not
1043920	1048400	powerful it's hard to say what's the most powerful in this song yeah but one of the most powerful
1048400	1058720	things is that he eventually kills himself oh i know and um and but he won't go to heaven
1058720	1064160	he's going straight to hell and he knows it yet he does it because once you do something that bad
1064160	1072800	you can't escape it what's done is done right mm-hmm oh yeah wow this is quite something quite
1072800	1079040	something um so this is 2001 i noticed that the rhymes come in at the end of the line
1079040	1085520	yeah he's not um the most technical rapper from what and he actually is slightly messy
1086320	1091680	in terms of his technical ability all right uh but that allows it to be more of a stream of
1091680	1095680	consciousness thing where he's just telling a story or talking to you and that's why it's
1095680	1102000	easy to fall in i got that's the feeling i got yeah he's telling a story i found the music was good
1102000	1108080	because it didn't take you away from the story at all yeah it's just there and a beautiful piano
1110640	1117520	beautiful suddenly haunting at least when it's paired with this melancholy story yeah oh wow
1120800	1124560	so that is dance with the devil i could see why everybody wanted me to hear that
1125520	1131120	um uh and i didn't need any i didn't need Kleenex but uh
1134880	1143680	it was uh quite something yeah people are saying you know don't show him this
1143680	1152720	because he will be destroyed by it no i think i i think this is a really really well done song
1152720	1160800	and i feel that this song was you know almost necessary to spell these things out what why
1160800	1166480	should we not say this type of stuff why should your music yeah why shouldn't we why should we not
1166480	1174080	go there right yeah awesome thank you very much yeah you're you're welcome i suppose yeah in a way
