00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Max Principle is talked about as an extraneous principle. It is not part of any standard

00:06.880 --> 00:14.320
theories of physics today. There's a reason for that which I, when I first realized this,

00:15.040 --> 00:23.360
I was really amazed. Max Principle implies that there is one universal frame, one universe

00:23.600 --> 00:33.280
because Max Principle trace the effects of dynamics centrifugal force and things like that

00:34.240 --> 00:38.960
happens because of some interaction with the rest of the matter in the universe.

00:40.400 --> 00:48.560
Whatever that interaction is, since universe is one reference frame, accepting Max Principle

00:48.560 --> 00:56.480
immediately implies accepting an absolute frame like ether and so on. But once you accept an

00:56.480 --> 01:04.000
absolute frame, the direct consequence is that propagation of light is Galilean. The velocity,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.320
relative velocity of light will depend on the velocity of the observer. So Max Principle

01:10.320 --> 01:15.280
cannot be incorporated in current physics without breaking Einstein's theory, without

01:15.280 --> 01:22.400
flowing away Einstein's theory of relativity. Welcome back to Demystify Psi. Soon to be named

01:22.400 --> 01:27.280
something else, we are actually considering expanding our name to include more of the topics

01:27.280 --> 01:34.480
we explore on this show, which clearly reaches way beyond science and even mysticism. So we are

01:35.280 --> 01:42.960
playing with new ideas. So look forward to Demystify Psi having a new flavor to its name very soon.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.840
We're going to start rolling that out and trying out some ideas and discussing it with our patrons.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.800
Suggestions are welcome.

01:49.680 --> 01:56.000
Today on the show, we are exploring the underlying assumptions of relativity and some

01:56.000 --> 02:02.800
contradictory experimental evidence with respect to special relativity. So the invariance of the

02:02.800 --> 02:07.360
speed of light, this idea that the speed of light is the same for everybody regardless of their

02:07.360 --> 02:15.440
motion. And today we have CS Unikrishnan from the Defense Institute of Advanced Technology in

02:15.440 --> 02:23.040
India. He is a physics scholar who has worked on the LIGO projects, and he has come to some

02:23.040 --> 02:27.760
very startling realizations concerning the history of physics and the way that we have applied our

02:27.760 --> 02:33.840
foundational assumptions to the picture of how the universe works. And in particular,

02:34.800 --> 02:44.080
he's very concerned about this idea of descriptions, these empirically defined equations being

02:44.080 --> 02:49.360
mistaken for explanations because there's a number of abstract postulates that are roped into them

02:49.360 --> 02:55.840
from the beginning. And of course, descriptions can be very, very deceptive, right? You can watch a

02:55.840 --> 03:01.040
magic show with David Copperfield and be absolutely convinced that the Statue of Liberty disappeared.

03:01.040 --> 03:06.000
It might look like that from every conceivable angle in the audience, but there's something

03:06.000 --> 03:13.440
else happening. And it's the job of the scientist to come up with hypotheses for what that something

03:13.440 --> 03:19.520
could be. And so we're exploring this issue in depth over the course of his conception of how

03:19.520 --> 03:24.240
this can be rescued by bringing in Mach's principle and really understanding that there's a lot of

03:24.240 --> 03:30.000
stuff in the universe that we can't see. It's really far away, but it does exert gravitational

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
effects en masse. And those things should be applied to all of our fundamental understandings

03:36.000 --> 03:41.680
and interpretations of these bizarre relativistic experiments. Absolutely. And if you like what

03:41.680 --> 03:47.200
we do, come over to patreon.com slash demystifyci. You can help us brainstorm a new name. You can

03:47.200 --> 03:54.160
help us by supporting the podcast with just a couple dollars a month. And in return for that,

03:54.160 --> 03:58.320
we give you both of the episodes early, so you get them on Saturdays instead of having to wait

03:58.320 --> 04:02.960
until everybody else gets them. But you also get to join our Patreon chat, which is a Zoom call

04:02.960 --> 04:09.280
that we have every week where we get together and we talk about the larger, bigger questions that

04:09.280 --> 04:15.440
people are curious about. And it's pretty cool. We have maybe a consistent group of like 15 people

04:15.440 --> 04:19.760
that come and there's probably another five or six that just hang out in the chat. And so it

04:19.760 --> 04:26.560
gives us a chance to actually connect with one another. So this is less of a isolating and

04:26.640 --> 04:32.480
atomized project. One way street. Yeah, it's less of a one way street. So if you have a couple

04:32.480 --> 04:36.560
dollars to spare, come over to patreon.com. We would absolutely love to see you and get your

04:36.560 --> 04:41.680
support. And in the meantime, enjoy our conversation with Professor Anikrishnan. We'll see you next

04:42.160 --> 04:44.800
The Scientific Revolution starts now.

04:57.600 --> 05:04.240
All right, so to kick this off into the science, I was hoping that I could read a little portion

05:04.240 --> 05:11.280
of one of the papers you sent us. And maybe we can springboard off that into what we were

05:11.280 --> 05:19.280
talking about today, which is fundamentally a conversation about revisiting old experiments,

05:19.280 --> 05:26.240
revisiting tried and true theories and considering their interpretation. There's a

05:26.240 --> 05:31.520
philosophical dimension of this, which is really interesting to us, because as we've been over,

05:31.520 --> 05:37.840
over and over and over on this show, empiricism really just shows you how a pattern unfolds.

05:37.840 --> 05:42.320
It doesn't necessarily give you an explanation of the cause of that pattern. And physics has

05:42.320 --> 05:47.120
been extraordinarily successful with detailing these patterns and equations and coming up with these,

05:48.000 --> 05:53.120
they call them theories, but they're really just these statements of how predictable events unfold

05:53.120 --> 05:58.640
at different places in the universe at different scales. And one of the most successful theories,

05:59.360 --> 06:06.880
kind of the bedrock of modern physics is Einstein's relativity. And what we're going to be talking about

06:06.880 --> 06:14.000
today is the strange implications of relativity and how they might be just misunderstanding. So

06:14.000 --> 06:17.600
I'm going to read a little paper, little piece of this paper, I'm going to just skip through a

06:17.600 --> 06:21.520
couple of excerpts, people should go read it themselves. It's called a new gravitational

06:21.520 --> 06:26.800
paradigm for relativity and dynamics and its philosophical scope. And this is from Journal

06:26.800 --> 06:33.840
of Physics conference series. And so the piece that I wanted to share to kick this off, it goes like

06:33.840 --> 06:40.160
this. Einstein's theories are interpreted not only as the theories of relativity and gravity,

06:40.160 --> 06:46.720
but also as the theories of space and time themselves. And then skipping forward. While these

06:46.720 --> 06:51.840
are factually, let's say, let's say spatial intervals between material particles and the

06:51.840 --> 06:57.520
duration marked by material clocks, the essential and crucial role of the material markers is dropped

06:57.600 --> 07:03.680
at the level of abstraction without logical rigor. And then it goes on, the unobservable

07:03.680 --> 07:09.520
space time is elevated to a full fledged dynamical entity in the general theory of relativity.

07:10.160 --> 07:15.920
So that there's a creation of this abstraction being turned into a physical substance. And then

07:15.920 --> 07:23.840
to close out the little excerpt, you say, in real physical terms, all observable experiences of

07:23.840 --> 07:30.720
gravity are limited to matter affecting spatial separation between material particles and the

07:30.720 --> 07:37.680
rate of material clocks. So there's this divergence from material representations of reality and

07:38.240 --> 07:43.600
theoretical abstractions. There's some confusion, some conflation of abstractions with material

07:43.600 --> 07:51.920
reality that's at the core of this discussion. And so before we get into all of the disagreements

07:52.800 --> 08:00.400
with the interpretation, maybe you can just comment on why it matters. Who cares if people

08:00.400 --> 08:06.720
have made these mistakes, treating these abstractions as physical substances and so forth?

08:06.720 --> 08:13.200
Why does it matter? Because the math works. Okay. Yeah, the math works, that is true.

08:14.080 --> 08:23.360
The point is, it is not only we observe various phenomena. So

08:25.680 --> 08:33.440
one doesn't have to really explain the phenomena to observe the phenomena and even describe it

08:34.160 --> 08:41.680
in ordinary language or even convert those phenomena into technologies. You don't have to

08:41.680 --> 08:50.960
really understand it theoretically, completely. Yet it is in our, it's our urge that we want to

08:50.960 --> 09:01.040
understand it more deeply, closely. And we form theories in the sense we try to connect up

09:01.600 --> 09:08.880
various phenomena and describe them on the basis of a few fundamental concepts.

09:09.120 --> 09:17.840
So space and time are two fundamental concepts, which we start with for describing dynamics,

09:17.840 --> 09:23.680
something, some object moving. Of course, it's always the matter object which is moving,

09:24.960 --> 09:30.000
because we can, that is all what we can experience. But to describe that motion,

09:30.160 --> 09:39.360
we need some reference that a particle moved from one position to other position.

09:40.320 --> 09:48.240
And how do you talk about this position? Positions in space. Space is our experience,

09:48.240 --> 09:57.120
in the sense we leave in space. And time is something which we experience as evolution of

09:57.120 --> 10:05.680
ourselves, evolution of our environment and so on, which we call time. So when we say time passes,

10:06.320 --> 10:16.880
what we mean is something evolves. Something changed. Something changed. So space and time

10:16.960 --> 10:28.000
has two essential concepts that was always needed to describe motion. Now when I talk about motion,

10:28.000 --> 10:36.080
movements, it is just not physical movement of some particle in space. It's also used as a

10:36.160 --> 10:45.280
general time for evolution change. Now, so space and time. Now, if you imagine

10:47.840 --> 10:54.160
Before you go on, can I ask you a quick question? How do you conceptualize motion without, sorry,

10:54.160 --> 10:57.520
evolution or change without some particle being relocated?

10:57.520 --> 11:06.640
You cannot. In fact, that is a point. Suppose you imagine a situation where there is no

11:06.640 --> 11:15.920
matter at all, nothing, nothing material. Now, you may be able to imagine space without matter.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.840
At least some people will be in a coordinate sense or something like that.

11:22.560 --> 11:28.480
Something when you say imagine empty space, people may be able to imagine empty space,

11:29.360 --> 11:35.600
but you will not be able to imagine time without any matter. There should be at least one particle

11:36.240 --> 11:45.600
which is evolving, which is moving. Only there has to be some particle for some matter

11:46.560 --> 11:51.760
in which we can experience, which is changing. Either it is changing its position,

11:52.400 --> 11:57.600
or it is changing some property like its temperature or something. Something should change.

11:58.480 --> 12:02.160
Would it be fair to say that you need two particles because you have to compare that

12:02.160 --> 12:08.960
motion to some standard of reference? Exactly. So therefore, one of the motions,

12:09.600 --> 12:17.520
when you said, when you refer to time, every time, every instance, when you refer to time,

12:17.520 --> 12:24.160
what you are doing is to compare one kind of motion with another kind of motion. One of them you

12:24.160 --> 12:29.600
use as a standard, something which is simpler. Maybe it is a periodic motion of something

12:29.600 --> 12:35.200
which you take as a standard. Otherwise, you are always comparing a change with another change.

12:36.160 --> 12:42.880
When you say, I have a clock, I have time. So the sense of time, if you really think about

12:42.880 --> 12:51.120
it, without matter, it has no meaning at all. So now, even this context, when you say space and

12:51.120 --> 13:01.200
time are physical entities without referring to matter at all, there is really a conceptual

13:01.200 --> 13:07.200
problem. There is a philosophical problem. It is not rigorous enough. It is not sufficient.

13:08.320 --> 13:14.240
So if you go really deep there, already you are stuck with these primitive concepts.

13:15.120 --> 13:21.920
They are metaphysical concepts, actually. They are not physical. Not quite physical, I would say.

13:21.920 --> 13:28.240
Can I pause you there for a second? When did people begin to be concerned with this? Was

13:28.240 --> 13:34.560
this something that people realized as soon as relativity was born? Was this something that was

13:34.560 --> 13:41.920
on the tips of people's tongues, or has this kind of really been underground this whole time?

13:42.880 --> 13:49.440
This meaning, the reification. Yes, the lack of physical reference points.

13:49.440 --> 13:57.040
This is already Newton's pregipia. Because Newton bonded to axiomatize,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.240
everything which he was talking about. So he wanted to talk about space, time. Though he

14:04.240 --> 14:10.720
started by saying that he did not want to define, because these are sort of obvious concepts,

14:11.760 --> 14:21.440
he still tried to talk about them, define them. And then he had to, because he had to describe

14:22.400 --> 14:29.040
movement of objects, dynamics in space and time. And then he had to say something about

14:29.760 --> 14:39.680
what is time and what is space. So he started by defining space in the beginning of pregipia itself.

14:40.240 --> 14:49.360
He makes these definitions. However, he immediately got stuck, because he had to define,

14:49.360 --> 14:58.160
once he defined what he called absolute time and absolute space, without reference to anything

14:58.160 --> 15:06.480
at all. That's what he meant by absolute. Without taking support of matter and various other concepts,

15:07.200 --> 15:17.040
purely primitive, pristine concepts, he defined space and time, but he couldn't point to what is

15:17.040 --> 15:21.920
space, what is what is time. So he defined them quantitatively or something. Is that what you

15:21.920 --> 15:31.520
mean by definition? Yeah, he just defined it sort of lyrically. You can always give a definition

15:31.520 --> 15:38.240
in terms of words. But how do you point to some object? How do you recognize what is space,

15:38.240 --> 15:50.000
what is time? He said you cannot, because instead of the absolute space and absolute time,

15:50.720 --> 15:59.440
in their place, we use, in practical terms, we use what is called relative space and relative time.

16:00.320 --> 16:06.880
And relative space is when you make markers in space and define a motion with respect to those

16:06.880 --> 16:14.880
markers. And markers are material references. Similarly, time, relative time, some change

16:14.880 --> 16:24.480
is happening. You take that as some reference and describe another change. So he was Newton,

16:24.480 --> 16:34.960
who realized the necessity of distinguishing between space and time as metaphysical primitives.

16:34.960 --> 16:43.920
And also, provide ways of identifying what could be used as relative space and relative time. So

16:43.920 --> 16:52.640
everything is eroded systematically in Pringipiya. Because he also had to talk about certain

16:53.680 --> 17:03.520
phenomena which we see, like centrifugal force. This you discussed in an earlier podcast with

17:04.160 --> 17:13.360
Assis, for example. So, he wanted to give, since he defined absolute space and absolute time,

17:13.360 --> 17:21.520
he also tried to give a proof for the existence of what we call, what he called as the absolute space.

17:22.160 --> 17:29.760
And he said, absolute space can be, the existence of reality of absolute space can be

17:29.760 --> 17:42.720
seen in phenomena like centrifugal force. And when a mass of liquid in a bucket, if it is

17:42.720 --> 17:52.080
rotating, the fact that its surface becomes curved, this kind of a thing happens only because

17:53.040 --> 17:58.640
the body of water is rotating with respect to absolute space according to him.

17:59.440 --> 18:05.360
Of course, this was criticized much later by Anas Mark, 200 years later.

18:06.720 --> 18:16.240
And where he said, what Newton claimed has no basis. Because when you say a body of water rotates,

18:16.960 --> 18:22.960
it could be just rotating with respect to all the matter in the universe and not with respect to

18:22.960 --> 18:29.360
absolute space. So, it could be an interaction which causes this curvature of the surface of water,

18:30.080 --> 18:36.400
real interaction with the rest of the matter and not something, some abstract,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.040
unobservable entity like absolute space and so on.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.880
Which is a small difference, right? It's a very tiny difference, but it's a really important

18:46.880 --> 18:52.720
difference. I feel like Newton was observing this phenomenon, trying to make sense of it,

18:52.720 --> 18:58.320
but he stopped thinking about interactions with matter. And that's where things maybe first go

18:58.320 --> 19:03.680
off the rails a little bit. But can you address the question I put earlier that were people upset

19:03.680 --> 19:09.360
about this when this happened? Were there philosophers that were coming out and saying,

19:09.360 --> 19:15.680
no, this can't be? I mean, it's very platonic, the idea of absolute space and absolute time.

19:15.680 --> 19:21.040
Yes, it's an old concept. It's a very old concept, absolute space without matter,

19:21.760 --> 19:35.920
something which can hold. There is a book by Max Jammar on space and a preface is written by Einstein

19:36.880 --> 19:44.240
where, again, these questions are discussed, what is space and what is time. But of course,

19:44.240 --> 19:52.800
these are much later. But Newton, after Newton, I think there is some discussion by Bishop Berkeley

19:53.520 --> 20:04.000
on this issue. But otherwise, serious discussion and a serious proposal,

20:04.080 --> 20:09.840
alternative to what Newton was saying, that happened only with a smock.

20:12.880 --> 20:17.120
So people were upset, but they didn't have an alternative. They weren't totally sure how to

20:17.120 --> 20:21.360
interactively link it. I'm not even sure that people were upset at the time of Newton.

20:21.360 --> 20:26.080
No, that's right. Yeah, there was nothing to be upset about it. I mean, it was acceptable.

20:26.960 --> 20:32.080
Like it worked. It worked. And he had, he had mathematically created, I've always seen Newton

20:32.160 --> 20:37.680
as the guy who is able to put mathematics in motion. And people are so tickled by that,

20:38.560 --> 20:42.240
that they're like, whatever assumptions this guy had to make to do this,

20:43.520 --> 20:46.800
fine. Because this works and now we can predict things in design.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.760
Also, I don't think people felt very strange to think of space as something,

20:51.760 --> 20:57.520
some entity which was there as some absolute abstracting, even without matter.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.560
Because there's a long philosophical tradition of the void.

21:01.840 --> 21:07.760
Yes. And the void as this concept seems very similar to absolute space. And it seems like a

21:07.760 --> 21:13.840
logical, not a huge leap to say, well, okay, if there is void that is unchanging,

21:13.840 --> 21:19.520
then there also must be some ticking pendulum somewhere that will never change that everything

21:19.520 --> 21:26.640
happens on the backdrop of. For example, you look at serious physicists today.

21:27.280 --> 21:33.760
Today, most of the physicists, practicing physicists are willing to accept the concept of

21:33.760 --> 21:41.920
space without matter, time without matter. So I don't think, I think people get upset the other way.

21:42.480 --> 21:48.160
If you say these things happen because of some interaction, people gets what interaction?

21:48.960 --> 21:53.760
We have an article hanging on our wall by Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker that was in

21:53.760 --> 21:57.920
some science magazine the other day where they argue that time is an object.

21:59.520 --> 22:04.880
Right. And so I think that you're right, that the greatest problem has always arisen when

22:04.880 --> 22:08.080
somebody shows up and is like, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Can we like get

22:08.080 --> 22:13.440
back to the material at hand here? Was Bergson really the first critic? You talk about Henry

22:13.440 --> 22:20.160
Bergson a lot in your work. And was that the first outspoken critic of this misplaced concreteness?

22:21.040 --> 22:28.720
No, Bergson comes into picture from another angle. We'll come to that. But I want to make

22:28.720 --> 22:37.360
one more point on this, why people were not upset with absolute space. See, when you look up into

22:37.440 --> 22:46.880
the sky, you see matter, stars, Milky Way. But if you look at the amount of matter you see

22:47.680 --> 22:56.000
in terms of stars and one galaxy, that is really not enough to fill the whole space you can imagine.

22:56.720 --> 23:07.840
In that sense, one always thought of largely empty space filled with a few stars and so on.

23:08.960 --> 23:16.240
We didn't know the extent of this universe, how much matter it consisted of. All that came in

23:16.240 --> 23:25.680
this last century. Before that, we had a solar system and a little bit of stars everywhere,

23:25.680 --> 23:31.440
but compared to empty space, this is a very miniscule amount of matter.

23:32.240 --> 23:37.760
I believe they thought our galaxy was the extent of the universe all the way up into the 20th,

23:38.960 --> 23:47.520
almost the mid 20th century. That's why even when Enes Mark talked about some interaction,

23:47.680 --> 23:55.920
interaction which could be responsible for things like phenomena like centrifugal acceleration,

23:56.720 --> 24:03.840
he could not suggest it could be the gravity of this matter. Because once you say it is gravity,

24:04.560 --> 24:12.720
then you can always calculate using Newton's theory how much gravity. If you calculate gravity

24:13.440 --> 24:20.480
with only Milky Way or 102 Milky Way like galaxies, you get a very, very small amount of

24:21.360 --> 24:31.200
gravity which is not enough to explain anything which you see. All this realization could not

24:31.200 --> 24:37.840
have happened even if you had the idea before we knew about this universe. I think now we

24:38.720 --> 24:45.360
can at least observe by statistical sampling something like trillions of galaxies.

24:45.360 --> 24:53.520
Yes. Now we have a rough idea of our vast universe, how much matter is there,

24:54.800 --> 25:03.360
and it has real serious consequences to our current theories.

25:03.760 --> 25:10.720
You make this point in the paper that you shared with us, which is that the theories

25:10.720 --> 25:18.320
that are foundational for physics were completed before we ever had this information.

25:19.360 --> 25:24.400
The information wasn't even theorized. It wasn't that the theories were put together with the idea

25:24.400 --> 25:31.040
that there was this vast universe that was filled with so much material. They were constructed in

25:31.120 --> 25:36.480
the sense of, okay, well, we have very little material. And we stuck with those theories.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.880
And they haven't been revised. And I think that that's the core of your argument, which is that,

25:40.880 --> 25:47.120
okay, so we have these theories that were constructed with a limited base of knowledge.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.600
And we have accepted them because they're mathematically very beautiful and I'm sure

25:51.600 --> 25:57.520
that there's cultural effects in there as well. But now we have come out the other side and we

25:57.520 --> 26:02.000
have so much more information and we have to go back and we have to reevaluate Einstein's theories

26:02.640 --> 26:07.520
to see if the core postulates hold knowing everything that we know and everything that

26:07.520 --> 26:15.120
we've accumulated in the times really since Newton. Yes. So right here, one can make a point

26:15.120 --> 26:22.880
that you can come back to again and again. When you say, let's look at the concept of absolute

26:22.880 --> 26:31.920
space of Newtons. Now, when you say absolute space, it only is talking about one space,

26:31.920 --> 26:36.080
one entity. There is only one absolute space you will talk about.

26:38.400 --> 26:45.600
When you say absolute time, you are talking about one universal time. Conceptually, that's

26:45.600 --> 26:53.920
what you mean by that. There is one reference time with the relative to which all other times

26:53.920 --> 27:02.320
are measured. There is one space, one holding space in which everything is arranged in various

27:02.320 --> 27:10.560
locations and so on. Now, when you talk about a universe, there's only one universe. When we say

27:10.560 --> 27:19.040
universe, it is one frame which we are talking about. Then everything else, every other motion,

27:19.040 --> 27:27.440
every other position, every thing which is happening, evolving in time, all this will have

27:27.440 --> 27:34.480
to be referred to this, what the dynamics of one universe. Then that universe provides

27:34.480 --> 27:42.240
reference for dynamics. Now, there is a very intimate connection between

27:42.240 --> 27:48.080
this kind of a concept of one absolute reference and things like the propagation of light.

27:49.440 --> 27:56.400
If you remember, before Einstein's theory came up, we had a theory of relativity,

27:56.400 --> 28:06.080
which was developed by Lawrence and Poincare. This theory had as its background what they

28:06.080 --> 28:14.160
called absolute either. Absolute either was a hypothetical medium which was postulated

28:14.880 --> 28:20.400
so that the waves of light could propagate in that medium. It is like

28:21.280 --> 28:33.440
air for propagation of sound. So, people believed that there should be some medium for the propagation

28:33.440 --> 28:41.280
of transverse waves because that's our experience. All transverse waves which we know, all kinds

28:41.280 --> 28:49.760
of waves we know of, they all propagate in some medium. So, a medium was postulated even before

28:49.760 --> 28:56.160
the theories of relativity came. There is one medium, it's an all-pervading medium which people

28:56.160 --> 29:07.200
had in mind. And in that medium, like sound propagates in air, it has some particular velocity

29:08.240 --> 29:15.200
decided by the properties of that medium. Now, if you are an observer who is moving

29:15.200 --> 29:21.280
relative to that medium, you will measure a different velocity for the same light.

29:22.400 --> 29:27.440
Light is propagating in the medium at one velocity. You move in that medium,

29:28.240 --> 29:35.440
then relative to that observer, light will move faster or slower depending on the direction of

29:35.440 --> 29:43.920
the movement. So, that is a common sense view. So, the old relativity of Lawrence and Poincare

29:44.880 --> 29:51.840
had the velocity of light depending on the motion of the observer. It was not an invariant

29:51.840 --> 30:04.080
velocity. All this was changed by Einstein's postulate of an invariant velocity of light.

30:04.800 --> 30:14.560
He postulated that the relative velocity of light is a constant, no matter whether the observer

30:14.560 --> 30:23.920
is moving towards an array of light or moving away from an array of light, if you measure velocity,

30:23.920 --> 30:33.680
it's an invariant constant. So, he had a different theory of relativity, which was

30:33.680 --> 30:39.440
different from the theory of Lawrence and Poincare. However, the mathematics

30:40.720 --> 30:47.120
which is used to describe that theory of relativity was exactly the same, Lawrence transformations.

30:48.400 --> 30:54.400
So, it's very interesting that at some stage in the development of physics,

30:55.600 --> 31:02.000
let's say 1900, we had two theories of relativity. Both were acceptable theories of

31:02.000 --> 31:10.720
relativity because both agreed with every experimental observations we had in those

31:10.720 --> 31:18.080
days from Michelson Mollie experiment or later things. Both theories agreed empirically with

31:19.680 --> 31:30.320
phenomena which we could see in the laboratory. However, the basic postulates which go into the

31:30.400 --> 31:37.680
two theories were entirely different. In one theory, light travelled with a variable velocity.

31:38.720 --> 31:47.440
However, there were new phenomena like length contraction, time dilation, so on. Those new

31:47.440 --> 31:55.600
phenomena coupled with the propagation of light somehow explained what you can see in the laboratory.

31:56.000 --> 32:04.560
In Einstein's theory, very similar phenomena were proposed because he was the same mathematics.

32:05.520 --> 32:13.040
However, the way Einstein set up the observability of this phenomena,

32:13.920 --> 32:21.920
he arranged a set even with an invariant velocity of light, he could explain the same phenomenon.

32:22.880 --> 32:29.680
Now, sociologically, this is where some amount of sociology comes. Sociologically,

32:31.360 --> 32:42.640
Einstein's theory was gained prominence very soon. Most of the physicists including Lawrence

32:44.000 --> 32:49.600
sort of agreed with what Einstein said. Lawrence said what we were trying to explain

32:50.320 --> 32:59.840
and Einstein just postulated and went ahead. So, at some stage, Einstein's theory gained

32:59.840 --> 33:08.640
prominence and it got accepted. Though there is not even a single experiment, even today,

33:09.760 --> 33:16.400
even today, there is not even a single experiment which can prove that the relative velocity of

33:16.400 --> 33:24.240
light is invariant constant. Experiments are consistent with that postulate, but there is no

33:24.240 --> 33:33.840
experiment which can prove this postulate directly. Why is that? There are subtle reasons for that.

33:36.240 --> 33:43.600
One would imagine that if you measure the velocity of a propagating entity,

33:43.600 --> 33:49.760
you can settle the question whether the relative velocity is a constant or variable.

33:50.640 --> 33:57.520
It sounds simple enough. For example, if you want to measure the relative velocity of sound,

33:58.320 --> 34:09.840
all you need is two microphones set apart by a meter or so on a frame. Then you have a source

34:09.920 --> 34:18.400
of sound somewhere. You make the sound and measure the duration to pass between two microphones.

34:18.400 --> 34:24.560
So, you have a duration, you have distance fixed by the two microphones. Then you

34:25.680 --> 34:32.320
take a ratio, you get a velocity. Then you can move the whole thing and you can measure the same

34:33.280 --> 34:41.600
velocity relative to moving reference frame. Therefore, it is very easy to decide whether the

34:42.560 --> 34:48.800
relative velocity of sound is variable or a constant. When you do this experiment, you will

34:48.800 --> 34:56.960
see that the relative velocity of sound does depend on the velocity of the reference frame.

34:57.760 --> 35:05.280
This is just the Doppler effect. Doppler effect is related, but Doppler effect is

35:05.280 --> 35:16.080
on the pitch, on the frequency of sound. Velocity is just a ratio between the

35:16.080 --> 35:20.880
distance traveled and the duration taken for traveling the distance.

35:21.840 --> 35:27.840
The Doppler shift happens when you have a stationary detector and then the sound sources

35:27.840 --> 35:33.040
are moving relative to it. But the experiment that you're describing, the microphones and the sound

35:33.040 --> 35:39.040
source are all moving together as one unit. That's an interesting question because

35:41.440 --> 35:46.640
there is one aspect which is not very clearly explained even in textbooks.

35:47.280 --> 35:53.600
Whether you take sound or light or even waves on water surface,

35:55.680 --> 36:02.560
the velocity of these waves does not depend on the velocity of the source.

36:05.040 --> 36:14.080
That is, it's entirely defined by the medium. It depends only on the properties of the medium.

36:14.080 --> 36:20.960
And is this true for light as far as sound? I think just to make sure that we set this

36:20.960 --> 36:24.880
absolutely clear, the Doppler thing is just that you're encountering more peaks on the wave

36:24.880 --> 36:32.000
which is different than the actual motion of the waves. Whereas the real question in the

36:32.000 --> 36:39.760
relativity is whether the relative velocity, whether it depends on the motion of the observer,

36:40.480 --> 36:48.480
the reference frame, not the source. Okay, now what's interesting is in the case of...

36:48.480 --> 36:52.960
Which would be entirely unique in the universe, right? That would be entirely unique as far as

36:52.960 --> 36:58.080
waves propagation is concerned. I didn't understand that question.

36:58.080 --> 37:03.280
Well, that would be a very exceptional physical phenomenon if that was true because it doesn't

37:03.280 --> 37:07.440
seem to play out that way in any other wave systems that we're aware of.

37:07.440 --> 37:14.480
Right. That is, if there is a medium, it's obvious that the relative velocity will depend also on

37:14.480 --> 37:21.600
the motion of the observer. It is very clear that if there is only one frame, if there is an absolute

37:21.600 --> 37:32.080
frame, one could identify whether it is either or something similar, then the relative velocity

37:32.080 --> 37:37.040
will depend on the velocity of the observer. So, postulating that...

37:37.040 --> 37:42.560
Hold on one second. I'm really sorry, but weren't we just saying that in the case of sound that

37:42.560 --> 37:45.200
it only depends on the medium itself but not the observer?

37:46.560 --> 37:53.520
No. It doesn't depend on the velocity motion of the source, but it does depend on the velocity

37:53.520 --> 38:00.320
of the observer. So, if we move these two microphones towards the source or away from the source,

38:02.240 --> 38:09.200
the duration taken to travel from one microphone to the other will depend on the velocity of the

38:09.200 --> 38:15.920
microphone, which is obvious because the sound reaches the first microphone at some time, some

38:15.920 --> 38:22.640
instant, then by the time sound reaches the next one, that microphone has moved away.

38:23.120 --> 38:28.720
I see, I see. Therefore, obviously, it has to take more time, more duration.

38:29.520 --> 38:34.480
Therefore, relative to the microphones, you have to say the velocity is less.

38:35.840 --> 38:42.800
Relative to somebody watching this experiment, what happened was the microphone was moving away,

38:43.680 --> 38:50.000
so it took more duration. But if you are sitting in the frame of the microphone, if you are moving

38:50.000 --> 38:59.200
with the microphone, then it is as if the relative velocity has reduced to reach from one microphone

38:59.200 --> 39:06.480
to other. So, when you say relative velocity, it's always a comparison between two observers,

39:06.480 --> 39:12.000
one observer who is watching outside the frame and another observer who is sitting with the frame.

39:13.200 --> 39:19.600
Got it. Like, we are sitting on the earth, but the earth is moving at a very, very large velocity

39:19.600 --> 39:24.960
which we don't realize about. It's not only the velocity in its orbit around the sun,

39:25.680 --> 39:30.720
but it's moving through the universe at about 350, 370 kilometers per second.

39:32.400 --> 39:38.000
We don't realize that. So, the question is, if a light ray is coming from outer space

39:39.680 --> 39:47.520
into our rooms, it touches one window at a particular instant, by the time it reaches

39:47.520 --> 39:56.400
the next window, the room itself has moved away a long distance. Now, the question is,

39:56.400 --> 40:03.360
even with that kind of a phenomenon, how can it happen that the relative velocity of light

40:04.160 --> 40:13.920
be a constant? How can you postulate such a very strange conclusion?

40:14.320 --> 40:27.200
That is why it is really a strange postulate. In fact, I have something, see, Charles Nordman,

40:27.200 --> 40:32.480
he was a radio astronomer, he was a friend of Einstein, he was an admirer of Einstein.

40:33.920 --> 40:42.000
He wrote something, some report on Einstein's visit to Paris in 1922, a very well written

40:42.480 --> 40:49.200
short report on the visit, and that time he mentioned this strange postulate of the

40:49.920 --> 40:56.880
constancy of the relative velocity of light, and he wrote it this way. There is hardly...

41:00.400 --> 41:07.520
He said, however, there is still something infinitely troubling in the Einsteinian system.

41:08.480 --> 41:15.520
This system is admirably coherent, but it rests on a particular conception of the propagation of

41:15.520 --> 41:23.600
light. How are we to imagine that the propagation of a ray of light could be identical for an observer

41:23.600 --> 41:32.000
who flies away from it, and for an observer who rushes to meet it? If this is possible,

41:32.720 --> 41:39.920
it is in any case inconceivable to our customary mentality, and no matter how hard we try,

41:40.480 --> 41:47.520
we cannot make the mechanism and the nature of that propagation indeligible. It must be

41:47.520 --> 41:55.760
confessed that here lies a mystery which eludes us. The whole ancient synthesis, as coherent as it is,

41:56.560 --> 42:06.160
rests on a mystery, exactly like revealed religions. That's what he said, and that is true.

42:06.160 --> 42:15.600
It's a very strange concept, but once you postulate that invariance of the relative velocity,

42:16.880 --> 42:20.800
all results of relativity theory follows from that.

42:21.680 --> 42:31.840
Lawrence transformation, everything follows from just that single postulate. That is what Einstein did.

42:34.080 --> 42:39.600
And people accepted it, even though it was a strange concept. People accepted it because

42:40.480 --> 42:47.760
it gave the full theory. When Lawrence and Poincare created the theory of relativity,

42:47.760 --> 42:58.720
it was a step-by-step progression where people had to work out each detail, because it was based on

42:58.720 --> 43:06.240
this another strange concept called either, which we cannot see, we cannot feel, we cannot get any

43:06.240 --> 43:14.880
evidence for it. But it was also postulated, and people thought any day Einstein's postulate is

43:15.520 --> 43:23.600
less evil than accepting something like an ether.

43:25.520 --> 43:32.000
Why do you think that is? I understand an unobservable, hypothetical unobservable,

43:32.000 --> 43:38.880
this postulate of the ether is difficult to stomach, but some exceptionalism to physics,

43:38.960 --> 43:47.520
as we understand it, seems even worse to me. There is one reason, and I think it's an important

43:47.520 --> 44:01.200
and genuine reason. If you look at the theory of Lawrence and Poincare, it is based on

44:01.280 --> 44:10.160
electrodynamics. Either was a medium, which was meant to support electrodynamics phenomena,

44:10.160 --> 44:17.200
called phenomena in electrodynamics. And Lawrence was trying to derive every result of

44:17.200 --> 44:26.080
relativity as a electromagnetic phenomena, because matter, it was already known by that time that

44:26.080 --> 44:34.320
matter consists of atoms and probably electrons, and there are electrical forces holding matter

44:34.320 --> 44:42.240
together. Therefore, he was trying to derive everything in relativity using electrodynamical

44:42.240 --> 44:51.680
phenomena. In Einstein's theory, this cage of electrodynamics is broken. It's a more general

44:51.760 --> 44:58.000
theory. Having postulated the invariance of the relative velocity of light,

44:59.280 --> 45:06.800
then a theory follows from this postulate. That theory is supposed to be applicable to

45:06.800 --> 45:12.640
all phenomena in physics. So, it's the temptation of the universalization,

45:12.640 --> 45:16.400
this holy grail of physics that I can talk about everything all at once.

45:17.360 --> 45:23.520
Yes, so therefore, you would agree that all of us would agree if we are supposed to pick one of

45:23.520 --> 45:29.680
these theories, we would say we will prefer the more universal theory which is applicable to

45:29.680 --> 45:37.520
mechanics, electrodynamics, optics, everything else. That is what happened. However, we should

45:37.600 --> 45:48.480
realize that the postulate was not experimentally verified. It was unverifiable because of certain

45:48.480 --> 46:01.280
reasons. Now, one reason I can immediately tell you, when you think of the concept of velocity,

46:02.240 --> 46:12.080
it is a statement of the duration taken for moving from a point to another point.

46:12.720 --> 46:19.200
So, there is a starting point, there is a final point. Now, you need two clocks,

46:20.000 --> 46:25.680
one clock at the starting point and one clock at the finishing point to measure a duration.

46:26.640 --> 46:33.760
So, you can fix a distance by pre-measuring that distance, you can say this is one meter.

46:34.720 --> 46:41.840
But duration is measured with only two clocks, not with one clock. So, if you are an observer

46:41.840 --> 46:52.080
who is at position A, first point, that observer has no access to the clock at B, position B.

46:53.040 --> 47:00.160
At position B, there is another observer. So, there is a problem of synchronization of

47:00.160 --> 47:06.640
two clocks. How are you to make sure that these clocks read exactly the same type?

47:08.240 --> 47:15.200
For measuring the velocity of sound, it does not matter because velocity of sound is a small

47:15.200 --> 47:22.000
quantity. You can always, you can synchronize clocks with a accuracy much. There are,

47:23.040 --> 47:29.440
the point is, there are things which move faster than sound. So, those things can be used to

47:29.440 --> 47:34.800
synchronize these two clocks. But there is nothing which moves faster than light.

47:36.640 --> 47:41.840
Okay. So, to synchronize two clocks for measuring the velocity of light

47:42.800 --> 47:48.400
is not only a technical problem, it's a conceptual problem. How can we synchronize

47:48.400 --> 47:57.120
these two clocks? If you use light for synchronizing two clocks, then it becomes a circular argument.

47:58.000 --> 48:04.720
You are trying to measure the velocity of light and you are using the same light to synchronize

48:04.720 --> 48:08.160
two clocks. So, that is a circular argument. You cannot do that.

48:08.560 --> 48:14.640
If you synchronize two clocks at the same position and move one of those clocks to the

48:14.640 --> 48:20.800
second position, you need a theory of moving clocks. You have to make sure that nothing

48:20.800 --> 48:27.680
happens to this clock while moving. But theory of relativity is also about what happens to moving

48:27.680 --> 48:36.400
clocks. So, you see, conceptually, there is a difficulty of synchronizing two clocks.

48:36.560 --> 48:46.160
If you want to measure the relative velocity of light. Therefore, all traditional experiments

48:47.520 --> 48:53.360
in relativity are what are called two-way experiments. You send light, get it back

48:54.240 --> 49:01.680
by reflecting Michelson-Morley experiment and so on. Now, when you are in a moving frame,

49:01.680 --> 49:06.080
let's say you are in a moving vehicle, a moving train or moving earth.

49:09.040 --> 49:16.480
And light propagates in one way. You don't know what its relative velocity is. But when

49:16.480 --> 49:23.840
light propagates the opposite way, whatever effects which happens because the velocity

49:23.840 --> 49:31.280
varies with the motion of the observer, that effect gets cancelled out. Because one way is

49:31.280 --> 49:38.000
along the motion of the frame, other way it is opposite the motion of the frame. So,

49:38.960 --> 49:47.360
this cancellation happens to a large extent. Because of which you cannot determine whether

49:47.360 --> 49:53.680
propagation of light is with a variable velocity or with a constant velocity

49:53.680 --> 49:58.800
with any of these two-way experiments. It would be the same thing if we did our

49:58.800 --> 50:03.840
microphone experiment and we reflected that sound source in the moving reference frame.

50:05.520 --> 50:10.480
There is a, yeah, it's almost same. But there is a subtle difference. There is a subtle difference.

50:11.200 --> 50:17.760
So, when I say in the two-way propagation, it cancels out. It does not cancel out

50:17.760 --> 50:22.640
endarily. There is a small second-order reference, something which depends on the

50:22.640 --> 50:29.680
score of the velocity. That is in one-way propagation. If you could measure, for example,

50:29.680 --> 50:36.320
when you do this experiment with sound, you will see that with microphones, as you move the microphone,

50:37.120 --> 50:43.040
the velocity, relative velocity changes and that change is proportional to the velocity of the

50:43.680 --> 50:52.720
observer. In a two-way experiment, that proportionality, that's not any more

50:54.960 --> 51:02.480
surveyed. It cancels out. But there is a residual effect which depends on the score

51:02.480 --> 51:07.520
of the velocity, next order, which is a much smaller quantity. What I mean is,

51:10.000 --> 51:15.840
when I say first order, it's a ratio between the velocity of the observer and the velocity of the

51:17.680 --> 51:26.000
light or sound. For example, velocity of sound is 300 meter per second, let's say, 300 meter.

51:26.640 --> 51:34.960
And the microphones are moving at one meter per second. So, one by 300 is the velocity of the

51:34.960 --> 51:42.480
observer divided by the velocity of sound, one by 300. That's a kind of signal you can get in an

51:42.480 --> 51:48.400
experiment when you do this experiment in a laboratory, the relative strength of the

51:48.720 --> 51:58.880
signal. So, if the microphones are moving by one meter per second, you get one by 300.

51:59.520 --> 52:05.520
If it moves by two meters per second, you get two by 300 and so on. Proportionately.

52:06.480 --> 52:11.120
However, in a two-way experiment, if you reflect sound like a Michelson-Mowley experiment,

52:12.080 --> 52:20.240
you get V square by C square, second order. So, one by 300 square, which is much less,

52:21.280 --> 52:31.920
which is one by 10 to the power of 5, much smaller. But there is a signal. You can measure that.

52:31.920 --> 52:37.440
In fact, that is what Michelson and Mowley were trying to measure, the second order signal,

52:37.440 --> 52:43.840
something which depends on the square of the V by C ratio, which is a very, very small signal,

52:43.840 --> 52:49.520
because Michelson and Mowley were not trying to measure the relative velocity of sound.

52:49.520 --> 52:54.560
They were trying to measure the motion of the air relative to the absolute either.

52:55.520 --> 53:02.320
They were trying to detect the motion of the air relative to absolute either. So, for that

53:02.320 --> 53:10.000
detection, they realized if light goes and comes back, you still have a small signal

53:10.960 --> 53:17.440
in which there is a signature of the velocity of the air through the either. Though it is a small

53:17.440 --> 53:21.760
signal, you can measure it. That's what Michelson attempted.

53:24.080 --> 53:28.800
Can I ask you just from a conceptual standpoint to help me understand why there's a residual

53:28.800 --> 53:35.680
in a two-way experiment versus a one-way? What is the cause of that? Having trouble understanding

53:35.680 --> 53:40.400
why that even happens? Not necessarily the math bit, but why is that?

53:40.400 --> 53:47.680
That's the reason. Yeah, I can just sort of try to say it and you can try to imagine whatever.

53:47.680 --> 53:56.720
Yeah, let's see what we can do. So, the time taken. So, I have a pulse of light which goes from point

53:56.720 --> 54:03.760
A to point B. Now, the separation between point A and point B, let's say call it L,

54:04.960 --> 54:11.600
distance of 1 meter or L meters. Okay, or let's fix it at 1 meter, 1 meter.

54:13.200 --> 54:23.360
Now, the time taken, duration to pass this 1 meter is even by 1 meter divided by the velocity.

54:23.600 --> 54:32.000
Length divided by velocity is a duration. Now, suppose the relative velocity

54:32.720 --> 54:40.240
depends on the velocity of the observer. So, if you are chasing, if the observer is moving in

54:40.240 --> 54:48.560
the same direction as a light propagation, the relative velocity will be less c minus v.

54:49.520 --> 54:55.760
So, in one direction, c minus v is a relative velocity.

54:58.400 --> 55:05.600
In the opposite direction, it is c plus v. So, duration taken in one direction is 1 meter divided by

55:06.240 --> 55:12.720
c minus v. Duration taken in the other way, it is 1 divided by c plus v.

55:12.960 --> 55:22.160
Okay. Now, total duration is 1 divided by c minus v plus 1 divided by c plus v.

55:23.920 --> 55:28.880
So, this because of c plus v and c minus v happens in the denominator and not in the

55:28.880 --> 55:35.600
numerator, they don't cancel out completely. What you get is

55:35.840 --> 55:47.360
1 minus v square by c square after that factor will come. In fact, this factor is very important

55:47.360 --> 55:54.640
in the relativity. 1 minus v square by c square. I guess for me, I think that conceptually it means

55:54.640 --> 56:00.400
that since this whole package is moving, it never really fully catches up to itself. There's some

56:00.400 --> 56:04.640
loss to this motion when you're moving with it. It seems like there's just a loss.

56:09.760 --> 56:14.720
Yeah, I'm not sure how I can better conceptualize it. I mean, I think that ultimately the mathematics

56:14.720 --> 56:20.240
helps conceptualize it because you have this relationship where when you're moving, the

56:20.240 --> 56:28.320
speed has to take into account your motion in the same direction. And so, that's c minus v.

56:29.280 --> 56:33.600
And then when it's bouncing back in the other direction, it also has to take into account

56:33.600 --> 56:40.240
your motion, which is c plus v. And when you mathematically try to combine those two fractions,

56:40.240 --> 56:47.440
you end up with this square second order. So, the point is, it is a fraction. That is, if it was,

56:47.440 --> 56:55.040
if the c plus v and c minus v, if they're in the numerator, when you add up, the v will cancel out

56:55.040 --> 57:03.760
completely. But here we are talking about durations, duration for the propagation. So, it is length

57:03.760 --> 57:10.240
divided by the velocity. So, c plus v and c minus v are in the denominator, not at the numerator.

57:11.040 --> 57:18.080
Therefore, when you add these two things together, there's a small residual. It depends on v square

57:18.080 --> 57:27.600
by c square. And that is, in fact, that was the logic what Michelson used to design his experiment.

57:28.160 --> 57:34.880
He said, it is difficult to measure the one-way propagation, but the two-way propagation is

57:34.880 --> 57:39.760
easy to measure because I can bring back the light to the location where I am.

57:41.120 --> 57:47.120
And though the signal is very small, I have this very nice technique of

57:47.200 --> 57:55.120
interferometry. He invented fine interferometry. I will use interference of light to measure this.

57:55.120 --> 58:00.640
And he set up the experiment. That's how, but what happened in the experiment?

58:01.280 --> 58:08.000
He did not see any signal, though he had the sensitivity to see the v square by c square signal.

58:08.560 --> 58:18.320
See, if you look at the numbers here, the velocity v is the velocity of the earth

58:18.880 --> 58:24.880
through either. And they assume that that velocity is the same as the velocity of the earth in the

58:24.880 --> 58:34.800
orbit around the sun. This is 30 kilometers per second. The velocity of light is 300,000

58:34.800 --> 58:44.240
kilometers per second. So, ratio v by c is one part in 10 to the 4, one part in 10,000.

58:44.880 --> 58:54.160
Square of that is 10 part in billion. So, it was a small signal, but still it's a signal which

58:55.440 --> 59:00.160
has a signature of that velocity. If the velocity is changing,

59:00.720 --> 59:09.280
that one will be able to measure it using Michelson's interferometric techniques.

59:09.920 --> 59:14.240
Can I ask you a question about interferometers before we move on, which is,

59:15.680 --> 59:20.320
aren't we looking at some sort of phase shift of the wave in interferometers?

59:20.320 --> 59:26.480
And we're back calculating the velocity change as a result. Is that a more like a Doppler type

59:26.480 --> 59:34.320
situation though? It is not Doppler because the source, the interferometer, the observer,

59:34.320 --> 59:41.680
everybody is sitting on the same frame in the laboratory. Doppler effects will happen only

59:41.680 --> 59:46.400
when there is a relative motion between the source and the detector. Got it, got it. So,

59:46.400 --> 59:50.640
it's like in our case where the microphones are moving together essentially. Yeah, everything is

59:50.640 --> 01:00:01.200
moving together. But so, when Michelson did, so in the interference, it is measuring the

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:11.920
duration. So, since light is supposed to be a wave, if the duration taken for one way propagation

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.960
and then the reverse propagation, the total duration is what Michelson was trying to measure here.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:26.560
If the total duration depends on the velocity of the earth through the ether, if that velocity

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:36.080
changes, increases or decreases, then the number of oscillations of light

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:47.120
in a particular distance also will change. Because when you say a phase of a wave

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.320
phase, how many oscillations of a wave, it depends, it is just a frequency of that wave,

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:02.240
which is a fixed quantity multiplied by duration. So, duration, interference technique can be used

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:08.800
to measure durations very accurately. That was a basic idea. And here we are trying to measure

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.600
a duration. Duration for light to go to a distance and come back to the same position. What is a

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:24.640
duration? Does this duration depend on the velocity of the earth when it goes around the sun?

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:33.760
And they found that they were not able to measure the variations in this duration,

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.440
even though the interferometer could be rotated in space. So, the relative velocity is changing.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.320
They know that they could change the relative velocity conceptually. However, the signal

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.720
did not show any of this. So, they could not detect the presence of ether. They could not

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.640
detect the motion of the earth through the ether. And by ether, we are thinking of this static

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.680
backdrop type ether, right? That is not really connected necessarily. It does not move around

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:12.000
with things. It is just there. Nothing. In fact, it has the property that it is not movable

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:24.720
stationary. They called it stationary either. That word was stationary was the word which is used

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:33.680
to describe it. So, the concept was there is a absolute, all-pervading medium, which is

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:40.560
absolutely still and earth and everything else is moving through that. But they could not detect it

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:49.520
and they had to explain why they could not detect it. And Lawrence invented this phenomenon called

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:57.920
length contraction. He said, okay, light is propagating with a variable velocity, duration is

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.360
actually changing, but I cannot see it because interferometer itself,

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.000
when it moves through the ether, its length reduces a little bit.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.200
And that reduction in length also is, involves this ratio 1 minus V square by C square.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:28.880
So, the two can cancel out. Okay, it is more subtle than this. It is actually square root

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:36.880
of 1 minus V square by C square for length contraction. There is a similar effect on time

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:45.760
dilation. Again, another one square root. So, this two square root of 1 minus V square by C square

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:53.520
multiplied together gives 1 minus V square by C square. So, Lawrence could explain everything.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.160
So, he said light is propagating in the same way with a variable velocity, but there are new

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:14.000
phenomena, length contraction and time dilation. So, all the three together conspire to keep this

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:23.280
medium called ether invisible. That was Lawrence's theory. Einstein said, okay, this is all

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:31.920
superfluous, extraneous things. We don't need all this either. All we need is single postulate.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.880
Postulate that the relative velocity of light does not depend on the velocity of the observer.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:46.480
So, if they had designed the Michelson-Morley experiment,

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:57.440
not to measure relative to the ether, but to move the detector as the experiment

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.280
is run, would they have got?

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.720
You mean the source or something?

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.000
Well, the source and the detect... So, assuming that the... So, you have, let's say, an interferometer

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.240
path, which you have point A and point B. And the light is emitted at point A, but then the

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.640
detector begins to move from point A towards point B, and it's reflected at point B and comes

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.920
back to the detector. Would they have gotten a different result? Would they have been able to

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:37.040
see this change? No. Earlier, I said, all this does not depend on the velocity of the source.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.320
Velocity of the source is irrelevant. But if the source and the detector are the same?

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.160
If the source and the... Well, because imagine that there's a single postulate,

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:54.160
like a single photon gets put into the system. So, let's say even the source and the detector

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.080
aren't the same thing, but they start at the same place.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:03.840
Yeah. The result will be exactly the same. What Michelson and Morley got, this result

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:14.160
is sort of a universal result. That will not change by changing the kind of source or any

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:23.760
of the configurational changes. It will not... The point is the explanation that light is

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.960
propagating with a variable velocity, but there are these new phenomena, physical phenomena,

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.080
light and contraction and time relation that works in all circumstances.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.360
You cannot say that this explanation is incorrect for any experiment. The only thing is you cannot

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:54.080
distinguish this explanation from Einstein's explanation that... No, that is not the reason.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.000
The relative velocity of light is an invariant. So, these are two different explanations.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.120
You cannot distinguish with an... Two-way experiment, you cannot determine which explanation is right.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.640
So, you need a one-way experiment. But one-way experiment,

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.000
there are conceptual problems because you don't know how to synchronize these two clocks.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:29.200
So, one had to invent a method. One had to invent a method where the synchronization

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:38.000
problem had to be solved, somehow solve it. You have... The clocks had to be separated in space

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.640
because light has to travel some distance.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:52.480
But somehow, you have to synchronize clocks at A and clock at B. And what I could do,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.000
you know, there are some people who attempted this in the history of physics.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:09.120
But all those attempts were using what is called a circular rotating experiment.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.280
This is the Sannyak experiment.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:23.520
Yes. So, when George Sannak did this experiment in 1930, it is specifically to show that,

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:29.600
in fact, they either exist or some absolute frame exists.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:38.480
So, he had point A. Light starts propagating from point A, but it comes back to point A.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.640
So, point A and point B are identified.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:51.680
So, light has to travel from a distance to get from point A to point B.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:58.960
But it is a looped path. That was his logic. In that experiment, he argued...

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:07.600
So, by the time light goes and comes back here, the point B moves a little bit.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:14.720
Just like in a linear system, when light starts from point A to reach point B,

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.040
by the time it reaches point B, the point B has moved a little bit.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.200
Therefore, the relative velocity or the duration is different.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.160
Here, rotating apparatus, when the light goes in this loop path,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:39.120
the point B has moved. But now, there is no burden of synchronizing point A and point B,

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.880
because they are together. It is as if one is using the same clock at A and B.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:59.360
But then, the result was, in some sense, shocking, because it showed that indeed,

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:08.080
the relative velocity of light depends on the velocity of the observing frame,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:20.640
reference frame. However, by 1913, Einstein's theory had been already accepted by most of the

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:30.240
physics community. Though, there were some objections. Still, some people were not very

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:37.520
convinced. But there were very powerful, prominent physicists of that type, Max Planck,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:45.440
Lawrence, and people like that. They had accepted Einstein's theory as the most plausible theory

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:56.560
of relativity. Nobody questioned, when Sannak's experiment results came, people tried to evade

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.040
it instead of discussing it. That's what happened in history. In fact,

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:11.120
I was going to say, what was the readout of Sannyak's experiment? Was it a phase shift of the light?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.800
Yes, it's exactly the same. In fact, whatever Michelson was trying to measure,

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.120
he said, every time you do a interferometry experiment,

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.440
a measurement with an interferometer, a duration, a change in duration is measured as a phase shift

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.960
and the phase shift is measured as a shift of the fringes, which you see, but this pattern of,

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:43.280
periodic pattern of fringes, bright and dark patterns. So, it shifts a little bit and that

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.080
is interpreted as a change in the duration of propagation and that is how it is measured.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.480
And Sannak's experiment also, that is what is measured. But Sannak experiment, if you look at,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.560
it's a one-way experiment that propagates in the same direction throughout

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.000
because the synchronization problem is not there anymore.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.320
Therefore, the signal is proportional to V, V by C, not V square by C square.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:19.120
So, it's a much easier experiment to do because signal is very large compared to

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.160
Michelson-Mowley experiment. So, what happened in the history was,

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:32.640
Sannak's experiment was not, it didn't get them attention, which it deserved.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:40.880
But there is something very strange here in the history. The same idea, whatever Sannak had as

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:54.160
an idea. Michelson had the same idea in about 1904 and he wrote a paper even before Einstein's theory

01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:03.200
came up, that was in 1905, Einstein's theory. Michelson wrote a paper in 1904 saying the

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:11.600
following. Okay, in the earlier experiment, where the two-way propagation of light was studied,

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:20.000
the presence of the hypothetical ether was not found in the experiment. However,

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:28.400
if a different kind of experiment is done, in which light travels only in one direction

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:35.760
and comes back to the starting point, in that kind of an interferometer, I can measure,

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:43.600
I propose to measure the presence of ether. So, he wanted to do an experiment in the same,

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:53.360
almost the same design as the Sannak experiment. But Michelson's interest was in detecting the

01:13:53.360 --> 01:14:02.240
motion of the earth relative to ether. So, what he said was, he could not detect the linear motion

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:08.240
of the earth through the ether, but he can measure the rotational motion, the spinning motion of the

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:18.000
earth in the ether using a different design of an interferometer. But the kind of interferometer

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.960
he had in mind had to be very large to measure the rotation of the earth.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.040
See, when Sannak did his experiment, he did it in a rotating frame in the laboratory.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.640
It was a tabletop experiment where the frame was rotated manually on a table.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.160
Michelson's interest was in detecting the rotation of the earth itself relative to ether.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:53.040
And since the earth rotation is at a very small rate, it takes 24 hours for one full rotation.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:03.040
The interferometer had to be very large in size to detect it. But he did this experiment in 1925.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.800
It is called Michelson's Gale experiment. He did it with a person called Gale.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.800
It was published in Astrophysical Journal in two papers.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.080
One paper was about the experiment. It was a kilometer size interferometer,

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.240
much like today's gravitational wave detectors and so on.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.880
And another paper was about the theory of this experiment in which he stated

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.520
that he detected the rotational motion of the earth relative to ether.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:55.200
In 1925, he wrote that paper. So even in 1925, Michelson was a believer in stationary ether.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:04.640
He was a believer. He had repeatedly said that also. He sort of leaned towards

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:12.640
the concept of ether. So he was convinced that there is an absolute frame.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:23.280
However, as I said, Einstein's theory was so prominent by that time, especially after 1919,

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.840
after the eclipse, solar eclipse, the general theory of relativity, all that came together.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:37.600
The Einstein's theory was unshakable. The faith in Einstein's theory was unshakable,

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.480
which continues to this day.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.600
But however, it's a fact that all these experiments are there in history.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.040
These are results which are there, which will not go away. And people said,

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.840
so the objection to Sannak experiment was that, okay, it's a rotating frame,

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:10.320
rotating reference frame, which is not equal to a linearly moving reference frame.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:16.800
There is a, in physics, there is a distinction made between what is called inertial motion

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:26.000
and non-inertial motion. Inertial motion is when you move linearly on a straight line

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:33.440
at a constant velocity, inertial motion. Inertial motion, you cannot distinguish,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:41.920
you cannot recognize, you cannot distinguish inertial motion from a state of rest.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.960
For example, we would say we are in inertial motion with the Earth now. We don't know

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:57.120
Earth is moving at hundreds of kilometers per second because we are almost in inertial motion.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.080
So, inertial motion cannot be distinguished from a state of rest. It is called principle of

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.720
relativity. What is called principle of relativity is just this statement that you cannot distinguish

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:17.440
inertial motion at any velocity from just a state of rest. It was stated by Galileo.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.600
And that's a fundamental principle of physics. So, people try to distinguish between inertial

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:32.960
motion and this non-inertial set of motion where there is rotation, acceleration, etc.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:41.920
And there's a misconception even among physicists that Einstein's theory of relativity,

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.560
special relativity is not applicable to situations of non-inertial motion.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:57.760
Anyway, that kind of an objection was raised about Sannak experiment.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:05.920
Therefore, it was that Sannak's works went into oblivion. People ignored it.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:15.600
However, this is the point I make in my papers and so on. I solved this problem.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:24.960
What I wanted was, I had to solve a dual problem. One is the synchronization of clocks,

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:31.280
which people like Michelson and Sannak had already solved by looping around.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:39.520
Now, I also had to solve this problem of inertial motion versus non-inertial motion.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.520
I needed an experiment where the reference frame is moving inertially

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:54.880
and the clocks are synchronized automatically. So, I found a configuration, which is not a

01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:01.920
rotating configuration. It's a stadium kind of a loop path. It's a different kind of configuration

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:09.520
where the reference frame, the clocks, the detector, the emitter, everything is moving

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:17.520
linearly, but the light goes around in a loop path and comes back. And I could do

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:25.040
this kind of an experiment in the laboratory and the results show that the relative velocity is

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:32.880
exactly like the relative velocity of sound. It depends on the motion of the observer.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.760
It's a variable quantity.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:49.280
All right. So, I think that we should unpack the material solutions to this problem or perhaps

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:56.240
start to consider Ernst Mach's ideas. Do you want to take a very short break just to stretch

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.840
really quick before we tackle that issue? Let's do that. I think it's always good to think about

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.880
this for a minute and then come back to it. Okay. During the break, I took a moment to read

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:14.000
the Michelson paper from 1925, the one that he did with Gail. Oops, I can't hear you for a reason.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:23.680
Oh, there we go. So, you make the case that Sonja does this experiment. There's reasons to dismiss

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.880
it because of the design, but it seems like it would be difficult to also dismiss Michelson's

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:39.920
experiment. Yes, right. And Michelson was a more permanent figure. He was a leader. He was a noble

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:52.800
laureate. But see, 1925, as I said, by then the theory Einstein's theory was very well accepted.

01:21:53.760 --> 01:22:02.800
There were very few critics. There were critics always, but there were so few that I think

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:13.760
the Michelson-Gail experiment was, it went unnoticed. That's what I think. But it's difficult to

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:22.720
gauge. When I give talks on relativity and various things, I see that nobody has heard about

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:30.640
the Michelson-Gail experiment except some senior people from a different generation.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:42.080
So, it's not very clear to me why it is so, but because it's very clear what Michelson says

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:48.560
in that abstract is very clear. Referring to his 1904 paper, he says that

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:57.680
if the ether is there, this is the kind of signal which is expected. And in 1925 writes

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:06.880
that the expected signal is measured. It is seen in the experiment. It is very clear.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:20.720
But he was also very careful. He says that this is consistent with Einstein's

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:32.240
formulation. In a way, it is actually very subtle. And to explain, it will take some

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:42.160
effort. But the point is, even today, you see, Sainac's discovery was very important in terms of

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:47.360
practical application. It's a Sainac interferometer which is used today to measure

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:56.160
what's called a gyroscope to measure rotations in aeroplanes and so on. If you are in an

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:04.720
aircraft, if you want to measure how its direction is changing, you need a gyroscope.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.440
What is used today is a laser-based gyroscope, active laser gyroscope,

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:21.360
or a fiber laser gyroscope. All this based on Sainac's idea that if you are in a rotating

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:30.320
situation, light takes more time to travel the distance and that can be measured.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:39.840
And that is a measure of rotation. So everywhere Sainac gyro is very important in practical

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:47.040
applications. However, nobody realizes that this was originally proposed as evidence for

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:57.600
the existence of the ether. Okay. But Microsoft experiment is, since it was looking at the rotation

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:03.760
of the Earth, it is not that well known as the Sainac experiment.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:15.040
Let's talk a little bit about how we could interpret all of this data in a slightly

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:25.600
different light by considering the fact that there's an invalid assumption about empty space

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.720
spaked into all of this and that if we start to consider that the universe is filled with

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.560
matter that's all exerting gravity upon one another, we can reframe some of these results.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.200
Yes. Yes, we should get to that. But before that, I thought there's one more point

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.400
related to what you asked earlier, where Henry Buxton comes into picture.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.960
See, that is a question of what is called the concept of simultaneity.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:06.320
When do we say two events are simultaneous? Of course, if two events happen at our own

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:13.440
location, we are sitting in some location in space. If some two events occur in the same

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.080
location, we don't have any ambiguity about whether they are simultaneous or not simultaneous.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:29.920
But if these two events happen at a distance from us at two different points,

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.480
then some signal has to bring in this information about these events to us.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.520
How do we decide whether these two events are simultaneous or not?

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:52.480
It's an important problem in physics, it's an important problem in general life and it's an

01:26:52.480 --> 01:27:01.440
important problem of philosophy as well. So Buxton was an expert on issues related to time,

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:11.520
duration, simultaneity and he had certain philosophical views on it, maybe prejudices or views

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.720
along the direction of thinking about absolute time, absolute simultaneity and so on.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:29.200
And it is in this context, in the early 1900s, philosophers came into contact with the

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:39.360
relativity theories, in which all these concepts were thrown away,

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:52.080
concept of simultaneity, concept of clocks, time, because the rate of clocks,

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:59.120
since it depended on the motion of the clocks, moving clock went slow, moving clock was

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.400
running slower, time dilation. So for every observer, there was his own type,

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:14.160
multitude of times. This was not really palatable to philosophers at that time,

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.720
because philosophers thought there is one universal time, there's one universal concept of

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:29.440
simultaneity. So people like Buxton got very interested in studying relativity theory and

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:38.720
they did study it very carefully. It is in this context, if you look at Einstein's writing,

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.600
both his paper in 1905 and he wrote a popular book in 1960, it's called Relativity,

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:54.800
Suspicion and General Theory. It's almost written for a popular, common man,

01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:03.520
that kind of a very, it starts from very basic concepts about time, space, clocks,

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.800
coordinate systems and so on. Now there is a long discussion about simultaneity in this book,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:19.120
which is described in the context of a moving train, there's a platform. So one is talking

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.480
about the relativity between the person on the platform and the person in the moving train.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:33.680
So in 1922 when Einstein visited Paris, there was one session, discussion,

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:41.840
session of discussions arranged by the Philosophical Society out there. This was a

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:50.800
session in Sorbonne and Buxton happened to be there. Buxton was a very prominent,

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:59.520
most popular philosopher at that time. His lectures were very popular in Paris

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:09.120
and in that session he was just one of the persons who came to listen to what Einstein had to say.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:18.800
At some stage there were some discussions, very short discussions and in which Buxton

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:26.560
was asked to comment on Einstein's theory because people knew that Buxton had studied this series.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:35.040
And Buxton said in this short time he has studied it, he studied it for his own benefit

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.160
and it's a very interesting theory. But in the short discussion he cannot express all that he

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.840
thinks about this theory. However, he wanted to point out something about this concept of

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:54.480
simultaneity in Einstein's theory and he made short comments for a few minutes in which he said

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:04.160
there is, he indicated, he didn't explain it but he indicated there is some real problem,

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:12.240
the way Einstein deals with simultaneity in relativity theory. Einstein did not take it very

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:22.160
seriously. However, in the same year, Buxton wrote a book which is called duration and

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:34.640
simultaneity, written in France, published in 1922, in which he explains with extreme clarity

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:43.440
where Einstein had gone wrong, real wrong in dealing with simultaneity in relativity.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:55.440
Okay, so I didn't want to explain the whole writing here but it's, if Einstein had paid

01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:04.000
attention to what Buxton had to say in that book, he, Einstein himself would have been able

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:15.600
to correct his theory because what he talks about simultaneity in his theory is actually a blunder,

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.320
blunder in the sense that once you assume that the velocity, relative velocity of light

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.320
is the same for everybody. Suppose we say, relative velocity of light is invariant

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:39.520
and the same for everybody, then the concept of simultaneity which follows from that postulate

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.560
is in direct conflict with our experience, what we experience as simultaneity.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.640
Not as a common, I'm not talking about mathematical,

01:32:52.800 --> 01:33:02.720
mathematical subtleties of relativity, we can experience directly in real life certain examples

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:10.160
of simultaneity and we know what the result is. The concept of the postulate of the

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:18.080
invariant velocity of light is inconsistent with our experience of simultaneity. This was pointed

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:25.280
out. What are the examples that Buxton uses of simultaneity that is experienced? So he analyzes

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:38.720
the same example what Einstein describes in his book of the strain and the platform.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:45.600
So the experiment, the example with Einstein uses is very, very simple. He says there's a train

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:57.200
moving along a platform. The platform has n points A and B. Train has n points A prime and B prime.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.360
Now let's assume that when the train reaches the platform, these points coincide,

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.320
a point on the platform coinciding with a point on the train and the second point on

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:21.360
the platform coinciding with the second point on the train. Let's assume that there is an observer

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.880
on the platform, there's an observer on the train at the midpoints, midpoint of platform,

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:34.560
midpoint of the train and they are coinciding at some point of time. They are in line with each

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:42.480
other. Let's assume that at that time two strokes of lighting happened at the two ends of the train.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:51.920
Somehow, so on end A and end B, two strokes of lighting has happened. Light from these

01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:03.280
strokes of lightning will reach both observers. Now since the person on the platform is at the

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:12.720
midpoint, if he gets these light flashes from these two strokes of lighting at the same time

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:19.360
in his clock, he will say the lighting happened simultaneously at the two points

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.640
because he is at the midpoint. Now the question Einstein asks is,

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.760
for the observer in the train, are the two strokes simultaneous or not?

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:38.800
He is moving, he is moving relative to what at the at this particular point when the strokes

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:48.240
happened that two observers coincided. And then there is analysis of what would the person

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.400
inside the train conclude about simultaneity. That's the only question which is answered

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:59.280
by both Einstein and Berkson. And the correct experience if you think about it,

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.440
the person in the train will not see it simultaneously because he is moving away.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.880
By the time the lightings come from both sides, he would have moved away from the midpoint.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:17.600
Therefore, he cannot see these two strokes of lighting simultaneously. That's our experience

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:24.560
also. However, if the relative velocity is same for the observer on the platform

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.360
and the observer on the train, suppose it is same, then their experience also has to be

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.040
exactly same. When you analyze this, suppose a person on the platform sees this,

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:43.920
how will we, how will he argue, he is on the midpoint, light from the left side,

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.760
left side and the light from the right side are coming at the same relative velocity of velocity.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:55.040
So therefore, since I am in the midpoint, they will reach at the same time. So therefore,

01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:03.120
it's all simultaneous. Now the person in the train, how will he argue? He will say,

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.480
when I was in the midpoint, the lighting happened. But the velocity of light does not depend on the

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:20.320
velocity of the source. Okay. The relative, if the relative velocity of light from the left side

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:26.560
and from the right side are exactly the same for the person on the train as well,

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:34.880
then both pulses have to reach him also at the same time. There is no escape from that conclusion.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:45.360
So experience contradicts the postulate very clearly. However, Einstein in his book, as well

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:53.920
as in his paper, when he argues about simultaneity, he forgets the fact that he has already assumed

01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:01.360
that the relative velocity of light is invariant constant. He ignores that he makes a blunder

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:11.360
really. And this blunder, Berkson points out very clearly in his book as one paragraph, one paragraph.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.800
But nobody took Berkson seriously at that time. It's a real blunder. Now there is a direct

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:33.920
consequence of all this. You know, GPS, GPS, all this only information, where GPS works,

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:40.640
the only information which comes from these satellites to our receiver in our mobile phone and so

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:50.400
are timing signals. The time at a satellite at about 20,000 kilometers away,

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:58.800
the timing signal comes saying that my position is this and I am sending the signal,

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:05.680
this is the time in this atomic clock. And similar timing signals are coming from multiple

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:14.400
satellites. To localize somebody in position, in space, you need to convert these timing signals

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:21.440
to distances. So there is a time of emission of the signal. There is a time of the arrival

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.480
of the signal in the receiver. The difference is the duration. This duration has to be converted to

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:37.760
a distance. Now we know that the relative velocity does not depend on the velocity of the source.

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.080
So the fact that the satellites are moving doesn't matter. It will only contribute to some

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:50.160
Doppler shift, Doppler shift in the frequency of signal, but not in the type because relative

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.880
velocity does not depend on the velocity of the source. Now the question is, in Einstein's theory,

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.680
the relative velocity does not depend on the velocity of the observer also, the receiver

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:09.040
as well. Therefore, the distance conversion from duration to this duration to distance

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:15.120
is a simple formula, invariant velocity multiplied by the duration. Distance is

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:23.920
just invariant constant velocity C multiplied by the duration. So when we have three such

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:34.640
durations, we can localize a person, a receiver. Okay. So it's a question of something like

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:42.080
simultaneity from three different satellites, which is a point where things are simultaneously

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:55.120
localized. However, suppose this concept of Einstein's concept of postulate of invariant

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:05.200
velocity is conflict with the concept of simultaneity. Then Einstein's formula cannot be used in

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:14.400
actual practice of GPS operation. You need to use the formula which is used in a Galilean theory,

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.240
like a velocity of relative velocity of sound. Because if the receiver is moving away from the

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.680
satellite, you have to say C minus V. If the receiver is moving towards a satellite,

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:33.760
you have to say C plus V and so on. Now it turns out the actual formula, the formula which is

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:41.680
actually used in GPS. If you can ask any expert in GPS, you will say it is not Einstein's formula.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:50.800
It is not C times duration to calculate the distance. It is C minus V times the duration.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.560
Okay. But that's a detail. What I'm saying is what Berkson said in 1922.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:08.320
It has its resonance echoing today in GPS operation. And all this has to do with the fact that the

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:18.880
relative velocity is not an invariant concept. The GPS example is an elegant proof of the way that

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:26.960
a mathematical theory is perhaps elegant and beloved, but in practice is not used. And I think

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:33.440
that that's the core of the argument here, which is that there are inconsistencies with the way that

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:42.640
we mathematically apply these rules to reality, which is that we like the ideas behind relativity,

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.160
but when push comes to shove and we have to design a system, we use different mathematics. And those

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:56.000
mathematics seem to imply that the velocity is not constant, that the motion is affecting the

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.720
perceived velocity. Well, not the mathematics. What I mean is experience. Experience is what

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:16.000
contradicts the postulate, the basic postulate of a special theory of relativity. See, if you

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.120
look at Einstein's theory of relativity, that's the basis of all physics today.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:32.480
So one cannot say that everything what is said in the theory is incorrect, because most of the

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:40.800
things I had to be working in practice to say that the theory was successful, which is a fact,

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:47.520
for example, various particle physics experiments and so on. See, if you really look at the theories

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:55.600
of relativity, there are two vital physical effects which you actually see in phenomena.

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:04.400
One is the fact that moving clocks runs slowly, time dilation. In fact, that's the most important

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:13.520
physical effects coming from theory of relativity. But this is a common effect. This effect is there

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:19.920
in both, both kind of theories. It was there in the Lawrence's theory with either, it's there in

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:30.800
Einstein's theory without either. So there are several physical effects which are described

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:37.760
correctly in both theories and they are all seen in actual empirical situations.

01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:47.760
But really crucial, when you test a theory in physics especially, there is a concept of what's

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:53.440
called a crucial experiment. Even one experiment, even one experiment going against a theory

01:44:53.440 --> 01:45:02.160
will invalidate the theory. You don't have to test a whole lot of things. Even if 99 experiments

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:08.640
are favouring the theory, if one experiment goes against a theory, then the whole theory can get

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:18.320
replaced. In fact, there is a particular quotation from Einstein which I would like to read out

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:26.080
which may be interesting. He says, the theoretical scientific researcher is not to be envied

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:35.120
because nature or more precisely put experiment is a merciless and not very kindly judge of his

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:45.040
efforts. She never says yes to a theory. In the best case, merely perhaps. But in most cases simply

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:54.000
no. If an experiment agrees with a theory, it means perhaps. If it does not agree, then it means no.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:03.920
If every theory is sure to experience, it's no someday. Most theories already do so soon after

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:13.440
their formulation. So this crucial experiment, that is a critical element here. Even one

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:23.760
experiment going against a theory invalidates a theory. Here we have many examples of experience

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:32.640
where the postulate seems to go against experience. Therefore, there must be an alternate theory

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:40.320
where these things are consistent. That is what we should discuss. What is that consistent theory

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.760
which will explain everything which we know in a empirical situation

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:53.280
and also consistent with the fact that light can propagate with a variable velocity?

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:06.320
Yeah, I assume that this leads us neatly to Mach and the involvement of the rest of the universe.

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.640
Yes, that's right. Now, one point.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.480
Can I say one thing though? I love that Einstein quote. I haven't heard that one before. But one

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:22.160
thing I love about it is that Einstein captures the essence of science, which is that it whittles

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.880
down possibilities. Nature never says yes to your theory. It can only say eh, maybe.

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.760
And people get so married to their theories because they think their yes is.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.720
And I just love the humility in that Einstein quote of just recognizing that these theories

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:45.280
all get chopped down and replaced eventually because new data becomes available, new ways

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.320
of looking at things appear in people's imaginations. I just think that's underlining

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:56.320
the possibility nature of theories. We permit these ideas into the sphere of possibility

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.440
when they become theories, especially when they're widely accepted theories.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.400
They pass lots of different tests, but that doesn't mean that they are necessarily so.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.760
It just means they haven't been proven to be not so. That's really, really remarkable.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:19.680
He wrote it in 1912 in a paper which he wrote about superconductivity. Superconductivity was

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:26.640
discovered in 1911. In 1912, he wrote a theoretical paper. And I think he was aware that he could

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:32.880
be wrong about what you were saying. That is where he has his quotation. Of course,

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:40.880
looking at edging from Einstein's personality, I wonder he ever thought his theory of

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:48.080
relativity would be subject to the same fate someday. I would assume so from the tone of

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:54.400
that statement. I do like that about him a lot. All right, so let's talk about Mark. Let's talk

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.280
about the cause of these discrepancies and what you think the solution said.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.720
Before we get there, I've been rolling this thing around in my head about the Michelson-Gale

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:18.960
experiment. Is it possible to do this experiment on a larger scale with experimental apparatuses

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.920
that are already in place? You look at the Michelson-Gale paper and they spent a ton of money.

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:33.600
They had an army engineer who helped them design this massive kilometer-long path. Is there some

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.760
place where this experiment could be repeated in the modern day without having to invest?

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:43.920
Yeah, I know. It is always investment. If it costs at that time, it will cost much more today.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:52.800
However, you see the Michelson-Gale experiment. The interferometer was already a size of a

01:49:52.800 --> 01:50:02.320
kilometer size interferometer. There was some mild vacuum and so on based on whatever technology

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.920
was available then. But today, the gravitational wave detectors are also Michelson interferometers,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.760
standard Michelson interferometers. Now, the next generation gravitational detectors,

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:23.440
which are supposed to come up after about 10 years, they are sort of triangular configuration.

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:35.920
In some sense, one can get similar data similar to what Michelson and Gale got in their

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.360
rectangular interferometers in this closed triangular

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:51.840
detectors of next generation. So it is not very difficult to do this kind of experiment

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:58.480
with today's technology. You don't even need one kilometer size with today's technology because

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:06.080
when Michelson did these experiments, there was no laser. Laser was discovered after 1960.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:13.920
Michelson was doing all these experiments using discharge lamps and things like that.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.360
Very, very small amount of light. But today, the same experiments can be done with much more

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:30.240
sensitivity on even a smaller scale with good vacuuming. So doing the experiment is not a problem.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.480
What is the problem? The problem is in convincing people that here there is something

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:44.160
to be explained. And it's very difficult to convince people that there is a deviation

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:54.720
which doesn't agree with Einstein's postulate. But doesn't the GPS make it apparent?

01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.720
Well, they just discounted based on the non-inertial business that we talked about.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.280
Yeah, most of the time, that's what they do. Even there, there is an issue.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:12.800
See, GPS was a technology which was implemented not by physics people. It was implemented by

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:19.360
defense people, okay, military and all that. So there were physicists and engineers working in that,

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:26.880
but mostly engineers, the physics people who are working in that tried to use and they knew about

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:34.160
the effects of relativity. And when the first two satellites which were sent up in the GPS

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:40.160
constellation, of course, now there are many, many such constellations. But when the first satellites

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:48.560
went up, they assumed that Einstein's formulae, formulae based on Einstein's special theory of

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:54.720
relativity would be sufficient, apart from the gravitational effects of one-two clocks and so

01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:03.440
on. But soon they realized that those formulae did not work. So there were post facto corrections

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:12.640
introduced in the GPS algorithms. And one of them is this correction for using,

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:19.520
correction using C minus V and C plus V instead of C. Instead of using a constant velocity,

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:27.200
you use a variable velocity. But the justification given by GPS physicist's

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:41.760
name is Neil Ashby. He writes a lot on this Neil Ashby. The main logical basis he talks about

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:50.080
is about this non-inertial motion and things like that. Same objections which was raised again

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:58.480
about SANAX experiments. People now write about GPS assessment. But they are not

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:07.680
sufficient, I would say. I will give you one example, which is a very interesting example.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:18.560
Suppose you see a flock of birds flying backwards carrying a clock. So there's a flock of birds,

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:26.400
they carry a clock, but they're flying backwards. You of course immediately know,

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:34.640
any commonsense person will know that birds cannot fly backwards with flapping their wings.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:45.120
The only way this can happen is when we, our observer himself, is moving faster than the birds

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:52.560
in the same direction. We have the illusion that the birds are flying backwards.

01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:01.760
Now you ask the question, where the clocks carried by these birds, will it go faster and slow or

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:08.640
slower? Will it have a time dilation? Einstein's theory says yes, because the clock is moving

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:15.760
relatively, the clock is moving relatively, therefore it should go slower. But I know

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:24.000
from common sense that I must be moving faster than the birds. That is why birds are flying

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.640
backwards. Therefore the clock carried by me should be going slower. Okay. It is just a

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:38.080
common sense objection. It is not an evidence against Einstein's theory. I'm not presenting it

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:46.800
as an evidence. I already see common sense of even an uneducated man can conflict with the

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:56.320
best theories of physics. And one should take this common sense conflicts very seriously

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:02.560
and think about it. Sometimes it may be irrelevant, but sometimes it can be very relevant.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:11.520
Okay. Now we can get back to Mark. What's actually going on in your opinion?

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:19.840
What's actually? What's the hidden story here? There's these problems,

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.680
there's some contradictions. What does the solution set look like?

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:33.600
Yes. Now we come back to this issue of cosmology. We know very well that these theories were

01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:43.760
formulated, perfected and so on. Before we knew about the extent of the cosmos, the amount of

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:54.800
matter in the cosmos and so on. So after 1930, after Edwin Hubble's observation that there are

01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:02.320
a lot of extragalactic objects which seems to be going away from us at velocity proportional to

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:12.960
their distance, people started looking at the galaxies outside far away using the new generation

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:20.080
of large telescopes, one meter telescope, Palomar and various other places. Then slowly

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:29.120
we realized that the universe was at least a thousand times larger than what we thought it is.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:38.240
Okay. We knew this Milky Way and a few Nebulae around this Magellanic clouds and so on.

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:45.360
But with these new telescopes, we realized that the universe is at least thousand times larger.

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:53.120
If it is thousand times larger, of course, the volume is a billion times larger, cube of this

01:57:53.120 --> 01:58:02.160
thousand. So if the volume is billion times larger, we also expect the matter in this universe,

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:05.040
also a billion times larger than what we thought it was.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:16.880
All that is fine. But now, if there is so much matter, there has to be corresponding amount of

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:29.280
gravity. And gravity is a very special interaction because it can affect logs, it can affect propagation

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:37.440
of objects, it can affect all dynamics. Even Einstein's theory itself, the general theory of

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:45.120
relativity, which is a theory of gravity, also says these things. We already know from experiments

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:51.680
that if you have two clocks at two different gravitational potentials, one at a lower potential,

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:58.000
another at a higher distance, a different potential, these two clocks will run at different rates,

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:05.360
depending on the value of the potential at the location of the clocks. So there is gravitational

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:14.240
time dilation. And there is a difference in gravitational potential, it can affect the rate

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:24.080
at which the clock runs. However, such effects are not included in the present theories, in the sense

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:31.360
with this enormous gravity in this universe, with this enormous gravitational potentials,

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:38.720
if there is any effect on clocks and propagation of light and so on, those effects are not part

01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:46.480
of our current theories because in the current theories, the matter in the universe is not

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:55.760
even considered. So there is a very big missing factor. Of course, we don't know a priori that

01:59:55.760 --> 02:00:05.280
this gravity has a significant effect or not, that we have to calculate. But the fact that gravity

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:13.920
affects everything means we need to reconsider our theories that because we have this new information

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:23.520
about the universe and if the gravity has any importance, if its magnitude is sufficient to

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:31.680
affect phenomena in the laboratory, we have to reconsider these theories and calculate all

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:38.800
these effects and see whether this is significant to change the theories or not. That's a basic

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:49.360
premise. Now this calculation can be done and some very interesting facts come out when you do a

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:57.600
even a rough calculation. See today, cosmology has developed to a stage where we have a

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:04.640
reasonably good idea about the average density of matter and energy in the universe.

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:15.280
Okay. So we have direct observation of galaxies and various sources which emit light,

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:22.320
but that is not all the matter. There is what is called dark matter, for example. They are

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:29.760
indirectly measured using their gravitational effects. So we have some measurements of this

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.960
average density of the universe. There is some uncertainty, both conceptual and quantitative

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:42.640
uncertainty in all these measurements. But if you have a reasonable idea, how much

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.720
matter is there, how much energy is there and so on in the universe today.

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:54.640
If you use these observational values and calculate the total gravitational potential

02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:00.800
in our rooms, for example, in your room or in the room I am sitting, the same value because the

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:08.720
universe has the same kind of appearance relative to our small earth. The number which comes out

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:14.560
is a very interesting number. The total gravitational potential due to all the matter in the universe,

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:20.880
all the matter and energy in the universe, if you calculate, you get a number which is numerically

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:34.800
very close to the square of the velocity of light. That velocity of light is 300,000

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:42.640
kilometer per second. Take the square of that. That is a number. That number matches

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:49.360
the value of the total gravitational potential of all the matter and energy in the universe.

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:53.440
So, this is not a coincidence. There is something profound

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.800
in the fact that these two numbers match.

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:07.360
First suggestion is the propagation of light is controlled by the gravity of the matter in the

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:14.400
universe. That is why there is a relation between the velocity of light and the gravitational potential

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:20.320
of all the matter and energy in the universe. The cosmic gravity, its value

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:29.760
is equal to the square of the velocity of light. Okay. So, not only that it is enormous,

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:36.800
enormous gravity, it is also this particular value rate optimal. This can be calculated.

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.920
This fact was known for a long time. People did not connect it up with anything else,

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:49.200
but this fact was known for a long time. It is not a new fact. That is one thing.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:57.920
Now, referring back to Mark's principle. See, why did what Mark said was very profound? Everybody

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:04.960
agrees that what Mark said and what is called Mark's principle today, it was named Mark's principle

02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:12.800
by Einstein himself. Even Einstein said is a very profound principle. But you all know that

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:16.000
Mark's principle is not part of our standard physics today.

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:25.600
Mark's principle is talked about as an extraneous principle. It is not part of any standard theories

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:34.080
of physics today. There is a reason for that, which I, when I first realized this, I was really

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:43.760
amazed. Mark's principle implies that there is one universal frame, one universe. Because Mark's

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:53.600
principle takes effects of dynamics centrifugal force and things like that happens because of

02:04:53.600 --> 02:05:00.160
some interaction with the rest of the matter in the universe. Whatever that interaction is,

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:07.760
since universe is one preference frame, accepting Mark's principle immediately implies

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:15.440
accepting an absolute frame like ether and so on. But once you accept an absolute frame,

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:22.560
the direct consequence is that propagation of light is Galilean. The velocity, relative

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:28.800
velocity of light will depend on the velocity of the observable. So, Mark's principle cannot

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:34.160
be incorporated in current physics without breaking Einstein's theory, without throwing away

02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:42.480
Einstein's theory of relativity. So, because of this, though Einstein really, if you look at the

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:49.680
history of the development of general theory of relativity, how Einstein developed that theory.

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:56.240
For about five years, Einstein could not decide whether Mark's principle should be

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:02.400
taken as a basis of general theory of relativity or some other principle.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:10.560
He tried incorporating Mark's principle into his theory of gravity, the general theory of

02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:16.880
relativity. He could not because general theory of relativity was based on specific theory of

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:24.160
relativity, in which he already assumed the invariance of the velocity of light. But Mark's

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:30.720
principle needs an absolute frame, which will deny the basic postulate of special theory of

02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:37.520
relativity. Therefore, he finally discarded Mark's principle. That is why Mark's principle is not

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:50.080
any more discussed in physics. So anyway, so the interaction, gravitational interaction with

02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:55.040
all the matter in the universe provides just gravitational potential affecting everything

02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:02.320
in the universe. So, if you take two clocks, one clock, which is stationary in this universe,

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:08.960
and another clock, which is moving in this universe, the gravitational potential experience

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:14.320
by the moving clock is slightly different from gravitational potential experience by the stationary

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:21.680
clock. And this can be calculated. Then you know what is the gravitational potential for a stationary

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:29.200
frame, which is, I said, the score of the velocity of light. You can very precisely calculate

02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:33.200
what is the gravitational potential felt by a clock, which is moving.

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:39.200
And then it turns out that the time dilation, which we see, beyond some

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:47.840
accelerators and so on, or moving real clocks in the laboratory, all the time dilations,

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:55.600
which we see experimentally, match us exactly with the gravitational effect of the universe.

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:03.280
So therefore, we have an explanation of, explanation for

02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:14.880
phenomena like time dilation, which is a prime effect of relativity we see in the laboratory.

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:24.320
Laboratory evidence for relativity is prime example is time dilation. We know that you don't

02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:28.880
need Einstein's theory to explain that. We need only the gravity of the universe.

02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:36.880
Similarly, for many, many physical effects in the laboratory, we can do this calculation,

02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:44.080
the effect of the gravity of the cosmos, cosmic matter on what we see in the laboratory.

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:52.560
And for every instance, without any exception, it matches. The calculation matches what we see

02:08:53.280 --> 02:09:00.960
in the laboratory. So every relativistic effect, which we see in the laboratory today,

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:08.080
can be explained as a consequence of the gravity of the matter in the universe.

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:16.480
I mean, that's a very, very profound framing of the interrelation

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:24.640
of the cosmos and the effect that the distant stars have upon us. It's a formulation that's

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:33.600
been around since Mox time, which he was writing in the 1920s. I think like 1870, 1880, those.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:41.120
Right, because Einstein was familiar with it. And so it fell out of favor because relativity

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:47.760
offers these very tantalizing thought experiments and purports to put us into a,

02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:54.160
personally, I think a more fantastical universe. Yes. And so now we're up against the challenge

02:09:54.160 --> 02:10:01.040
where you have two theories where the mathematics give you, they can describe the same observed

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:07.440
phenomenon. Here, the mathematics is different. The mathematics is different, but the end point

02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:12.160
is that you have an observation and you can use one set of mathematics, which is Einsteinian

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.760
relativity, to describe it. And then you have another set of mathematics, which refers to the

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:24.160
cosmos to describe it, but the observation is the same. And so this comes down to preference and

02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:31.040
and belief really, like this is a cultural state of affairs. Here there is no choice.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:41.120
Okay. Because we can see the objects in the universe with a telescope,

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.760
or various measurements related. So there are galaxies and so on. They are really there.

02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:58.000
They are not an illusion. If those gravities, if those objects are there, there has to be

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:05.600
gravity of corresponding to those objects. There's no choice. Right? So if gravity is there,

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:12.960
those gravitational effects would be there. So now if Einstein was, if suppose Einstein's theory

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:22.080
is right, then you will have a doubled effects, one due to Einstein's formulation, whatever that is.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:28.560
And this gravitational effect, which has to be there because there is also objects are really

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:35.920
there. But you cannot have both together because that will have doubled the effect. So you have to

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:42.720
make a choice between the two. And the choice is obvious because those objects are there.

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:50.960
You cannot choose Einstein's theory and say, though those objects are there, their gravity is not.

02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:59.440
Again, you cannot make such a front. I love that it simplifies things and speaks in terms of

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.720
the real material objects. But gravity itself is still a nightmare, right? So why do two atoms

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.040
attract to one another at the end of the day? Do you spend any time thinking about that at a

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:15.120
material scale? Like what are the atoms actually doing to pull each other together?

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.400
Yes, you can ask the same question about electrical forces as well. Okay, so why

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:31.840
matter interacts with matter in this particular way is a deeper question. I would say it's a deeper

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:39.680
question. So for example, take the concept of a field, gravitational field, magnetic field,

02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:47.440
and electric field. We cannot experience any of these fields. All we can see is when we put two

02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:54.080
pieces of matter together with certain properties, they either attract or dribble,

02:12:54.080 --> 02:13:00.080
there's a force, we can push one with another. Yeah, they're like maps of effects, essentially.

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:06.720
They're like predictable maps of effects. And because we like continuity, the concept of

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:15.120
continuity, we don't want, we don't like action at a distance. We like only when we see something

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:23.520
being pushed, we want to associate something local pushing it. By proposing, by postulating a field,

02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:29.760
we can say, okay, I have a piece of matter, this creates a field, which is everywhere.

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:35.760
Then that field acts on another piece of matter. It's a nice concept. But every field,

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:43.280
whether it is gravitational, or electric or magnetic, they are all unobservable entities in

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:51.200
physics. Okay, they are postulated. They are what we would call free creations of our mind.

02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:58.560
Right, they're abstract. Yeah, we can never verify their reality, the way we verify the

02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:08.400
reality of matter, solid matter. So there is a gradation of realities, which we use in physics,

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:14.400
but there is no escape from that using such concepts. That's the way we understand it.

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:19.280
You think there's no escape, or do you think that we just haven't conceptualized it fully?

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:26.720
No. Any other way of talking about this becomes very complicated. There is a formulation of

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.680
interaction between two objects to matter, whether it's gravitation or

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:39.840
electrodynamics. There's a formulation of action at a distance. There are mathematical

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:47.200
formulations of how two objects interact without a field intervening, these two objects.

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:54.960
They are called action at a distance theories. But they are mathematically very formidable.

02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:03.040
But the question is not necessarily whether or not there's not a field in between the two

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.280
objects. The question is, is the field made of something?

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:16.880
Yes, so how do we decide that? That's a problem. So now one thing which we seem to agree,

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:22.560
even that is debatable, but seem to agree is that this field contains energy.

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:30.400
And when we are talking about attraction of two objects, it's not so obvious. But when we talk

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:38.960
about a propagating wave, for example, you move an object, either a mass or a charge,

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:45.520
it generates electromagnetic wave, which can transfer energy from here to there.

02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:52.480
Because we can do all this communication with electromagnetic waves. So there seems

02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:59.200
to be some reason in proposing that there is a field which is independent of matter,

02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:04.960
which can propagate, which can affect and so on. There seem to be reasonable concepts.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:14.560
Again, it's not necessarily that there isn't the effects of the field. It's like,

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:20.960
when we talk about energy, well, I think one of my favorite definitions for energy is

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:27.200
material in motion or material that can be in terms of potential energy. It's material that

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:34.320
under other circumstances will go into motion. And so when we talk about energy in terms of

02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:39.200
electromagnetic waves, all of the sudden, we kind of throw our hands up and we say, well,

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.440
the field itself is in motion, but the field is mathematical. The field is a set of measurements

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:56.720
that we have made. Yeah. So this would have been a puzzle, but for the relation which Einstein

02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:05.440
himself clarified, equating energy and mass. So when he said there is a equivalence between

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:16.560
energy and mass, that in some way, not solved, but at least reconcile this problem,

02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:25.200
that energy equivalence to some kind of a matter. So when you come to quantum theories,

02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:32.640
for example, we talk about photons, particles of light, instead of just waves.

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:41.760
And there, at least, we think of photon as some localized quanta of energy,

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:48.080
very similar to matter, though it is not really as real as matter.

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.680
But at least we talk about quanta of energy very much like a particle.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:03.360
In that sense, there is a close analogy. I agree that they are not the same.

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:10.800
They are not the same. It is not exactly matter in the normal sense, like an electron moving

02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:16.720
for a fundamental particle moving. But photon is treated as a fundamental particle

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:22.880
with the properties of a particle today. I guess the thing that leaves me deeply

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:28.880
unsatisfied comes back to this human intuition, which is that if quantum fields,

02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:35.920
when you come down to the bottom of it, are pure energy, which is determined by the measurements

02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:42.320
made of, let's say, the zero point energy of the vacuum, or inside of a particle collider,

02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:49.200
you have some kind of momentum transfer between the thing that you're measuring and your detector.

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:58.000
In the current models, those things are not material. And yet, they produce material

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:06.400
objects somehow. And there is this void where no one has yet figured out how to cross it,

02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:11.280
because you have, on one hand, pure energy, and then on the other hand, you have tangible matter.

02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:16.000
And it seems like people stopped looking because of this Michelson-Morley experiment.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.480
They gave up on the static ether, and it seems very much impossible to explain these

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:28.480
action at distances without the material objects being in contact with one another somehow to

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:32.800
affect this momentum transfer. And the field stands in for that object, right? We're like,

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:36.080
look, there's a field in between them, so there's no action at a distance. Really,

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:42.400
it's the field that's propagating these effects. But it's like, how does the field become a material?

02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:50.720
Yeah, but if you look at modern theoretical physics, it has gone even beyond this.

02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:58.720
In fact, something which even a practicing physicist like me find a bit strange,

02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:03.040
because field theories say that even particles are fields.

02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:08.720
Electrons, protons, and various things are actually fields.

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:11.920
But they're particular excitation of the underlying field.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.880
That's what that's, but that is only a theoretical formulation. These are just

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:26.160
our own creations. No, this is, this is the all this kind of concept evolved out of

02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:31.840
mathematics. I see the theories further and further so that people could explain

02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:40.640
everything in the unified some picture. This, that doesn't mean that what we created in our

02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:47.040
theories is what is there in real nature. But this is how we treat everything today as fields.

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:58.320
And what if instead of fields, and instead of the static ether, we imagine that the atoms themselves

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:03.680
have, obviously they have some surface that we consider as the atom, right, the shell of the

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:08.480
electron or whatever it is for the chemist, but that there is some rarefied portion of the atom

02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.520
beyond that shell, which connects them to their neighbors, which is imponderable, but is carried

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:20.160
with the atom wherever it moves. Then you have a dynamical ether that's not actually static as a

02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:25.200
background. It can't be measured separately because it moves wherever the atoms move. And what if

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:30.160
there's a structure there still? What if we don't have to give up on material explanations for these

02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:39.680
things? Yeah, sir. I mean, when you ask this question, I feel a bit strange. That's because

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:51.200
of another reason. See, today, we think of dynamics as consisting of matter,

02:21:51.280 --> 02:22:01.040
fields, motion, and those kinds of concepts. However, there is a formulation of mechanics

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:10.320
due to William Roman Hamilton, Hamilton's formulation, Hamiltonian mechanics.

02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:20.640
In the Hamiltonian mechanics, which came in the 1830s, the fundamental object there,

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:28.800
entity, is what is called action. So there is a principle of least action or stationary action

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:35.520
where you say the path of dynamics, the actual path of dynamics, is a path where

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:45.600
this quantity called action is minimized. And you can derive all dynamics, every aspect of

02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:52.080
dynamics, whether it's electrodynamics or any other kind of dynamics from these action principles

02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:59.680
using Hamiltonian formulation. Now, if you think of this action, what is this action? Is it something

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:08.000
like a field or something real? People have not spent much time thinking about it. It is still

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:15.840
used as a mathematical convenience. Because action without actors is sort of nonsensical

02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:25.200
in our everyday conception. However, if you think about action, you see this principle

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:33.280
of least action works in real space and time. So you are saying there are various possible paths

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:42.080
in space and time. And one of those paths or one set of those paths is chosen,

02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:52.800
cancelling all other paths possible. You know that a path cannot be cancelled with another path.

02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:59.440
The only way you can cancel something is when you have something like a wave,

02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:07.120
something which can go positive or negative. So there has to be something in real space and time

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:14.640
with the properties of waves so that you can cancel some paths and enhance some other paths.

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:22.720
If you think that way, something like action has to be a real step in real space and time.

02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:29.520
Otherwise, how can action principle work? So the fact that action principle works in every

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:37.840
instance of physical dynamics, where it is standard particle mechanics or electrodynamics

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:42.640
or gravity or any other field theory, everywhere action principle works.

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:49.200
Then you might say, okay, action might be something in real space, we cannot feel it,

02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:52.720
we cannot see it, we cannot experience, sense it.

02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:04.960
But if such a thing is there as a real entity, it is around every atom, every particle and so on

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:16.480
as some real extended entity with the properties of a wave. So though your question was

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:25.920
not in this context, already we see that there is a possibility that there are things which we

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:34.160
cannot feel, sense and so on directly, but which could be really there in space and time

02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:42.000
around matter, which controls all dynamics. And this is the greatest challenge of physics,

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:50.320
because physics is unseen. Physics is things that we have to spend so much time and effort

02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:57.760
designing detectors and measurement apparatuses in order to be able to feel something,

02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:03.200
which we then have to translate to some mental theoretical model. And biology doesn't work

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.120
in the same way. You can look through a microscope and you can see the structures as they go.

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:14.960
And so it forces it to be physical, it forces it to be material. And physics just doesn't

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:23.040
have that because it is so, so small and so undetectable that we are left with the limits

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:30.480
of imagination. Yeah, but at the same time, physics has an advantage that things don't change.

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:35.680
The same thing repeats every time you do. You create a situation,

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:44.880
everything happens in the same way, not like a living matter. Things are not changing.

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:55.600
So therefore, a consistent picture can be obtained by persistently probing something

02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:03.040
the same way again and again. Here you mentioned this question of energy, energy of motion,

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:08.080
kinetic energy that we understand, something new, and we call it kinetic energy. But you

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:13.920
also mentioned potential energy. Now when you say potential, electric potential for example,

02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:21.840
we cannot see a potential. What we can see is only the variation of a potential in space,

02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:28.080
which we call a field, electric field when we say electric field. It's a variation of

02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:37.040
electric potential in space. For example, we can, there are these demonstrations where we have

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:44.800
a room which is electrically elevated to 1000 volts. We can stand inside that room without

02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:51.680
getting a truck because it's a constant potential. But if we test something with a different potential,

02:27:51.680 --> 02:28:00.480
we'll get a truck. So potential which we use, it's a term which we use very often in physics,

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.760
but we cannot sense a potential. We cannot see a potential. What we can sense is only a

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:13.760
variation of the potential in space or a change of potential in time. A time variation of a potential

02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:21.360
we can detect as a field. We can also detect a spatial variation of a potential as a force.

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:27.840
Electrical force and so on. So it's very much like this action in dynamics is very much like that.

02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:33.600
We cannot feel action, but the spatial variation of action is what we call momentum.

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:41.200
In the Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatial variation of action is what is called momentum. Momentum,

02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:51.120
we have a sense of what momentum is. Also, the time variation of action is what we call energy.

02:28:52.640 --> 02:29:04.640
In dynamics. But unless the action has a reality, we cannot have a spatial variation of action

02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:10.640
and a time dependence of action. So action must be real and is some extended object

02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:18.240
around every material body and so on which controls all dynamics. So these are things which are still

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:26.480
unexplored sufficiently in physics. We know the mathematics. We know all the mathematical

02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:32.320
expressions related to this. But what is the physical reality of these things? We are not

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:38.560
explored sufficiently. And I would say, go ahead. I think that's the perfect place to

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:45.520
pause for now. I think that's a beautiful realization. I think it points to a huge

02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:52.160
conceptual body of work that has yet to come. Yes. Of explanation versus just description.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:59.920
Yes. Description is easy. Description is easy because that is what we see in the laboratory,

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:05.600
phenomenon. When we see a lot of phenomena, we can say, we can describe it. We can even sort of

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:14.320
give a plausible framework, but explaining something starting from a small number of

02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:26.400
premises without making a new premise for each explanation. That is where the power of theory,

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:34.800
physical theory comes. And whether it is a consistent theory or not, is again determined by

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:40.960
these crucial experiments. So it's a back and forth interaction between

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:50.000
sufficiently, cleverly designed experiments and this imagination, free creations of our mind.

02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:57.440
I love that. I also, before we leave, I want to say how beautifully written your papers are.

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.800
You know, oftentimes, scientific papers are

02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:07.200
abstruse, especially about physics. They can be very complex and heavy in the language,

02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:15.680
but your prose is very clear. And the logic that the ideas follow is so beautifully laid out

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:21.920
that it was a joy to read your papers. So thank you for that. See the clarity. Clarity is the most

02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:30.160
important when you want to communicate. Okay. And that comes with only a wish. One has to have

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:40.560
the desire to be clear. And the most clear expositions I have seen in my life is by Einstein.

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:47.120
If you read Einstein's writings, that clarity, and that's the kind of clarity one

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:54.240
desires to achieve. Of course, his language is very fine and all that, you know, achieving that

02:31:54.240 --> 02:32:05.440
is difficult. But when I write a paper, I also try to ask people around me to see it and try to

02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:19.360
explain it to me. I'm very keen that whatever I think of as a conceptual, even a deep thought

02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:25.360
in physics, I should be able to explain to a schoolboy. I love that. I should be able to explain

02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:32.480
because, or, okay, forget schoolboy, I should be able to explain to my parents, my sister or

02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:37.840
brother or somebody, because they will ask me, what are you doing? I should be able to explain.

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.320
That's such a huge motivation for our work as well. Like when we were in graduate school,

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:49.760
we started, we were both studying electrical phenomena. And we came up against this question

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:57.680
of what is charge. And that doesn't have an explanation. It has a measurement. And that

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:02.640
was what set us on this path where we're exploring physics and trying to find theories that can

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:08.080
actually hold together for a full explanation because you can't talk to people about these ideas

02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:13.280
if you can't explain them even to yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because, you know, finally,

02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:22.000
why are we doing all this? You see, when we try to make a theory or when we try to think of physics,

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:27.680
why explanations in physics or any other science, that is for the whole community.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:33.760
It is not for the, it's a personal, of course, personal desire is the first thing which comes.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:40.320
You have a passion to understand. You want to understand, but understanding is not just for

02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:48.160
yourself. Having understood, you want to talk about it to people around you, explain it,

02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:55.440
students and various things like that. So achieving a certain level of clarity is very

02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:02.400
important for me always. Good shines through. Yeah, you're doing a great job. Thank you so much.

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:09.440
And, and thanks for taking the time to, you know, get into some of these issues. I think that we

02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:15.280
have made more sense of particularly a lot of these basic inforometer ideas that we've talked

02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:19.120
around in the show. I think that we've gotten a lot more clarity. So I thank you for that.

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:22.640
By the way, before you go, if people want to find out more about you,

02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:29.280
is there a way for them to, what's the best place? Should they read your papers,

02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:34.800
do you have a website or how do you do this? There is a Wikipedia page. There's a Wikipedia page

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:43.840
with some information. I maintain a YouTube channel, though I have not updated it for some

02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:51.040
time. I should do that with some of my talks and so on. Of course, I work in what is called a

02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:58.880
Defense Institute of Advanced Technology in Pune in India. Earlier, I was in the Tata Institute

02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:08.320
of Fundamental Research. So I have a website, one of those Google site website, again, it's not

02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:19.040
updated. I will update. But then two years ago, I wrote a book called New Relativity in the

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:25.760
Gravitational Universe. It is published by Springer. So there is enough information on the web.

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:33.520
When you do a search, there is enough information about me, various places scattered maybe.

02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:42.160
And so it's not difficult to find out more about me. And I always reply to emails and so on when

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:53.840
people write to me. It was really a very nice experience talking to you both. I really enjoyed

02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:02.960
just talking to you on various things. Because this is what I will do when some of my friends come

02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:13.440
here and sit. We talk about various things. And I learned from them. They want to learn from me

02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:19.600
and so on. That's beautiful. That's what we're going for. Yeah, that's why we built this project

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:25.120
really. Because it's hard to find those kind of friends. So we reached out across the internet

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:31.360
to have these conversations. Yes, yes. I'm really glad you have met you. I hope this isn't our last

02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:39.120
time meeting. Yes. Yeah, some other time we can talk a bit about quantum mechanics probably,

02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:50.480
because that is conceptual issues. When you come to what one would call the unsold

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:57.840
conceptual issues, you always associate quantum physics with this unsold conceptual issues.

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:06.640
Today, I talked to you about this action and things like that. And it was not a random thought,

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.760
because that's the kind of thing which I very passionately following up.

02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:17.920
Excellent. Let's do that. A couple of months down the line. I think we have a

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:24.560
beautiful calendar right now. Yeah, please. It's very reassuring to find people who are

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:31.760
thinking along your lines. I feel like the world is a saner, more legible place for having you in

02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:38.640
it. And so thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll see you again soon. Yeah, have a

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:45.680
great rest of your night. It's pretty late there. So thank you. Thank you and take care. Bye everybody.

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:48.800
See you later.
