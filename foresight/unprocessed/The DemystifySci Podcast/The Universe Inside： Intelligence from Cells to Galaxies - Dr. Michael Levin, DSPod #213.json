{"text": " Today on the podcast we have our third conversation with Mike Eleven to kick off the new year and we talk a lot about the developments that he's been making in his lab that all centered around the idea of embodied cognition, intelligence versus consciousness, some of the specifics of the way that the experiments work because the last time that we talked to him he had just published his paper on frog skin Xenobots where they had taken frog skin cells from frog skin, grown them in special conditions and then created these ambulatory little creatures that could then corral other skin cells to produce more of themselves and so basically in I think a pretty transparent way made a new life form out of a cellular format that you wouldn't really expect would be able to do something new and he kind of teased us with the idea that they were working on doing the same thing with mammalian cells and this paper was published over the course of the last year and so a lot of our discussion centered on what are called antherbots which are tracheal epithelial cells that grown in a 3d matrix then released from the 3d matrix are now become these multicellular ciliated structures that astonishingly migrate to the location of wounds inside of plated neuronal cells and then act to heal the break in the cellular layer and so it opens all of these questions that are kind of a perpetual topic with Michael Levin right like what are the parameters that create the design limitations that we associate with the bodies that we live in and as always it's a absolutely fascinating discussion because I think that Levin is thinking about these questions in a way that honestly very very few people are Levin and collaborators as he mentions towards the end of the episode and there's extraordinary second third-order effects from the instrumentalization of these experiments as well right so what does it world with truly regenerative medicine look like how do we account for the ability that we can build our bodies back but our minds are perhaps wrestling with the longevity issue and also how does disembodied consciousness appear at other scales throughout the cosmos in systems that we might not have access to how to examine those systems in a way where we can poke at them if they're on different time scales and different spatial scales that we're used to these are huge questions so it's a wide-ranging conversation part three and we'll look forward maybe next year to doing part four we wanted to say a huge thank you to our patrons for being here all year this is our first podcast for the new year it's actually New Year's Day today we're really stoked on the next year we're having our first conference out in Austin Texas we would love to see you there it's gonna be a really close-knit conversation circle we have some incredible speakers lined up you can check out all of those things at the link down in the description and up here and I really hope to meet you guys out there and check out the total solar eclipse which is happening that weekend we also have live stream tickets that are gonna be on sale and right now those are $10 but the price is gonna go up in the next few weeks so get those now on the early sale and it's still affordable and we're gonna be making a big road trip out there and playing music shows along the way so if you are on the path of Oregon to Austin get in touch with us if you want us to play in your town and we will figure out a way to make it happen and as always a huge thank you to our patrons we could not do this without you guys because as you probably well know we live in a society where you you got to make bread to eat bread and we do eat a lot of peanut butter and jelly but this has been a transformative experience because we have been able to build this show on the basis of having an audience that believes in what we're doing and so if you've been listening to the show for a while and you and you want to support us then come on over to patreon.com that link is right here and you can join for just a couple dollars a month and really help us keep the ship going and help us develop it and make it so that we have more in-person conversations so we can go see you in the towns where you're at and not have it just be something that is through the computer screen where everyone is experiencing by themselves all right let's talk to Michael it seems like you're spending a lot of time thinking about this idea of intelligence and the manifestations of intelligence and this the smallest possible unit of what can be said to be intelligent and studying how it evolves and organizes and sorts like there was a paper that was just on on the Reeveson side where you were looking at the way that these different sorting algorithms clustered during evolutionary experiences and I wonder if we could start with a conversation about the minimum unit of intelligence and evolution and behavior because if you can do it with such a simple system then it seems like those principles are being applied actively in the bio about work sure sure yeah I mean the thing is and I have some somewhere on my website I have a video that I made of the word cloud of all our papers from every year and how it's changed from I think 1992 or something all the way and you can watch them change and the thing is that it's not that I've spent more time thinking about this now I always thought about this stuff this was always what I'm interested in but there was a time when that wasn't the right time to talk about any of it and progressively over the years it's become more and more fruitful to start to talk about it because these are topics that go sort of across the grain for a lot of the way that people think about biology and so on and until we had a body of work that really was able to say no look this is a useful way to think about things because it leads to new discoveries right until that had reached a certain level there was no point in becoming out and talking about basal cognition or any of that stuff so so now I think I think we're in an interesting point now where we can actually robustly talk about some of these things yeah and in particular if you want to start with the with the sorting algorithm so so the thing about the sorting algorithms is that there is no evolution there this is purely the standard very few lines of code that a sort of what we're talking six seven lines of code tops that a standard sorting algorithm has and the reason I picked it is because understanding the very minimal system that that exhibits some sort of very kind of basal aspects of intelligence of cognitive behavior of problem-solving and so on is really important because a lot of people have and this includes this includes you know professional neuroscientists and so on they they think that a lot of these kinds of capacities show up fairly late right and so so you know so so Nick Humphreys would put it at birds and mammals for example I could mean really late and I inevitably when I start talking about the symmetries or the invariances that exist in terms of these different capacities across the tree the tree of life across all kinds of weird implementations and so on inevitably the question becomes well what's the smallest piece in other words are you then saying that every rock has hopes and dreams and things I write that that's the question that people ask and so so actually I think it's very important to answer that question to say what do these things look like when they become really minimal right you know what what are the earliest things that or the simplest things that have these properties and so what was cool about the sorting algorithms is that a few things they're well known so people have been you know computer science students have been studying these things for many decades they're completely deterministic there there is no even that there's not even pseudo randomness there they're totally deterministic they're completely transparent you can see all the code the next thing about that as opposed to biology is that if I say look here's a biological system that's doing something new and unexpected someone could say there's a mechanism for you just haven't found it yet it there's always in biology there's always more details to be discovered right and you never know that you've got it all and you probably will never have it all so so but but with these things I can say no look here are the six lines of code like there's nothing else there literally is not no other place for anything to hide that this is it and so then if you have something like that it also has the interesting property that people think they know how it works and what it can do and this is showing up a lot in the current AI debates because people it's not everybody of course there are other people who disagree but but a lot of people are saying well this is just linear algebra we know we made it we know how it works it does you know and people have very strong feelings it can't this and it doesn't that and you know it it there's no there's no way it has whatever interesting thing they think they have as biological creatures because they made it and I want to say that even even these incredibly minimal things where we think we know exactly how they work in these and have very small parts we don't know everything they're capable of there are major surprises and that and that's what we found in this paper now I should also be clear this is a preprint so it's not been peer reviewed so so you know I always like to kind of point out that that's what we're talking about and so can we go into some of the details about what is the system that these algorithms are inside of in the behavior that you see yeah so so the things that we're looking for we're looking for the two two main things number one we're looking for what I call basal intelligence which which I define as the ability to solve problems and get to the same outcome by different means this is William James's definition of intelligence you know same goal by different means and in particular there's one very particular thing that we looked for and found which I call delayed gratification and it's the idea and in fact William James talks about this imagine imagine two magnets and you know they're trying to get together and you put a piece of wood between them that's it right what the magnet is never going to do is go around and the wood and get to where it wants to go because because that would temporarily actually take it further away from its goal right the energy the free energy would actually rise as and they can't do that all they do is they go down the gradient if you have an animal or certain kinds of self-driving vehicles or in James's example Romeo and Juliet right facing all kinds of physical and social barriers they have all kinds of tools to do this they understand delayed gratification they know that temporarily you might have to go away from your goal in order to reach it later and and so that's a kind of metric of cognitive sophistication right but but the ability to do it at all is already something so so one thing one thing that I would that we were looking for is the ability to to do that kind of problem-solving or delay gratification the second thing we were looking for is unexpected unexpected goals and when I say goals I don't mean human level metacognitive goals like I know what my goal is I don't mean that I mean very simple cybernetic goals which are states that you spend energy to try to achieve and if somebody sort of pulls you away from it you'll you know you'll you'll you'll continue to try to get there in some kind of way so those are those are the those are the two things that we were looking for and so so let's just go from the beginning what do these sorting algorithms do all the ideas that you start with a with an array of numbers these are random random numbers they're there you know let's say from one to a hundred you have a hundred numbers and they're shuffled they're all randomly distributed so the sort of the job of the sorting algorithm is we're gonna crank through this algorithm we're gonna we're gonna look at what the numbers and we're gonna follow a very simple recipe and by the end of it all of them are gonna be in order that's all it's gonna do it's gonna arrange the numbers in order it's a very short algorithm now the main way that it works is there's a there's a centralized kind of top-down mind that or in this case a computer that knows the algorithm and is just sitting there rearranging the numbers and there are many different sorting algorithms is bubble sort selection sort whatever we made we made two small modifications to allow us to ask all of these interesting questions and by the way what the the other thing we did is to visualize that process as a walk in a navigation in a certain space in other words a walk in sorting space so you start out over here and in many potential configurations where all the numbers are shuffled but everybody's got to get to one particular point which is when all the numbers are in place and it's guaranteed these sorting algorithms are guaranteed to eventually get you there right it might take a while depending on the length of the stream but they all get there so they all sort of walk around and they get to this they get to this one spot okay so and that's that's what we're interested in in terms of intelligence we're interested in ability to navigate in some kind of problem space so we so we made two changes number one so we made this a little more biological instead of having a top-down controller that sees all the numbers and is following one algorithm and doing its thing we made it distributed and bottom up meaning that we gave each each each number we call them cells now in each cell has a has associated with a certain number they all have their own tiny little agency and all they know how to do is look around and they have preferences about their neighbors so if you're a five what you would like to have is a four on your left and a six on your right that that's it so instead of and but you're going to follow that same algorithm so you've got you've got the algorithm but now every single cell is following the algorithm it's not top-down you know omniscient single agent that's sorting them but every cell has its own little little preferences right so that's very biological because in biology you're dealing with an agential material where every cell has local local knowledge local preferences and so on but we don't add anything new so there's no memory we don't we don't give them all kinds of complex all they have is that same original algorithm it's just they can't see the whole string all they see is some some distance away all they see is local so it's we haven't added anything we've just sort of distributed it out and and by the way the first amazing result of the paper is that that actually works when you do that you still get sorted numbers so so if you break the if when nobody nobody knows what all the numbers are you can still get them sorted that's kind of cool so so that kind of distributed source so that's that's the first thing then then we added something else which is very biological and is really the key to testing this intelligence which is that we stepped away from the notion of a of an infallible algorithm in other words normally when you do the algorithm you assume that it works in other words when i say swap the the the five and the seven you assume that they in fact get swapped we introduce a notion of an unreliable medium the algorithm might say you want to swap one of the cells could be broken it could be damaged maybe it can't be moved maybe it can't initiate moves so so we introduce this notion of a frozen cell now notice that in the traditional algorithm there is no notion of hey did my did the operation succeed how am i doing what what am i actually uh you know am i going in the right direction nothing the algorithm doesn't have any of that all it has is a set of steps and you sort of blindly take those steps and that's it so so you see this is a super minimal system uh initially you would look at and you would say well there is no machinery here for any any of the things you want to find there's no machinery here for dealing with broken cells there's no machinery here for delayed gratification there's no sense of how am i doing or what path am i taking through that space not none of that is there and that's why i i like this system so much because it shows us that even in scenarios where you you think you know what's there and what it does you can you can be significantly surprised so so here's what we found here here are surprised first of all we found that if if you do introduce these broken cells which can't move and then you track the progress of the sorting algorithm across the space you find out that in fact what it does know how to do is delay gratification it knows how to go backwards which means in this case un-sort the string a little and in order to have gains later on that that's an amazing thing because that is not in the algorithm if you look at the actual algorithm there's nothing in there like that you don't see you don't see that so so that already starting to tell you that that there are competencies that are not obvious from looking at the material so that's the first thing and then we were able to do something else because you know in the traditional way of doing this there's one single algorithm that's sorting the whole string right you're you're sort of god looking at it from the top down and you're following selection sort or insertion sort or whatever it's going to be and you're moving whatever you need to move around to get them sorted in this case everything's bottom up every cell has its own uh is following its own algorithm so we were able to do something something very unusual which in fact we do in the biology too we made a chimera and that is a mix of cells where some cells are following one algorithm but other cells are following another algorithm and for example our our frog allotle is a chimera when you take cells from a frog embryo and you take cells from an axolotl embryo they have different local rules that they're going to follow because one's going to make a frog one's going to make an axolotl but you can put them together in a single organism you can ask what happens right so we did that here we we um we mixed two two algorithms in the same string now the way you do it is you when that um as you assign them randomly so we have a bunch of random numbers and each one gets a random assignment you're either you're either going to follow selection sort or you're going to follow a bubble sort something like that right and it's and it's random it's mixed up you can think about that as the genetic sort of right it's the thing that determines your policy of action it determines what you're going to do and there's two different there's two different kinds um again surprise the first the first kind of interesting thing is that that works in other words you don't need to both have the same uh journey through that space in order to get to where it's going and so you can have a chimera string that still gets sorted even though half of it's following one set of rules and half of it's following another okay that's cool then we asked that we asked a really wild question which is if you if you look at the string in the middle of the process what's the distribution of the of the cells that are following the two different algorithms like where do they hang out in the string now now here's what we know we know that at the very beginning it's going to be random so so let's define a notion of clustering which is just this I look to my left I look to my right and I ask what are the odds that the that the guy sitting next to me is using exactly the same algorithm as I am we call it we defined a new a new term um Adam Goldstein came up with this he calls it an algotype like you have genotype phenotype so algotype right and so and so okay so clustering is just I look to my left I look to my right what's the odds that my neighbor is the same algotype as me we know that in the beginning it's 50% because they're random we assign them randomly we also know that at the end it's also going to be 50% because at the end everybody's got to be sorted according to their number but the algotypes who are signed randomly they weren't assigned according to number so that means if we really if we sort you on the number the other types are gonna be of course just like at the beginning they'll be all over the place they're gonna be 50 50 what happens in the middle and this is the amazing part what happens in the middle is that what the curve so so so 50 it's clamped at 50 50 but in the middle it kind of goes like this so what happens is that in between the sorting process cells with the same algotype like to hang out together they spend a bunch of time in these clusters where we are all the same type of we're all following the same procedure but then they inevitably get dragged apart you know I sometimes joke that this is like a it's a minimal model of the human condition of you know for any living being like for a period of time in your life you get to do some things that are against the general trend of the physics of your world but eventually you all end up in the same place right it's like this really minimal minimal way you have you have a period of time where you get to do some things that you want but eventually the inevitable physics of your universe sort of grinds you down right that's that's like like a minimal model of our of our existential state so what's what's amazing about it is that again nowhere in the algorithm does it say I know what algotype I am or how you find that out nowhere in the algorithm does it talk about checking the algotype of your neighbors none of that is there it's completely emergent and it's not just emergent complexity the way that you know fractals are an emergent complexity the game of life cellular automata emergent complexity from very simple rules is not just that it's what one step beyond that it's actually in the case of the the the delay gratification it's emergent competencies and in the case of the the clustering or hanging out together it's some sort of it's some sort of emergent computational goal that you as the programmer did not put in there this is a very simple system that has goals and competencies that you did not put in there even though you wrote the algorithm the algorithm is deterministic it's small and transparent and you know this is I this is why I think it's significant because if if that's the case in these little things when people say they think they know what you know various AI architectures do or various you know collective swarm robotics or swarm you know various things like that I mean I I think there are so many surprises in store for us that we really need to develop a science of guessing guessing these kind of emerging goals and so this so the last thing I want to say is that this takes us back to your point at the very beginning that okay so what does this have to do with the various biobots because much like with with these with these algorithms when when we make novel biologicals where the answer to well what what are going to be its goals all while have a you know long history of of a selection but determined well they don't have a long history of selection they've never been here before these biobots there was never a selection to be a good zanibot or a good anthropobot so how do you know what the goals are going to be where do they come from right so that I think is the is the emergence of a new science of figuring out the novel goals of systems where you cannot say that evolution is what did it and that's I think that's going to be really important for us as a species going forward I love that we have this really straightforward experiment that's so simplified available to be able to consider the larger implications and so I want to spend a little bit more time really understanding the dynamics that emerge from it and so when you say that these algorithms in the midpoint cluster according to type do you have a sense for why that is yeah um why it why is interesting because we have to think about what kind of answer we're looking for so on the one hand and this is also true in biology there's no magic here I'm not saying that these things are doing anything that isn't allowed by the by the algorithm if you were to track the data flow you would say well this is perfectly consistent with the algorithm there's nothing to see here which is exactly what some people do for biology they look at you and your brain and they say well this is just chemistry this is just just electrons moving around there's nothing there's nothing special here right if you if you insist on the lowest level of description that is all that's all you're ever going to see and that's it's not false it's just a very limiting world view um on the other hand if you if you if you take a step back and you ask yeah but knowing what you know about the algorithm why why didn't you predict that that was going to happen yeah and this is this is kind of my my my thing about a lot of biology is that after the fact after somebody has done something interesting and shows you a new phenomenon you've never seen before it's very easy to go back and look at the micro details and say yep no miracles here therefore all good like we can explain it you know yeah you can always track down the the steps that you took but unless you had a theory that actually told you in advance that this was going to happen in other words you know not not just explanation looking backwards but invention looking forwards then then you then you're missing something and so now so so what we're missing in this case is a system that would have allowed us to say ahead of time oh i know that's what your algorithm says but i can see what's going to happen here these guys are going to want to travel together right that's that's what we're that's what we're looking for and and do i have that theory no although um i will um i'll propose a hypothesis which which we're going to test soon um the hypothesis is this uh based on uh kind of carl friston's framework of surprise minimization um chris fields and i had this had this paper a few years ago now on why it is basically he calls it an imperial model of multi-cellularity the idea goes like this why why would cells want to get together right and and one way to think about this is that well if every cell doesn't like to be surprised let's face it if you're a living thing and you're constantly getting surprised you're not going to last very long so so everything is is trying to minimize uh minimize surprise well one of the least surprising things out there is you so what might be nice is to make some copies of yourself and put them around you to make a sort of like stem cell niche kind of thing where the cells on the outside are frontline infantry they're facing the uncertainty of the outside world the cell on the inside is protected and has a very consistent environment because everything it's dealing with is basically a copy of itself so um that's our idea so that that was our idea and so so so uh following this firstonian paradigm what you really want are neighbors that are predictable well how will they be predictable well they could be like you if they're like you they're they're they're pretty predictable so my gut feeling is that that's what's going on here i suspect that this is a primitive version a very early version of of surprise minimization that the reason they're traveling together is uh because they're trying to minimize joint free energy or some such thing i'm sure carl would would say it much more much more elegantly but but i think that's probably what's going on here they're they're traveling together for as long as they can because it minimizes their uncertainty about their environment and we again notice that they don't have any explicit mechanism for this there's nothing in the algorithm that says uh you know make a prediction to compare it to your reward model that there's nothing in there it's it's it's emergent although this is emergent and i think it's consistent with carl and chris and and other people when they apply this active inference framework to particles you know they apply it to things that do not have explicit mechanisms and we knew this from a long time ago when you do um some kind of a least action model and you say hey look this beam of light gets to where it picks the path where it loses the you know the least amount of of effort right and you say yeah but how does that work it doesn't have any mechanisms inside to compute all the paths and right it doesn't have explicit mechanisms for it but i think this is what we're learning is that you don't need explicit mechanisms to do some of this stuff that's and i think that's really important well there's an aspect of with you know the path of least resistance for light which i imagine has to do with like permissivity which is that if you're traveling through a field where there's a bunch of different potential paths one path will have less resistance than a different path and so you fall and that that's i've realized that you know physics doesn't necessarily have a material model for light like it's field but i think that there is probably a material property of of the substances that it's traveling through that that affects it like one atom will transmit light more easily than a different atom and so when i think about the sorting algorithms my first thought is algorithms take different amounts of time to run right and so do you think that there's an aspect of time that is important here where you have the information of a of one sorting algorithm is more quickly accessible than the information of let's say another and so they're running on different time scales and so at the beginning when they're sorting they're sorting relative to which neighbor has a an answer that matches the time scale of the cell itself does that make sense yeah it does um yeah it's an interesting it's it's definitely an interesting point i mean the thing just to go back and and i'm not a physicist so i don't want to get like too deep into this and say something stupid but my understanding of the the least what's cool about the least action business is that you're right of course the different paths of different permissivities but in order to pick the right path in some sense you have to try them all out right you don't know that you're on the least path until unless you have some information about all of them and and so and so that that kind of non-locality i i think i think in in our case in the case of the the algorithms there could well be a time component because in order to know whether your neighbor is like you or not you need to spend some time with them so so one of the things we're doing now is tracking their life histories to figure out things like well how much time do you need to spend next to someone before you decide that hey they're like me or they're not like me and i think that um uh the active inference framework is going to make some clear predictions about that you know in terms of i'm just just in general bayesian you know reasoning is going to just going to tell you like how many experiences do you need to have with someone before you know whether their policies are surprising to you or not right um again underlying the underlining the idea that none of this is explicit these things don't have the the algorithms don't have explicit code for doing any of that but we can track it from from you know from observations so so stay tuned this is this is super super early still um but i do think it's interesting that i'm gonna i'm gonna have a discussion with uh with carlin also mark solans about this because you know it has this it to me anyway maybe maybe they'll tell me this is nonsense but to me it has this weird um resonance with uh this idea of of conscious and unconscious drives right we tell stories about why we did things and you sort of have this like logical thatcher algorithm those like i well i did it because xyz but it turns out that actually there may be some underlying pattern that isn't apparent to you at all and may or may not be apparent to somebody else who's a different observer may you know maybe an analyst a psychoanalyst or whatever who's looking and say yeah well you think that's what you did and in that local you know in that situation that story kind of makes sense but look at the bigger pattern if you look at the bigger pattern you find out that actually you tend to xyz right and so i just wonder whether this is also a really minimal model of how we understand implicit goals which are there directly in whatever um algorithm you're following uh sorry those would be explicit goals and then and then there are some implicit goals that you're following and i have no idea where those come from right and that's i think that's an exciting area for the futures to figure out where they come i'm curious about the instrumentalization of this because it seems well is is that the goal of studying these systems is so that perhaps you can program these bio bots eventually to towards some end and then if that is the case is it ideal for the bio bots to be intelligent like would you really want them choosing their own goals or making decisions um perhaps it is but but it's it's a bit hazy for me how that would be useful um yeah yeah that's a that's a great point well well the first let's just let's just start off here uh if they if in fact they do have their own goals we would love to know about that before we use them in some particular context right and this is true with bots it's true with bacteria with CAR T cells with swarm robotics with the internet of things with financial institutions with social structures if these things are going to have goals beyond what we think of when we built them we need to know about it right so whether you whether you want them to have goals or not they may or may not so you need to know so it seems like the the on the spot developments of goals right the changing of goals is i guess more what i was concerned about you know if they decide well we had this goal before but now we're now we've changed our minds so to speak yeah yeah second order right second order goals you know choosing your own goals again i don't know that that and by the way i've made no claims that either the answer or either either the bots or the algorithms do that all we've done so far is find some goals they have that we don't didn't know about we i've made no claims that they have the second order ability to choose their goals but if that's true we need to know right whether that's whether that's true or not so that's that's the first step now why now let's answer the other question why do you want them to have goals well imagine um think of uh the the spectrum of of intelligence all the way from very simple machines that do very specific things and they're sort of you know whatever else happens they're just going to do the same thing over again all the way through various cybernetics creations that have goal directed abilities and then some animals that can be trained and then some humans that can set their own goals to some extent and so on um think about think about medicine you know biomedicine uh where do our interventions fit on that scale right now almost all of with with only a couple interesting examples all of our interventions are way on the left side of that spectrum they're extremely simple mechanical things drugs for example right so typical drugs they just do what they do they're not context sensitive if they're binding something they're going to bind it and that's it and whether that's good for you or bad for you and this is why we're having massive divergence of efficacy and side effects in people because they just do what they do imagine if we could get beyond that and we could have interventions that are higher agency interventions where you could push some of the complexity onto the reagent such that it would have some and so so now the obvious thing that people think about here are like smart insulin pumps right they don't just sort of pump out you know they have a little bit of sensing and they kind of know what's going on right so smart insulin pumps um I think our example which I think we talked about last time of HCN2 which is this ion channel that we use to repair various birth defects that's a step in this direction because that that the drugs that open that channel are they act in a context sensitive way that's what allows them to fix very complex structures like brain face heart and gut it's not because they do the same thing no matter what they're actually trying to do a very particular thing which is to increase voltage depending on what's going on in the environment increase the difference in voltage the sharpen the boundaries so that's that's already a step up and I think that what what the opportunity here is with the for specifically with the antherobots and we could talk about what they do and why is we can take advantage of the various competencies of parts of your own body in this case these are tracheal cells from the same patient to do complex things that we have no idea how to how to force in medicine so we could take advantage of the intelligence of your own cells to heal things and to do sensing in both directions of the push meaning meaning to to heal and to improve and then to to read which is the the sensing side you know these cells probably know more about each other than we even know to ask questions about nevermind have sensors for and so I think having these kind of reagents that actually do have a processing they have you know signal detection amplification memory decision making readouts all of these things that are part of a a a simple cognitive system you you want your your medical intervention to have that because then you can do things that we couldn't possibly micromanage and the thing that we found the antherobots could do which is just mind-boggling to me is that if you if you put them on a on a on a scratch that you've made in the two-dimensional culture of neurons so you take human pluripotent stem cell derived neurons you grow a lawn of them on a on a on a petri dish you scratch you put a scratch through it that's that's you know so when people use that as a simple model of wound healing it's a scratch scratch assay you put down these antherobots and what they'll do is over a few days they'll they'll take the edges of that wound and they'll knit the they'll knit the neurons together now who knew who could have said that um the cells of your trachea which normally sit there quietly for whatever 80 plus years that if you that if you let them go and let them reboot their life they can actually run around on their own and find neural wounds to heal and who knows what else i mean that was just the first thing you try it who knows what else what else they know how to do like that's that's a competency of these cells that we had no idea about and again it's that sort of thing where uh i'm sure somebody reading that paper could say well uh there must be some pro you know pro neural molecule that they're putting out and i'm sure we'll find it yeah no sure of course there's going to be a physical explanation for it's not going to be magic there's going to be there's going to be some after the fact there's going to be some explanation for it which we are of course investigating but how come no theory predicted that ahead of time how come we didn't know to expect that that's what i think is much more interesting it's easy to tell stories afterwards the question is you know uh yeah how you know what what what what models what models in world used you have to get you to do the experiment in the first place and so that being the first thing we tried my my i don't think you know we should be playing the lottery every day it's we're not the luckiest people in the world i think what this is telling us is that they have tons of unexpected capacities and we're going to be of course looking for these is naming them bots ambitious or because it seems like you're you want to have control over their behavior that's the way i think about robots anyways i'm not a robotic scientist or anything but do you is that the ultimate goal is to tell them exactly what part of the dish to go to or what which of the cuts to heal perhaps something like that and and what what's the road to that yeah um well first first let's just talk about the terminology for a moment yeah um it's it's certainly true that we could have just called them organoids uh but but the thing with organoids is that organoids are typically the perp so so here's what i think words are for and and nomenclature is for i think words are um just protocols for for interacting with something so so when you name something what you're doing is facilitating or preventing ways to interact with it so if you call it a if you call something an organoid what you're really saying is i'm focused on making this as uh as as best of a model of the of the real organ as possible i want it to be exact i'm going to screen drugs on it i'm going to you know study airway biology i want it to be a little model of a lung that's what i want by calling it bot what i'm saying is yes all that and there are plenty of people who have made airway organoids and and and so on but actually there's much more here to do because because you can we can in fact in the future program them and this this came up when we were doing the zenobots people said why are you calling them zenobots i mean developmental biologists who who study amphibian embryos have seen ciliated epithelium for decades we call them animal caps these are just animal caps why why do you need a new word for and i couldn't say it at the time because this stuff was was not published but the point is yeah and if you call them animal caps you'll never make an anthrabot because because why would you because if because that's an amphibian specific embryonic thing why would you take an adult human trachea that you wouldn't get there and so words have real power they they they tell you how you're thinking about something and they facilitate once you once you call them bots you say well bots can be made out of a lot of things maybe it's not just a frog thing maybe we could make this out of out of human cells right and so they facilitate so that's what i'm interested in is terminology that facilitates research programs and um and so and so yeah so the future is definitely to program them in in various ways uh much like with the zenobots you know the first three zenobot papers were basically just studying the native properties of these things and so i mean you dug did some super cool stuff about sculpting them and and and so on but the thing is uh what what what i really want to do is focus on surprising native capacities because if the first thing we did was knock in a bunch of synthetic biology circuits people would say ah well but you've engineered the heck out of them so yes of course they do whatever you made them do and that's fine i want to say we've we've in the in the case of the anthrabots we've done almost nothing to them right we've so so gizem came up with it with a with a protocol to to get them to to grow from a single cell and then turn inside out so that the cilia are on the outside surface and all that but but we didn't do anything to make them heal uh neural wounds they already do that and and that that i think is really valuable because yes of course we'll get to programming them and this means giving them all sorts of stimuli when they're assembling and it means putting in different cell types perhaps and it means training them maybe so we haven't we haven't shown that yet but we're working on that both with them and with the zenobots uh can they be trained can they be you know what native preferences do they have all that kind of stuff um that that will all come but but what i think is really critical much like what the algorithms is to say we thought we knew what tracheal epithelium does and we thought we knew what organoids are for and look there's a lot more to it than that yeah that make that clears it up a lot it's interesting that in some sense that golf between doing what you want and doing what they want is both dangerous and exciting and it it seems like there's a lot of crossover with the ai world because a lot of people are very concerned with that valley between the two now do you have conversations with ai engineers about the similarities and what you're finding yeah yeah um yes and and there's some uh there's some fun that twitter threads are about it too um uh and and we have you know about probably a quarter of my group is uh uh computational machine learning expert so we certainly you know we certainly think about that stuff a lot um yeah i i think i think the main limiting factor in a lot of these discussions is that they take place in a vacuum that neglects the wider context of diverse intelligence i mean people people well first of all first of all this this this focus on specifically language models and things like that it that's like a tiny corner of what's actually coming right diverse intelligence is gonna be so much more challenging and interesting than than than just what we have now and that's really important i think a lot of people are not not i'm not getting it and also you know a lot of people are saying things like it's it's intelligent like us and therefore it's dangerous there are plenty things that are incredibly dangerous that are not intelligent like us you don't need to be super intelligent to be extremely dangerous you don't need to be like us to be intelligent like there are all kinds of leaps here that people tend to make that i think are not warranted but just um just in general like a real uh understanding of the fact that intelligence can be uh expressed in unfamiliar guises and some and some humility around like how bad we really are at recognizing other other forms of it you know besides what we're used to would be what i would be i think really useful and essential i think it's an existential need for us going forward if we're going to survive with the antherbots and the xenobots both they're derived from organisms that have immune systems and the action of cells migrating to a place where there is a wound seems really immune like to me do you think that there is a significant relationship between those two functions where there is a certain drive inside the body to produce cells that will heal that is encoded somehow in the substrate genetically where it's like once you liberate a cell from its context there's some sort of other deeper level programming which is like okay my job now that i'm free since i'm not a cancer cell is to do the the opposite of proliferate and is in fact to go into fix yeah um that's a very interesting hypothesis i mean these are uh epithelial cells are not specifically immune cells and in the in normally in the body they don't do any of that they just sit quietly basically but but i like i like where you're going with this and i think that one advantage that these things have over other kinds of um robotics that we might make or drugs or various other things is that they probably share with us the priors about what it's like to be healthy about about what's good about being a being because not only are they mammals not only are they human not only but but they're also your own cells so it's entirely plausible to me now we haven't proven any of this i want to be super clear we don't know that they home to wounds we don't know what they can recognize you know we don't know any of that um but it's very plausible to me that they share with us this notion of what damages and what repair is um yeah this this this may be you know this may be something that that is really uh advantageous about this technology you know is that you don't have to teach them what's good and bad about being a multicellular organism and from from what i read of the antherbot's paper the way that you're generating these cells is that you take them you grow them in an extracellular matrix that's three-dimensional from single cells and then you put them into what you call it a low viscosity medium and in the low viscosity medium you see these changes occur and the changes are like you said pretty stark so you have these these cells that normally would be ciliated on the interior of the cells you turn them so that they're ciliated on the outside and so all of a sudden you have this motile collection of cells and i wonder if you have looked to see what the actual changes are inside of the cell that permits this kind of new organization as a consequence of the different growth conditions yeah um no we we don't know the details yet it's the change is a multicellular in other words it's not an individual cell that does much of anything it's the whole thing turns itself inside out so you start with a ball where the cili are pointing into the center of the ball and then then the whole thing just turns inside out when when we wash it out of the out of the matrix it turns inside out now what exactly does that we we don't know my gut feeling is that there are going to be some pathways looking that that probably would look like embryonic gastrulation and some things like that i'm going to guess it's probably reusing some of that that's a total guess we don't know yeah the answer is we don't know but embryonic gastrulation to me is a almost quasi stem cell property where it's where stem cells probably the wrong the wrong word to use but there's early development like early development like they aren't differentiated to their context yet and so do you think that it's just a property of cells that once you take them out of the context of the body where they have grown used to being and now you put them into this matrix where they have to recontextualize themselves that this is an opportunity for them to to kind of redesign their own their own relationship to the environment suddenly that's that that is a yeah that's a great point uh what this is all currently under investigation uh do they think they're recapitulating some kind of embryogenesis we we don't know so so the xenobots for example the normal xenobot lives for about a week but we've been able to if if you feed them and keep them ridiculously clean they can go longer and they will go uh i think our record is like 84 days or something and during those weeks it changes shape it changes shape it becomes transparent it it does some other stuff and uh i don't know is that is that some new developmental sequence that you know that normally no no one ever does um yeah we you know we we don't know and the same thing with the anthrobots like like is this uh is this a developmental sequence basically for this it does it think it's an embryo we're gonna find out we're doing all the you know we're we're characterizing all the new genes that they express both the xenobot and the anthrobot side uh yeah we're gonna we're gonna find out but we don't know yet there was a there was a science fiction story i want to say it was arthur clark but maybe not uh a long time ago where um they cracked uh aging and so people started living longer and what they found out was that at around 120 humans undergo all these changes it's just you've never seen it before because nobody ever lived that long and so you know they start growing a third like a new set of teeth and all this stuff and i think i think at the end what i think they they grew wings and look like angels i forget what it was but but it was the point where yes actually there was this new developmental stage it's just you know what you we had didn't access it before but but so so maybe this is like that maybe these these things have a new a new developmental sequence that they can do i don't know it seems like uh when i think about the major health crises let's say the threats in most people's lives assuming they don't die from an accident or something it's cancer and heart disease and those are very different bioengineering projects one where you're in the case of cancer perhaps trying to teach cells how to behave themselves again something like that i mean i suppose the approach right now is to just destroy them but i i i suppose ultimately you would want your bots to be teachers in a sense and perhaps it's similar with with cardiovascular disease as well but that seems like more of a a repair in the wound healing sense uh perhaps a cleanup job is there some uh well do you think about this in terms of the bots in terms of what their ultimate functionality will be in terms of maybe not simply joining or or obeying some specific program goal but in terms of teaching and interacting with their new environments and re-instructing them and what yeah what is the future of that look like in your mind yeah i think that uh there's a there's a few there's a few different uh use cases for the bots the most the most obvious things are we're going to make useful synthetic living machines for specific purposes so maybe they drop off pro regenerative molecules maybe they clean up cancer cells maybe they scrape the plaque off your artery walls maybe they they clean up arthritic knee joints they repair you know retina or spinal cord we like very specific things so so we'll be some of that i i think bigger picture what both they and the xenobots are are a kind of uh platform in which we get to learn to control morphogenesis so so cracking the code the mapping between the experiences you received as a cell and the pattern that a group of you are going to build because if we solve that that's it that's a completely different path to regenerative medicine that has nothing to do with the bots per se in other words at some point we're going to know how to grow a new heart how to grow new limbs how to grow new organs why you know and and and the stuff what we're working on right now in the lab which is trying to understand why do they forget why do tissues forget what the correct pattern is why does everything fall apart after some number of decades right so so using the bots as a kind of sandbox platform to understand how do collections of cells make decisions about what they're going to do so that's kind of that's kind of the second thing and then there's this is more philosophical stuff but but but for biomedicine right there are the direct use cases and then there's the bigger picture of you know what we really want is complete control over growth and form that's that's what we really do do you imagine that to be like an in situ process at the end of the day or is it ex vivo are you going to be growing the do you imagine these medical technicians i don't know how many years from now are growing these externally and replacing diseased organs or is it more something that's happening inside of the body like you're actually you know in the sense reprogramming your body or giving it the external environment that needs in order to regenerate itself it seems like two very different approaches yeah i think i think uh long term it's all going to be in situ and uh in in the meantime are we going to crack the uh ex vivo morphogenesis and transplant before we crack the in vivo stuff i'm not sure i'm not sure uh down the line it's it's it's all going to be it's all going to be in vivo but maybe maybe maybe the uh the bioengineered organs will get cracked first i'm not sure that seems to be the more traditional approach as far as i can tell you know we are we're already doing organ transplants with varying levels of success um obviously the huge advantage here is just that you have ideally your own cells right or something that matches and you don't have the horrible immune problems with the transplantation yeah um i mean so you could argue both ways on the one hand you could say well uh just just growing a specific or a single specific organ should be easier and then we'll just pop it in maybe but but look at look at for example the case so so back in 2010 or so we show that there's a particular um bioelectric pattern that causes frog embryos to make new eyes in weird locations when your eyes on the gut on the tail whatever um we are nowhere near being able to bioengineer and grow an eye in in vitro right i mean so so so people have shown like if you explained the eye progenitor cells and you sort of leave them alone they can make an optic cup and some things like that but but it's not that it's not that we knew how to how to engineer an eye eyes are very complex they have lots of different tissue types what we simply did was to take advantage of the competency of the material meaning the cells of the in vivo they they they know how to make an eye they they've already done it twice they they certainly have all that information what you need to be able to do is convince them to do it again somewhere else and so if you look at this problem as can i micromanage the cells to be an organ you know using traditional bioengineering maybe we make a bladder maybe we make you know ears are not hard we can make things where we can make a scaffold we see a bunch of cells on tops maybe 3d print some things maybe you know you might think that's the way to go but i actually think the easier way to do it is not to try to control any of that it's to convince the collective what you want them to build and just do that in vivo where the surrounding material is is basically much smarter than we are about how it's done so i'm not sure i we'll see how we will see how it goes there's a really interesting aspect of this where if you can reprogram an embryo to grow eyes in places where you wouldn't expect eyes okay so there's two places where my mind immediately goes number one there's a certain permissivity of the embryo where the entire context of the being is that okay we are in the process we are we are we are creating the structure we get instructions we make it and then we get to a place where we cease our differentiation and the structures are more or less fixed and they get repaired in place and so one question and you can you can go either way with us is a do you think that once the structures are fixed you have a completely different problem where you would then have to inflict some kind of damage in order to get them to regenerate and number two which is kind of orthogonal is the eyes that form in places where you don't expect are they then wired into the brain in the way that you would expect yeah let me let me do the first one and then remind me of the second one because i'll forget by the time i'm done the first thing i want to say which is which is kind of a cool point it has to do with the permissivity or the competency so and this is something that one of these things that i couldn't you know say back in 2010 but now now that we're talking about development as a as a collective intelligence process now we can start to think about it this way if you look in the developmental biology textbook they will tell you that only in the frog only the anterior norectoderm so the stuff you know basically from here up is competent to be i and it's that's the only stuff that can make i and the reason is because if you prompt it with what they call the master i gene which is this thing called pack six then yeah that those are the only regions that ever make i but it turns out that actually that limited competency and developmental biology competency is a narrow definition which is what it's able to make i use it more broadly but more generically the competency of your material is opaque to you unless you probe it with the correct prompt we need to and this is you know when people say aw it can't do this you know this this doesn't do that whenever you're making an assessment and an assessment of intelligence in some system you are basically taking an IQ test yourself as an external observer you are saying this is what i have noticed how to make it do that doesn't mean that's all it knows how to do that's just what you know so so in this is a great case for that because actually it turns out that if you go to the bioelectric level no i have almost any cell in as far as we can tell any region in the in the tadpole is it is competent to do this we just didn't know that because we were using the wrong prompt and so and so this should all of this everything we've talked about should really fill us with significant humility about about what we know about the material that we're working with you don't necessarily know if you know i've i don't know if you've ever seen these things i've got pictures of them on my blog and and a couple of papers um these these plant galls you know these amazing just about to ask about that because they create these insane structures prompted by the presence of like wasps and bugs that move inside the leaves yeah and and if you didn't know that if you didn't have that example you would never in a million years say that the that the oak genome could make this red spiky brown thing you would say no it makes a flat green leaf and and it takes a living bioengineer who as dan then it would say you know competency without comprehension uh is able to to prompt the leaf to do this crazy to build this crazy thing you would never know it knows how to do that so um that's uh you know that that's the important thing is that we really need to understand the competency of our material and what what we're working with and i i actually don't think that adulthood is when all of that ceases there's a there's a there's a ship a thesis thing going on here which is that in a standard body right cells and materials are coming and going all the time and you need to be able to um it's this thing like uh like like in allison wonderland where you uh you have to work really hard to stay in one place you you in order to maintain a body you can't just say well okay now i don't need this information i you know i'm just gonna hang out you will not last very long um and and i think there probably are insects in other organisms that that you know that live a day or a couple of days where that's where that's true but typically if you want to persist you have to continuously re repair remodel replace and and and so on and um so so i think uh the only thing that happens during uh during maturation is that the scale of those projects gets smaller so instead of re shaping the whole embryo during neuralation and gastrulation all that you're now saying okay well these few cells are gone how do i maintain the integrity of my epithelium and things like that right so but but i think i think that process of of homeostasis anatomical homeostasis which which i am really into is uh continues your your whole life and and without that process uh i in fact that's what i think aging is is a is a a defect in that process it's just it's basically a you know i think i think aging is a version of failure to regenerate it's a which and development is basically just a set of regenerative repairs from each embryonic stage to the next stage i think all of this boils down to regenerative remodeling which boils down to homeostasis humans can't really grow gauze though sorry say again i said humans can't really grow gauze though which is we don't know that we don't know that you know sure sure i guess i guess the only thing that i'm saying is that if i think about the various human diseases right because if if there's a parallel between okay oak gall would you say that that's a disease no no i don't think no i don't think it's a disease i think it's uh now now there are there are virus induced galls that uh that screw up cells and so on so and those those are basically featureless lumps they're kind of like a tumor but maybe you can say that's a disease a standard one of these galls i mean from the perspective of the plant it might be a disease but i i think it's morphogenetic hacking i think i think all you've done is you've with the what the wasp has done is to um hack the material to go to undertake a different journey in morpheus space and i don't think that's i don't think that's it that that that that's a disease do we have any sense of what's the different morphological purpose is like why does one wasp make one gall another wasp make another gall um i do not know there are people who study this so so um uh insect ecologists and uh and such there are a couple of folks that i'm in touch with that study that kind of stuff i i don't know uh for me the interesting thing is the space of the possible and how little so so if you think about this giant multi-dimensional uh anatomical morpheus space which holds all the different shapes that things can be normal standard reliable development gives you one pointless tiny little keyhole into that space and all you see is the embryo and the normal thing that it builds and then sometimes you have what they call developmental plasticity and look this plant can have two different shapes depending on if it's a dry environment or a wet okay so so instead of a single point you see kind of like a little little halo or up through your keyhole but through that keyhole is a giant space of possibilities that we are still very bad at mapping out and what i think these uh all the synthetic stuff that antherobots the xenobots other other things that people the goo galls other things that people build are all vehicles for exploring that space they let you they let you take that little keyhole and like like stick your head in and look around like a like a periscope and and look around and say here are the other possibilities you know and and what human cells can do uh well we didn't think they made antherobots until you know we did it a few years ago so i don't know my guess is i so so so the way to um uh kind of uh uh just just drill down on on that question is uh are there any limits so people ask is there any limit to what a given cell can build and some people say yeah they're called developmental constraints there are things that the i'm not sure i believe in developmental constraints i i think that in a given context there are limits to what it's going to do does that mean that if you knew what you were doing you couldn't prompt it to do something completely different no i i think um and and again this is conjecture on my part but here's here's here's what i think um that basically there are going to be like like for example if you have planaria if planaria don't have genes to make bone you know the the the hard minerals and all that okay you're not you're not going to get them to to you know to to make bone because if the if the hardware isn't there it isn't there but beyond that in terms of shape i'm not sure there are any limits i i don't i i just i you know i think in the end um except for materials limits and the laws of physics i don't believe there's going to be any limitations on what shape you could build i guess this ties back to the question of whether or not the eyes are tied into the brain right because if you have a crazy body plan and all of a sudden your like elementary canal is all screwed up and you're just dumping waste into your internal cavity you're gonna have a bad time yeah so uh yeah um i'm glad you remember that um okay i'm i'm not gonna say that there aren't ways to screw things up because absolutely there are and uh the competency of regulative development that fixes all these problems is not infinite and there's many ways to screw up an embryo for sure for sure but this is some work that um Doug Blackiston in my group did same same person who did all the zen the zen about biology um but by the way if you can get him on you'll have a great time uh he's he's amazing but anyway back back in the well yeah around 2013 2014 something like that we uh we we did some experiments where what we did was we we we grew ectopic eyes on the backs and the tails of tadpoles and we asked that question can i see out of these eyes what happens when you have this new architecture is it is it functional the the answer is super interesting first of all it turns out that yeah they can see we we we actually built a machine that um trains them on on visual cues and and and and we made tadpoles that did not have primary eyes but they had this you know this one eye on its tail yeah they can learn in visual or visual assay so they can absolutely see the next question is you know you said does it connect to the brain well it doesn't connect to the brain actually it connects to either the spinal cord or in some cases nothing obvious that we can figure out and they can see anyway so so not only is it um plastic in terms of um making the right uh the right organs and the right structure excuse me but actually um even even the wiring is uh is up for uh is is you know is is up for change and you know just imagine like you you you come into this world and you have this weird itchy patch of tissue on your back like how do you even know that's visual data you know but the brain is able to is able to use it and um and and and i'll tell you two two two fun fun things about that one is that um we we then uh let some of those okay so imagine you got an eye on the tail you let that animal grow eventually that tadpole is going to turn into a frog well the tail has to disappear and what happens is normally the tail gets these signals it it degrades it you know basically um apoptosis uh you know it eats itself and so on and then the tail disappears so we had a pool going in the lab about well what's going to happen to the eye right and uh because the whole tail is going to die what what about the eye does the eye think it's part of the tail does it so so this was this was super cool and we watched this thing and uh i'm not sure if we publish i don't remember if we published it but i i i got these amazing pictures of um frogs with eyes on their butts because what happens is the tail gets smaller and smaller the eye gets bigger and bigger and the eye of it just rides it back and eventually just ends up sitting on the butt of the frog the tail is long gone that eye is is is perfectly clear that it's not part of the tail and it's not going to you know degrade the way the tail will and we we don't know if it's functional on the adult frog because we don't really have a good um behavioral method for adult frogs the way we had for tadpole so i don't i don't know if the adult frog can see backwards we don't know but um but but yeah the the eye survived the death of the tail and so just just more broadly you might think about why i mean why is the frog why is the tadpole ready for this for for eyes to be formed like that doesn't happen in nature why would ever and why would evolution do that and i think the lesson that uh i think we not not just from this work but from from a lot of work is this evolution i don't think makes solutions to specific problems but i think evolution does is make problem-solving machines and part of that is the um and and i got a paper from a few months ago um where i beat this uh you know in in significant detail this this idea that because because evolution is working with an agential material it naturally makes systems that um that that can solve these problems and and here's one of my favorite examples of of of this kind of thing is um this was found back in the 40s that if you if you have a salamander and um what you can do is in in for the very early embryos you can you can do this procedure which causes them to multiply their genetic material so instead of two n you can have four n five n six n and so on so the first amazing thing if you do that you still get a normal salamander so that's why it like extra genetic material doesn't seem to confuse it but that's already kind of cool the next thing that happens is that the cells get bigger in order to accommodate all that all the copies of the genome but the salamander sees exactly the same size so that means that as your cells get bigger you need to know to use fewer of them to build the same the exact same organs and so what what he did was he took um um this was uh frank hauser and he took cross sections of this tubule that it's a kidney tubule and he takes cross sections of it and he shows that in a normal uh animal there's like eight to ten cells that go around and they sort of make this tubule in the middle is a big empty space and then and then you make these cells big and now there's fewer there's like four or five of them going around so that's amazing thing number two is that if uh if your cells are the wrong size you know to adapt their numbers so that you can have the same overall structure here's the real kicker if you make the cells gigantic and i believe these were maybe like five n or six n nudes or something like that the cells are so big only one of them fits and so what does the cell do it bends around itself like this leaving a hole in the middle to make the exact same tubule now the reason that's super cool is that that's a different molecular mechanism in the former case you have cell to cell communication tubular genesis blah blah blah in this case you have cytoskeletal bending so so this is top down causation this is crazy this is calling up different new more different molecular mechanisms to achieve the same high level anatomical goal right that that's i mean if that's not intelligence i don't know if we had if we had any kind of a machine that could do this i mean this would be super amazing intelligence because you're faced with a problem you've not seen before you can you can call up different resources of yours to get to get the job the same job done if you're prevented from and and now think of think of the amazing thing that this that this embryo has to has to deal with i'm going to come into the world i don't know how many copies of my genetic material i'm going to have i don't know the size of my cells i don't know the number of my cells i don't know if somebody's going to cut me in half uh early on i have to be able to make a salamander despite all of this changes in the environment changes in my own parts for god's sake right like i don't i can't even depend on my own components i i don't know what what dna i'm gonna have but but i'm gonna make this salamander right and and so and so i think that is what evolution gives us it gives us in for many species not not all i'm not sure c elegans does any of that but but for for many species what evolution has given you is this amazing uh problem-solving machine that does not make too many assumptions about what the world is going to be like now you now you would think that um that's what evolution is for is to is to is to progressively over time extract information about the environment and make sure that whatever you're born in you've got the benefit of all those prior generations but in machine learning you've got this notion of overfitting you know overtraining on your examples you don't want to just memorize your training data set you want to uh you want to be smarter than that and i think um absolutely uh development is smarter than that i don't think development over trains on on on these priors i think it learns a lesson of how to solve these problems and i think really every life multicellular but probably all but but certainly the multicellular life is um is is is born into the world solving problems i don't think it you don't know what you have until you sort of take stuff and this is why you can take an early embryo and cut it into pieces and have multiple twins instead of you know half embryos and and so on yeah i know that shyla has a bunch of stuff uh do you want to do you want to pick up on the on the idea of the platonic salamander form that remains even with five n i mean i have some more like divergent philosophical questions about this regenerative medicine that i can hang out if you got if you want to keep pulling on this thread i mean the let's let's stay here for a little bit because i think the regenerative medicine is what this all kind of centers around right because we want to be able to see as as much as i don't like the idea of science being an instrumentalizable process where there's there's discovery simply for the sake of discovery we we all live within a system where the discoveries at some point need to be instrumentalized onto something in order to get people to really see the point of it and to really get people viscerally invested in it and so i think that that's that might be a good place to end but where do you think the platonic form of the salamander comes from the idea that you can take this embryo and you can screw with it you can change the genetic organization you can make the cells enormous so that it goes from cell cell signaling to create a kidney tubule to just one cell that wraps around it like what is that yeah boy uh yeah um that that is the uh the hard question isn't it um i mean i should say from the beginning that uh i don't know but um i think we definitely start with that but um we we can we can say a few things about it um one one thing is that uh there there are um there are a lot of what what physicists would call free lunches in this kind of scenario in the following in the following way imagine imagine that um you're you're running evolution in a particular world where the most fit um the thing is a particular kind of triangle yeah it's it's it's a certain kind of triangle so here comes evolution and it does a bunch of generations and it nails down the first angle and it optimizes the first angle and then bunch more generations and it optimizes the second angle now it's done it doesn't have to look for the third angle because we already know that once you know two angles in flat space you know what the third angle is supposed to be uh isn't that amazing isn't it where did that come from it's certainly not in the genome uh it's a free gift from the laws of geometry physics i don't know but but it's it's super practical because whereas one can think you know the old this this whole idea this this platonic Pythagorean idea of of these um these information structures that hang out somewhere else not in the physical world then when you make specific physical embodiments for them then you get to to to to to interface with them you know when you have a fulcrum you get to have um you know our committees uh so simple machines and things like that um it it it all sounds initially it all sounds very um philosophical in the bad in the in the pejorative sense it's like why we need any of that we you know it's it's all you're just adding you know crazy stuff onto our ontology you don't need it but when you're saving 33 percent of evolutionary time now this is quite practical now this is this is you you really have to ask where does this where do these things come from and there are tons of these throughout mathematics so i you know think of all the truths of number theory uh all of the all you know the distribution of primes all this other stuff where where where do those things hang out presumably all the all the physical structures at the beginning of the big bang that set all the you know the the forces the relative strengths of the forces all that all that stuff could have been completely different and still the truths of number theory are what they are and so i'm partial to this idea that there is a platonic realm of some sort um that it does contain a bunch of free lunches that evolution is really good at searching it that i i don't think that what evolution is doing is searching the really hard space of microstates on on the on the on the output outcome i think that what it's really basically searching for is and this is this is a bad analogy but we don't have better ones yet it's searching the space of pointers into this platonic space it's searching for ways to capitalize on these free lunches this idea that i mean there's so many of these like i can imagine if you if you have a uh when you um evolve a voltage gated ion channel what you really have is a voltage gated current conductance you have a transistor and if you have a couple of those you can make a logic gate and when you have a logic gate you have a truth table you have the basis of rational thought you have a truth table and you have the fact that nand gates so not and gates are actually quite special compared to all the other gates so where is all that stuff all you did was make a voltage gated ion channel where'd you get all that stuff from you you didn't need to evolve a truth table you didn't need to nail down all the components uh you you get all of that for free and so so so i see everything we're doing as a research program in which we develop tools to map out that space what else is out there because because again you have to ask yourself what what what is this crazy world you do for you well i think what it does for you is it sensitizes you to look for things that you didn't expect things that you didn't bake in it helps you think about making tools to explore that right um and uh i think that the way that you know if you look at um somebody made this thing called the map of mathematics and it's just like this literally this map and you get different areas of math and how they relate to each other i i i think i think platonic space has a structure to it i think there are all kinds of interesting things there from from from geometry and the things we call geometry and algebra and and you know computation and so on and evolution is really good at capitalizing on some of that stuff and so so what else so so to get back to your question does does the form of the salamander hang out there maybe but also form and function of the antherobots and zenobots and who and galls and who knows what the heck else is there um and i think i think that structure is um rich i don't think it's flat and homogenous in the for example when we when we studied the behavior and the shape of these of the antherobots we didn't just see a continuum of here's every possible thing it came in in in in morphotypes it came in in in chunks like this there's this kind there's that kind there's this kind and so yeah i think i think this the the space has structure and i think we need to and so i'm i'm also working on and this this you know we'll take a little bit and we can maybe talk about it at some future time because i don't have it all worked out but i think there's even there's even an interesting uh thing where like under under my understanding of this of the standard um kind of view of this this platonic space thing is that the contents are supposed to be eternal and unchanging right it's sort of fixed they're all they just hang out and they are what they are and like that's it so so i'm not sure that's true i think i think we can start to develop a kind of chemistry of it that ways in which these things actually are active in some sense distinct from the way they actually manifest here and i think there are useful i think there are useful models of that that we can that we can develop to say how do those things combine and and change and how does that impact which ones and how we are able to implement in in you know in engineering and biology and so on i wonder to what extent those forms are stored in the external environment too like when you were talking about the nephron tubule things i was thinking i wonder how much the hydrostatic pressures and so forth are sculpting the cell into the form that it takes and how much of the salamander is a product of forcing by the world the entire i mean i hate to say the entire universe but essentially everything collaborating to make the salamander yeah yeah yeah it's well for sure for sure the context of those cells matters right and and it's entirely possible that in order to explain what's going on we need to consider inputs from the biophysical environment from the energetics and from the from all kinds of stuff i'm sure i'm sure that's true um the question is is and this isn't this is an open question is there a more informative meaning a more um a model that leads to better in invention where what you're talking about is ways in which those parameters index into a pre-existing space of options versus some other i mean frankly i don't know what the what the what the you know competing model would be but but some some way of just um you know sort of calculating locally all the forces and and things like that which i'm sure can be done the question is does it help you find the next thing you know there's a really interesting limit to the kinds of synthetic organisms that can be produced and the routes to them like i know that craig vent craig ventner was working on you know what is the minimal cell that can be produced and the way that they arrived at it was not from bottom up production it was they took a cell and they continuously deleted portions of it until they got to some minimum component and the minimum component was some thing is like 350 protein coding genes and if you look at the papers they're pretty wonky looking cells like they're not really super functional anymore and there's a there's a there's a limit there that i think is breachable with a different kind of design right because none of ventner's work was about this idea of okay environment forcing parameters what can we take to produce a cell that rises from a different environment and matures into something new and with a salamander i like you could probably produce a different kind of salamander with a different kind of body plan with different organs but like do you think that without genetic modification you could produce something that's like a bird probably not right well i'll tell you what what we have done in planaria so so so two examples and again on the on the on the bird thing how about those galls like there's no genetic modification there right like we would have again the looking backwards somebody's going to say oh yeah i can see how this particular growth factor is this and that right so you got flat leaf and you got gall great but the bigger issue here you would have not known that there's a gall you don't know what the next gall is capable of like right so there's more to it um here's here's what we did in planaria first of all we made two-headed planaria by altering the bioelectric pattern we talked about this last time there's no genetic modification there they're permanently two-headed so that's something it's not another species but it's definitely different than the original species so it's something also we've shown that you can actually make planaria with heads that belong to other species so about other species about 100 to 150 million years evolutionary distance so again no no genetic modification now can you go can you go further and you can you know can you make it look like a bird you're not going to get bone i don't think but could you could you get patterns that look like other animals i bet you could if you've ever seen um uh there's another thing that's uh that that speaks to this those uh i forget i forget what the name of the the fly it's it's a little fly and on its wings it has a picture of ants and it's right you know i'm talking about so so yeah so so there you're what it's doing is running a stripped down like low resolution two-dimensional morphogenesis program on its on its wings and so i think the the reprogrammability and the virtualization is massive i think we've not scratched the surface of it so so you know could i tell you what the limits of that are or whether there are limits no i don't know but i would i would bet large amounts of money that the the uh the narrow view that we have now of the mapping between genome and anatomy is way too narrow for reality so one of the things that comes up a lot when i when i discuss your work with people who maybe aren't scientists or aren't really thinking deeply about these questions is okay great we'll be able to regenerate our organs maybe we'll live for a very long time but the brain or the mind starts to become an issue at some point and there's something about the mind that's very different from a kidney in that it seems to be that the cells the functionality of the brain let's say i i know that the mind is sort of delocalized but let's say the central nervous system or whatever you want to call it the thinking machine of the body those cells patterning depends on their experience and so if you had a disease of the brain like a brain tumor or something in terms of treating damage to the brain or regenerating the brain is it conceivable that we'll be able to in some sense pattern these experiences without having gone through the entire path of the life in order to have those connections it just seems like kind of the the expert level regenerative medicine would be this very dynamic architecture this this web like network which it just depends on on a past almost in a way that perhaps a kidney doesn't is that something you've given any thought to yeah yeah yeah we yeah i think about this a lot um a few a few things um first of all uh your brain is different from the kidney but i don't think it's because the kidney doesn't think i do you know i like right now you my left hemisphere is having a chat with your left hemisphere and and we're sort of pretty proud of ourselves for having language and stuff but um there are plenty of other uh systems in the body that solve problems that navigate physiological and other spaces and and we just don't sense them anymore than we sense each other's consciousness so i'm actually not sure it's it's special in that way but um to address your other point about how do we how do we deal with long-term memories i'll give you i'll give you the kind of bummer idea and then the positive idea after that uh the bummer idea is is is this i i don't know let's let's imagine and this this goes back to like the traditional view of of heaven right like this idea of eternal let's say let's say your your you live unlimited amounts of time it's aside from any issues of regeneration or damage or anything like that it isn't obvious to me that any cognitive system can stay sane for an unlimited amount of time like i'm pretty sure i could keep myself busy for 10 000 years probably but like 10 million years i i don't know you know of a while and would you be able to integrate your experiences from 10 000 years ago at some point it's like i wonder if we just start pasting i feel like i paced over my experiences at some point you know i replaced them with new experiences there's obviously the cognitive psychological modeling where we're constantly rehearsing our memories as we go and it's not clear that you would even have access to your experience at some range and that would maybe that's what you mean by going insane is you just lose track of who you are i'm worried about more than that actually in that in that case um so so so it's entirely possible and for example i'm i'm pretty sure that uh you know most of my memories past a few years ago are pasted to a certain degree in the sense that if somebody said oh no you got that all wrong this is how it really went down and we have video i'd be like all right i suppose that's it like fine you know like i i don't know that my memories really go like you know that i would really trust to go back very far at all anyway so so that's fine maybe that would just keep happening and i think that some creatures like could could a dog stay perfectly sane and happy on a farm with rabbits to chase and all that good stuff for like a billion years like maybe right maybe every day would be as joyous as every other day and it would all be super cool like maybe that's fine could a human do that i'm not sure i'm just not sure i don't know um but uh but let's let's let's let's talk about the more the more realistic case um i think i think it's actually a lot a lot more hopeful than than it sounds for the following reason uh the work on planaria and this was uh first discovered by mcconnell in the 60s and 70s and then we replicated the important parts of it in 2013 ourselves um they that you can train them and then you can cut off their entire head brain and all and the tail will sit there doing nothing over the next eight days it regenerates a new brain and now they remember the original information assuming and when we have to say it's an assumption i don't know what the alternative is but let's let's assume that it's stored elsewhere in the body what that shows is that you can actually imprint information onto a new developing brain because until then they do nothing it's only once the brain is there that you see the behavior whatever the information was maybe it was neural maybe it wasn't maybe it's holographic throughout you know there's an amazing book called shuffle brain um about salamanders by this guy paul peach and uh incredible and and he talks about this holographic theory of memory but maybe it's all over the body who knows uh it's imprinted on the new brain now i'm not saying we're exactly like planaria but they're telling us that it's possible they're telling us that it's possible to uh imprint learned information onto new brain tissue um i actually don't believe that memories are encoded by the specific micro um the architecture of your synapses that that story there are increase that story is increasingly sort of cracking at this point and um whatever it is i i have a feeling that if if we do regeneration correctly uh the memories will regenerate now that's now now so i think i think that part is optimistic the part we have to keep keep track of is that in an important way i think we are all like planaria in that we don't have access to our past what we have access to are the engrams that the past has left in our brains and bodies at any given moment and i don't know the thickness of that moment for for for each of us but at any given moment all we're doing is reconstructing a plausible story based on those engrams about what happened before and we all know it's fallible and it's you know we and every time we do it we sort of alter the thing you were just talking about we're all doing that anyway all the time like we are basically like people say oh my god these planaria are amazing yeah we were pretty much all doing that you know all the time i think so so given that that that the core self is a process it's a continuous homeodynamic process it's a reconstruction that's not a physical structure that kind of sits there and you might lose it and then what happens um i think we're fine i i think we're gonna if when we get to the point of being able to regenerate brain tissue i think we're gonna be fine and and and i want to um also put in a couple of other pointers to some stuff first of all and i have a student um carina with whom we are writing a review of the of of all the mismatches between brain state and um uh and and cognitive state but you know there are these cases of uh well there are many cases many different kinds of cases but i'll just talk about one which is these these specific specific cases of of hydrocephaly where somebody's someone someone is born with um fluid a very high fluid pressure in there in there in their skull and that prevents the brain from developing and so you know this guy Lorber in the 80s documented um some guy that had less than a third of the the uh the brain volume of a chimpanzee and he was doing a master's program in math and he had above normal IQ and like he wouldn't know he would you know he would introduce himself and meet people who take a flashlight and shine it in one ear and it would sort of you know like pink light will come up the other end and uh and he was completely fine and so um so so i think i think our mapping of information to to um brain uh medium is we we don't understand how it works we have we have no idea and um and there are many other clinical cases uh that underscore that underscore this idea so so so yeah so i think uh i i think it's going to be fine i think i think it's much more um robust and you can think about think about the um the caterpillar butterfly thing right like not only so so so caterpillars basically destroy their brain they break up most of the connections but when you do these experiments this is against some of Doug Blackistan's old work when you check the moth or butterfly they remember the original information that you train the caterpillar on not only do they remember but they actually generalize across that process because if you train them to eat a particular kind of leaf on a particular color background the the moth or butterfly will go feed the same way but they don't eat leaves they drink nectar and so you're not remembering that leaves you know this particular color means leaves which you're remembering is food so you're actually smart enough to generalize the category to a complete one when i'm a completely different kind of being that doesn't care about leaves at all whereas before that's all i wanted but now i don't care about leaves at all i i'm still going to generalize and i still know what i want so right so amazing during like there's so much plasticity here i think we're going to be fine this makes me think of the reports that i've read of people who have organ transplants and appear to manifest the characteristics of the people that they get a heart transplant or a lung transplant from yeah yeah we wanted to cover it in that review there's not enough clinical well documented clinical cases but you're right and i've talked to i've talked to transplant surgeons about this kind of stuff interestingly enough kidney donors liver donors they don't talk about that stuff it's heart lung i don't know why but you know again the numbers are small so not sure what you know the really egregious cases are are you know there's not that many documented but yeah yeah there's there's something going on here and we have we have a bunch of unpublished data generated by Johanna Bischoff in our group where we transplanted little pieces of two-headed planaria into one headed planaria and some percentage of them if you recut them again they convert to two-headed and so so this idea of transplanting information be it morphogenetic information or be it behavioral information i don't make that much distinction between them i think they're the same process it moves it moves with tissue and it spreads when you put the little implant in it actually spreads across that information not the cells the information spreads across the host so ultimately you know you know mcconnell joked at the time it was 67 68 he joked about the concept of professor burgers this idea that you could actually you know get somebody else's knowledge by eating you know pieces of flesh made made from their body i don't know right like we know nobody's shown that you know you can learn calculus and then pass that along in a burger but some kind of information maybe and if we knew what the proper encoding and decoding was i think there would be all sorts of interesting new routes for for memories this is i mean a dysfunctional example but prions seem like their the transfer of information without any kind of organ or genetic relationship yep yep i agree um yeah i think yeah prions are a kind of non-genetic inheritance um glansman shows uh RNA um so he trains these aplizia and he and he takes uh you know extracts RNA and injects it into a new animal and they um and they acquire some of the information yeah i mean it's just really fascinating because when we were talking about the tadpoles with the eyes some of them are wired into the brain and some of them can see without being wired into the brain and so you have all of the sudden this new framework for understanding even something as basic as visual perception where we equate it from conventional frameworks as being a necessary you know eye brain relationship and so if you start to release that and all of a sudden it's actually in the body does that radically change the way that we have to consider of bodies and minds and and consciousness to me it seems like it must yeah yeah i think so i think that um all of this has a lot to say about what fundamentally what we are and uh what it is that that persists through time and where things are encoded i mean in planaria you can chop them into multiple pieces and each of those pieces will become an animal and that's you know in philosophy of mind 101 you know you go over this example of the malfunctioning transporter right so it sort of replicates you puts a copy over there but it forgets to delete the you know the old star trek episode right like it forgets to delete the original and now which one's the real one well yeah you can do that you can actually do that in planaria so i think our concept of this this idea that there's a discrete border between me and not me you know me between yourself and the outside world between different individuals between the memories that belong to you or the memories that belong to somebody else i i think our uh conceptions of all that stuff are are pretty primitive and probably um you know wrong you you mentioned uh the the danger of overfitting with training uh machine learning models and that links to this kind of tangentially where i think that the way that i've been thinking about consciousness and awareness and intelligence has to do with the presence of a sensory system that can then integrate information and then have effects upon the world and when we discuss the ability of computer scientists to produce consciousness or intelligence to me i always see there being a limitation in these sensory systems i'm like yeah you can have a brain on a chip but in order for that to be something that i recognize as conscious it has to be tied into some kind of body that is able to process multiple modes of sensory information integrate them and then apply them to goal directed behavior and if there is not a necessity for a brain the way that i've conventionally thought about it it really changes the way that i think about machine consciousness because as we start to develop these systems and even if they're not embodied in the way that i'm used to thinking of embodied systems it seems like we we are opening the door into what don hoffman calls you know like another conscious portal that we're booting up yeah yeah um well a couple of things uh first i would be really careful not to lump consciousness and intelligence in the same bucket i don't think these are synonyms and so we have to i think talk about them separately um with respect to embodiment i would say that i agree with you that uh some sort of perception action loop is really important but i don't think three-dimensional space is the only space in which to do that and so if you're doing that in physiological state space or you're doing it in transcriptional space or you're doing it in anatomical morpheus space or metabolic space or linguistic space i think that's good enough i don't think there's anything i don't think this three-dimensional space is privileged i think we treat it that way because that's how our sensory motor system developed and we're really used to things that move around well in the three-dimensional world being the interesting intelligent things like us but uh that's just i think that's just prejudice on our part i think these other spaces in which other beings strive and suffer are equally real and so you can have embodiment that is not obvious to us um that is that is in these other spaces um that was the last thing that was it was a third oh well and so and so and so another another example of that is uh some is people with locked-in syndrome right so so you can you can be locked in syndrome where you have basically zero ability to have uh functional efficacy in terms of anybody noticing you doing anything but you're perfectly conscious and and you know you've you've got a rich inner life so um i think i think i think we have to be careful and i think um uh it it used to be that intelligence and consciousness were very closely tied together i think that evolution kind of makes sure that those things go together and things that are naturally evolved you can kind of gauge one from the other probably like again we really don't know right so so the other mind's problem is is serious when you when you start to think about unconventional things like it's it's pretty easy to say oh come on i know you and i both have minds even though i don't have access to yours but but i'm giving i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt well that's that's that's easy until you get to things that don't actually look like you or are made of something different right it gets it gets really hard intelligence is easy because because problem solving abilities is a third person verifiable objective competency um first person consciousness is is different different and difficult um yeah but uh but but yeah i i think uh i think it's uh it's much it's much wider than than we normally think and it's and it's not hard to come up with cases that basically break almost any um i mean this is the one of the main things i work on now is to try to the one my tame framework is is trying to do is to come up with a um a framework for understanding uh cognition and agency in extremely diverse across extremely diverse embodiments because because all of the existing frameworks they they break very easily with with biological examples most of the things that people um walk around you know kind of talking about okay here's my criterion you can come up with you know seven examples that will just like crush it within you know within minutes it's pretty easy it's it's hard to come up with a good with a good framework yeah i wonder to what extent this mode of re-envisioning intelligence could be applied to other scale systems like i always thought it was really interesting that the physicists got uh let's say dominion over astrophysical or cosmic scale processes um it could i could imagine a different planet with humans on it that the biologists took over that that work and saw different things different patterns in the sky and different uh let's say behaviors of galaxies or or systems and and approach them as intelligence and that that wouldn't be treated as superstitious or rational uh in some sense uh to what extent have you had you do have you collaborated with astrophys is this about about this possibility um i don't know it just seems like in some sense very heretical but it but at the same time i can't find a rational cause for why that's so yeah um i i think uh two two two things to to think about there one is that i i i think uh the reason that um i i think you need an impedance match a kind of um kind of uh cohesion between the tools you're using and what you're hoping to find i think the reason that physicists always see dumb matter and dumb machines and never mind is because they're using tools that are very low agency tools voltmeters and rulers and you know telescopes and things like that these are very low agency things all they're ever gonna see is low agency stuff uh i think you need minds to recognize other minds and um uh so that's that's one thing another thing is is this uh i feel very strongly that assessments of whether any people say this to me all the time and say oh uh you know your your team framework is very kind of panpsychist so what you're just going to say that um that the weather and and and the sun are conscious to well my point is is this but you can't say that you can't just say anything you can't say it is or it isn't you have to do experiments and so um but both directions are bad right so so in the olden days every every rock had a spirit behind it and every you know whatever like that that's so that's problematic because then you say well what what is that doing for you and your ability to understand the rock and whatever but the other option when you say oh no the weather definitely doesn't have any any you know any agency to it i i don't know have you tried training it because we have tools in in behavior science where you can actually address novel systems and ask does this thing have habituation sensitization associate of learning predictive predictive coding uh you know a metacognitive assessment all that these are not things you can have feelings about or preconceptions about you have to do experiments so so my question is um you know uh yeah you can you can you can entertain i i think you can entertain the idea that wow what if the you know the whole galaxy is this like giant intelligence totally possible but you can't say that until you've done some sort of experiment and they have to be perturbational experiments you can't do it just by observation that's really key um you know they did these experiments uh in the 70s where this guy made these um movies where there were different shapes moving around so triangles and squares and circles and things and he would show them to people and people go oh look it's very obvious the the the circles in love with the square and then they're trying to run away but the triangle keeps trying to break them like you can tell these stories all day long but the only way to to develop them into things that help your research and help you understand nature is to do perturbational experiments is they find if i put my finger on the triangle and don't let it go what's going to happen or i put a barrier does the circle really go around and get this way like what's actually going to happen and so i'm completely open to um potential intelligence is at other scales of time and space in fact i did i did annoy a bunch of physicists at one point asking them could redesign a planetary scale synapse so so some kind of a gravitational system where a pulse comes in and so it's some sort of asteroid comes flying in something changes and then the next time you know the next three asteroids come flying in it does something different because it's learned and it's got you know it's it's a synapse right so it has a historicity to it um and yes i think you can design such things whether they occur in nature i have no idea um well there's some interesting anecdotes i think there's some flyby anomalies with anomalies it's hard to say there's some flyby anomalies with uh the jupiter probes you know that that end up leaving their orbit set you know and and and they're just kind of catalogued and moved on and and again like it's not such a perturbation it's actually terrifying to think about uh perturbing another galaxy or something and all of the people in that galaxy are like what's going on um but i suppose you wouldn't need to do that because there there are these anomaly i mean the galactic rotation problem is another really interesting one it's like we have a very robust model of gravity quantitatively we've checked it out locally in our solar system to the best of our ability on earth and then we look at these large-scale structures and it's like well they're moving by some other means and uh it really opens the door but i suppose without being able to mess with it you can't really see if it's responsive or or if it's just some physical process that we are not aware of yet i mean that's the thing right crossing crossing levels between local physical process suppose you have a you have a conversation with somebody and uh you convince them to go to grad school you have this you know four argue four really good arguments why they should go get their phd and they do and then and then here you know along comes the physics is how did you do that and and you say well here's and they say okay so let's measure so there was this air vibration and it went into the eardrum and then there's a okay it's not that that story is false it's just completely useless that the next time somebody else needs to be talked into whatever it is right it doesn't capture the essence of what's going on even though even though at the local scale yes it all was true and it all held together and these are the sets of frequencies and air vibrations that happen it misses the whole point of the story so um it's almost i i feel it's like um uh and again this is this is just you know kind of very very hand-wavy stuff but but i'm working on something something a little better um the the notion of synchronicity right the idea that there are large scale patterns that show up at specific observational scales when you as the observer know what to look for but down below they are just chance or they're you know it's it's never magic it's never against the laws of physics but it but but if you look at a larger scale there's often like yeah wait a minute though yeah i know each one of these things kind of was was random by itself but all together there's some there's something going on here and so you have to know how to look for those patterns and even better you have to know how to read and write those patterns which means perturbational experiments so you know i i don't have any ideas on how to um do perturbational experiments on on galaxies but but like the weather kind of a thing should be absolutely uh uh tractable and and we did something like that with um with gene regulatory networks because they're very simple dynamical systems and you look at them you say well that's things kind of it's we you know for sure it's dumb it's never gonna look turns out they're capable of six different kinds of memory including pavlovian conditioning and all it takes it doesn't you don't need cells you don't need synapses you don't need any of that it's it's a it's a handful of genes that turn each other on and off and already you get this amazing free gift which is that some of the biological ones anyway they can they can learn why do you think that the physicists have such preeminence in our academic tower you know i feel like people all like if you look at nsf at least last time i looked it was mostly physicists that were in charge uh it just seems like people expect physicists to answer these really huge cosmic questions and i've always found that a little bit bizarre but and i've been trying to trace how that came about and if it's arbitrary or if it's is there something innate about the way that we perceive the world that demands that kind of explanation even if it's not capable of it yeah um i would argue that it's because uh they make cd players right like they i mean they they're the ones and and it's because they pick the low-hanging fruit i mean literally not to take anything away like physics is amazing and it lots of hard problems and all of that but but um as as anybody who does computer science or physics when they try to reach bio they get into biology they want to rip the hair out of their heads because because they're used to systems that are precise uh basically the low end of the spectrum you can you can we know how to deal with the low end of the spectrum and now we do anyway after all the hard work and those are the things where we make reliable technology so so you know if you want a washing machine or you want a cd player you didn't get there without the physicists now you need some other stuff but but but but the stuff from the right side of that spectrum so so psychoanalysis and uh but you all that kind of stuff in and art and everything like it's great but it is notoriously unreliable for doing any particular thing you know it sort of will enrich some of us and not others and who knows but but if you really want you know if you if you um if you want to build a house or you want to you want to you know antibiotics or something like that it's physics and then chemistry and i i i think that's that's what it is it's just people people can see what works and and it's going to take a lot of hard work uh to get that degree of um a predictive utility out of these higher higher agency things if we live in a world of platonic forms that are being biologically manifest and evolution is you described it as being something that makes problem solving machines do you have a sense of your own role in that as like what is the what is the platonic form of the problem that you see yourself as solving yeah so so this is uh just my phenomenology of it i i don't know because i'm not able to do experiments controlled experiments on the scale of you know life and science and all of that right so so i i don't know if any of this is has any truth to it this is just how how i feel um yeah um it certainly feels to me like i'm discovering not inventing and that the people in my lab uh we are we are uncovering something um i don't know if they would agree by the way but but uh but me personally everything that that we've done over the decades i feel like we're unearthing something that already existed and that has a particular structure to it we don't make it up we find it and we kind of uh we can do better or worse at figuring out what it is and how to relate to it and how to bring it out into the world um that's how it feels to me i don't know that any of that is true um but um yeah and i also think that so so here's another kind of wacky thing uh and i've told this to some of my students um i i also feel like some of that stuff is under positive pressure in other words it wants to come out in other words it's there for you to like like when you poke that little hole into that platonic space by making uh the you know a bot or some kind of new technology stuff comes rushing through that hole and i really feel like again this is very non-scientific i'm just telling you how it feels to to to me um that that's what we do we figure out ways to kind of put a crack in that in that boundary and then stuff starts pouring through the boundary you don't have to you don't have to pull it out if you if you make the if you if you if you um make make a make that barrier porous it it comes out i think i think it's under pressure it it it whatever you whatever you create in this world that's uh uh it will it will um pull patterns that that are that are there and is that how you approach your own goal orientation in your science like you know we're starting a new year here and and it's almost like if it's a miracle year for you what would it look like but i sense that it's almost like you see it as just chasing that that you know positive pressure that positive pressure yeah you're sort of flowing with it do you set that that's sort of objective bar for yourself when you when you look out onto the immediate future as a scientist or are you are you just kind of going with the muse um well i well i definitely think there's a muse no no doubt about that but um i also think that the space of possible things to chase after is infinite and so i actually like like on the spectrum you know in some labs you you know you sort of show up and whatever you do as long as you discover something cool everybody's you know happy with it but i'm on the other spectrum so i have a very specific research agenda i would like everybody who joins the higher than my lab we're all working on very specific things where i know what i want to to come out of this um so and that's that's not to say that uh that i'm you know uh defining it like designing any of these things it's just that there are many many different things that different muses that one could tune into and i have one particular one that you know i'm sort of flowing with and that means being very thoughtful about um what are the channels through which you write these these findings will hopefully hopefully flow the center i've got a i've got a mind map that hangs in our um in our in our lab and it's like this this this this giant poster that we put like nine feet wide that we printed on silk and the center of the mind map is called embodied mind that's the center so so it's all the different ways and you know all the different questions and things that we're doing and then different people's specific projects are sort of peppered around the leaves of the trail of that of that graph and so that everybody can see where where they kind of plug into this but it's no it's very specific and it's very curated it's a beautiful world that you're building i really think that when i i think i've told you this before that when i went to go study biology i imagined that it would be the the study of what is life and i very quickly realized that it was much more mechanistic and much more molecular than that in most cases and one of the reasons that we started this podcast was because i was certain that there were people out there who were asking the larger questions of the significance and pushing the boundaries of what it meant to understand bodies and life itself because it does seem to be a very weird center of the universe and obviously that's like a very you know earth centric or human centric perspective but there is something that is there's a motive force of life which is the solving of problems and the universe seems full of problems to solve and so figuring out the process by which we can do that in novel ways seems to me to be the passage into something that is greater than the past because at every single juncture where humans have run into problems the way that we have solved them is by figuring out technological approaches to resolving what has happened and obviously that creates downstream problems like you look at the you know the green revolution or something we have solved the problem of mass starvation but now we have phosphate runoff and pollution of waters and now we have so many people that we don't have regenerative agriculture that prevents us from just decimating animal life on the planet and i think that the the passage into the next era is the passage of understanding or biology much better than we ever have before and i think that your work is really really at the center of this and i just i'm i'm i'm grateful to have to have met you and to know that that someone is is doing this it's really it gives me a lot of hope for the future well thank you so much yeah i'm i that's one of the things i'm happiest about is when people get hope from some of the things i say and i this is maybe a good time to point out that it obviously isn't just me so in addition to the people in my lab that do a lot of the hard work it's also i have i have some amazing collaborators that that have been pulled together some of whom you may want to have on so people like Richard Watson and you know and chris fields and mark solmes and some other folks they really make a lot of this possible because these are some of the things i say these ideas have been around for really long time but they've gotten no traction because there's a huge difference between saying something and pushing it to the point where it actually generates new discoveries and until you do that second thing it doesn't move the needle and that that's the really hard part and so so there have been a lot of people that i've worked with that enable that they have enabled some of that some of that to happen and i think i think what you're saying is super important in the sense of understanding life beyond kind of the lowest levels of it meaning the the mechanistic molecular stuff is is critical it's going to be important for us going into the you know whatever the future of humanity is the one thing i want to say though is people get hyper fixated when when they hear life people get hyper fixated on the material and on how it gets here so so the biological wet the cytoplasm stuff and the product of evolution and i just want to say that i think life and and that kind of focus on what's important is really critical but we have to remember the protoplasm isn't magic and it isn't unique and the meandering course of the evolutionary process is not the only way that mind enters this world and we have to get broader than than a focus on the easy stuff which is the material it's really easy to say oh you're made of silicon yeah you're not real you're just you're just faking it and and really the hard work that we have to do as a as a species is to get beyond those those kind of superficial criteria and to really say what what do we really mean by um i don't i don't know about life i you know you can you can keep life what it is but but but cognition um i think goes way beyond the living world and we we have to understand we have to develop um the rigorous frameworks of of recognizing in novel guises that we wouldn't necessarily say are alive and i think that this next year is going to be really interesting to see what happens because i feel like we're approaching that question in a massive way technologically yeah we we are um i i'm i'm really um disappointed about how narrow that debate has been and the hyper focus on language models and and uh the kind of ai's that we have today and the things you know the people people just get so so focused on these examples and and and the broader lessons of the field of diverse intelligence are haven't even been scratched yet everybody's just like really focused on this on this one thing i think i think we get much bigger issues actually coming than than just than just this yeah i mean i think that we can plan to spend the next year reading up and studying more on the the diverse intelligence and hopefully we can see you again in at the beginning of the next year yeah absolutely anytime thank you so much it's always awesome thanks for so eye-opening talking to you and i really appreciate you giving us your time and giving it to our audience as well that's great i appreciate thank you always a great discussion be well um yeah stay in touch happy new year happy new year all right happy new year yeah send me uh send me a link when this comes up we'll do you got it all right bye everybody bye
