00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Today on the podcast we have our third conversation with Mike Eleven to

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,480
kick off the new year and we talk a lot about the developments that he's been

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,480
making in his lab that all centered around the idea of embodied cognition,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,720
intelligence versus consciousness, some of the specifics of the way that the

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,760
experiments work because the last time that we talked to him he had just

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,960
published his paper on frog skin Xenobots where they had taken frog skin

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,280
cells from frog skin, grown them in special conditions and then created these

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,600
ambulatory little creatures that could then corral other skin cells to produce

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,720
more of themselves and so basically in I think a pretty transparent way made a

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,680
new life form out of a cellular format that you wouldn't really expect would be

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,920
able to do something new and he kind of teased us with the idea that they were

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,040
working on doing the same thing with mammalian cells and this paper was

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,360
published over the course of the last year and so a lot of our discussion

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,200
centered on what are called antherbots which are tracheal epithelial cells

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,360
that grown in a 3d matrix then released from the 3d matrix are now become these

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,160
multicellular ciliated structures that astonishingly migrate to the location of

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:25,480
wounds inside of plated neuronal cells and then act to heal the break in the

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,000
cellular layer and so it opens all of these questions that are kind of a

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,160
perpetual topic with Michael Levin right like what are the parameters that

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,960
create the design limitations that we associate with the bodies that we live

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,160
in and as always it's a absolutely fascinating discussion because I think

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,000
that Levin is thinking about these questions in a way that honestly very

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,720
very few people are Levin and collaborators as he mentions towards the end

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,440
of the episode and there's extraordinary second third-order effects from the

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,160
instrumentalization of these experiments as well right so what does it

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,720
world with truly regenerative medicine look like how do we account for the

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,080
ability that we can build our bodies back but our minds are perhaps wrestling

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,920
with the longevity issue and also how does disembodied consciousness appear at

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,880
other scales throughout the cosmos in systems that we might not have access

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,640
to how to examine those systems in a way where we can poke at them if they're on

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,400
different time scales and different spatial scales that we're used to these

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,760
are huge questions so it's a wide-ranging conversation part three and we'll look

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
forward maybe next year to doing part four we wanted to say a huge thank you

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,160
to our patrons for being here all year this is our first podcast for the new

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,280
year it's actually New Year's Day today we're really stoked on the next year

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
we're having our first conference out in Austin Texas we would love to see you

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,280
there it's gonna be a really close-knit conversation circle we have some

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,880
incredible speakers lined up you can check out all of those things at the

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,760
link down in the description and up here and I really hope to meet you guys out

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,680
there and check out the total solar eclipse which is happening that weekend

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,480
we also have live stream tickets that are gonna be on sale and right now those

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,840
are $10 but the price is gonna go up in the next few weeks so get those now on

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,800
the early sale and it's still affordable and we're gonna be making a big road

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,520
trip out there and playing music shows along the way so if you are on the path

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,960
of Oregon to Austin get in touch with us if you want us to play in your town and

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,920
we will figure out a way to make it happen and as always a huge thank you to

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,880
our patrons we could not do this without you guys because as you probably

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,960
well know we live in a society where you you got to make bread to eat bread and

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,600
we do eat a lot of peanut butter and jelly but this has been a transformative

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,400
experience because we have been able to build this show on the basis of having

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,000
an audience that believes in what we're doing and so if you've been listening to

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,520
the show for a while and you and you want to support us then come on over to

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,600
patreon.com that link is right here and you can join for just a couple dollars a

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,760
month and really help us keep the ship going and help us develop it and make

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,120
it so that we have more in-person conversations so we can go see you in

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,120
the towns where you're at and not have it just be something that is through the

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,360
computer screen where everyone is experiencing by themselves all right

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,200
let's talk to Michael

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,200
it seems like you're spending a lot of time thinking about this idea of

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,400
intelligence and the manifestations of intelligence and this the smallest

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,560
possible unit of what can be said to be intelligent and studying how it evolves

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,100
and organizes and sorts like there was a paper that was just on on the

63
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,960
Reeveson side where you were looking at the way that these different sorting

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,200
algorithms clustered during evolutionary experiences and I wonder if we could start

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,320
with a conversation about the minimum unit of intelligence and evolution and

66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,040
behavior because if you can do it with such a simple system then it seems like

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,320
those principles are being applied actively in the bio about work sure sure

68
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,040
yeah I mean the thing is and I have some somewhere on my website I have a video

69
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,520
that I made of the word cloud of all our papers from every year and how it's

70
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,520
changed from I think 1992 or something all the way and you can watch them change

71
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,720
and the thing is that it's not that I've spent more time thinking about this now

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,360
I always thought about this stuff this was always what I'm interested in but

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,800
there was a time when that wasn't the right time to talk about any of it and

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,160
progressively over the years it's become more and more fruitful to start to talk

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,240
about it because these are topics that go sort of across the grain for a lot of

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,600
the way that people think about biology and so on and until we had a body of work

77
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,840
that really was able to say no look this is a useful way to think about things

78
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,960
because it leads to new discoveries right until that had reached a certain

79
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,920
level there was no point in becoming out and talking about basal cognition or

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,440
any of that stuff so so now I think I think we're in an interesting point now

81
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,240
where we can actually robustly talk about some of these things yeah and in

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,960
particular if you want to start with the with the sorting algorithm so so the

83
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,760
thing about the sorting algorithms is that there is no evolution there this is

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,480
purely the standard very few lines of code that a sort of what we're talking

85
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,280
six seven lines of code tops that a standard sorting algorithm has and the

86
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,240
reason I picked it is because understanding the very minimal system

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,760
that that exhibits some sort of very kind of basal aspects of intelligence of

88
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,520
cognitive behavior of problem-solving and so on is really important because a

89
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,480
lot of people have and this includes this includes you know professional

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,640
neuroscientists and so on they they think that a lot of these kinds of

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,320
capacities show up fairly late right and so so you know so so Nick Humphreys

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,440
would put it at birds and mammals for example I could mean really late and I

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:41,080
inevitably when I start talking about the symmetries or the invariances that

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,360
exist in terms of these different capacities across the tree the tree of

95
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,000
life across all kinds of weird implementations and so on inevitably the

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,160
question becomes well what's the smallest piece in other words are you then

97
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,320
saying that every rock has hopes and dreams and things I write that that's

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
the question that people ask and so so actually I think it's very important to

99
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,400
answer that question to say what do these things look like when they become

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,920
really minimal right you know what what are the earliest things that or the

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,000
simplest things that have these properties and so what was cool about the

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,160
sorting algorithms is that a few things they're well known so people have been

103
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
you know computer science students have been studying these things for many

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,800
decades they're completely deterministic there there is no even that

105
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
there's not even pseudo randomness there they're totally deterministic they're

106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,560
completely transparent you can see all the code the next thing about that as

107
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,560
opposed to biology is that if I say look here's a biological system that's doing

108
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,120
something new and unexpected someone could say there's a mechanism for you

109
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,680
just haven't found it yet it there's always in biology there's always more

110
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,000
details to be discovered right and you never know that you've got it all and

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,800
you probably will never have it all so so but but with these things I can say

112
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,880
no look here are the six lines of code like there's nothing else there literally

113
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,200
is not no other place for anything to hide that this is it and so then if you

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
have something like that it also has the interesting property that people think

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
they know how it works and what it can do and this is showing up a lot in the

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
current AI debates because people it's not everybody of course there are other

117
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,560
people who disagree but but a lot of people are saying well this is just

118
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,720
linear algebra we know we made it we know how it works it does you know and

119
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,240
people have very strong feelings it can't this and it doesn't that and you

120
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,760
know it it there's no there's no way it has whatever interesting thing they

121
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,880
think they have as biological creatures because they made it and I want to say

122
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,920
that even even these incredibly minimal things where we think we know exactly how

123
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,640
they work in these and have very small parts we don't know everything they're

124
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,040
capable of there are major surprises and that and that's what we found in this

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,960
paper now I should also be clear this is a preprint so it's not been peer

126
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,000
reviewed so so you know I always like to kind of point out that that's what we're

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,720
talking about and so can we go into some of the details about what is the system

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,320
that these algorithms are inside of in the behavior that you see yeah so so the

129
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,440
things that we're looking for we're looking for the two two main things

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,720
number one we're looking for what I call basal intelligence which which I define

131
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:18,000
as the ability to solve problems and get to the same outcome by different means

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,800
this is William James's definition of intelligence you know same goal by

133
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,880
different means and in particular there's one very particular thing that we

134
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,960
looked for and found which I call delayed gratification and it's the idea and in

135
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,080
fact William James talks about this imagine imagine two magnets and you

136
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,800
know they're trying to get together and you put a piece of wood between them

137
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,640
that's it right what the magnet is never going to do is go around and the wood

138
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,280
and get to where it wants to go because because that would temporarily

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,520
actually take it further away from its goal right the energy the free energy

140
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,520
would actually rise as and they can't do that all they do is they go down the

141
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,640
gradient if you have an animal or certain kinds of self-driving vehicles or in

142
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,800
James's example Romeo and Juliet right facing all kinds of physical and

143
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
social barriers they have all kinds of tools to do this they understand delayed

144
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,960
gratification they know that temporarily you might have to go away from your goal

145
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,600
in order to reach it later and and so that's a kind of metric of cognitive

146
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,000
sophistication right but but the ability to do it at all is already

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,360
something so so one thing one thing that I would that we were looking for is the

148
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,280
ability to to do that kind of problem-solving or delay gratification

149
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,800
the second thing we were looking for is unexpected unexpected goals and when I

150
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,000
say goals I don't mean human level metacognitive goals like I know what my

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,040
goal is I don't mean that I mean very simple cybernetic goals which are states

152
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,000
that you spend energy to try to achieve and if somebody sort of pulls you away

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,920
from it you'll you know you'll you'll you'll continue to try to get there in

154
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,240
some kind of way so those are those are the those are the two things that we were

155
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,080
looking for and so so let's just go from the beginning what do these sorting

156
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,840
algorithms do all the ideas that you start with a with an array of numbers

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,320
these are random random numbers they're there you know let's say from one to a

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,000
hundred you have a hundred numbers and they're shuffled they're all randomly

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,840
distributed so the sort of the job of the sorting algorithm is we're gonna crank

160
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,320
through this algorithm we're gonna we're gonna look at what the numbers and we're

161
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,840
gonna follow a very simple recipe and by the end of it all of them are gonna be

162
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,600
in order that's all it's gonna do it's gonna arrange the numbers in order it's

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,840
a very short algorithm now the main way that it works is there's a there's a

164
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,760
centralized kind of top-down mind that or in this case a computer that knows the

165
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,600
algorithm and is just sitting there rearranging the numbers and there are

166
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,640
many different sorting algorithms is bubble sort selection sort whatever we

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,200
made we made two small modifications to allow us to ask all of these

168
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
interesting questions and by the way what the the other thing we did is to

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,800
visualize that process as a walk in a navigation in a certain space in other

170
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,720
words a walk in sorting space so you start out over here and in many potential

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,920
configurations where all the numbers are shuffled but everybody's got to get to

172
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,280
one particular point which is when all the numbers are in place and it's

173
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,360
guaranteed these sorting algorithms are guaranteed to eventually get you there

174
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
right it might take a while depending on the length of the stream but they all

175
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
get there so they all sort of walk around and they get to this they get to

176
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,480
this one spot okay so and that's that's what we're interested in in terms of

177
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,800
intelligence we're interested in ability to navigate in some kind of problem

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,680
space so we so we made two changes number one so we made this a little more

179
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,480
biological instead of having a top-down controller that sees all the numbers and

180
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
is following one algorithm and doing its thing we made it distributed and bottom

181
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,080
up meaning that we gave each each each number we call them cells now in each

182
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,400
cell has a has associated with a certain number they all have their own tiny

183
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,960
little agency and all they know how to do is look around and they have preferences

184
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,400
about their neighbors so if you're a five what you would like to have is a four on

185
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,720
your left and a six on your right that that's it so instead of and but you're

186
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,680
going to follow that same algorithm so you've got you've got the algorithm but

187
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,120
now every single cell is following the algorithm it's not top-down you know

188
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,880
omniscient single agent that's sorting them but every cell has its own little

189
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,000
little preferences right so that's very biological because in biology you're

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,840
dealing with an agential material where every cell has local local knowledge

191
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,480
local preferences and so on but we don't add anything new so there's no memory we

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,160
don't we don't give them all kinds of complex all they have is that same

193
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,000
original algorithm it's just they can't see the whole string all they see is some

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,760
some distance away all they see is local so it's we haven't added anything we've

195
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,480
just sort of distributed it out and and by the way the first amazing result of

196
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,760
the paper is that that actually works when you do that you still get sorted

197
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,720
numbers so so if you break the if when nobody nobody knows what all the

198
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,240
numbers are you can still get them sorted that's kind of cool so so that

199
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,600
kind of distributed source so that's that's the first thing then then we

200
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
added something else which is very biological and is really the key to

201
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,520
testing this intelligence which is that we stepped away from the notion of a

202
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,920
of an infallible algorithm in other words normally when you do the algorithm you

203
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,400
assume that it works in other words when i say swap the the the five and the seven

204
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,880
you assume that they in fact get swapped we introduce a notion of an unreliable

205
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,880
medium the algorithm might say you want to swap one of the cells could be broken it

206
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,880
could be damaged maybe it can't be moved maybe it can't initiate moves so so we

207
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,720
introduce this notion of a frozen cell now notice that in the traditional

208
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,600
algorithm there is no notion of hey did my did the operation succeed how am i

209
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,240
doing what what am i actually uh you know am i going in the right direction

210
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,360
nothing the algorithm doesn't have any of that all it has is a set of steps and

211
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,720
you sort of blindly take those steps and that's it so so you see this is a

212
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,280
super minimal system uh initially you would look at and you would say well

213
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,000
there is no machinery here for any any of the things you want to find there's no

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,120
machinery here for dealing with broken cells there's no machinery here for

215
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,280
delayed gratification there's no sense of how am i doing or what path am i taking

216
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,520
through that space not none of that is there and that's why i i like this

217
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,080
system so much because it shows us that even in scenarios where you you think

218
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,000
you know what's there and what it does you can you can be significantly

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,480
surprised so so here's what we found here here are surprised first of all we

220
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,680
found that if if you do introduce these broken cells which can't move

221
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,960
and then you track the progress of the sorting algorithm across the space you

222
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,320
find out that in fact what it does know how to do is delay gratification it

223
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,120
knows how to go backwards which means in this case un-sort the string a little

224
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,080
and in order to have gains later on that that's an amazing thing because that is

225
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,840
not in the algorithm if you look at the actual algorithm there's nothing in

226
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,200
there like that you don't see you don't see that so so that already

227
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,720
starting to tell you that that there are competencies that are not obvious from

228
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,760
looking at the material so that's the first thing and then we were able

229
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,080
to do something else because you know in the traditional way of doing this

230
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,360
there's one single algorithm that's sorting the whole string right you're

231
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,320
you're sort of god looking at it from the top down and you're following

232
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,200
selection sort or insertion sort or whatever it's going to be and you're

233
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,040
moving whatever you need to move around to get them sorted in this case

234
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,960
everything's bottom up every cell has its own uh is following its own algorithm

235
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,080
so we were able to do something something very unusual which in fact we do in

236
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,880
the biology too we made a chimera and that is a mix of cells where some cells

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,320
are following one algorithm but other cells are following another algorithm

238
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,080
and for example our our frog allotle is a chimera when you take cells from a

239
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,880
frog embryo and you take cells from an axolotl embryo they have

240
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,760
different local rules that they're going to follow because one's going to make a

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,640
frog one's going to make an axolotl but you can put them together in a single

242
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,200
organism you can ask what happens right so we did that here we we um we mixed

243
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,720
two two algorithms in the same string now the way you do it is you when that um

244
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,840
as you assign them randomly so we have a bunch of random numbers and each one

245
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,960
gets a random assignment you're either you're either going to follow selection

246
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,480
sort or you're going to follow a bubble sort something like that right and it's

247
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,600
and it's random it's mixed up you can think about that as the genetic sort of

248
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,720
right it's the thing that determines your policy of action it determines what

249
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,840
you're going to do and there's two different there's two different kinds

250
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,080
um again surprise the first the first kind of interesting thing is that that

251
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,880
works in other words you don't need to both have the same uh journey through

252
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,560
that space in order to get to where it's going and so you can have a chimera

253
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
string that still gets sorted even though half of it's following one set of

254
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,000
rules and half of it's following another okay that's cool then we asked that we

255
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,600
asked a really wild question which is if you if you look at the string in the

256
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,760
middle of the process what's the distribution of the of the cells that

257
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,320
are following the two different algorithms like where do they hang out in the

258
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,480
string now now here's what we know we know that at the very beginning it's

259
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,000
going to be random so so let's define a notion of clustering which is just this

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,600
I look to my left I look to my right and I ask what are the odds that the that

261
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,880
the guy sitting next to me is using exactly the same algorithm as I am we

262
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,560
call it we defined a new a new term um Adam Goldstein came up with this he

263
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,960
calls it an algotype like you have genotype phenotype so algotype right

264
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,120
and so and so okay so clustering is just I look to my left I look to my right

265
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,040
what's the odds that my neighbor is the same algotype as me

266
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,880
we know that in the beginning it's 50% because they're random we assign them

267
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,920
randomly we also know that at the end it's also going

268
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,120
to be 50% because at the end everybody's got to be sorted according to their

269
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,320
number but the algotypes who are signed randomly they weren't

270
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,520
assigned according to number so that means if we really if we sort you on

271
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,400
the number the other types are gonna be of course just like at the beginning

272
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,240
they'll be all over the place they're gonna be 50 50 what happens in the

273
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,200
middle and this is the amazing part what happens in the middle

274
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,280
is that what the curve so so so 50 it's clamped at 50 50 but in the middle it

275
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,160
kind of goes like this so what happens is that in between the sorting process

276
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,000
cells with the same algotype like to hang out together they spend

277
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
a bunch of time in these clusters where we are all the same type of we're all

278
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,600
following the same procedure but then they inevitably get dragged apart

279
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,440
you know I sometimes joke that this is like a it's a minimal model of the

280
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,560
human condition of you know for any living being

281
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,000
like for a period of time in your life you get to do some things that are

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,320
against the general trend of the physics of your world but eventually

283
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,520
you all end up in the same place right it's like this really minimal

284
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,040
minimal way you have you have a period of time where you get to do some things

285
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,400
that you want but eventually the inevitable physics of your universe

286
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,880
sort of grinds you down right that's that's like

287
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,720
like a minimal model of our of our existential state

288
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,280
so what's what's amazing about it is that again

289
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,280
nowhere in the algorithm does it say I know what algotype I am

290
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,480
or how you find that out nowhere in the algorithm does it talk about checking

291
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,240
the algotype of your neighbors none of that is there it's completely

292
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,840
emergent and it's not just emergent complexity the way that you know

293
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,640
fractals are an emergent complexity the game of life

294
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,600
cellular automata emergent complexity from very simple rules is not just that

295
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,120
it's what one step beyond that it's actually

296
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,120
in the case of the the the delay gratification it's emergent competencies

297
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,040
and in the case of the the clustering or hanging out together

298
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,040
it's some sort of it's some sort of emergent computational goal that you as

299
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,280
the programmer did not put in there this is a very simple system

300
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,040
that has goals and competencies that you did not put in there

301
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,480
even though you wrote the algorithm the algorithm is deterministic it's small

302
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,800
and transparent and you know this is I this is why I think it's

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,960
significant because if if that's the case in these little things

304
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,640
when people say they think they know what you know various AI

305
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,360
architectures do or various you know collective

306
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,480
swarm robotics or swarm you know various things like that

307
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,080
I mean I I think there are so many surprises

308
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,520
in store for us that we really need to develop a science of

309
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,040
guessing guessing these kind of emerging goals and so this

310
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,000
so the last thing I want to say is that this takes us back to your point at the

311
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,240
very beginning that okay so what does this have to do with the various

312
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,720
biobots because much like with with these

313
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,560
with these algorithms when when we make novel biologicals

314
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,000
where the answer to well what what are going to be

315
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,440
its goals all while have a you know long history of of a selection

316
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,560
but determined well they don't have a long history of selection they've never

317
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,920
been here before these biobots there was never a

318
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,880
selection to be a good zanibot or a good anthropobot

319
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,280
so how do you know what the goals are going to be where do they come from

320
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,200
right so that I think is the is the emergence of a new science of

321
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,880
figuring out the novel goals of systems where you cannot

322
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,360
say that evolution is what did it and that's I think that's going to be really

323
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,320
important for us as a species going forward

324
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,800
I love that we have this really straightforward experiment that's so

325
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,880
simplified available to be able to consider the larger implications and

326
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,160
so I want to spend a little bit more time really understanding

327
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,440
the dynamics that emerge from it and so when you say that

328
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,280
these algorithms in the midpoint cluster according to type

329
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:26,120
do you have a sense for why that is yeah um

330
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,880
why it why is interesting because we have to think about what kind of answer

331
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,320
we're looking for so on the one hand and this is also true in biology

332
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,360
there's no magic here I'm not saying that these things are doing anything that

333
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,560
isn't allowed by the by the algorithm if you were to track

334
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:51,480
the data flow you would say well this is perfectly consistent with the algorithm

335
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,480
there's nothing to see here which is exactly what some people do for biology

336
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
they look at you and your brain and they say

337
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,920
well this is just chemistry this is just just electrons moving around there's

338
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,920
nothing there's nothing special here right if you if you insist on the lowest

339
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,720
level of description that is all that's all you're ever going to see

340
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,640
and that's it's not false it's just a very limiting world view

341
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,960
um on the other hand if you if you if you take a step back and you ask yeah but

342
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,120
knowing what you know about the algorithm why why didn't you predict that that

343
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,560
was going to happen yeah and this is this is kind of my my

344
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,800
my thing about a lot of biology is that after the fact after somebody has done

345
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,840
something interesting and shows you a new phenomenon you've never seen before

346
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,840
it's very easy to go back and look at the micro details and say yep no miracles

347
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,880
here therefore all good like we can explain it you know

348
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,160
yeah you can always track down the the steps that you took

349
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,600
but unless you had a theory that actually told you in advance that this was

350
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,360
going to happen in other words you know not not just explanation looking

351
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,680
backwards but invention looking forwards then then you then you're missing

352
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,800
something and so now so so what we're missing in this case

353
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,520
is a system that would have allowed us to say ahead of time

354
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,800
oh i know that's what your algorithm says but i can see what's going to happen

355
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,200
here these guys are going to want to travel together

356
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,240
right that's that's what we're that's what we're looking for and and

357
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,400
do i have that theory no although um i will um

358
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,680
i'll propose a hypothesis which which we're going to test

359
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:25,640
soon um the hypothesis is this uh based on uh kind of carl friston's

360
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,600
framework of surprise minimization um chris fields and i had this had this

361
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,400
paper a few years ago now on why it is

362
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,320
basically he calls it an imperial model of multi-cellularity the idea goes

363
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,800
like this why why would cells want to get together

364
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,120
right and and one way to think about this is that well if every cell

365
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,840
doesn't like to be surprised let's face it if you're a living thing and you're

366
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,640
constantly getting surprised you're not going to last very long

367
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,000
so so everything is is trying to minimize uh minimize surprise

368
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,200
well one of the least surprising things out there

369
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,160
is you so what might be nice is to make some copies of yourself and put

370
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,400
them around you to make a sort of like stem cell niche kind of thing where the

371
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,680
cells on the outside are frontline infantry they're facing the uncertainty

372
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,520
of the outside world the cell on the inside is protected and has a very

373
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,120
consistent environment because everything it's dealing with is basically a copy of

374
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,560
itself so um that's our idea so that that was our

375
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,880
idea and so so so uh following this firstonian paradigm

376
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,040
what you really want are neighbors that are predictable

377
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,840
well how will they be predictable well they could be like you if they're like

378
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,760
you they're they're they're pretty predictable so my gut feeling is that

379
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,680
that's what's going on here i suspect that this is a primitive

380
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,200
version a very early version of of surprise minimization

381
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,360
that the reason they're traveling together is uh because they're trying to

382
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,320
minimize joint free energy or some such thing i'm sure carl would

383
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,760
would say it much more much more elegantly but but i think that's probably

384
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,880
what's going on here they're they're traveling together for as long as they

385
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,320
can because it minimizes their uncertainty about

386
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,200
their environment and we again notice that they don't have any explicit

387
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,560
mechanism for this there's nothing in the algorithm that says

388
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,400
uh you know make a prediction to compare it to your

389
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,360
reward model that there's nothing in there it's it's it's emergent

390
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,640
although this is emergent and i think it's consistent with

391
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,480
carl and chris and and other people when they apply this active

392
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,480
inference framework to particles you know they apply it to things that do not

393
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,000
have explicit mechanisms and we knew this from a long time ago

394
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,400
when you do um some kind of a least action model and you say hey look this

395
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,680
beam of light gets to where it picks the path

396
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,440
where it loses the you know the least amount of of effort

397
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,720
right and you say yeah but how does that work it doesn't have any mechanisms

398
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,760
inside to compute all the paths and right it doesn't have explicit

399
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,960
mechanisms for it but i think this is what we're learning is that you don't

400
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,360
need explicit mechanisms to do some of this stuff

401
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,680
that's and i think that's really important well there's an aspect of

402
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,880
with you know the path of least resistance for light

403
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,040
which i imagine has to do with like permissivity

404
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,640
which is that if you're traveling through a field

405
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,000
where there's a bunch of different potential paths

406
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,880
one path will have less resistance than a different path and so you fall and

407
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,880
that that's i've realized that you know physics

408
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,280
doesn't necessarily have a material model for light like it's field

409
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:31,000
but i think that there is probably a material property of of the substances

410
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
that it's traveling through that that affects it like one atom

411
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,840
will transmit light more easily than a different atom

412
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,720
and so when i think about the sorting algorithms

413
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,560
my first thought is algorithms take different amounts of time to run

414
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,080
right and so do you think that there's an aspect of

415
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,800
time that is important here where you have

416
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,040
the information of a of one sorting algorithm

417
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,400
is more quickly accessible than the information

418
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,480
of let's say another and so they're running on different time scales

419
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,560
and so at the beginning when they're sorting they're sorting relative to

420
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,480
which neighbor has a an answer that matches the time scale

421
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,400
of the cell itself does that make sense yeah it does um

422
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,440
yeah it's an interesting it's it's definitely an interesting point i mean

423
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,720
the thing just to go back and and i'm not a physicist so i don't want to get

424
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,920
like too deep into this and say something stupid but my understanding of

425
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,680
the the least what's cool about the least action business is that

426
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,880
you're right of course the different paths of different permissivities but

427
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,120
in order to pick the right path in some sense you have to try them all out

428
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,160
right you don't know that you're on the least path until unless you have some

429
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,000
information about all of them and and so and so that that kind of

430
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,320
non-locality i i think i think in in our case in

431
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,960
the case of the the algorithms there could well be a time component because

432
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,520
in order to know whether your neighbor is like you or not

433
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,280
you need to spend some time with them so so one of the things we're doing now is

434
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,160
tracking their life histories to figure out things like well how much time do

435
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,760
you need to spend next to someone before you decide that hey they're like me or

436
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,360
they're not like me and i think that um uh the active

437
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,960
inference framework is going to make some clear predictions about that you know

438
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,160
in terms of i'm just just in general bayesian you know reasoning is going to

439
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,080
just going to tell you like how many experiences do you need to have

440
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,400
with someone before you know whether their policies are surprising to you or

441
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,560
not right um again underlying the underlining the

442
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,320
idea that none of this is explicit these things don't have the the algorithms

443
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,920
don't have explicit code for doing any of that but we can track it from from

444
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,840
you know from observations so so stay tuned this is this is super super

445
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,600
early still um but i do think it's interesting that

446
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,040
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a discussion with uh with carlin also mark solans

447
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,280
about this because you know it has this it to me anyway maybe

448
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,680
maybe they'll tell me this is nonsense but to me it has this weird um

449
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,440
resonance with uh this idea of of conscious and unconscious drives

450
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,120
right we tell stories about why we did things and you sort of have this like

451
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,400
logical thatcher algorithm those like i well i did it because xyz

452
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
but it turns out that actually there may be some underlying pattern that isn't

453
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,920
apparent to you at all and may or may not be apparent to somebody else who's a

454
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,360
different observer may you know maybe an analyst a psychoanalyst or whatever

455
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,680
who's looking and say yeah well you think that's what you did and in that local

456
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,040
you know in that situation that story kind of makes sense but look at the

457
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,840
bigger pattern if you look at the bigger pattern you find out that

458
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,600
actually you tend to xyz right and so i just wonder whether this is also a

459
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,280
really minimal model of how we understand implicit goals which are

460
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,120
there directly in whatever um algorithm you're following uh sorry those would

461
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,840
be explicit goals and then and then there are some implicit goals

462
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,040
that you're following and i have no idea where those come from right and that's

463
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,080
i think that's an exciting area for the futures to figure out where they come

464
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:15,320
i'm curious about the instrumentalization of this because it seems well is is that

465
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,240
the goal of studying these systems is so that perhaps you can program these

466
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,840
bio bots eventually to towards some end and then if that is the case is it ideal

467
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,600
for the bio bots to be intelligent like would you really want them choosing

468
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,440
their own goals or making decisions um perhaps it is but but it's it's a bit

469
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,440
hazy for me how that would be useful um yeah yeah that's a that's a great point

470
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,840
well well the first let's just let's just start off here uh if they if in fact they

471
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,240
do have their own goals we would love to know about that before we use them in

472
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,400
some particular context right and this is true with bots it's true with bacteria

473
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,800
with CAR T cells with swarm robotics with the internet of things with financial

474
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,400
institutions with social structures if these things are going to have goals

475
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,480
beyond what we think of when we built them we need to know about it right so

476
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,440
whether you whether you want them to have goals or not they may or may not so

477
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,200
you need to know so it seems like the the on the spot developments of goals

478
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,320
right the changing of goals is i guess more what i was concerned about you know

479
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,160
if they decide well we had this goal before but now we're now we've changed

480
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,160
our minds so to speak yeah yeah second order right second order goals you know

481
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:34,520
choosing your own goals again i don't know that that and by the way i've made no

482
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,880
claims that either the answer or either either the bots or the algorithms do

483
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,720
that all we've done so far is find some goals they have that we don't didn't

484
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,720
know about we i've made no claims that they have the second order ability to

485
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,520
choose their goals but if that's true we need to know right whether that's

486
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,360
whether that's true or not so that's that's the first step now why now let's

487
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,280
answer the other question why do you want them to have goals well

488
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,760
imagine um think of uh the the spectrum of of intelligence all the way from

489
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,480
very simple machines that do very specific things and they're sort of you know

490
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,440
whatever else happens they're just going to do the same thing over again

491
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,240
all the way through various cybernetics creations that have goal directed

492
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,040
abilities and then some animals that can be trained and then some humans that

493
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,600
can set their own goals to some extent and so on um think about think about

494
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,840
medicine you know biomedicine uh where do our interventions fit on that scale

495
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,640
right now almost all of with with only a couple interesting examples all of our

496
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,520
interventions are way on the left side of that spectrum

497
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,520
they're extremely simple mechanical things drugs for example right so

498
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,000
typical drugs they just do what they do they're not context sensitive

499
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,640
if they're binding something they're going to bind it and that's it and

500
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,680
whether that's good for you or bad for you and this is why we're having

501
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,840
massive divergence of efficacy and side effects in people because they just do

502
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,040
what they do imagine if we could get beyond that and we could have

503
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,080
interventions that are higher agency interventions where you could push some

504
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,120
of the complexity onto the reagent such that it would have some and so so now

505
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,880
the obvious thing that people think about here are like smart insulin pumps

506
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,520
right they don't just sort of pump out you know they have a little bit of

507
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,520
sensing and they kind of know what's going on right so smart insulin pumps um

508
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,720
I think our example which I think we talked about last time

509
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,320
of HCN2 which is this ion channel that we use to

510
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,200
repair various birth defects that's a step in this direction because that

511
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,320
that the drugs that open that channel are they act in a context sensitive way

512
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,680
that's what allows them to fix very complex structures like brain face heart

513
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,000
and gut it's not because they do the same thing no

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,960
matter what they're actually trying to do a very

515
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,000
particular thing which is to increase voltage depending on what's going on in

516
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,520
the environment increase the difference in voltage the

517
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,040
sharpen the boundaries so that's that's already a step up

518
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,640
and I think that what what the opportunity here is with the for

519
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,360
specifically with the antherobots and we could talk about what they do and why

520
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,840
is we can take advantage of the various competencies of parts of your own body

521
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,000
in this case these are tracheal cells from the same

522
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
patient to do complex things that we have no idea how to

523
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,760
how to force in medicine so we could take advantage of the intelligence of

524
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,200
your own cells to heal things and to do sensing in

525
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,960
both directions of the push meaning meaning to to heal and to improve

526
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,560
and then to to read which is the the sensing side you know

527
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,840
these cells probably know more about each other than we even know

528
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,680
to ask questions about nevermind have sensors for and so I think having these

529
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,840
kind of reagents that actually do have a processing they have

530
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,000
you know signal detection amplification memory decision making readouts

531
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,400
all of these things that are part of a a a simple cognitive system

532
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,080
you you want your your medical intervention to have that because

533
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,680
then you can do things that we couldn't possibly micromanage

534
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,800
and the thing that we found the antherobots could do which is just

535
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:11,320
mind-boggling to me is that if you if you put them on a

536
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,760
on a on a scratch that you've made in the two-dimensional culture of neurons

537
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,440
so you take human pluripotent stem cell derived neurons you grow a

538
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,040
lawn of them on a on a on a petri dish you scratch

539
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,240
you put a scratch through it that's that's you know so when people use that

540
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,560
as a simple model of wound healing it's a scratch

541
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,800
scratch assay you put down these antherobots and what they'll do is over a

542
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,920
few days they'll they'll take the edges of that wound

543
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,840
and they'll knit the they'll knit the neurons together now who knew

544
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,920
who could have said that um the cells of your trachea which

545
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,040
normally sit there quietly for whatever 80 plus years

546
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,560
that if you that if you let them go and let them reboot their life

547
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,000
they can actually run around on their own and find neural

548
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,720
wounds to heal and who knows what else i mean that was just the first thing you

549
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,640
try it who knows what else what else they know how to do

550
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,400
like that's that's a competency of these cells that we had no idea about

551
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,000
and again it's that sort of thing where uh i'm sure somebody reading that paper

552
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,720
could say well uh there must be some pro you know pro neural molecule that

553
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,280
they're putting out and i'm sure we'll find it yeah no

554
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,840
sure of course there's going to be a physical explanation for it's not going

555
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,400
to be magic there's going to be there's going to be some after the fact there's

556
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,160
going to be some explanation for it which we are of course investigating

557
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,200
but how come no theory predicted that ahead of time how come we didn't know to

558
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
expect that that's what i think is much more

559
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,400
interesting it's easy to tell stories afterwards the question is

560
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,080
you know uh yeah how you know what what what what models what models in world

561
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,880
used you have to get you to do the experiment in the first place

562
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,800
and so that being the first thing we tried my my i don't think you know we

563
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,600
should be playing the lottery every day it's we're not the luckiest people in

564
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,760
the world i think what this is telling us is that they have tons of unexpected

565
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,520
capacities and we're going to be of course looking for these

566
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,120
is naming them bots ambitious or because it seems like you're you want to have

567
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,200
control over their behavior that's the way i think about robots anyways

568
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,080
i'm not a robotic scientist or anything but

569
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,800
do you is that the ultimate goal is to tell them exactly what part of the

570
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,280
dish to go to or what which of the cuts to heal perhaps

571
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,520
something like that and and what what's the road to that

572
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,280
yeah um well first first let's just talk about the terminology for a moment

573
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,000
yeah um it's it's certainly true that we could have just called them organoids

574
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,680
uh but but the thing with organoids is that organoids are typically

575
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,760
the perp so so here's what i think words are for and and nomenclature is for i

576
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,480
think words are um just protocols for for interacting with something

577
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,600
so so when you name something what you're doing is

578
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,120
facilitating or preventing ways to interact with it so if you call it a if

579
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,920
you call something an organoid what you're really saying is

580
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,040
i'm focused on making this as uh as as best of a model of the of the real

581
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,480
organ as possible i want it to be exact i'm going to screen drugs on it i'm

582
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,800
going to you know study airway biology i want it to be a little

583
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,200
model of a lung that's what i want by calling it bot what i'm saying is

584
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,080
yes all that and there are plenty of people who have made airway organoids

585
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,160
and and and so on but actually there's much more here to do because because

586
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,000
you can we can in fact in the future program them and this this came up

587
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,640
when we were doing the zenobots people said why are you calling them zenobots

588
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,680
i mean developmental biologists who who study amphibian embryos have seen

589
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,080
ciliated epithelium for decades we call them animal caps

590
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,280
these are just animal caps why why do you need a new word for and i couldn't

591
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,480
say it at the time because this stuff was was not published but

592
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,760
the point is yeah and if you call them animal caps you'll never make an

593
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,800
anthrabot because because why would you because if

594
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
because that's an amphibian specific embryonic thing why would you take an

595
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,800
adult human trachea that you wouldn't get there

596
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,040
and so words have real power they they they tell you how you're thinking about

597
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,320
something and they facilitate once you once you call them bots you say well

598
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,760
bots can be made out of a lot of things maybe it's not just a frog thing maybe

599
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,200
we could make this out of out of human cells right and so they facilitate so

600
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,320
that's what i'm interested in is terminology that facilitates research

601
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,240
programs and um and so and so yeah so the future

602
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,280
is definitely to program them in in various ways

603
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,160
uh much like with the zenobots you know the first three zenobot papers

604
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,240
were basically just studying the native properties of these things and so i mean

605
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,000
you dug did some super cool stuff about sculpting them and and and so on

606
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,840
but the thing is uh what what what i really want to do

607
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,920
is focus on surprising native capacities because if the first thing we

608
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,120
did was knock in a bunch of synthetic biology circuits

609
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,400
people would say ah well but you've engineered the heck out of them so yes

610
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,280
of course they do whatever you made them do and that's fine

611
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,720
i want to say we've we've in the in the case of the anthrabots we've done

612
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,320
almost nothing to them right we've so so gizem came up with it with a with a

613
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,440
protocol to to get them to to grow from a single cell

614
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,480
and then turn inside out so that the cilia are on the outside surface and all

615
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,880
that but but we didn't do anything to make them heal uh neural

616
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,480
wounds they already do that and and that that i think is really

617
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,360
valuable because yes of course we'll get to programming them and this means

618
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,640
giving them all sorts of stimuli when they're assembling and it means putting

619
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,320
in different cell types perhaps and it means training them maybe so we haven't

620
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,600
we haven't shown that yet but we're working on that both with them and with

621
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,480
the zenobots uh can they be trained can they be you

622
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,440
know what native preferences do they have all that kind of stuff

623
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,360
um that that will all come but but what i think is really critical much like

624
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,520
what the algorithms is to say we thought we knew what tracheal

625
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,880
epithelium does and we thought we knew what organoids are for and look there's

626
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,160
a lot more to it than that

627
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,040
yeah that make that clears it up a lot it's interesting that in some sense that

628
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,120
golf between doing what you want and doing what they want

629
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,400
is both dangerous and exciting and it it seems like there's a lot of crossover

630
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,600
with the ai world because a lot of people are very concerned with that

631
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,520
valley between the two now do you have conversations with ai

632
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,440
engineers about the similarities and what you're finding

633
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,360
yeah yeah um yes and and there's some uh there's some fun that

634
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,760
twitter threads are about it too um uh and and we have you know about

635
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,760
probably a quarter of my group is uh uh computational machine learning

636
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,880
expert so we certainly you know we certainly think about that stuff a lot

637
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,080
um yeah i i think i think the main limiting factor in a lot of these

638
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,040
discussions is that they take place in a vacuum that neglects the wider context

639
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,800
of diverse intelligence i mean people people well first

640
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,560
of all first of all this this this focus on specifically language models and

641
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,240
things like that it that's like a tiny corner of what's

642
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,360
actually coming right diverse intelligence is gonna be so much more

643
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,760
challenging and interesting than than than just what we have now and that's

644
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,120
really important i think a lot of people are not not i'm not getting it and

645
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,160
also you know a lot of people are saying things like

646
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,520
it's it's intelligent like us and therefore it's dangerous there are plenty

647
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,640
things that are incredibly dangerous that are not intelligent like us you don't

648
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,920
need to be super intelligent to be extremely dangerous you don't need to

649
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,840
be like us to be intelligent like there are all kinds of leaps here that

650
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,720
people tend to make that i think are not warranted but just um

651
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,680
just in general like a real uh

652
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,360
understanding of the fact that intelligence can be uh expressed in

653
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,440
unfamiliar guises and some and some humility around like how bad we really

654
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,720
are at recognizing other other forms of it you know besides what we're

655
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,520
used to would be what i would be i think really useful and

656
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,040
essential i think it's an existential need for us going forward if we're

657
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,960
going to survive with the antherbots and the xenobots

658
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,720
both they're derived from organisms that have

659
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,120
immune systems and the action of cells migrating to a place where

660
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,320
there is a wound seems really immune like to me

661
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,640
do you think that there is a significant relationship between

662
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,120
those two functions where there is a certain drive inside

663
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,120
the body to produce cells that will heal that is

664
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,280
encoded somehow in the substrate genetically where it's like once you

665
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,600
liberate a cell from its context there's some sort of other

666
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,640
deeper level programming which is like okay my job now that i'm free

667
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,640
since i'm not a cancer cell is to do the the opposite of proliferate

668
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,320
and is in fact to go into fix yeah um that's a very interesting hypothesis i

669
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,880
mean these are uh epithelial cells are not specifically

670
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,320
immune cells and in the in normally in the body they don't do any of that they

671
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,000
just sit quietly basically but but i like i like where you're going with

672
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,240
this and i think that one advantage that these things

673
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,920
have over other kinds of um robotics that we might make or drugs or various

674
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,120
other things is that they probably share with us the

675
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,960
priors about what it's like to be healthy about about what's good

676
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,200
about being a being because not only are they mammals not only are they human

677
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,680
not only but but they're also your own cells so it's entirely plausible to me

678
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,640
now we haven't proven any of this i want to be super clear we don't know that

679
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,600
they home to wounds we don't know what they can recognize

680
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,000
you know we don't know any of that um but it's very plausible to me that they

681
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,560
share with us this notion of what damages and what repair is

682
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,240
um yeah this this this may be you know this may be

683
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,960
something that that is really uh advantageous about this technology

684
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,680
you know is that you don't have to teach them what's good and bad about

685
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:05,480
being a multicellular organism and from from what i read of the

686
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,000
antherbot's paper the way that you're generating these cells is that you take

687
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,480
them you grow them in an extracellular matrix that's three-dimensional

688
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,160
from single cells and then you put them into

689
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,360
what you call it a low viscosity medium and in the low viscosity medium you see

690
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,440
these changes occur and

691
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,600
the changes are like you said pretty stark so you have these

692
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,520
these cells that normally would be ciliated

693
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,440
on the interior of the cells you turn them so that they're ciliated on the

694
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,760
outside and so all of a sudden you have this

695
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,960
motile collection of cells and

696
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:52,600
i wonder if you have looked to see what the actual changes are inside of the

697
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,840
cell that permits this kind of new organization

698
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,600
as a consequence of the different growth conditions

699
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:07,160
yeah um no we we don't know the details yet it's

700
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,920
the change is a multicellular in other words

701
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,080
it's not an individual cell that does much of anything it's the whole thing

702
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,920
turns itself inside out so you start with a ball where the cili are pointing

703
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,440
into the center of the ball and then then the whole thing just turns inside out

704
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,080
when when we wash it out of the out of the matrix it turns inside out

705
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:32,520
now what exactly does that we we don't know my gut feeling is that there are

706
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,600
going to be some pathways looking that that probably

707
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,440
would look like embryonic gastrulation and some things like that i'm going to

708
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,040
guess it's probably reusing some of that that's a total guess we don't know

709
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,080
yeah the answer is we don't know but embryonic gastrulation to me

710
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,440
is a almost quasi stem cell property

711
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,360
where it's where stem cells probably the wrong the wrong word to use but

712
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,000
there's early development like early development like they

713
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,400
aren't differentiated to their context yet and so

714
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,000
do you think that it's just a property of cells that once you take them out

715
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,360
of the context of the body where they have grown used to being and now you

716
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,000
put them into this matrix where they have to

717
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,080
recontextualize themselves that this is an opportunity for them to

718
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,760
to kind of redesign their own their own relationship to the environment

719
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,200
suddenly that's that that is a yeah that's a great

720
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,280
point uh what this is all currently under investigation

721
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,240
uh do they think they're recapitulating some kind of embryogenesis we

722
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,880
we don't know so so the xenobots for example the normal xenobot

723
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,480
lives for about a week but we've been able to if

724
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,240
if you feed them and keep them ridiculously clean

725
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,320
they can go longer and they will go uh i think our record is like

726
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,920
84 days or something and during those weeks

727
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,680
it changes shape it changes shape it becomes transparent it

728
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,720
it does some other stuff and uh i don't know is that is that some new

729
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,920
developmental sequence that you know that normally

730
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,800
no no one ever does um yeah we you know we we don't know and the same thing with

731
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,320
the anthrobots like like is this uh is this a developmental

732
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,360
sequence basically for this it does it think it's an embryo we're gonna find

733
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,480
out we're doing all the you know we're we're characterizing all the new

734
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,000
genes that they express both the xenobot and the anthrobot side

735
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,280
uh yeah we're gonna we're gonna find out but we don't know yet

736
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,160
there was a there was a science fiction story i want to say it was

737
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,720
arthur clark but maybe not uh a long time ago where um

738
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,640
they cracked uh aging and so people started living longer

739
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,960
and what they found out was that at around 120 humans undergo all these

740
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,440
changes it's just you've never seen it before because nobody ever lived that

741
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,960
long and so you know they start growing a third like a new set of teeth and all

742
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,040
this stuff and i think i think at the end

743
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,640
what i think they they grew wings and look like angels i forget what it was

744
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,200
but but it was the point where yes actually there was this new

745
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,600
developmental stage it's just you know what you we had didn't access it before

746
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,520
but but so so maybe this is like that maybe these these things have a new

747
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,440
a new developmental sequence that they can do i don't know

748
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,920
it seems like uh when i think about the major health crises

749
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,960
let's say the threats in most people's lives assuming they don't die from an

750
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,040
accident or something it's cancer and heart disease

751
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,640
and those are very different bioengineering projects

752
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,360
one where you're in the case of cancer perhaps trying to

753
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,320
teach cells how to behave themselves again something like that

754
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,520
i mean i suppose the approach right now is to just destroy them

755
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,760
but i i i suppose ultimately you would want your bots to be teachers

756
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,360
in a sense and perhaps it's similar with with

757
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,280
cardiovascular disease as well but that seems like more of a

758
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,640
a repair in the wound healing sense uh perhaps a cleanup job

759
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,400
is there some uh well do you think about this

760
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,400
in terms of the bots in terms of what their ultimate functionality will be

761
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,400
in terms of maybe not simply joining or or obeying some

762
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,480
specific program goal but in terms of teaching and

763
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,200
interacting with their new environments and

764
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,080
re-instructing them and what yeah what is the future of that look like

765
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:26,520
in your mind yeah i think that uh there's a there's a few there's a few

766
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,680
different uh use cases for the bots the most

767
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,360
the most obvious things are we're going to make

768
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,480
useful synthetic living machines for specific purposes

769
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,560
so maybe they drop off pro regenerative molecules maybe they clean up cancer

770
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,240
cells maybe they scrape the plaque off your artery

771
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,560
walls maybe they they clean up arthritic knee

772
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,800
joints they repair you know retina or spinal cord we like

773
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,440
very specific things so so we'll be some of that

774
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,720
i i think bigger picture what both they and the xenobots

775
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:05,000
are are a kind of uh platform in which we get to learn to control morphogenesis

776
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,200
so so cracking the code the mapping between

777
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,440
the experiences you received as a cell and the pattern that a group of you are

778
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,760
going to build because if we solve that that's it that's a completely

779
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,400
different path to regenerative medicine that has nothing to do with the bots

780
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,840
per se in other words at some point we're going to know

781
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,680
how to grow a new heart how to grow new limbs how to grow new organs why you

782
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,800
know and and and the stuff what we're working on right now in the lab which

783
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,000
is trying to understand why do they forget why do

784
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,280
tissues forget what the correct pattern is why does everything fall apart after

785
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,080
some number of decades right so so using the bots as a kind of sandbox

786
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,520
platform to understand how do collections of cells make decisions

787
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,400
about what they're going to do so that's kind of that's kind of the second

788
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,880
thing and then there's this is more philosophical stuff but

789
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,480
but but for biomedicine right there are the direct use cases and then

790
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,000
there's the bigger picture of you know what we really want is complete control

791
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,960
over growth and form that's that's what we really do do you imagine that to be

792
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,560
like an in situ process at the end of the day or is it ex vivo are you going to

793
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,360
be growing the do you imagine these medical technicians

794
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,280
i don't know how many years from now are growing these externally and replacing

795
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,600
diseased organs or is it more something that's happening inside of the body

796
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,360
like you're actually you know in the sense reprogramming your body or giving

797
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,280
it the external environment that needs in order to regenerate itself

798
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,920
it seems like two very different approaches yeah i think i think uh long

799
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,400
term it's all going to be in situ and uh

800
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,960
in in the meantime are we going to crack the uh ex vivo morphogenesis and

801
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,920
transplant before we crack the in vivo stuff i'm not sure

802
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,760
i'm not sure uh down the line it's it's it's all going to be

803
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,520
it's all going to be in vivo but maybe maybe maybe the uh

804
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,360
the bioengineered organs will get cracked first i'm not sure

805
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,120
that seems to be the more traditional approach as far as i can tell

806
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,560
you know we are we're already doing organ transplants with varying levels of

807
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,320
success um obviously the huge advantage here is

808
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,480
just that you have ideally your own cells right or

809
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,000
something that matches and you don't have the horrible immune problems with the

810
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,560
transplantation yeah um i mean so you could argue

811
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,640
both ways on the one hand you could say well uh just just growing a specific or

812
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,680
a single specific organ should be easier and then we'll just

813
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,840
pop it in maybe but but look at look at for example the case so

814
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:34,200
so back in 2010 or so we show that there's a particular um bioelectric

815
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,720
pattern that causes frog embryos to make new eyes

816
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,800
in weird locations when your eyes on the gut on the tail whatever

817
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,200
um we are nowhere near being able to bioengineer

818
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,400
and grow an eye in in vitro right i mean so so so people have shown like if you

819
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,920
explained the eye progenitor cells and you sort of

820
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,560
leave them alone they can make an optic cup and some things like that

821
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,320
but but it's not that it's not that we knew how to how to engineer an eye eyes

822
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,960
are very complex they have lots of different tissue types

823
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,400
what we simply did was to take advantage of the competency of the material

824
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,400
meaning the cells of the in vivo they they they know how to make an eye

825
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,040
they they've already done it twice they they certainly have all that

826
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,160
information what you need to be able to do is convince them to do it again

827
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,440
somewhere else and so if you look at this problem as

828
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,280
can i micromanage the cells to be an organ

829
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,800
you know using traditional bioengineering maybe we make a bladder

830
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,960
maybe we make you know ears are not hard we can make things where we can make a

831
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,280
scaffold we see a bunch of cells on tops

832
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,480
maybe 3d print some things maybe you know you might think that's the way to go

833
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,480
but i actually think the easier way to do it is not to try to control

834
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,840
any of that it's to convince the collective what you want them to build

835
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,680
and just do that in vivo where the surrounding material is

836
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,240
is basically much smarter than we are about how it's done

837
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,800
so i'm not sure i we'll see how we will see how it goes

838
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,320
there's a really interesting aspect of this where if you can

839
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:10,360
reprogram an embryo to grow eyes in places where you wouldn't expect eyes

840
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,120
okay so there's two places where my mind immediately goes number one

841
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,840
there's a certain permissivity of the embryo

842
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,280
where the entire context of the being is that okay we are in the process we are

843
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,720
we are we are creating the structure we get instructions

844
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,320
we make it and then we get to a place where we cease our differentiation

845
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,160
and the structures are more or less fixed and they get repaired in place

846
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,480
and so one question and you can you can go either way with us

847
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,200
is a do you think that once the structures are fixed you have a completely

848
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,800
different problem where you would then have to inflict some kind of damage

849
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,680
in order to get them to regenerate and number two which is kind of orthogonal

850
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,520
is the eyes that form in places where you don't expect

851
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,960
are they then wired into the brain in the way that you would expect

852
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,960
yeah let me let me do the first one and then remind me of the second one

853
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,640
because i'll forget by the time i'm done

854
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,880
the first thing i want to say which is which is kind of a cool point it has to do with

855
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:25,160
the permissivity or the competency so and this is something that one of these things that i

856
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,640
couldn't you know say back in 2010 but now now that we're talking about development as a

857
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,200
as a collective intelligence process now we can start to think about it this way

858
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,880
if you look in the developmental biology textbook they will tell you that only in the frog

859
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,480
only the anterior norectoderm so the stuff you know basically from here up is competent to be i

860
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,280
and it's that's the only stuff that can make i and the reason is because if you prompt it with

861
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,400
what they call the master i gene which is this thing called pack six then yeah that those are

862
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:03,560
the only regions that ever make i but it turns out that actually that limited competency and

863
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,240
developmental biology competency is a narrow definition which is what it's able to make

864
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,360
i use it more broadly but more generically the competency of your material is opaque to you

865
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,560
unless you probe it with the correct prompt we need to and this is you know when people say

866
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,360
aw it can't do this you know this this doesn't do that whenever you're making an assessment

867
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,880
and an assessment of intelligence in some system you are basically taking an IQ test yourself as

868
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,000
an external observer you are saying this is what i have noticed how to make it do that doesn't mean

869
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,320
that's all it knows how to do that's just what you know so so in this is a great case for that

870
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,680
because actually it turns out that if you go to the bioelectric level no i have almost any cell

871
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,920
in as far as we can tell any region in the in the tadpole is it is competent to do this we just

872
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,760
didn't know that because we were using the wrong prompt and so and so this should all of this everything

873
00:59:52,760 --> 01:00:01,240
we've talked about should really fill us with significant humility about about what we know

874
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,440
about the material that we're working with you don't necessarily know if you know i've i don't

875
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,440
know if you've ever seen these things i've got pictures of them on my blog and and a couple of

876
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,480
papers um these these plant galls you know these amazing just about to ask about that because they

877
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:23,640
create these insane structures prompted by the presence of like wasps and bugs that move inside

878
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:29,560
the leaves yeah and and if you didn't know that if you didn't have that example you would never

879
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:34,040
in a million years say that the that the oak genome could make this red spiky brown thing you

880
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,960
would say no it makes a flat green leaf and and it takes a living bioengineer who as dan

881
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,000
then it would say you know competency without comprehension uh is able to to prompt the leaf

882
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,800
to do this crazy to build this crazy thing you would never know it knows how to do that so um

883
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,720
that's uh you know that that's the important thing is that we really need to understand the

884
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:01,400
competency of our material and what what we're working with and i i actually don't think that

885
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:07,080
adulthood is when all of that ceases there's a there's a there's a ship a thesis thing going on

886
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,880
here which is that in a standard body right cells and materials are coming and going all the time

887
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:18,920
and you need to be able to um it's this thing like uh like like in allison wonderland where you uh

888
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,160
you have to work really hard to stay in one place you you in order to maintain a body you

889
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,400
can't just say well okay now i don't need this information i you know i'm just gonna hang out

890
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,720
you will not last very long um and and i think there probably are insects in other organisms

891
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,200
that that you know that live a day or a couple of days where that's where that's true but typically

892
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:44,920
if you want to persist you have to continuously re repair remodel replace and and and so on and um

893
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:53,080
so so i think uh the only thing that happens during uh during maturation is that the scale

894
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:58,680
of those projects gets smaller so instead of re shaping the whole embryo during neuralation and

895
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:04,040
gastrulation all that you're now saying okay well these few cells are gone how do i maintain the

896
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:09,240
integrity of my epithelium and things like that right so but but i think i think that process of

897
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:18,840
of homeostasis anatomical homeostasis which which i am really into is uh continues your your whole

898
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:25,800
life and and without that process uh i in fact that's what i think aging is is a is a a defect in

899
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:31,160
that process it's just it's basically a you know i think i think aging is a version of failure to

900
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,120
regenerate it's a which and development is basically just a set of regenerative repairs

901
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,840
from each embryonic stage to the next stage i think all of this boils down to regenerative

902
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:47,960
remodeling which boils down to homeostasis humans can't really grow gauze though sorry say again i

903
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:55,000
said humans can't really grow gauze though which is we don't know that we don't know that you know

904
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,560
sure sure i guess i guess the only thing that i'm saying is that if i think about the various human

905
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,000
diseases right because if if there's a parallel between okay oak gall would you say that that's a

906
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,400
disease no no i don't think no i don't think it's a disease i think it's uh now now there are there

907
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:19,320
are virus induced galls that uh that screw up cells and so on so and those those are basically

908
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:24,600
featureless lumps they're kind of like a tumor but maybe you can say that's a disease a standard one

909
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,960
of these galls i mean from the perspective of the plant it might be a disease but i i think

910
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,440
it's morphogenetic hacking i think i think all you've done is you've with the what the wasp has

911
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,960
done is to um hack the material to go to undertake a different journey in morpheus space and i don't

912
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,760
think that's i don't think that's it that that that that's a disease do we have any sense of

913
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:52,440
what's the different morphological purpose is like why does one wasp make one gall another

914
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:57,640
wasp make another gall um i do not know there are people who study this so so um

915
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:03,640
uh insect ecologists and uh and such there are a couple of folks that i'm in touch with that study

916
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,960
that kind of stuff i i don't know uh for me the interesting thing is the space of the possible

917
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:17,160
and how little so so if you think about this giant multi-dimensional uh anatomical morpheus

918
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:23,960
space which holds all the different shapes that things can be normal standard reliable

919
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,000
development gives you one pointless tiny little keyhole into that space and all you see is the

920
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,480
embryo and the normal thing that it builds and then sometimes you have what they call developmental

921
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,920
plasticity and look this plant can have two different shapes depending on if it's a dry

922
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,600
environment or a wet okay so so instead of a single point you see kind of like a little

923
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,800
little halo or up through your keyhole but through that keyhole is a giant space of possibilities

924
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:53,480
that we are still very bad at mapping out and what i think these uh all the synthetic stuff

925
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,320
that antherobots the xenobots other other things that people the goo galls other things that people

926
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,920
build are all vehicles for exploring that space they let you they let you take that little keyhole

927
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:08,200
and like like stick your head in and look around like a like a periscope and and look around and

928
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:14,520
say here are the other possibilities you know and and what human cells can do uh well we didn't

929
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:20,600
think they made antherobots until you know we did it a few years ago so i don't know my guess is

930
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:28,760
i so so so the way to um uh kind of uh uh just just drill down on on that question is uh

931
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,360
are there any limits so people ask is there any limit to what a given cell can build and some

932
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,520
people say yeah they're called developmental constraints there are things that the i'm not

933
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:44,200
sure i believe in developmental constraints i i think that in a given context there are limits

934
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,040
to what it's going to do does that mean that if you knew what you were doing you couldn't

935
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:54,360
prompt it to do something completely different no i i think um and and again this is conjecture on

936
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,360
my part but here's here's here's what i think um that basically there are going to be like like for

937
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:06,760
example if you have planaria if planaria don't have genes to make bone you know the the the hard

938
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,560
minerals and all that okay you're not you're not going to get them to to you know to to make bone

939
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:17,000
because if the if the hardware isn't there it isn't there but beyond that in terms of shape

940
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:23,160
i'm not sure there are any limits i i don't i i just i you know i think in the end um except

941
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,880
for materials limits and the laws of physics i don't believe there's going to be any limitations

942
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:34,440
on what shape you could build i guess this ties back to the question of whether or not the eyes

943
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:40,520
are tied into the brain right because if you have a crazy body plan and all of a sudden

944
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,840
your like elementary canal is all screwed up and you're just dumping waste into your internal

945
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:54,440
cavity you're gonna have a bad time yeah so uh yeah um i'm glad you remember that um okay i'm

946
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:00,040
i'm not gonna say that there aren't ways to screw things up because absolutely there are and uh the

947
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:06,200
competency of regulative development that fixes all these problems is not infinite and there's

948
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,520
many ways to screw up an embryo for sure for sure but this is some work that um Doug Blackiston in

949
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:19,320
my group did same same person who did all the zen the zen about biology um but by the way if you

950
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:25,480
can get him on you'll have a great time uh he's he's amazing but anyway back back in the well yeah

951
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:33,320
around 2013 2014 something like that we uh we we did some experiments where what we did was we we

952
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:39,960
we grew ectopic eyes on the backs and the tails of tadpoles and we asked that question can i see

953
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,000
out of these eyes what happens when you have this new architecture is it is it functional

954
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:50,440
the the answer is super interesting first of all it turns out that yeah they can see we we we actually

955
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,880
built a machine that um trains them on on visual cues and and and and we made tadpoles that did

956
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,920
not have primary eyes but they had this you know this one eye on its tail yeah they can learn in

957
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:06,040
visual or visual assay so they can absolutely see the next question is you know you said does it

958
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,040
connect to the brain well it doesn't connect to the brain actually it connects to either the

959
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:15,080
spinal cord or in some cases nothing obvious that we can figure out and they can see anyway

960
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:24,440
so so not only is it um plastic in terms of um making the right uh the right organs and the right

961
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:34,600
structure excuse me but actually um even even the wiring is uh is up for uh is is you know is

962
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,960
is up for change and you know just imagine like you you you come into this world and you have this

963
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,520
weird itchy patch of tissue on your back like how do you even know that's visual data you know but

964
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:50,040
the brain is able to is able to use it and um and and and i'll tell you two two two fun fun things

965
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:57,720
about that one is that um we we then uh let some of those okay so imagine you got an eye on the tail

966
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:04,920
you let that animal grow eventually that tadpole is going to turn into a frog well the tail has to

967
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:10,200
disappear and what happens is normally the tail gets these signals it it degrades it you know

968
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:16,040
basically um apoptosis uh you know it eats itself and so on and then the tail disappears so we had

969
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,400
a pool going in the lab about well what's going to happen to the eye right and uh because the whole

970
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:26,200
tail is going to die what what about the eye does the eye think it's part of the tail does it so so

971
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,440
this was this was super cool and we watched this thing and uh i'm not sure if we publish i don't

972
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,920
remember if we published it but i i i got these amazing pictures of um frogs with eyes on their

973
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,600
butts because what happens is the tail gets smaller and smaller the eye gets bigger and bigger and the

974
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,040
eye of it just rides it back and eventually just ends up sitting on the butt of the frog the tail

975
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:51,960
is long gone that eye is is is perfectly clear that it's not part of the tail and it's not going to

976
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,080
you know degrade the way the tail will and we we don't know if it's functional on the adult frog

977
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,960
because we don't really have a good um behavioral method for adult frogs the way we had for tadpole

978
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,240
so i don't i don't know if the adult frog can see backwards we don't know but um but but yeah the

979
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:14,040
the eye survived the death of the tail and so just just more broadly you might think about why

980
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:19,800
i mean why is the frog why is the tadpole ready for this for for eyes to be formed like that

981
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:25,080
doesn't happen in nature why would ever and why would evolution do that and i think the lesson

982
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:31,160
that uh i think we not not just from this work but from from a lot of work is this evolution

983
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,320
i don't think makes solutions to specific problems but i think evolution does is make

984
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:42,360
problem-solving machines and part of that is the um and and i got a paper from a few months ago um

985
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:48,120
where i beat this uh you know in in significant detail this this idea that because because evolution

986
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:54,280
is working with an agential material it naturally makes systems that um that that can solve these

987
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:00,920
problems and and here's one of my favorite examples of of of this kind of thing is um this

988
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:08,600
was found back in the 40s that if you if you have a salamander and um what you can do is in in for

989
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,720
the very early embryos you can you can do this procedure which causes them to multiply their

990
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:19,400
genetic material so instead of two n you can have four n five n six n and so on so the first

991
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,320
amazing thing if you do that you still get a normal salamander so that's why it like extra

992
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,560
genetic material doesn't seem to confuse it but that's already kind of cool the next thing that

993
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:33,000
happens is that the cells get bigger in order to accommodate all that all the copies of the genome

994
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,880
but the salamander sees exactly the same size so that means that as your cells get bigger you need

995
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,000
to know to use fewer of them to build the same the exact same organs and so what what he did was he

996
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,920
took um um this was uh frank hauser and he took cross sections of this tubule that it's a kidney

997
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:53,080
tubule and he takes cross sections of it and he shows that in a normal uh animal there's like

998
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,760
eight to ten cells that go around and they sort of make this tubule in the middle is a big empty

999
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:03,640
space and then and then you make these cells big and now there's fewer there's like four or five of

1000
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:09,720
them going around so that's amazing thing number two is that if uh if your cells are the wrong size

1001
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,520
you know to adapt their numbers so that you can have the same overall structure here's the real

1002
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,400
kicker if you make the cells gigantic and i believe these were maybe like five n or six n

1003
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,920
nudes or something like that the cells are so big only one of them fits and so what does the cell

1004
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:31,000
do it bends around itself like this leaving a hole in the middle to make the exact same tubule now

1005
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,760
the reason that's super cool is that that's a different molecular mechanism in the former

1006
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,840
case you have cell to cell communication tubular genesis blah blah blah in this case you have

1007
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:45,000
cytoskeletal bending so so this is top down causation this is crazy this is calling up different

1008
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:51,000
new more different molecular mechanisms to achieve the same high level anatomical goal

1009
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,760
right that that's i mean if that's not intelligence i don't know if we had if we had any kind of a

1010
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,320
machine that could do this i mean this would be super amazing intelligence because you're

1011
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:04,200
faced with a problem you've not seen before you can you can call up different resources of yours

1012
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:10,040
to get to get the job the same job done if you're prevented from and and now think of think of the

1013
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,920
amazing thing that this that this embryo has to has to deal with i'm going to come into the world

1014
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,440
i don't know how many copies of my genetic material i'm going to have i don't know the

1015
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,200
size of my cells i don't know the number of my cells i don't know if somebody's going to cut me in

1016
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:28,520
half uh early on i have to be able to make a salamander despite all of this changes in the

1017
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:34,040
environment changes in my own parts for god's sake right like i don't i can't even depend on my own

1018
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:38,600
components i i don't know what what dna i'm gonna have but but i'm gonna make this salamander right

1019
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,160
and and so and so i think that is what evolution gives us it gives us in for many species not not

1020
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:48,360
all i'm not sure c elegans does any of that but but for for many species what evolution has given

1021
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:54,920
you is this amazing uh problem-solving machine that does not make too many assumptions about

1022
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:01,000
what the world is going to be like now you now you would think that um that's what evolution is for

1023
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,600
is to is to is to progressively over time extract information about the environment and make sure

1024
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,200
that whatever you're born in you've got the benefit of all those prior generations but in machine

1025
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,920
learning you've got this notion of overfitting you know overtraining on your examples you don't

1026
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,960
want to just memorize your training data set you want to uh you want to be smarter than that and i

1027
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,720
think um absolutely uh development is smarter than that i don't think development over trains on

1028
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,040
on on these priors i think it learns a lesson of how to solve these problems and i think really

1029
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:38,760
every life multicellular but probably all but but certainly the multicellular life

1030
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:44,280
is um is is is born into the world solving problems i don't think it you don't know what

1031
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,200
you have until you sort of take stuff and this is why you can take an early embryo and cut it

1032
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,720
into pieces and have multiple twins instead of you know half embryos and and so on yeah i know

1033
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:59,800
that shyla has a bunch of stuff uh do you want to do you want to pick up on the on the idea of the

1034
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:06,520
platonic salamander form that remains even with five n i mean i have some more like divergent

1035
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,240
philosophical questions about this regenerative medicine that i can hang out if you got if you

1036
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,840
want to keep pulling on this thread i mean the let's let's stay here for a little bit because

1037
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,160
i think the regenerative medicine is what this all kind of centers around right because we want

1038
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:28,840
to be able to see as as much as i don't like the idea of science being an instrumentalizable process

1039
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:33,720
where there's there's discovery simply for the sake of discovery we we all live within a system where

1040
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,440
the discoveries at some point need to be instrumentalized onto something in order to

1041
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:44,280
get people to really see the point of it and to really get people viscerally invested in it and

1042
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:51,640
so i think that that's that might be a good place to end but where do you think the platonic form

1043
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,720
of the salamander comes from the idea that you can take this embryo and you can screw with it you

1044
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,960
can change the genetic organization you can make the cells enormous so that it goes from

1045
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:07,000
cell cell signaling to create a kidney tubule to just one cell that wraps around it like

1046
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:15,800
what is that yeah boy uh yeah um that that is the uh the hard question isn't it um i mean i should

1047
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:24,200
say from the beginning that uh i don't know but um i think we definitely start with that but um we

1048
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:32,200
we can we can say a few things about it um one one thing is that uh

1049
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:41,480
there there are um there are a lot of what what physicists would call free lunches in this kind

1050
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:48,040
of scenario in the following in the following way imagine imagine that um you're you're running

1051
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:55,800
evolution in a particular world where the most fit um the thing is a particular kind of triangle

1052
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,520
yeah it's it's it's a certain kind of triangle so here comes evolution and it does a bunch of

1053
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,800
generations and it nails down the first angle and it optimizes the first angle and then

1054
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,760
bunch more generations and it optimizes the second angle now it's done it doesn't have to

1055
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,160
look for the third angle because we already know that once you know two angles in flat space you

1056
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:21,160
know what the third angle is supposed to be uh isn't that amazing isn't it where did that come

1057
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:28,120
from it's certainly not in the genome uh it's a free gift from the laws of geometry physics i don't

1058
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:35,720
know but but it's it's super practical because whereas one can think you know the old this this

1059
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:42,120
whole idea this this platonic Pythagorean idea of of these um these information structures that hang

1060
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,880
out somewhere else not in the physical world then when you make specific physical

1061
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,160
embodiments for them then you get to to to to to interface with them you know when you

1062
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:56,920
have a fulcrum you get to have um you know our committees uh so simple machines and things like

1063
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:05,320
that um it it it all sounds initially it all sounds very um philosophical in the bad in the

1064
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,400
in the pejorative sense it's like why we need any of that we you know it's it's all you're just adding

1065
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:15,160
you know crazy stuff onto our ontology you don't need it but when you're saving 33 percent of

1066
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:21,320
evolutionary time now this is quite practical now this is this is you you really have to ask

1067
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:26,360
where does this where do these things come from and there are tons of these throughout mathematics

1068
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:32,600
so i you know think of all the truths of number theory uh all of the all you know the distribution

1069
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:38,120
of primes all this other stuff where where where do those things hang out presumably all the all

1070
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,240
the physical structures at the beginning of the big bang that set all the you know the the

1071
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:47,160
forces the relative strengths of the forces all that all that stuff could have been completely

1072
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:55,080
different and still the truths of number theory are what they are and so i'm partial to this idea

1073
01:18:55,080 --> 01:19:02,520
that there is a platonic realm of some sort um that it does contain a bunch of free lunches that

1074
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:09,480
evolution is really good at searching it that i i don't think that what evolution is doing is

1075
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:16,280
searching the really hard space of microstates on on the on the on the output outcome i think that

1076
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:22,120
what it's really basically searching for is and this is this is a bad analogy but we don't have

1077
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:27,240
better ones yet it's searching the space of pointers into this platonic space it's searching

1078
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:32,760
for ways to capitalize on these free lunches this idea that i mean there's so many of these like

1079
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:42,520
i can imagine if you if you have a uh when you um evolve a voltage gated ion channel what you

1080
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,560
really have is a voltage gated current conductance you have a transistor and if you have a couple of

1081
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:54,360
those you can make a logic gate and when you have a logic gate you have a truth table you have the

1082
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:59,800
basis of rational thought you have a truth table and you have the fact that nand gates so not and

1083
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:05,160
gates are actually quite special compared to all the other gates so where is all that stuff all you

1084
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,920
did was make a voltage gated ion channel where'd you get all that stuff from you you didn't need to

1085
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,640
evolve a truth table you didn't need to nail down all the components uh you you get all of that for

1086
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:23,880
free and so so so i see everything we're doing as a research program in which we develop tools

1087
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:29,240
to map out that space what else is out there because because again you have to ask yourself

1088
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:34,840
what what what is this crazy world you do for you well i think what it does for you is it sensitizes

1089
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,080
you to look for things that you didn't expect things that you didn't bake in it helps you think

1090
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:46,840
about making tools to explore that right um and uh i think that the way that you know if you look at

1091
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,680
um somebody made this thing called the map of mathematics and it's just like this literally

1092
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:55,560
this map and you get different areas of math and how they relate to each other i i i think i

1093
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,920
think platonic space has a structure to it i think there are all kinds of interesting things there

1094
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:06,360
from from from geometry and the things we call geometry and algebra and and you know computation

1095
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:13,800
and so on and evolution is really good at capitalizing on some of that stuff and so so what

1096
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,920
else so so to get back to your question does does the form of the salamander hang out there

1097
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:27,400
maybe but also form and function of the antherobots and zenobots and who and galls and who knows

1098
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:34,120
what the heck else is there um and i think i think that structure is um rich i don't think it's

1099
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:38,920
flat and homogenous in the for example when we when we studied the behavior and the shape of these

1100
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:45,480
of the antherobots we didn't just see a continuum of here's every possible thing it came in in in

1101
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,120
in morphotypes it came in in in chunks like this there's this kind there's that kind there's this

1102
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:55,480
kind and so yeah i think i think this the the space has structure and i think we need to

1103
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:01,080
and so i'm i'm also working on and this this you know we'll take a little bit and we can

1104
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,560
maybe talk about it at some future time because i don't have it all worked out but i think there's

1105
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:12,200
even there's even an interesting uh thing where like under under my understanding of this of the

1106
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:17,560
standard um kind of view of this this platonic space thing is that the contents are supposed to

1107
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:21,400
be eternal and unchanging right it's sort of fixed they're all they just hang out and they are what

1108
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,600
they are and like that's it so so i'm not sure that's true i think i think we can start to develop a

1109
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:33,480
kind of chemistry of it that ways in which these things actually are active in some sense

1110
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,920
distinct from the way they actually manifest here and i think there are useful i think there

1111
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:44,120
are useful models of that that we can that we can develop to say how do those things combine and

1112
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:52,360
and change and how does that impact which ones and how we are able to implement in in you know

1113
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:56,840
in engineering and biology and so on i wonder to what extent those forms are stored in the

1114
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,160
external environment too like when you were talking about the nephron tubule things i was

1115
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:06,280
thinking i wonder how much the hydrostatic pressures and so forth are sculpting the cell

1116
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:14,120
into the form that it takes and how much of the salamander is a product of forcing by the world

1117
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:19,480
the entire i mean i hate to say the entire universe but essentially everything collaborating to make

1118
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:28,600
the salamander yeah yeah yeah it's well for sure for sure the context of those cells matters

1119
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:35,400
right and and it's entirely possible that in order to explain what's going on we need to consider

1120
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:41,560
inputs from the biophysical environment from the energetics and from the from all kinds of stuff

1121
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:47,640
i'm sure i'm sure that's true um the question is is and this isn't this is an open question

1122
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:55,560
is there a more informative meaning a more um a model that leads to better in invention

1123
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,800
where what you're talking about is ways in which those parameters index into a pre-existing space

1124
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:07,960
of options versus some other i mean frankly i don't know what the what the what the you know

1125
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,320
competing model would be but but some some way of just um you know sort of calculating locally

1126
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,480
all the forces and and things like that which i'm sure can be done the question is does it help

1127
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:30,040
you find the next thing you know there's a really interesting limit to the kinds of synthetic

1128
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:36,120
organisms that can be produced and the routes to them like i know that craig vent craig ventner

1129
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:42,920
was working on you know what is the minimal cell that can be produced and the way that they arrived

1130
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:50,440
at it was not from bottom up production it was they took a cell and they continuously deleted

1131
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:55,720
portions of it until they got to some minimum component and the minimum component was some

1132
01:24:55,720 --> 01:25:04,120
thing is like 350 protein coding genes and if you look at the papers they're pretty wonky looking

1133
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:12,520
cells like they're not really super functional anymore and there's a there's a there's a limit

1134
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:19,640
there that i think is breachable with a different kind of design right because none of ventner's

1135
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:27,000
work was about this idea of okay environment forcing parameters what can we take to produce

1136
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:38,280
a cell that rises from a different environment and matures into something new and with a salamander

1137
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:45,000
i like you could probably produce a different kind of salamander with a different kind of

1138
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:53,320
body plan with different organs but like do you think that without genetic modification you could

1139
01:25:53,320 --> 01:26:01,560
produce something that's like a bird probably not right well i'll tell you what what we have done

1140
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:13,720
in planaria so so so two examples and again on the on the on the bird thing how about those

1141
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:18,200
galls like there's no genetic modification there right like we would have again the

1142
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:23,720
looking backwards somebody's going to say oh yeah i can see how this particular growth factor is

1143
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,880
this and that right so you got flat leaf and you got gall great but the bigger issue here you would

1144
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:32,360
have not known that there's a gall you don't know what the next gall is capable of like right so

1145
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:39,080
there's more to it um here's here's what we did in planaria first of all we made two-headed planaria

1146
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:44,280
by altering the bioelectric pattern we talked about this last time there's no genetic modification

1147
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:48,200
there they're permanently two-headed so that's something it's not another species but it's

1148
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,320
definitely different than the original species so it's something also we've shown that you can

1149
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:58,520
actually make planaria with heads that belong to other species so about other species about 100 to

1150
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:06,120
150 million years evolutionary distance so again no no genetic modification now can you go can you

1151
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:10,440
go further and you can you know can you make it look like a bird you're not going to get bone

1152
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:15,560
i don't think but could you could you get patterns that look like other animals i bet you could

1153
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,360
if you've ever seen um uh there's another thing that's uh that that speaks to this those uh i

1154
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:26,360
forget i forget what the name of the the fly it's it's a little fly and on its wings it has a picture

1155
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:33,000
of ants and it's right you know i'm talking about so so yeah so so there you're what it's doing is

1156
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,360
running a stripped down like low resolution two-dimensional morphogenesis program on its on

1157
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:44,040
its wings and so i think the the reprogrammability and the virtualization is massive i think we've

1158
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:48,280
not scratched the surface of it so so you know could i tell you what the limits of that are or

1159
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:53,720
whether there are limits no i don't know but i would i would bet large amounts of money that the

1160
01:27:53,720 --> 01:28:00,520
the uh the narrow view that we have now of the mapping between genome and anatomy is way too

1161
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:13,000
narrow for reality so one of the things that comes up a lot when i when i discuss your work

1162
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,480
with people who maybe aren't scientists or aren't really thinking deeply about these questions

1163
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:24,440
is okay great we'll be able to regenerate our organs maybe we'll live for a very long time but

1164
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:30,360
the brain or the mind starts to become an issue at some point and there's something about the

1165
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:38,680
mind that's very different from a kidney in that it seems to be that the cells the functionality

1166
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:44,120
of the brain let's say i i know that the mind is sort of delocalized but let's say the central

1167
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:50,600
nervous system or whatever you want to call it the thinking machine of the body those cells

1168
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,400
patterning depends on their experience and so if you had a disease of the brain like a

1169
01:28:55,480 --> 01:29:04,360
brain tumor or something in terms of treating damage to the brain or regenerating the brain

1170
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:13,400
is it conceivable that we'll be able to in some sense pattern these experiences without

1171
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:18,840
having gone through the entire path of the life in order to have those connections it just seems

1172
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:25,800
like kind of the the expert level regenerative medicine would be this very dynamic architecture

1173
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:35,000
this this web like network which it just depends on on a past almost in a way that perhaps a kidney

1174
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,680
doesn't is that something you've given any thought to yeah yeah yeah we yeah i think about this a

1175
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:46,600
lot um a few a few things um first of all uh your brain is different from the kidney but

1176
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,480
i don't think it's because the kidney doesn't think i do you know i like right now you my

1177
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:55,960
left hemisphere is having a chat with your left hemisphere and and we're sort of pretty proud

1178
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:01,240
of ourselves for having language and stuff but um there are plenty of other uh systems in the body

1179
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:07,160
that solve problems that navigate physiological and other spaces and and we just don't sense them

1180
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:12,200
anymore than we sense each other's consciousness so i'm actually not sure it's it's special in that

1181
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:18,360
way but um to address your other point about how do we how do we deal with long-term memories i'll

1182
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,560
give you i'll give you the kind of bummer idea and then the positive idea after that uh the bummer

1183
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:28,040
idea is is is this i i don't know let's let's imagine and this this goes back to like the

1184
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:32,840
traditional view of of heaven right like this idea of eternal let's say let's say your your you live

1185
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:39,000
unlimited amounts of time it's aside from any issues of regeneration or damage or anything

1186
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,320
like that it isn't obvious to me that any cognitive system can stay sane for an

1187
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:48,120
unlimited amount of time like i'm pretty sure i could keep myself busy for 10 000 years probably

1188
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:53,720
but like 10 million years i i don't know you know of a while and would you be able to integrate

1189
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,960
your experiences from 10 000 years ago at some point it's like i wonder if we just start pasting

1190
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,920
i feel like i paced over my experiences at some point you know i replaced them with new experiences

1191
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:08,120
there's obviously the cognitive psychological modeling where we're constantly rehearsing our

1192
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:14,280
memories as we go and it's not clear that you would even have access to your experience at

1193
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:18,680
some range and that would maybe that's what you mean by going insane is you just lose track of who

1194
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:24,920
you are i'm worried about more than that actually in that in that case um so so so it's entirely

1195
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:31,960
possible and for example i'm i'm pretty sure that uh you know most of my memories past a few years

1196
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:37,320
ago are pasted to a certain degree in the sense that if somebody said oh no you got that all wrong

1197
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,920
this is how it really went down and we have video i'd be like all right i suppose that's it

1198
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,880
like fine you know like i i don't know that my memories really go like you know that i would

1199
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,800
really trust to go back very far at all anyway so so that's fine maybe that would just keep happening

1200
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:57,880
and i think that some creatures like could could a dog stay perfectly sane and happy on a farm with

1201
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:02,280
rabbits to chase and all that good stuff for like a billion years like maybe right maybe every day

1202
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,520
would be as joyous as every other day and it would all be super cool like maybe that's fine

1203
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:13,640
could a human do that i'm not sure i'm just not sure i don't know um but uh but let's let's let's

1204
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:18,760
let's talk about the more the more realistic case um i think i think it's actually a lot a lot more

1205
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:27,240
hopeful than than it sounds for the following reason uh the work on planaria and this was uh

1206
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:31,800
first discovered by mcconnell in the 60s and 70s and then we replicated the important parts of it

1207
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:39,320
in 2013 ourselves um they that you can train them and then you can cut off their entire head

1208
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,800
brain and all and the tail will sit there doing nothing over the next eight days it regenerates

1209
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:49,480
a new brain and now they remember the original information assuming and when we have to say

1210
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:54,200
it's an assumption i don't know what the alternative is but let's let's assume that it's stored elsewhere

1211
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:00,040
in the body what that shows is that you can actually imprint information onto a new developing

1212
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:04,280
brain because until then they do nothing it's only once the brain is there that you see the

1213
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:09,160
behavior whatever the information was maybe it was neural maybe it wasn't maybe it's holographic

1214
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:14,120
throughout you know there's an amazing book called shuffle brain um about salamanders by this guy paul

1215
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:19,640
peach and uh incredible and and he talks about this holographic theory of memory but maybe it's

1216
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:26,440
all over the body who knows uh it's imprinted on the new brain now i'm not saying we're exactly

1217
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,000
like planaria but they're telling us that it's possible they're telling us that it's possible

1218
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,640
to uh imprint learned information onto new brain tissue um i actually don't believe that memories

1219
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:44,920
are encoded by the specific micro um the architecture of your synapses that that story there are

1220
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:50,440
increase that story is increasingly sort of cracking at this point and um whatever it is

1221
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:58,520
i i have a feeling that if if we do regeneration correctly uh the memories will regenerate now

1222
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,360
that's now now so i think i think that part is optimistic the part we have to keep keep track

1223
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:11,320
of is that in an important way i think we are all like planaria in that we don't have access to our

1224
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:16,200
past what we have access to are the engrams that the past has left in our brains and bodies

1225
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,920
at any given moment and i don't know the thickness of that moment for for for each of us

1226
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,960
but at any given moment all we're doing is reconstructing a plausible story based on those

1227
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,760
engrams about what happened before and we all know it's fallible and it's you know we and every

1228
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,640
time we do it we sort of alter the thing you were just talking about we're all doing that anyway

1229
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:40,280
all the time like we are basically like people say oh my god these planaria are amazing yeah we

1230
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:47,400
were pretty much all doing that you know all the time i think so so given that that that the core

1231
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:54,040
self is a process it's a continuous homeodynamic process it's a reconstruction that's not a physical

1232
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:58,040
structure that kind of sits there and you might lose it and then what happens um i think we're

1233
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,760
fine i i think we're gonna if when we get to the point of being able to regenerate brain tissue

1234
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:07,800
i think we're gonna be fine and and and i want to um also put in a couple of other

1235
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:12,760
pointers to some stuff first of all and i have a student um carina with whom we are

1236
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:20,760
writing a review of the of of all the mismatches between brain state and um uh and and cognitive

1237
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:26,760
state but you know there are these cases of uh well there are many cases many different kinds

1238
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,240
of cases but i'll just talk about one which is these these specific specific cases of of

1239
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:38,440
hydrocephaly where somebody's someone someone is born with um fluid a very high fluid pressure in

1240
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:43,560
there in there in their skull and that prevents the brain from developing and so you know this guy

1241
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:49,400
Lorber in the 80s documented um some guy that had less than a third of the the uh the brain

1242
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:54,440
volume of a chimpanzee and he was doing a master's program in math and he had above normal IQ and

1243
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,960
like he wouldn't know he would you know he would introduce himself and meet people who take a

1244
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,320
flashlight and shine it in one ear and it would sort of you know like pink light will come up the

1245
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:09,400
other end and uh and he was completely fine and so um so so i think i think our mapping of information

1246
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:17,240
to to um brain uh medium is we we don't understand how it works we have we have no idea and um

1247
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:25,960
and there are many other clinical cases uh that underscore that underscore this idea so so so yeah

1248
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:33,880
so i think uh i i think it's going to be fine i think i think it's much more um robust and you

1249
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:39,320
can think about think about the um the caterpillar butterfly thing right like not only so so so

1250
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:44,200
caterpillars basically destroy their brain they break up most of the connections but

1251
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,960
when you do these experiments this is against some of Doug Blackistan's old work when you

1252
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,240
check the moth or butterfly they remember the original information that you train the caterpillar

1253
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:57,720
on not only do they remember but they actually generalize across that process because if you

1254
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:04,040
train them to eat a particular kind of leaf on a particular color background the the moth or

1255
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,920
butterfly will go feed the same way but they don't eat leaves they drink nectar and so you're not

1256
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,640
remembering that leaves you know this particular color means leaves which you're remembering is food

1257
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,120
so you're actually smart enough to generalize the category to a complete one when i'm a completely

1258
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,720
different kind of being that doesn't care about leaves at all whereas before that's all i wanted

1259
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,560
but now i don't care about leaves at all i i'm still going to generalize and i still know what i

1260
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:32,440
want so right so amazing during like there's so much plasticity here i think we're going to be fine

1261
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:41,000
this makes me think of the reports that i've read of people who have organ transplants

1262
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,560
and appear to manifest the characteristics of the people that they get a heart transplant

1263
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:53,480
or a lung transplant from yeah yeah we wanted to cover it in that review there's not enough

1264
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:57,960
clinical well documented clinical cases but you're right and i've talked to i've talked to

1265
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:03,560
transplant surgeons about this kind of stuff interestingly enough kidney donors liver donors

1266
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:08,600
they don't talk about that stuff it's heart lung i don't know why but you know again the numbers

1267
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:14,360
are small so not sure what you know the really egregious cases are are you know there's not that

1268
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:19,080
many documented but yeah yeah there's there's something going on here and we have we have a

1269
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:27,080
bunch of unpublished data generated by Johanna Bischoff in our group where we transplanted little

1270
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:33,320
pieces of two-headed planaria into one headed planaria and some percentage of them if you

1271
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:39,560
recut them again they convert to two-headed and so so this idea of transplanting information

1272
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,400
be it morphogenetic information or be it behavioral information i don't make that much

1273
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:48,280
distinction between them i think they're the same process it moves it moves with tissue

1274
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,160
and it spreads when you put the little implant in it actually spreads across that information

1275
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:59,240
not the cells the information spreads across the host so ultimately you know you know mcconnell

1276
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:05,880
joked at the time it was 67 68 he joked about the concept of professor burgers this idea that

1277
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:12,920
you could actually you know get somebody else's knowledge by eating you know pieces of

1278
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:19,400
flesh made made from their body i don't know right like we know nobody's shown that you know

1279
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:25,080
you can learn calculus and then pass that along in a burger but some kind of information maybe and

1280
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:31,160
if we knew what the proper encoding and decoding was i think there would be all sorts of interesting

1281
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:38,280
new routes for for memories this is i mean a dysfunctional example but prions seem like their

1282
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:48,920
the transfer of information without any kind of organ or genetic relationship yep yep i agree um

1283
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:56,760
yeah i think yeah prions are a kind of non-genetic inheritance um glansman shows uh RNA um so he

1284
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:03,480
trains these aplizia and he and he takes uh you know extracts RNA and injects it into a new animal

1285
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:09,720
and they um and they acquire some of the information yeah i mean it's just really fascinating

1286
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:14,680
because when we were talking about the tadpoles with the eyes some of them are wired into the

1287
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:19,320
brain and some of them can see without being wired into the brain and so you have all of the sudden

1288
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:26,040
this new framework for understanding even something as basic as visual perception where we equate it

1289
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:36,200
from conventional frameworks as being a necessary you know eye brain relationship and so if you

1290
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:43,560
start to release that and all of a sudden it's actually in the body does that radically change

1291
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:50,520
the way that we have to consider of bodies and minds and and consciousness to me it seems like

1292
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:59,960
it must yeah yeah i think so i think that um all of this has a lot to say about what fundamentally

1293
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:09,640
what we are and uh what it is that that persists through time and where things are encoded i mean

1294
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:16,760
in planaria you can chop them into multiple pieces and each of those pieces will become an animal

1295
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:23,800
and that's you know in philosophy of mind 101 you know you go over this example of the

1296
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,200
malfunctioning transporter right so it sort of replicates you puts a copy over there but it

1297
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,880
forgets to delete the you know the old star trek episode right like it forgets to delete the original

1298
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:36,440
and now which one's the real one well yeah you can do that you can actually do that in planaria

1299
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:44,040
so i think our concept of this this idea that there's a discrete border between me and not me

1300
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,240
you know me between yourself and the outside world between different individuals between

1301
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:51,880
the memories that belong to you or the memories that belong to somebody else i i think our uh

1302
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:58,680
conceptions of all that stuff are are pretty primitive and probably um you know wrong

1303
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:06,760
you you mentioned uh the the danger of overfitting with training uh machine learning models and

1304
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:14,760
that links to this kind of tangentially where i think that the way that i've been thinking about

1305
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:23,400
consciousness and awareness and intelligence has to do with the presence of a sensory system

1306
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:31,800
that can then integrate information and then have effects upon the world and when we discuss

1307
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:39,560
the ability of computer scientists to produce consciousness or intelligence to me i always

1308
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:46,040
see there being a limitation in these sensory systems i'm like yeah you can have a brain on a chip

1309
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:51,960
but in order for that to be something that i recognize as conscious it has to be tied into

1310
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:58,280
some kind of body that is able to process multiple modes of sensory information integrate them and

1311
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:06,360
then apply them to goal directed behavior and if there is not a necessity for a brain

1312
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:12,520
the way that i've conventionally thought about it it really changes the way that i think about

1313
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:17,720
machine consciousness because as we start to develop these systems and even if they're not

1314
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:24,440
embodied in the way that i'm used to thinking of embodied systems it seems like we we are opening

1315
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:29,160
the door into what don hoffman calls you know like another conscious portal that we're booting up

1316
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:35,960
yeah yeah um well a couple of things uh first i would be really careful not to lump consciousness

1317
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,840
and intelligence in the same bucket i don't think these are synonyms and so we have to i

1318
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:47,320
think talk about them separately um with respect to embodiment i would say that i agree with you

1319
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:53,480
that uh some sort of perception action loop is really important but i don't think three-dimensional

1320
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:58,840
space is the only space in which to do that and so if you're doing that in physiological state space

1321
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:02,760
or you're doing it in transcriptional space or you're doing it in anatomical morpheus space or

1322
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:08,840
metabolic space or linguistic space i think that's good enough i don't think there's anything

1323
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,240
i don't think this three-dimensional space is privileged i think we treat it that way because

1324
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:19,400
that's how our sensory motor system developed and we're really used to things that move around well

1325
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:25,640
in the three-dimensional world being the interesting intelligent things like us but uh that's just i

1326
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:30,280
think that's just prejudice on our part i think these other spaces in which other beings strive

1327
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:38,120
and suffer are equally real and so you can have embodiment that is not obvious to us um that

1328
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:44,520
is that is in these other spaces um that was the last thing that was it was a third oh well and so

1329
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:50,760
and so and so another another example of that is uh some is people with locked-in syndrome right so

1330
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:57,560
so you can you can be locked in syndrome where you have basically zero ability to have uh functional

1331
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:03,560
efficacy in terms of anybody noticing you doing anything but you're perfectly conscious and and

1332
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:08,760
you know you've you've got a rich inner life so um i think i think i think we have to be careful and i

1333
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:17,400
think um uh it it used to be that intelligence and consciousness were very closely tied together

1334
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:23,400
i think that evolution kind of makes sure that those things go together and things that are naturally

1335
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:28,680
evolved you can kind of gauge one from the other probably like again we really don't know right so

1336
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:33,560
so the other mind's problem is is serious when you when you start to think about unconventional

1337
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,880
things like it's it's pretty easy to say oh come on i know you and i both have minds even though i

1338
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,040
don't have access to yours but but i'm giving i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt well

1339
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:47,000
that's that's that's easy until you get to things that don't actually look like you or are made of

1340
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,480
something different right it gets it gets really hard intelligence is easy because because problem

1341
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:59,080
solving abilities is a third person verifiable objective competency um first person consciousness

1342
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:07,320
is is different different and difficult um yeah but uh but but yeah i i think uh i think it's uh

1343
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:12,360
it's much it's much wider than than we normally think and it's and it's not hard to come up with

1344
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:18,920
cases that basically break almost any um i mean this is the one of the main things i work on now

1345
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,480
is to try to the one my tame framework is is trying to do is to come up with a

1346
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:32,680
um a framework for understanding uh cognition and agency in extremely diverse across extremely

1347
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:38,440
diverse embodiments because because all of the existing frameworks they they break very easily

1348
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:44,440
with with biological examples most of the things that people um walk around you know kind of talking

1349
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,960
about okay here's my criterion you can come up with you know seven examples that will just like

1350
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:54,280
crush it within you know within minutes it's pretty easy it's it's hard to come up with a good

1351
01:46:54,280 --> 01:47:00,680
with a good framework yeah i wonder to what extent this mode of re-envisioning intelligence

1352
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:05,160
could be applied to other scale systems like i always thought it was really interesting that the

1353
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:15,800
physicists got uh let's say dominion over astrophysical or cosmic scale processes um it could

1354
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:21,240
i could imagine a different planet with humans on it that the biologists took over that that work

1355
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:26,360
and saw different things different patterns in the sky and different uh let's say behaviors of

1356
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:32,120
galaxies or or systems and and approach them as intelligence and that that wouldn't be treated

1357
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:39,400
as superstitious or rational uh in some sense uh to what extent have you had you do have you

1358
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:44,520
collaborated with astrophys is this about about this possibility um i don't know it just seems like

1359
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:49,000
in some sense very heretical but it but at the same time i can't find a rational cause for why

1360
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:56,200
that's so yeah um i i think uh two two two things to to think about there one is that

1361
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:03,720
i i i think uh the reason that um i i think you need an impedance match a kind of um

1362
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:11,400
kind of uh cohesion between the tools you're using and what you're hoping to find

1363
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:16,600
i think the reason that physicists always see dumb matter and dumb machines and never mind is

1364
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:21,560
because they're using tools that are very low agency tools voltmeters and rulers and you know

1365
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,880
telescopes and things like that these are very low agency things all they're ever gonna see is

1366
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:32,600
low agency stuff uh i think you need minds to recognize other minds and um uh so that's that's

1367
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:39,240
one thing another thing is is this uh i feel very strongly that assessments of whether

1368
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:43,560
any people say this to me all the time and say oh uh you know your your team framework is very kind

1369
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,360
of panpsychist so what you're just going to say that um that the weather and and and the sun are

1370
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:54,280
conscious to well my point is is this but you can't say that you can't just say anything you can't say

1371
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:59,800
it is or it isn't you have to do experiments and so um but both directions are bad right so so in

1372
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:05,800
the olden days every every rock had a spirit behind it and every you know whatever like that that's

1373
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,440
so that's problematic because then you say well what what is that doing for you and your ability

1374
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:15,160
to understand the rock and whatever but the other option when you say oh no the weather definitely

1375
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:20,120
doesn't have any any you know any agency to it i i don't know have you tried training it because we

1376
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:26,360
have tools in in behavior science where you can actually address novel systems and ask does this

1377
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:31,400
thing have habituation sensitization associate of learning predictive predictive coding uh you

1378
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:36,920
know a metacognitive assessment all that these are not things you can have feelings about or

1379
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:43,720
preconceptions about you have to do experiments so so my question is um you know uh yeah you can

1380
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:50,120
you can you can entertain i i think you can entertain the idea that wow what if the you know

1381
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:55,640
the whole galaxy is this like giant intelligence totally possible but you can't say that until

1382
01:49:55,640 --> 01:50:00,200
you've done some sort of experiment and they have to be perturbational experiments you can't do it

1383
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:05,720
just by observation that's really key um you know they did these experiments uh in the 70s where

1384
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:10,520
this guy made these um movies where there were different shapes moving around so triangles and

1385
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:15,480
squares and circles and things and he would show them to people and people go oh look it's very obvious

1386
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,920
the the the circles in love with the square and then they're trying to run away but the triangle

1387
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:25,160
keeps trying to break them like you can tell these stories all day long but the only way to to develop

1388
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,800
them into things that help your research and help you understand nature is to do perturbational

1389
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:34,040
experiments is they find if i put my finger on the triangle and don't let it go what's going

1390
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:37,960
to happen or i put a barrier does the circle really go around and get this way like what's

1391
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:44,360
actually going to happen and so i'm completely open to um potential intelligence is at other

1392
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:50,520
scales of time and space in fact i did i did annoy a bunch of physicists at one point asking them

1393
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:56,680
could redesign a planetary scale synapse so so some kind of a gravitational system where a pulse

1394
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:00,840
comes in and so it's some sort of asteroid comes flying in something changes and then the next time

1395
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:04,120
you know the next three asteroids come flying in it does something different because it's learned

1396
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:10,040
and it's got you know it's it's a synapse right so it has a historicity to it um and yes i think

1397
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:14,680
you can design such things whether they occur in nature i have no idea um well there's some

1398
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:19,480
interesting anecdotes i think there's some flyby anomalies with anomalies it's hard to say there's

1399
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:25,640
some flyby anomalies with uh the jupiter probes you know that that end up leaving their orbit set

1400
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:31,400
you know and and and they're just kind of catalogued and moved on and and again like it's not

1401
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,520
such a perturbation it's actually terrifying to think about uh perturbing another galaxy or

1402
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:40,840
something and all of the people in that galaxy are like what's going on um but i suppose you

1403
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:44,360
wouldn't need to do that because there there are these anomaly i mean the galactic rotation problem

1404
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:49,800
is another really interesting one it's like we have a very robust model of gravity quantitatively

1405
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:53,720
we've checked it out locally in our solar system to the best of our ability on earth

1406
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:58,280
and then we look at these large-scale structures and it's like well they're moving by some other

1407
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:04,840
means and uh it really opens the door but i suppose without being able to mess with it

1408
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:09,880
you can't really see if it's responsive or or if it's just some physical process that we are not

1409
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:16,440
aware of yet i mean that's the thing right crossing crossing levels between local physical process

1410
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:23,400
suppose you have a you have a conversation with somebody and uh you convince them to go to grad

1411
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,480
school you have this you know four argue four really good arguments why they should go get their

1412
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:32,840
phd and they do and then and then here you know along comes the physics is how did you do that

1413
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:38,200
and and you say well here's and they say okay so let's measure so there was this air vibration and

1414
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:43,720
it went into the eardrum and then there's a okay it's not that that story is false it's just completely

1415
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:48,200
useless that the next time somebody else needs to be talked into whatever it is right it doesn't

1416
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:54,280
capture the essence of what's going on even though even though at the local scale yes it all was

1417
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:58,440
true and it all held together and these are the sets of frequencies and air vibrations that happen

1418
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:05,960
it misses the whole point of the story so um it's almost i i feel it's like um uh and again this is

1419
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,760
this is just you know kind of very very hand-wavy stuff but but i'm working on something something

1420
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:16,600
a little better um the the notion of synchronicity right the idea that there are large scale patterns

1421
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:22,840
that show up at specific observational scales when you as the observer know what to look for

1422
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:29,480
but down below they are just chance or they're you know it's it's never magic it's never against

1423
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:33,640
the laws of physics but it but but if you look at a larger scale there's often like yeah wait a

1424
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:38,200
minute though yeah i know each one of these things kind of was was random by itself but all together

1425
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:43,240
there's some there's something going on here and so you have to know how to look for those patterns

1426
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:47,400
and even better you have to know how to read and write those patterns which means perturbational

1427
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:52,760
experiments so you know i i don't have any ideas on how to um do perturbational experiments on on

1428
01:53:52,760 --> 01:54:00,440
galaxies but but like the weather kind of a thing should be absolutely uh uh tractable and and we

1429
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:04,840
did something like that with um with gene regulatory networks because they're very simple

1430
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:09,560
dynamical systems and you look at them you say well that's things kind of it's we you know for

1431
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:13,160
sure it's dumb it's never gonna look turns out they're capable of six different kinds of memory

1432
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,000
including pavlovian conditioning and all it takes it doesn't you don't need cells you don't need

1433
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,080
synapses you don't need any of that it's it's a it's a handful of genes that turn each other on

1434
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:25,880
and off and already you get this amazing free gift which is that some of the biological ones

1435
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:31,480
anyway they can they can learn why do you think that the physicists have such preeminence in our

1436
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:37,480
academic tower you know i feel like people all like if you look at nsf at least last time i looked

1437
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:45,000
it was mostly physicists that were in charge uh it just seems like people expect physicists to answer

1438
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,360
these really huge cosmic questions and i've always found that a little bit bizarre but and i've been

1439
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:58,280
trying to trace how that came about and if it's arbitrary or if it's is there something innate

1440
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,280
about the way that we perceive the world that demands that kind of explanation even if it's

1441
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:11,240
not capable of it yeah um i would argue that it's because uh they make cd players right like they

1442
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:16,040
i mean they they're the ones and and it's because they pick the low-hanging fruit i mean literally

1443
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:20,360
not to take anything away like physics is amazing and it lots of hard problems and all of that but

1444
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:25,320
but um as as anybody who does computer science or physics when they try to reach bio they get

1445
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:29,480
into biology they want to rip the hair out of their heads because because they're used to systems

1446
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:35,400
that are precise uh basically the low end of the spectrum you can you can we know how to deal with

1447
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,880
the low end of the spectrum and now we do anyway after all the hard work and those are the things

1448
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:45,640
where we make reliable technology so so you know if you want a washing machine or you want a cd player

1449
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:51,240
you didn't get there without the physicists now you need some other stuff but but but but the

1450
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:56,760
stuff from the right side of that spectrum so so psychoanalysis and uh but you all that kind of

1451
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:02,920
stuff in and art and everything like it's great but it is notoriously unreliable for doing any

1452
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:09,160
particular thing you know it sort of will enrich some of us and not others and who knows but but

1453
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:13,480
if you really want you know if you if you um if you want to build a house or you want to you want

1454
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:18,200
to you know antibiotics or something like that it's physics and then chemistry and i i i think

1455
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:23,880
that's that's what it is it's just people people can see what works and and it's going to take a

1456
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:32,440
lot of hard work uh to get that degree of um a predictive utility out of these higher higher

1457
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:42,760
agency things if we live in a world of platonic forms that are being biologically manifest and

1458
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:48,120
evolution is you described it as being something that makes problem solving machines

1459
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:56,280
do you have a sense of your own role in that as like what is the what is the platonic form of the

1460
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:08,360
problem that you see yourself as solving yeah so so this is uh just my phenomenology of it i i don't

1461
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:13,240
know because i'm not able to do experiments controlled experiments on the scale of you know

1462
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:17,400
life and science and all of that right so so i i don't know if any of this is has any truth to it

1463
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:27,560
this is just how how i feel um yeah um it certainly feels to me like i'm discovering not inventing

1464
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:34,040
and that the people in my lab uh we are we are uncovering something um i don't know if they

1465
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:41,160
would agree by the way but but uh but me personally everything that that we've done over the decades

1466
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:47,560
i feel like we're unearthing something that already existed and that has a particular

1467
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:53,080
structure to it we don't make it up we find it and we kind of uh we can do better or worse at

1468
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:57,000
figuring out what it is and how to relate to it and how to bring it out into the world

1469
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,640
um that's how it feels to me i don't know that any of that is true um but um yeah and i also think

1470
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:10,600
that so so here's another kind of wacky thing uh and i've told this to some of my students um

1471
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:18,360
i i also feel like some of that stuff is under positive pressure in other words it wants to

1472
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:23,080
come out in other words it's there for you to like like when you poke that little hole into

1473
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:29,160
that platonic space by making uh the you know a bot or some kind of new technology stuff comes

1474
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:33,480
rushing through that hole and i really feel like again this is very non-scientific i'm just

1475
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:39,560
telling you how it feels to to to me um that that's what we do we figure out ways to kind of

1476
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:44,360
put a crack in that in that boundary and then stuff starts pouring through the boundary you

1477
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:48,760
don't have to you don't have to pull it out if you if you make the if you if you if you um

1478
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:55,400
make make a make that barrier porous it it comes out i think i think it's under pressure it it it

1479
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:03,000
whatever you whatever you create in this world that's uh uh it will it will um pull patterns

1480
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:08,280
that that are that are there and is that how you approach your own goal orientation in your science

1481
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:12,680
like you know we're starting a new year here and and it's almost like if it's a miracle year for

1482
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:20,280
you what would it look like but i sense that it's almost like you see it as just chasing that that

1483
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:25,400
you know positive pressure that positive pressure yeah you're sort of flowing with it do you set

1484
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:30,840
that that's sort of objective bar for yourself when you when you look out onto the immediate

1485
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:38,200
future as a scientist or are you are you just kind of going with the muse um well i well i

1486
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:43,880
definitely think there's a muse no no doubt about that but um i also think that the space of possible

1487
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:50,600
things to chase after is infinite and so i actually like like on the spectrum you know in some labs

1488
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:55,080
you you know you sort of show up and whatever you do as long as you discover something cool

1489
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:59,240
everybody's you know happy with it but i'm on the other spectrum so i have a very specific

1490
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:04,200
research agenda i would like everybody who joins the higher than my lab we're all working on

1491
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:11,000
very specific things where i know what i want to to come out of this um so and that's that's not

1492
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,680
to say that uh that i'm you know uh defining it like designing any of these things it's just that

1493
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:21,560
there are many many different things that different muses that one could tune into

1494
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:26,600
and i have one particular one that you know i'm sort of flowing with and that means being very

1495
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:32,040
thoughtful about um what are the channels through which you write these these findings will hopefully

1496
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:37,320
hopefully flow the center i've got a i've got a mind map that hangs in our um in our in our lab

1497
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:42,120
and it's like this this this this giant poster that we put like nine feet wide that we printed on

1498
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:47,400
silk and the center of the mind map is called embodied mind that's the center so so it's all

1499
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:51,480
the different ways and you know all the different questions and things that we're doing and then

1500
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:55,240
different people's specific projects are sort of peppered around the leaves of the trail of that of

1501
02:00:55,240 --> 02:01:00,280
that graph and so that everybody can see where where they kind of plug into this but it's no

1502
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:06,680
it's very specific and it's very curated it's a beautiful world that you're building i really

1503
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:11,480
think that when i i think i've told you this before that when i went to go study biology i

1504
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:17,800
imagined that it would be the the study of what is life and i very quickly realized that it was

1505
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:23,320
much more mechanistic and much more molecular than that in most cases and one of the reasons

1506
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:27,560
that we started this podcast was because i was certain that there were people out there who

1507
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:34,040
were asking the larger questions of the significance and pushing the boundaries of what it meant to

1508
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:42,120
understand bodies and life itself because it does seem to be a very weird center of the universe

1509
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,560
and obviously that's like a very you know earth centric or human centric perspective but

1510
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:55,800
there is something that is there's a motive force of life which is the solving of problems

1511
02:01:55,800 --> 02:02:01,160
and the universe seems full of problems to solve and so figuring out the process by which

1512
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:07,960
we can do that in novel ways seems to me to be the passage into something that is

1513
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:13,720
greater than the past because at every single juncture where humans have run into problems

1514
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:19,240
the way that we have solved them is by figuring out technological approaches to resolving what

1515
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:25,560
has happened and obviously that creates downstream problems like you look at the you know the green

1516
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:30,840
revolution or something we have solved the problem of mass starvation but now we have

1517
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,480
phosphate runoff and pollution of waters and now we have so many people that we don't have regenerative

1518
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:43,480
agriculture that prevents us from just decimating animal life on the planet and i think that the

1519
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:50,360
the passage into the next era is the passage of understanding or biology much better than we ever

1520
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:55,480
have before and i think that your work is really really at the center of this and i just

1521
02:02:56,600 --> 02:03:02,840
i'm i'm i'm grateful to have to have met you and to know that that someone is is doing this

1522
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:08,280
it's really it gives me a lot of hope for the future well thank you so much yeah i'm i that's

1523
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,680
one of the things i'm happiest about is when people get hope from some of the things i say

1524
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:19,880
and i this is maybe a good time to point out that it obviously isn't just me so in addition

1525
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:24,280
to the people in my lab that do a lot of the hard work it's also i have i have some amazing

1526
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:30,520
collaborators that that have been pulled together some of whom you may want to have on so people

1527
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:34,520
like Richard Watson and you know and chris fields and mark solmes and some other folks

1528
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:43,960
they really make a lot of this possible because these are some of the things i say these ideas

1529
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:48,920
have been around for really long time but they've gotten no traction because there's a huge difference

1530
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:54,760
between saying something and pushing it to the point where it actually generates new discoveries

1531
02:03:54,760 --> 02:04:00,120
and until you do that second thing it doesn't move the needle and that that's the really hard part

1532
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:04,920
and so so there have been a lot of people that i've worked with that enable that they have

1533
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:11,160
enabled some of that some of that to happen and i think i think what you're saying is super important

1534
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:17,960
in the sense of understanding life beyond kind of the lowest levels of it meaning the the

1535
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:23,240
mechanistic molecular stuff is is critical it's going to be important for us going into the you

1536
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:29,720
know whatever the future of humanity is the one thing i want to say though is people get

1537
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:35,560
hyper fixated when when they hear life people get hyper fixated on the material and on how it

1538
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:44,040
gets here so so the biological wet the cytoplasm stuff and the product of evolution and i just

1539
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:51,880
want to say that i think life and and that kind of focus on what's important is really critical

1540
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:59,880
but we have to remember the protoplasm isn't magic and it isn't unique and the meandering

1541
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:06,360
course of the evolutionary process is not the only way that mind enters this world and we have to

1542
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:11,480
get broader than than a focus on the easy stuff which is the material it's really easy to say

1543
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:16,680
oh you're made of silicon yeah you're not real you're just you're just faking it and and really

1544
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:22,440
the hard work that we have to do as a as a species is to get beyond those those kind of superficial

1545
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:27,640
criteria and to really say what what do we really mean by um i don't i don't know about life i you

1546
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:33,480
know you can you can keep life what it is but but but cognition um i think goes way beyond the living

1547
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:40,360
world and we we have to understand we have to develop um the rigorous frameworks of of recognizing

1548
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:45,720
in novel guises that we wouldn't necessarily say are alive and i think that this next year is going

1549
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:52,360
to be really interesting to see what happens because i feel like we're approaching that question

1550
02:05:52,360 --> 02:06:01,480
in a massive way technologically yeah we we are um i i'm i'm really um disappointed about how

1551
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:09,960
narrow that debate has been and the hyper focus on language models and and uh the kind of

1552
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:16,520
ai's that we have today and the things you know the people people just get so so focused on these

1553
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:23,560
examples and and and the broader lessons of the field of diverse intelligence are haven't even

1554
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:27,880
been scratched yet everybody's just like really focused on this on this one thing i think i think

1555
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:34,440
we get much bigger issues actually coming than than just than just this yeah i mean i think that we

1556
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:40,120
can plan to spend the next year reading up and studying more on the the diverse intelligence

1557
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:45,320
and hopefully we can see you again in at the beginning of the next year yeah absolutely anytime

1558
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:50,200
thank you so much it's always awesome thanks for so eye-opening talking to you and i really

1559
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:54,600
appreciate you giving us your time and giving it to our audience as well that's great i appreciate

1560
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:58,920
thank you always a great discussion be well um yeah stay in touch happy new year

1561
