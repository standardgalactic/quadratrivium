0	6880	Max Principle is talked about as an extraneous principle. It is not part of any standard
6880	14320	theories of physics today. There's a reason for that which I, when I first realized this,
15040	23360	I was really amazed. Max Principle implies that there is one universal frame, one universe
23600	33280	because Max Principle trace the effects of dynamics centrifugal force and things like that
34240	38960	happens because of some interaction with the rest of the matter in the universe.
40400	48560	Whatever that interaction is, since universe is one reference frame, accepting Max Principle
48560	56480	immediately implies accepting an absolute frame like ether and so on. But once you accept an
56480	64000	absolute frame, the direct consequence is that propagation of light is Galilean. The velocity,
64000	70320	relative velocity of light will depend on the velocity of the observer. So Max Principle
70320	75280	cannot be incorporated in current physics without breaking Einstein's theory, without
75280	82400	flowing away Einstein's theory of relativity. Welcome back to Demystify Psi. Soon to be named
82400	87280	something else, we are actually considering expanding our name to include more of the topics
87280	94480	we explore on this show, which clearly reaches way beyond science and even mysticism. So we are
95280	102960	playing with new ideas. So look forward to Demystify Psi having a new flavor to its name very soon.
102960	107840	We're going to start rolling that out and trying out some ideas and discussing it with our patrons.
107840	108800	Suggestions are welcome.
109680	116000	Today on the show, we are exploring the underlying assumptions of relativity and some
116000	122800	contradictory experimental evidence with respect to special relativity. So the invariance of the
122800	127360	speed of light, this idea that the speed of light is the same for everybody regardless of their
127360	135440	motion. And today we have CS Unikrishnan from the Defense Institute of Advanced Technology in
135440	143040	India. He is a physics scholar who has worked on the LIGO projects, and he has come to some
143040	147760	very startling realizations concerning the history of physics and the way that we have applied our
147760	153840	foundational assumptions to the picture of how the universe works. And in particular,
154800	164080	he's very concerned about this idea of descriptions, these empirically defined equations being
164080	169360	mistaken for explanations because there's a number of abstract postulates that are roped into them
169360	175840	from the beginning. And of course, descriptions can be very, very deceptive, right? You can watch a
175840	181040	magic show with David Copperfield and be absolutely convinced that the Statue of Liberty disappeared.
181040	186000	It might look like that from every conceivable angle in the audience, but there's something
186000	193440	else happening. And it's the job of the scientist to come up with hypotheses for what that something
193440	199520	could be. And so we're exploring this issue in depth over the course of his conception of how
199520	204240	this can be rescued by bringing in Mach's principle and really understanding that there's a lot of
204240	210000	stuff in the universe that we can't see. It's really far away, but it does exert gravitational
210000	216000	effects en masse. And those things should be applied to all of our fundamental understandings
216000	221680	and interpretations of these bizarre relativistic experiments. Absolutely. And if you like what
221680	227200	we do, come over to patreon.com slash demystifyci. You can help us brainstorm a new name. You can
227200	234160	help us by supporting the podcast with just a couple dollars a month. And in return for that,
234160	238320	we give you both of the episodes early, so you get them on Saturdays instead of having to wait
238320	242960	until everybody else gets them. But you also get to join our Patreon chat, which is a Zoom call
242960	249280	that we have every week where we get together and we talk about the larger, bigger questions that
249280	255440	people are curious about. And it's pretty cool. We have maybe a consistent group of like 15 people
255440	259760	that come and there's probably another five or six that just hang out in the chat. And so it
259760	266560	gives us a chance to actually connect with one another. So this is less of a isolating and
266640	272480	atomized project. One way street. Yeah, it's less of a one way street. So if you have a couple
272480	276560	dollars to spare, come over to patreon.com. We would absolutely love to see you and get your
276560	281680	support. And in the meantime, enjoy our conversation with Professor Anikrishnan. We'll see you next
282160	284800	The Scientific Revolution starts now.
297600	304240	All right, so to kick this off into the science, I was hoping that I could read a little portion
304240	311280	of one of the papers you sent us. And maybe we can springboard off that into what we were
311280	319280	talking about today, which is fundamentally a conversation about revisiting old experiments,
319280	326240	revisiting tried and true theories and considering their interpretation. There's a
326240	331520	philosophical dimension of this, which is really interesting to us, because as we've been over,
331520	337840	over and over and over on this show, empiricism really just shows you how a pattern unfolds.
337840	342320	It doesn't necessarily give you an explanation of the cause of that pattern. And physics has
342320	347120	been extraordinarily successful with detailing these patterns and equations and coming up with these,
348000	353120	they call them theories, but they're really just these statements of how predictable events unfold
353120	358640	at different places in the universe at different scales. And one of the most successful theories,
359360	366880	kind of the bedrock of modern physics is Einstein's relativity. And what we're going to be talking about
366880	374000	today is the strange implications of relativity and how they might be just misunderstanding. So
374000	377600	I'm going to read a little paper, little piece of this paper, I'm going to just skip through a
377600	381520	couple of excerpts, people should go read it themselves. It's called a new gravitational
381520	386800	paradigm for relativity and dynamics and its philosophical scope. And this is from Journal
386800	393840	of Physics conference series. And so the piece that I wanted to share to kick this off, it goes like
393840	400160	this. Einstein's theories are interpreted not only as the theories of relativity and gravity,
400160	406720	but also as the theories of space and time themselves. And then skipping forward. While these
406720	411840	are factually, let's say, let's say spatial intervals between material particles and the
411840	417520	duration marked by material clocks, the essential and crucial role of the material markers is dropped
417600	423680	at the level of abstraction without logical rigor. And then it goes on, the unobservable
423680	429520	space time is elevated to a full fledged dynamical entity in the general theory of relativity.
430160	435920	So that there's a creation of this abstraction being turned into a physical substance. And then
435920	443840	to close out the little excerpt, you say, in real physical terms, all observable experiences of
443840	450720	gravity are limited to matter affecting spatial separation between material particles and the
450720	457680	rate of material clocks. So there's this divergence from material representations of reality and
458240	463600	theoretical abstractions. There's some confusion, some conflation of abstractions with material
463600	471920	reality that's at the core of this discussion. And so before we get into all of the disagreements
472800	480400	with the interpretation, maybe you can just comment on why it matters. Who cares if people
480400	486720	have made these mistakes, treating these abstractions as physical substances and so forth?
486720	493200	Why does it matter? Because the math works. Okay. Yeah, the math works, that is true.
494080	503360	The point is, it is not only we observe various phenomena. So
505680	513440	one doesn't have to really explain the phenomena to observe the phenomena and even describe it
514160	521680	in ordinary language or even convert those phenomena into technologies. You don't have to
521680	530960	really understand it theoretically, completely. Yet it is in our, it's our urge that we want to
530960	541040	understand it more deeply, closely. And we form theories in the sense we try to connect up
541600	548880	various phenomena and describe them on the basis of a few fundamental concepts.
549120	557840	So space and time are two fundamental concepts, which we start with for describing dynamics,
557840	563680	something, some object moving. Of course, it's always the matter object which is moving,
564960	570000	because we can, that is all what we can experience. But to describe that motion,
570160	579360	we need some reference that a particle moved from one position to other position.
580320	588240	And how do you talk about this position? Positions in space. Space is our experience,
588240	597120	in the sense we leave in space. And time is something which we experience as evolution of
597120	605680	ourselves, evolution of our environment and so on, which we call time. So when we say time passes,
606320	616880	what we mean is something evolves. Something changed. Something changed. So space and time
616960	628000	has two essential concepts that was always needed to describe motion. Now when I talk about motion,
628000	636080	movements, it is just not physical movement of some particle in space. It's also used as a
636160	645280	general time for evolution change. Now, so space and time. Now, if you imagine
647840	654160	Before you go on, can I ask you a quick question? How do you conceptualize motion without, sorry,
654160	657520	evolution or change without some particle being relocated?
657520	666640	You cannot. In fact, that is a point. Suppose you imagine a situation where there is no
666640	675920	matter at all, nothing, nothing material. Now, you may be able to imagine space without matter.
678480	681840	At least some people will be in a coordinate sense or something like that.
682560	688480	Something when you say imagine empty space, people may be able to imagine empty space,
689360	695600	but you will not be able to imagine time without any matter. There should be at least one particle
696240	705600	which is evolving, which is moving. Only there has to be some particle for some matter
706560	711760	in which we can experience, which is changing. Either it is changing its position,
712400	717600	or it is changing some property like its temperature or something. Something should change.
718480	722160	Would it be fair to say that you need two particles because you have to compare that
722160	728960	motion to some standard of reference? Exactly. So therefore, one of the motions,
729600	737520	when you said, when you refer to time, every time, every instance, when you refer to time,
737520	744160	what you are doing is to compare one kind of motion with another kind of motion. One of them you
744160	749600	use as a standard, something which is simpler. Maybe it is a periodic motion of something
749600	755200	which you take as a standard. Otherwise, you are always comparing a change with another change.
756160	762880	When you say, I have a clock, I have time. So the sense of time, if you really think about
762880	771120	it, without matter, it has no meaning at all. So now, even this context, when you say space and
771120	781200	time are physical entities without referring to matter at all, there is really a conceptual
781200	787200	problem. There is a philosophical problem. It is not rigorous enough. It is not sufficient.
788320	794240	So if you go really deep there, already you are stuck with these primitive concepts.
795120	801920	They are metaphysical concepts, actually. They are not physical. Not quite physical, I would say.
801920	808240	Can I pause you there for a second? When did people begin to be concerned with this? Was
808240	814560	this something that people realized as soon as relativity was born? Was this something that was
814560	821920	on the tips of people's tongues, or has this kind of really been underground this whole time?
822880	829440	This meaning, the reification. Yes, the lack of physical reference points.
829440	837040	This is already Newton's pregipia. Because Newton bonded to axiomatize,
838000	844240	everything which he was talking about. So he wanted to talk about space, time. Though he
844240	850720	started by saying that he did not want to define, because these are sort of obvious concepts,
851760	861440	he still tried to talk about them, define them. And then he had to, because he had to describe
862400	869040	movement of objects, dynamics in space and time. And then he had to say something about
869760	879680	what is time and what is space. So he started by defining space in the beginning of pregipia itself.
880240	889360	He makes these definitions. However, he immediately got stuck, because he had to define,
889360	898160	once he defined what he called absolute time and absolute space, without reference to anything
898160	906480	at all. That's what he meant by absolute. Without taking support of matter and various other concepts,
907200	917040	purely primitive, pristine concepts, he defined space and time, but he couldn't point to what is
917040	921920	space, what is what is time. So he defined them quantitatively or something. Is that what you
921920	931520	mean by definition? Yeah, he just defined it sort of lyrically. You can always give a definition
931520	938240	in terms of words. But how do you point to some object? How do you recognize what is space,
938240	950000	what is time? He said you cannot, because instead of the absolute space and absolute time,
950720	959440	in their place, we use, in practical terms, we use what is called relative space and relative time.
960320	966880	And relative space is when you make markers in space and define a motion with respect to those
966880	974880	markers. And markers are material references. Similarly, time, relative time, some change
974880	984480	is happening. You take that as some reference and describe another change. So he was Newton,
984480	994960	who realized the necessity of distinguishing between space and time as metaphysical primitives.
994960	1003920	And also, provide ways of identifying what could be used as relative space and relative time. So
1003920	1012640	everything is eroded systematically in Pringipiya. Because he also had to talk about certain
1013680	1023520	phenomena which we see, like centrifugal force. This you discussed in an earlier podcast with
1024160	1033360	Assis, for example. So, he wanted to give, since he defined absolute space and absolute time,
1033360	1041520	he also tried to give a proof for the existence of what we call, what he called as the absolute space.
1042160	1049760	And he said, absolute space can be, the existence of reality of absolute space can be
1049760	1062720	seen in phenomena like centrifugal force. And when a mass of liquid in a bucket, if it is
1062720	1072080	rotating, the fact that its surface becomes curved, this kind of a thing happens only because
1073040	1078640	the body of water is rotating with respect to absolute space according to him.
1079440	1085360	Of course, this was criticized much later by Anas Mark, 200 years later.
1086720	1096240	And where he said, what Newton claimed has no basis. Because when you say a body of water rotates,
1096960	1102960	it could be just rotating with respect to all the matter in the universe and not with respect to
1102960	1109360	absolute space. So, it could be an interaction which causes this curvature of the surface of water,
1110080	1116400	real interaction with the rest of the matter and not something, some abstract,
1117520	1121040	unobservable entity like absolute space and so on.
1122000	1126880	Which is a small difference, right? It's a very tiny difference, but it's a really important
1126880	1132720	difference. I feel like Newton was observing this phenomenon, trying to make sense of it,
1132720	1138320	but he stopped thinking about interactions with matter. And that's where things maybe first go
1138320	1143680	off the rails a little bit. But can you address the question I put earlier that were people upset
1143680	1149360	about this when this happened? Were there philosophers that were coming out and saying,
1149360	1155680	no, this can't be? I mean, it's very platonic, the idea of absolute space and absolute time.
1155680	1161040	Yes, it's an old concept. It's a very old concept, absolute space without matter,
1161760	1175920	something which can hold. There is a book by Max Jammar on space and a preface is written by Einstein
1176880	1184240	where, again, these questions are discussed, what is space and what is time. But of course,
1184240	1192800	these are much later. But Newton, after Newton, I think there is some discussion by Bishop Berkeley
1193520	1204000	on this issue. But otherwise, serious discussion and a serious proposal,
1204080	1209840	alternative to what Newton was saying, that happened only with a smock.
1212880	1217120	So people were upset, but they didn't have an alternative. They weren't totally sure how to
1217120	1221360	interactively link it. I'm not even sure that people were upset at the time of Newton.
1221360	1226080	No, that's right. Yeah, there was nothing to be upset about it. I mean, it was acceptable.
1226960	1232080	Like it worked. It worked. And he had, he had mathematically created, I've always seen Newton
1232160	1237680	as the guy who is able to put mathematics in motion. And people are so tickled by that,
1238560	1242240	that they're like, whatever assumptions this guy had to make to do this,
1243520	1246800	fine. Because this works and now we can predict things in design.
1246800	1251760	Also, I don't think people felt very strange to think of space as something,
1251760	1257520	some entity which was there as some absolute abstracting, even without matter.
1257520	1260560	Because there's a long philosophical tradition of the void.
1261840	1267760	Yes. And the void as this concept seems very similar to absolute space. And it seems like a
1267760	1273840	logical, not a huge leap to say, well, okay, if there is void that is unchanging,
1273840	1279520	then there also must be some ticking pendulum somewhere that will never change that everything
1279520	1286640	happens on the backdrop of. For example, you look at serious physicists today.
1287280	1293760	Today, most of the physicists, practicing physicists are willing to accept the concept of
1293760	1301920	space without matter, time without matter. So I don't think, I think people get upset the other way.
1302480	1308160	If you say these things happen because of some interaction, people gets what interaction?
1308960	1313760	We have an article hanging on our wall by Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker that was in
1313760	1317920	some science magazine the other day where they argue that time is an object.
1319520	1324880	Right. And so I think that you're right, that the greatest problem has always arisen when
1324880	1328080	somebody shows up and is like, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Can we like get
1328080	1333440	back to the material at hand here? Was Bergson really the first critic? You talk about Henry
1333440	1340160	Bergson a lot in your work. And was that the first outspoken critic of this misplaced concreteness?
1341040	1348720	No, Bergson comes into picture from another angle. We'll come to that. But I want to make
1348720	1357360	one more point on this, why people were not upset with absolute space. See, when you look up into
1357440	1366880	the sky, you see matter, stars, Milky Way. But if you look at the amount of matter you see
1367680	1376000	in terms of stars and one galaxy, that is really not enough to fill the whole space you can imagine.
1376720	1387840	In that sense, one always thought of largely empty space filled with a few stars and so on.
1388960	1396240	We didn't know the extent of this universe, how much matter it consisted of. All that came in
1396240	1405680	this last century. Before that, we had a solar system and a little bit of stars everywhere,
1405680	1411440	but compared to empty space, this is a very miniscule amount of matter.
1412240	1417760	I believe they thought our galaxy was the extent of the universe all the way up into the 20th,
1418960	1427520	almost the mid 20th century. That's why even when Enes Mark talked about some interaction,
1427680	1435920	interaction which could be responsible for things like phenomena like centrifugal acceleration,
1436720	1443840	he could not suggest it could be the gravity of this matter. Because once you say it is gravity,
1444560	1452720	then you can always calculate using Newton's theory how much gravity. If you calculate gravity
1453440	1460480	with only Milky Way or 102 Milky Way like galaxies, you get a very, very small amount of
1461360	1471200	gravity which is not enough to explain anything which you see. All this realization could not
1471200	1477840	have happened even if you had the idea before we knew about this universe. I think now we
1478720	1485360	can at least observe by statistical sampling something like trillions of galaxies.
1485360	1493520	Yes. Now we have a rough idea of our vast universe, how much matter is there,
1494800	1503360	and it has real serious consequences to our current theories.
1503760	1510720	You make this point in the paper that you shared with us, which is that the theories
1510720	1518320	that are foundational for physics were completed before we ever had this information.
1519360	1524400	The information wasn't even theorized. It wasn't that the theories were put together with the idea
1524400	1531040	that there was this vast universe that was filled with so much material. They were constructed in
1531120	1536480	the sense of, okay, well, we have very little material. And we stuck with those theories.
1536480	1540880	And they haven't been revised. And I think that that's the core of your argument, which is that,
1540880	1547120	okay, so we have these theories that were constructed with a limited base of knowledge.
1547840	1551600	And we have accepted them because they're mathematically very beautiful and I'm sure
1551600	1557520	that there's cultural effects in there as well. But now we have come out the other side and we
1557520	1562000	have so much more information and we have to go back and we have to reevaluate Einstein's theories
1562640	1567520	to see if the core postulates hold knowing everything that we know and everything that
1567520	1575120	we've accumulated in the times really since Newton. Yes. So right here, one can make a point
1575120	1582880	that you can come back to again and again. When you say, let's look at the concept of absolute
1582880	1591920	space of Newtons. Now, when you say absolute space, it only is talking about one space,
1591920	1596080	one entity. There is only one absolute space you will talk about.
1598400	1605600	When you say absolute time, you are talking about one universal time. Conceptually, that's
1605600	1613920	what you mean by that. There is one reference time with the relative to which all other times
1613920	1622320	are measured. There is one space, one holding space in which everything is arranged in various
1622320	1630560	locations and so on. Now, when you talk about a universe, there's only one universe. When we say
1630560	1639040	universe, it is one frame which we are talking about. Then everything else, every other motion,
1639040	1647440	every other position, every thing which is happening, evolving in time, all this will have
1647440	1654480	to be referred to this, what the dynamics of one universe. Then that universe provides
1654480	1662240	reference for dynamics. Now, there is a very intimate connection between
1662240	1668080	this kind of a concept of one absolute reference and things like the propagation of light.
1669440	1676400	If you remember, before Einstein's theory came up, we had a theory of relativity,
1676400	1686080	which was developed by Lawrence and Poincare. This theory had as its background what they
1686080	1694160	called absolute either. Absolute either was a hypothetical medium which was postulated
1694880	1700400	so that the waves of light could propagate in that medium. It is like
1701280	1713440	air for propagation of sound. So, people believed that there should be some medium for the propagation
1713440	1721280	of transverse waves because that's our experience. All transverse waves which we know, all kinds
1721280	1729760	of waves we know of, they all propagate in some medium. So, a medium was postulated even before
1729760	1736160	the theories of relativity came. There is one medium, it's an all-pervading medium which people
1736160	1747200	had in mind. And in that medium, like sound propagates in air, it has some particular velocity
1748240	1755200	decided by the properties of that medium. Now, if you are an observer who is moving
1755200	1761280	relative to that medium, you will measure a different velocity for the same light.
1762400	1767440	Light is propagating in the medium at one velocity. You move in that medium,
1768240	1775440	then relative to that observer, light will move faster or slower depending on the direction of
1775440	1783920	the movement. So, that is a common sense view. So, the old relativity of Lawrence and Poincare
1784880	1791840	had the velocity of light depending on the motion of the observer. It was not an invariant
1791840	1804080	velocity. All this was changed by Einstein's postulate of an invariant velocity of light.
1804800	1814560	He postulated that the relative velocity of light is a constant, no matter whether the observer
1814560	1823920	is moving towards an array of light or moving away from an array of light, if you measure velocity,
1823920	1833680	it's an invariant constant. So, he had a different theory of relativity, which was
1833680	1839440	different from the theory of Lawrence and Poincare. However, the mathematics
1840720	1847120	which is used to describe that theory of relativity was exactly the same, Lawrence transformations.
1848400	1854400	So, it's very interesting that at some stage in the development of physics,
1855600	1862000	let's say 1900, we had two theories of relativity. Both were acceptable theories of
1862000	1870720	relativity because both agreed with every experimental observations we had in those
1870720	1878080	days from Michelson Mollie experiment or later things. Both theories agreed empirically with
1879680	1890320	phenomena which we could see in the laboratory. However, the basic postulates which go into the
1890400	1897680	two theories were entirely different. In one theory, light travelled with a variable velocity.
1898720	1907440	However, there were new phenomena like length contraction, time dilation, so on. Those new
1907440	1915600	phenomena coupled with the propagation of light somehow explained what you can see in the laboratory.
1916000	1924560	In Einstein's theory, very similar phenomena were proposed because he was the same mathematics.
1925520	1933040	However, the way Einstein set up the observability of this phenomena,
1933920	1941920	he arranged a set even with an invariant velocity of light, he could explain the same phenomenon.
1942880	1949680	Now, sociologically, this is where some amount of sociology comes. Sociologically,
1951360	1962640	Einstein's theory was gained prominence very soon. Most of the physicists including Lawrence
1964000	1969600	sort of agreed with what Einstein said. Lawrence said what we were trying to explain
1970320	1979840	and Einstein just postulated and went ahead. So, at some stage, Einstein's theory gained
1979840	1988640	prominence and it got accepted. Though there is not even a single experiment, even today,
1989760	1996400	even today, there is not even a single experiment which can prove that the relative velocity of
1996400	2004240	light is invariant constant. Experiments are consistent with that postulate, but there is no
2004240	2013840	experiment which can prove this postulate directly. Why is that? There are subtle reasons for that.
2016240	2023600	One would imagine that if you measure the velocity of a propagating entity,
2023600	2029760	you can settle the question whether the relative velocity is a constant or variable.
2030640	2037520	It sounds simple enough. For example, if you want to measure the relative velocity of sound,
2038320	2049840	all you need is two microphones set apart by a meter or so on a frame. Then you have a source
2049920	2058400	of sound somewhere. You make the sound and measure the duration to pass between two microphones.
2058400	2064560	So, you have a duration, you have distance fixed by the two microphones. Then you
2065680	2072320	take a ratio, you get a velocity. Then you can move the whole thing and you can measure the same
2073280	2081600	velocity relative to moving reference frame. Therefore, it is very easy to decide whether the
2082560	2088800	relative velocity of sound is variable or a constant. When you do this experiment, you will
2088800	2096960	see that the relative velocity of sound does depend on the velocity of the reference frame.
2097760	2105280	This is just the Doppler effect. Doppler effect is related, but Doppler effect is
2105280	2116080	on the pitch, on the frequency of sound. Velocity is just a ratio between the
2116080	2120880	distance traveled and the duration taken for traveling the distance.
2121840	2127840	The Doppler shift happens when you have a stationary detector and then the sound sources
2127840	2133040	are moving relative to it. But the experiment that you're describing, the microphones and the sound
2133040	2139040	source are all moving together as one unit. That's an interesting question because
2141440	2146640	there is one aspect which is not very clearly explained even in textbooks.
2147280	2153600	Whether you take sound or light or even waves on water surface,
2155680	2162560	the velocity of these waves does not depend on the velocity of the source.
2165040	2174080	That is, it's entirely defined by the medium. It depends only on the properties of the medium.
2174080	2180960	And is this true for light as far as sound? I think just to make sure that we set this
2180960	2184880	absolutely clear, the Doppler thing is just that you're encountering more peaks on the wave
2184880	2192000	which is different than the actual motion of the waves. Whereas the real question in the
2192000	2199760	relativity is whether the relative velocity, whether it depends on the motion of the observer,
2200480	2208480	the reference frame, not the source. Okay, now what's interesting is in the case of...
2208480	2212960	Which would be entirely unique in the universe, right? That would be entirely unique as far as
2212960	2218080	waves propagation is concerned. I didn't understand that question.
2218080	2223280	Well, that would be a very exceptional physical phenomenon if that was true because it doesn't
2223280	2227440	seem to play out that way in any other wave systems that we're aware of.
2227440	2234480	Right. That is, if there is a medium, it's obvious that the relative velocity will depend also on
2234480	2241600	the motion of the observer. It is very clear that if there is only one frame, if there is an absolute
2241600	2252080	frame, one could identify whether it is either or something similar, then the relative velocity
2252080	2257040	will depend on the velocity of the observer. So, postulating that...
2257040	2262560	Hold on one second. I'm really sorry, but weren't we just saying that in the case of sound that
2262560	2265200	it only depends on the medium itself but not the observer?
2266560	2273520	No. It doesn't depend on the velocity motion of the source, but it does depend on the velocity
2273520	2280320	of the observer. So, if we move these two microphones towards the source or away from the source,
2282240	2289200	the duration taken to travel from one microphone to the other will depend on the velocity of the
2289200	2295920	microphone, which is obvious because the sound reaches the first microphone at some time, some
2295920	2302640	instant, then by the time sound reaches the next one, that microphone has moved away.
2303120	2308720	I see, I see. Therefore, obviously, it has to take more time, more duration.
2309520	2314480	Therefore, relative to the microphones, you have to say the velocity is less.
2315840	2322800	Relative to somebody watching this experiment, what happened was the microphone was moving away,
2323680	2330000	so it took more duration. But if you are sitting in the frame of the microphone, if you are moving
2330000	2339200	with the microphone, then it is as if the relative velocity has reduced to reach from one microphone
2339200	2346480	to other. So, when you say relative velocity, it's always a comparison between two observers,
2346480	2352000	one observer who is watching outside the frame and another observer who is sitting with the frame.
2353200	2359600	Got it. Like, we are sitting on the earth, but the earth is moving at a very, very large velocity
2359600	2364960	which we don't realize about. It's not only the velocity in its orbit around the sun,
2365680	2370720	but it's moving through the universe at about 350, 370 kilometers per second.
2372400	2378000	We don't realize that. So, the question is, if a light ray is coming from outer space
2379680	2387520	into our rooms, it touches one window at a particular instant, by the time it reaches
2387520	2396400	the next window, the room itself has moved away a long distance. Now, the question is,
2396400	2403360	even with that kind of a phenomenon, how can it happen that the relative velocity of light
2404160	2413920	be a constant? How can you postulate such a very strange conclusion?
2414320	2427200	That is why it is really a strange postulate. In fact, I have something, see, Charles Nordman,
2427200	2432480	he was a radio astronomer, he was a friend of Einstein, he was an admirer of Einstein.
2433920	2442000	He wrote something, some report on Einstein's visit to Paris in 1922, a very well written
2442480	2449200	short report on the visit, and that time he mentioned this strange postulate of the
2449920	2456880	constancy of the relative velocity of light, and he wrote it this way. There is hardly...
2460400	2467520	He said, however, there is still something infinitely troubling in the Einsteinian system.
2468480	2475520	This system is admirably coherent, but it rests on a particular conception of the propagation of
2475520	2483600	light. How are we to imagine that the propagation of a ray of light could be identical for an observer
2483600	2492000	who flies away from it, and for an observer who rushes to meet it? If this is possible,
2492720	2499920	it is in any case inconceivable to our customary mentality, and no matter how hard we try,
2500480	2507520	we cannot make the mechanism and the nature of that propagation indeligible. It must be
2507520	2515760	confessed that here lies a mystery which eludes us. The whole ancient synthesis, as coherent as it is,
2516560	2526160	rests on a mystery, exactly like revealed religions. That's what he said, and that is true.
2526160	2535600	It's a very strange concept, but once you postulate that invariance of the relative velocity,
2536880	2540800	all results of relativity theory follows from that.
2541680	2551840	Lawrence transformation, everything follows from just that single postulate. That is what Einstein did.
2554080	2559600	And people accepted it, even though it was a strange concept. People accepted it because
2560480	2567760	it gave the full theory. When Lawrence and Poincare created the theory of relativity,
2567760	2578720	it was a step-by-step progression where people had to work out each detail, because it was based on
2578720	2586240	this another strange concept called either, which we cannot see, we cannot feel, we cannot get any
2586240	2594880	evidence for it. But it was also postulated, and people thought any day Einstein's postulate is
2595520	2603600	less evil than accepting something like an ether.
2605520	2612000	Why do you think that is? I understand an unobservable, hypothetical unobservable,
2612000	2618880	this postulate of the ether is difficult to stomach, but some exceptionalism to physics,
2618960	2627520	as we understand it, seems even worse to me. There is one reason, and I think it's an important
2627520	2641200	and genuine reason. If you look at the theory of Lawrence and Poincare, it is based on
2641280	2650160	electrodynamics. Either was a medium, which was meant to support electrodynamics phenomena,
2650160	2657200	called phenomena in electrodynamics. And Lawrence was trying to derive every result of
2657200	2666080	relativity as a electromagnetic phenomena, because matter, it was already known by that time that
2666080	2674320	matter consists of atoms and probably electrons, and there are electrical forces holding matter
2674320	2682240	together. Therefore, he was trying to derive everything in relativity using electrodynamical
2682240	2691680	phenomena. In Einstein's theory, this cage of electrodynamics is broken. It's a more general
2691760	2698000	theory. Having postulated the invariance of the relative velocity of light,
2699280	2706800	then a theory follows from this postulate. That theory is supposed to be applicable to
2706800	2712640	all phenomena in physics. So, it's the temptation of the universalization,
2712640	2716400	this holy grail of physics that I can talk about everything all at once.
2717360	2723520	Yes, so therefore, you would agree that all of us would agree if we are supposed to pick one of
2723520	2729680	these theories, we would say we will prefer the more universal theory which is applicable to
2729680	2737520	mechanics, electrodynamics, optics, everything else. That is what happened. However, we should
2737600	2748480	realize that the postulate was not experimentally verified. It was unverifiable because of certain
2748480	2761280	reasons. Now, one reason I can immediately tell you, when you think of the concept of velocity,
2762240	2772080	it is a statement of the duration taken for moving from a point to another point.
2772720	2779200	So, there is a starting point, there is a final point. Now, you need two clocks,
2780000	2785680	one clock at the starting point and one clock at the finishing point to measure a duration.
2786640	2793760	So, you can fix a distance by pre-measuring that distance, you can say this is one meter.
2794720	2801840	But duration is measured with only two clocks, not with one clock. So, if you are an observer
2801840	2812080	who is at position A, first point, that observer has no access to the clock at B, position B.
2813040	2820160	At position B, there is another observer. So, there is a problem of synchronization of
2820160	2826640	two clocks. How are you to make sure that these clocks read exactly the same type?
2828240	2835200	For measuring the velocity of sound, it does not matter because velocity of sound is a small
2835200	2842000	quantity. You can always, you can synchronize clocks with a accuracy much. There are,
2843040	2849440	the point is, there are things which move faster than sound. So, those things can be used to
2849440	2854800	synchronize these two clocks. But there is nothing which moves faster than light.
2856640	2861840	Okay. So, to synchronize two clocks for measuring the velocity of light
2862800	2868400	is not only a technical problem, it's a conceptual problem. How can we synchronize
2868400	2877120	these two clocks? If you use light for synchronizing two clocks, then it becomes a circular argument.
2878000	2884720	You are trying to measure the velocity of light and you are using the same light to synchronize
2884720	2888160	two clocks. So, that is a circular argument. You cannot do that.
2888560	2894640	If you synchronize two clocks at the same position and move one of those clocks to the
2894640	2900800	second position, you need a theory of moving clocks. You have to make sure that nothing
2900800	2907680	happens to this clock while moving. But theory of relativity is also about what happens to moving
2907680	2916400	clocks. So, you see, conceptually, there is a difficulty of synchronizing two clocks.
2916560	2926160	If you want to measure the relative velocity of light. Therefore, all traditional experiments
2927520	2933360	in relativity are what are called two-way experiments. You send light, get it back
2934240	2941680	by reflecting Michelson-Morley experiment and so on. Now, when you are in a moving frame,
2941680	2946080	let's say you are in a moving vehicle, a moving train or moving earth.
2949040	2956480	And light propagates in one way. You don't know what its relative velocity is. But when
2956480	2963840	light propagates the opposite way, whatever effects which happens because the velocity
2963840	2971280	varies with the motion of the observer, that effect gets cancelled out. Because one way is
2971280	2978000	along the motion of the frame, other way it is opposite the motion of the frame. So,
2978960	2987360	this cancellation happens to a large extent. Because of which you cannot determine whether
2987360	2993680	propagation of light is with a variable velocity or with a constant velocity
2993680	2998800	with any of these two-way experiments. It would be the same thing if we did our
2998800	3003840	microphone experiment and we reflected that sound source in the moving reference frame.
3005520	3010480	There is a, yeah, it's almost same. But there is a subtle difference. There is a subtle difference.
3011200	3017760	So, when I say in the two-way propagation, it cancels out. It does not cancel out
3017760	3022640	endarily. There is a small second-order reference, something which depends on the
3022640	3029680	score of the velocity. That is in one-way propagation. If you could measure, for example,
3029680	3036320	when you do this experiment with sound, you will see that with microphones, as you move the microphone,
3037120	3043040	the velocity, relative velocity changes and that change is proportional to the velocity of the
3043680	3052720	observer. In a two-way experiment, that proportionality, that's not any more
3054960	3062480	surveyed. It cancels out. But there is a residual effect which depends on the score
3062480	3067520	of the velocity, next order, which is a much smaller quantity. What I mean is,
3070000	3075840	when I say first order, it's a ratio between the velocity of the observer and the velocity of the
3077680	3086000	light or sound. For example, velocity of sound is 300 meter per second, let's say, 300 meter.
3086640	3094960	And the microphones are moving at one meter per second. So, one by 300 is the velocity of the
3094960	3102480	observer divided by the velocity of sound, one by 300. That's a kind of signal you can get in an
3102480	3108400	experiment when you do this experiment in a laboratory, the relative strength of the
3108720	3118880	signal. So, if the microphones are moving by one meter per second, you get one by 300.
3119520	3125520	If it moves by two meters per second, you get two by 300 and so on. Proportionately.
3126480	3131120	However, in a two-way experiment, if you reflect sound like a Michelson-Mowley experiment,
3132080	3140240	you get V square by C square, second order. So, one by 300 square, which is much less,
3141280	3151920	which is one by 10 to the power of 5, much smaller. But there is a signal. You can measure that.
3151920	3157440	In fact, that is what Michelson and Mowley were trying to measure, the second order signal,
3157440	3163840	something which depends on the square of the V by C ratio, which is a very, very small signal,
3163840	3169520	because Michelson and Mowley were not trying to measure the relative velocity of sound.
3169520	3174560	They were trying to measure the motion of the air relative to the absolute either.
3175520	3182320	They were trying to detect the motion of the air relative to absolute either. So, for that
3182320	3190000	detection, they realized if light goes and comes back, you still have a small signal
3190960	3197440	in which there is a signature of the velocity of the air through the either. Though it is a small
3197440	3201760	signal, you can measure it. That's what Michelson attempted.
3204080	3208800	Can I ask you just from a conceptual standpoint to help me understand why there's a residual
3208800	3215680	in a two-way experiment versus a one-way? What is the cause of that? Having trouble understanding
3215680	3220400	why that even happens? Not necessarily the math bit, but why is that?
3220400	3227680	That's the reason. Yeah, I can just sort of try to say it and you can try to imagine whatever.
3227680	3236720	Yeah, let's see what we can do. So, the time taken. So, I have a pulse of light which goes from point
3236720	3243760	A to point B. Now, the separation between point A and point B, let's say call it L,
3244960	3251600	distance of 1 meter or L meters. Okay, or let's fix it at 1 meter, 1 meter.
3253200	3263360	Now, the time taken, duration to pass this 1 meter is even by 1 meter divided by the velocity.
3263600	3272000	Length divided by velocity is a duration. Now, suppose the relative velocity
3272720	3280240	depends on the velocity of the observer. So, if you are chasing, if the observer is moving in
3280240	3288560	the same direction as a light propagation, the relative velocity will be less c minus v.
3289520	3295760	So, in one direction, c minus v is a relative velocity.
3298400	3305600	In the opposite direction, it is c plus v. So, duration taken in one direction is 1 meter divided by
3306240	3312720	c minus v. Duration taken in the other way, it is 1 divided by c plus v.
3312960	3322160	Okay. Now, total duration is 1 divided by c minus v plus 1 divided by c plus v.
3323920	3328880	So, this because of c plus v and c minus v happens in the denominator and not in the
3328880	3335600	numerator, they don't cancel out completely. What you get is
3335840	3347360	1 minus v square by c square after that factor will come. In fact, this factor is very important
3347360	3354640	in the relativity. 1 minus v square by c square. I guess for me, I think that conceptually it means
3354640	3360400	that since this whole package is moving, it never really fully catches up to itself. There's some
3360400	3364640	loss to this motion when you're moving with it. It seems like there's just a loss.
3369760	3374720	Yeah, I'm not sure how I can better conceptualize it. I mean, I think that ultimately the mathematics
3374720	3380240	helps conceptualize it because you have this relationship where when you're moving, the
3380240	3388320	speed has to take into account your motion in the same direction. And so, that's c minus v.
3389280	3393600	And then when it's bouncing back in the other direction, it also has to take into account
3393600	3400240	your motion, which is c plus v. And when you mathematically try to combine those two fractions,
3400240	3407440	you end up with this square second order. So, the point is, it is a fraction. That is, if it was,
3407440	3415040	if the c plus v and c minus v, if they're in the numerator, when you add up, the v will cancel out
3415040	3423760	completely. But here we are talking about durations, duration for the propagation. So, it is length
3423760	3430240	divided by the velocity. So, c plus v and c minus v are in the denominator, not at the numerator.
3431040	3438080	Therefore, when you add these two things together, there's a small residual. It depends on v square
3438080	3447600	by c square. And that is, in fact, that was the logic what Michelson used to design his experiment.
3448160	3454880	He said, it is difficult to measure the one-way propagation, but the two-way propagation is
3454880	3459760	easy to measure because I can bring back the light to the location where I am.
3461120	3467120	And though the signal is very small, I have this very nice technique of
3467200	3475120	interferometry. He invented fine interferometry. I will use interference of light to measure this.
3475120	3480640	And he set up the experiment. That's how, but what happened in the experiment?
3481280	3488000	He did not see any signal, though he had the sensitivity to see the v square by c square signal.
3488560	3498320	See, if you look at the numbers here, the velocity v is the velocity of the earth
3498880	3504880	through either. And they assume that that velocity is the same as the velocity of the earth in the
3504880	3514800	orbit around the sun. This is 30 kilometers per second. The velocity of light is 300,000
3514800	3524240	kilometers per second. So, ratio v by c is one part in 10 to the 4, one part in 10,000.
3524880	3534160	Square of that is 10 part in billion. So, it was a small signal, but still it's a signal which
3535440	3540160	has a signature of that velocity. If the velocity is changing,
3540720	3549280	that one will be able to measure it using Michelson's interferometric techniques.
3549920	3554240	Can I ask you a question about interferometers before we move on, which is,
3555680	3560320	aren't we looking at some sort of phase shift of the wave in interferometers?
3560320	3566480	And we're back calculating the velocity change as a result. Is that a more like a Doppler type
3566480	3574320	situation though? It is not Doppler because the source, the interferometer, the observer,
3574320	3581680	everybody is sitting on the same frame in the laboratory. Doppler effects will happen only
3581680	3586400	when there is a relative motion between the source and the detector. Got it, got it. So,
3586400	3590640	it's like in our case where the microphones are moving together essentially. Yeah, everything is
3590640	3601200	moving together. But so, when Michelson did, so in the interference, it is measuring the
3601200	3611920	duration. So, since light is supposed to be a wave, if the duration taken for one way propagation
3611920	3618960	and then the reverse propagation, the total duration is what Michelson was trying to measure here.
3618960	3626560	If the total duration depends on the velocity of the earth through the ether, if that velocity
3626560	3636080	changes, increases or decreases, then the number of oscillations of light
3638560	3647120	in a particular distance also will change. Because when you say a phase of a wave
3647680	3654320	phase, how many oscillations of a wave, it depends, it is just a frequency of that wave,
3654320	3662240	which is a fixed quantity multiplied by duration. So, duration, interference technique can be used
3662240	3668800	to measure durations very accurately. That was a basic idea. And here we are trying to measure
3668800	3675600	a duration. Duration for light to go to a distance and come back to the same position. What is a
3675600	3684640	duration? Does this duration depend on the velocity of the earth when it goes around the sun?
3685680	3693760	And they found that they were not able to measure the variations in this duration,
3693760	3699440	even though the interferometer could be rotated in space. So, the relative velocity is changing.
3700400	3706320	They know that they could change the relative velocity conceptually. However, the signal
3707120	3714720	did not show any of this. So, they could not detect the presence of ether. They could not
3714720	3720640	detect the motion of the earth through the ether. And by ether, we are thinking of this static
3720640	3725680	backdrop type ether, right? That is not really connected necessarily. It does not move around
3725680	3732000	with things. It is just there. Nothing. In fact, it has the property that it is not movable
3734640	3744720	stationary. They called it stationary either. That word was stationary was the word which is used
3745440	3753680	to describe it. So, the concept was there is a absolute, all-pervading medium, which is
3753680	3760560	absolutely still and earth and everything else is moving through that. But they could not detect it
3761280	3769520	and they had to explain why they could not detect it. And Lawrence invented this phenomenon called
3769520	3777920	length contraction. He said, okay, light is propagating with a variable velocity, duration is
3777920	3783360	actually changing, but I cannot see it because interferometer itself,
3785760	3790000	when it moves through the ether, its length reduces a little bit.
3792640	3799200	And that reduction in length also is, involves this ratio 1 minus V square by C square.
3800160	3808880	So, the two can cancel out. Okay, it is more subtle than this. It is actually square root
3808880	3816880	of 1 minus V square by C square for length contraction. There is a similar effect on time
3818560	3825760	dilation. Again, another one square root. So, this two square root of 1 minus V square by C square
3826720	3833520	multiplied together gives 1 minus V square by C square. So, Lawrence could explain everything.
3835680	3842160	So, he said light is propagating in the same way with a variable velocity, but there are new
3842160	3854000	phenomena, length contraction and time dilation. So, all the three together conspire to keep this
3855760	3863280	medium called ether invisible. That was Lawrence's theory. Einstein said, okay, this is all
3864320	3871920	superfluous, extraneous things. We don't need all this either. All we need is single postulate.
3872960	3878880	Postulate that the relative velocity of light does not depend on the velocity of the observer.
3879200	3886480	So, if they had designed the Michelson-Morley experiment,
3887200	3897440	not to measure relative to the ether, but to move the detector as the experiment
3899440	3901280	is run, would they have got?
3901280	3902720	You mean the source or something?
3902800	3910000	Well, the source and the detect... So, assuming that the... So, you have, let's say, an interferometer
3910000	3916240	path, which you have point A and point B. And the light is emitted at point A, but then the
3916240	3922640	detector begins to move from point A towards point B, and it's reflected at point B and comes
3922640	3925920	back to the detector. Would they have gotten a different result? Would they have been able to
3925920	3937040	see this change? No. Earlier, I said, all this does not depend on the velocity of the source.
3937040	3942320	Velocity of the source is irrelevant. But if the source and the detector are the same?
3944960	3948160	If the source and the... Well, because imagine that there's a single postulate,
3948160	3954160	like a single photon gets put into the system. So, let's say even the source and the detector
3954160	3956080	aren't the same thing, but they start at the same place.
3957440	3963840	Yeah. The result will be exactly the same. What Michelson and Morley got, this result
3965280	3974160	is sort of a universal result. That will not change by changing the kind of source or any
3974160	3983760	of the configurational changes. It will not... The point is the explanation that light is
3983760	3988960	propagating with a variable velocity, but there are these new phenomena, physical phenomena,
3988960	3994080	light and contraction and time relation that works in all circumstances.
3996000	4005360	You cannot say that this explanation is incorrect for any experiment. The only thing is you cannot
4005360	4014080	distinguish this explanation from Einstein's explanation that... No, that is not the reason.
4014080	4020000	The relative velocity of light is an invariant. So, these are two different explanations.
4020000	4027120	You cannot distinguish with an... Two-way experiment, you cannot determine which explanation is right.
4028480	4032640	So, you need a one-way experiment. But one-way experiment,
4033600	4038000	there are conceptual problems because you don't know how to synchronize these two clocks.
4040320	4049200	So, one had to invent a method. One had to invent a method where the synchronization
4049200	4058000	problem had to be solved, somehow solve it. You have... The clocks had to be separated in space
4058080	4060640	because light has to travel some distance.
4063680	4072480	But somehow, you have to synchronize clocks at A and clock at B. And what I could do,
4073680	4078000	you know, there are some people who attempted this in the history of physics.
4078160	4089120	But all those attempts were using what is called a circular rotating experiment.
4089120	4091280	This is the Sannyak experiment.
4091280	4103520	Yes. So, when George Sannak did this experiment in 1930, it is specifically to show that,
4104400	4109600	in fact, they either exist or some absolute frame exists.
4110640	4118480	So, he had point A. Light starts propagating from point A, but it comes back to point A.
4119200	4122640	So, point A and point B are identified.
4124560	4131680	So, light has to travel from a distance to get from point A to point B.
4131680	4138960	But it is a looped path. That was his logic. In that experiment, he argued...
4141120	4147600	So, by the time light goes and comes back here, the point B moves a little bit.
4148320	4154720	Just like in a linear system, when light starts from point A to reach point B,
4155360	4159040	by the time it reaches point B, the point B has moved a little bit.
4159760	4163200	Therefore, the relative velocity or the duration is different.
4163760	4170160	Here, rotating apparatus, when the light goes in this loop path,
4171360	4179120	the point B has moved. But now, there is no burden of synchronizing point A and point B,
4179120	4186880	because they are together. It is as if one is using the same clock at A and B.
4187200	4199360	But then, the result was, in some sense, shocking, because it showed that indeed,
4200080	4208080	the relative velocity of light depends on the velocity of the observing frame,
4208080	4220640	reference frame. However, by 1913, Einstein's theory had been already accepted by most of the
4221200	4230240	physics community. Though, there were some objections. Still, some people were not very
4230240	4237520	convinced. But there were very powerful, prominent physicists of that type, Max Planck,
4238240	4245440	Lawrence, and people like that. They had accepted Einstein's theory as the most plausible theory
4245440	4256560	of relativity. Nobody questioned, when Sannak's experiment results came, people tried to evade
4257200	4263040	it instead of discussing it. That's what happened in history. In fact,
4265120	4271120	I was going to say, what was the readout of Sannyak's experiment? Was it a phase shift of the light?
4272000	4276800	Yes, it's exactly the same. In fact, whatever Michelson was trying to measure,
4276800	4281120	he said, every time you do a interferometry experiment,
4282080	4289440	a measurement with an interferometer, a duration, a change in duration is measured as a phase shift
4289440	4294960	and the phase shift is measured as a shift of the fringes, which you see, but this pattern of,
4296080	4303280	periodic pattern of fringes, bright and dark patterns. So, it shifts a little bit and that
4303280	4310080	is interpreted as a change in the duration of propagation and that is how it is measured.
4310080	4316480	And Sannak's experiment also, that is what is measured. But Sannak experiment, if you look at,
4316480	4320560	it's a one-way experiment that propagates in the same direction throughout
4322640	4326000	because the synchronization problem is not there anymore.
4327440	4332320	Therefore, the signal is proportional to V, V by C, not V square by C square.
4332720	4339120	So, it's a much easier experiment to do because signal is very large compared to
4339120	4346160	Michelson-Mowley experiment. So, what happened in the history was,
4346160	4352640	Sannak's experiment was not, it didn't get them attention, which it deserved.
4353440	4360880	But there is something very strange here in the history. The same idea, whatever Sannak had as
4361840	4374160	an idea. Michelson had the same idea in about 1904 and he wrote a paper even before Einstein's theory
4374160	4383200	came up, that was in 1905, Einstein's theory. Michelson wrote a paper in 1904 saying the
4383200	4391600	following. Okay, in the earlier experiment, where the two-way propagation of light was studied,
4392640	4400000	the presence of the hypothetical ether was not found in the experiment. However,
4401680	4408400	if a different kind of experiment is done, in which light travels only in one direction
4409040	4415760	and comes back to the starting point, in that kind of an interferometer, I can measure,
4416960	4423600	I propose to measure the presence of ether. So, he wanted to do an experiment in the same,
4423600	4433360	almost the same design as the Sannak experiment. But Michelson's interest was in detecting the
4433360	4442240	motion of the earth relative to ether. So, what he said was, he could not detect the linear motion
4442240	4448240	of the earth through the ether, but he can measure the rotational motion, the spinning motion of the
4448240	4458000	earth in the ether using a different design of an interferometer. But the kind of interferometer
4458000	4462960	he had in mind had to be very large to measure the rotation of the earth.
4463840	4469040	See, when Sannak did his experiment, he did it in a rotating frame in the laboratory.
4469760	4476640	It was a tabletop experiment where the frame was rotated manually on a table.
4477840	4484160	Michelson's interest was in detecting the rotation of the earth itself relative to ether.
4485120	4493040	And since the earth rotation is at a very small rate, it takes 24 hours for one full rotation.
4494320	4503040	The interferometer had to be very large in size to detect it. But he did this experiment in 1925.
4503920	4508800	It is called Michelson's Gale experiment. He did it with a person called Gale.
4508800	4514800	It was published in Astrophysical Journal in two papers.
4516640	4522080	One paper was about the experiment. It was a kilometer size interferometer,
4524720	4528240	much like today's gravitational wave detectors and so on.
4530880	4536880	And another paper was about the theory of this experiment in which he stated
4537440	4543520	that he detected the rotational motion of the earth relative to ether.
4544560	4555200	In 1925, he wrote that paper. So even in 1925, Michelson was a believer in stationary ether.
4556320	4564640	He was a believer. He had repeatedly said that also. He sort of leaned towards
4565600	4572640	the concept of ether. So he was convinced that there is an absolute frame.
4575440	4583280	However, as I said, Einstein's theory was so prominent by that time, especially after 1919,
4583920	4589840	after the eclipse, solar eclipse, the general theory of relativity, all that came together.
4590800	4597600	The Einstein's theory was unshakable. The faith in Einstein's theory was unshakable,
4598560	4600480	which continues to this day.
4604960	4609600	But however, it's a fact that all these experiments are there in history.
4612320	4617040	These are results which are there, which will not go away. And people said,
4617600	4623840	so the objection to Sannak experiment was that, okay, it's a rotating frame,
4623840	4630320	rotating reference frame, which is not equal to a linearly moving reference frame.
4630320	4636800	There is a, in physics, there is a distinction made between what is called inertial motion
4637360	4646000	and non-inertial motion. Inertial motion is when you move linearly on a straight line
4646640	4653440	at a constant velocity, inertial motion. Inertial motion, you cannot distinguish,
4653440	4661920	you cannot recognize, you cannot distinguish inertial motion from a state of rest.
4664800	4670960	For example, we would say we are in inertial motion with the Earth now. We don't know
4670960	4677120	Earth is moving at hundreds of kilometers per second because we are almost in inertial motion.
4677680	4684080	So, inertial motion cannot be distinguished from a state of rest. It is called principle of
4684080	4690720	relativity. What is called principle of relativity is just this statement that you cannot distinguish
4690720	4697440	inertial motion at any velocity from just a state of rest. It was stated by Galileo.
4697840	4705600	And that's a fundamental principle of physics. So, people try to distinguish between inertial
4705600	4712960	motion and this non-inertial set of motion where there is rotation, acceleration, etc.
4714160	4721920	And there's a misconception even among physicists that Einstein's theory of relativity,
4721920	4728560	special relativity is not applicable to situations of non-inertial motion.
4730320	4737760	Anyway, that kind of an objection was raised about Sannak experiment.
4738880	4745920	Therefore, it was that Sannak's works went into oblivion. People ignored it.
4745920	4755600	However, this is the point I make in my papers and so on. I solved this problem.
4758240	4764960	What I wanted was, I had to solve a dual problem. One is the synchronization of clocks,
4765840	4771280	which people like Michelson and Sannak had already solved by looping around.
4771680	4779520	Now, I also had to solve this problem of inertial motion versus non-inertial motion.
4780240	4785520	I needed an experiment where the reference frame is moving inertially
4787280	4794880	and the clocks are synchronized automatically. So, I found a configuration, which is not a
4794880	4801920	rotating configuration. It's a stadium kind of a loop path. It's a different kind of configuration
4802720	4809520	where the reference frame, the clocks, the detector, the emitter, everything is moving
4809520	4817520	linearly, but the light goes around in a loop path and comes back. And I could do
4818080	4825040	this kind of an experiment in the laboratory and the results show that the relative velocity is
4825920	4832880	exactly like the relative velocity of sound. It depends on the motion of the observer.
4834080	4835760	It's a variable quantity.
4836720	4849280	All right. So, I think that we should unpack the material solutions to this problem or perhaps
4849280	4856240	start to consider Ernst Mach's ideas. Do you want to take a very short break just to stretch
4856240	4861840	really quick before we tackle that issue? Let's do that. I think it's always good to think about
4861840	4866880	this for a minute and then come back to it. Okay. During the break, I took a moment to read
4867520	4874000	the Michelson paper from 1925, the one that he did with Gail. Oops, I can't hear you for a reason.
4874000	4883680	Oh, there we go. So, you make the case that Sonja does this experiment. There's reasons to dismiss
4883680	4890880	it because of the design, but it seems like it would be difficult to also dismiss Michelson's
4890880	4899920	experiment. Yes, right. And Michelson was a more permanent figure. He was a leader. He was a noble
4899920	4912800	laureate. But see, 1925, as I said, by then the theory Einstein's theory was very well accepted.
4913760	4922800	There were very few critics. There were critics always, but there were so few that I think
4924080	4933760	the Michelson-Gail experiment was, it went unnoticed. That's what I think. But it's difficult to
4934160	4942720	gauge. When I give talks on relativity and various things, I see that nobody has heard about
4943600	4950640	the Michelson-Gail experiment except some senior people from a different generation.
4951760	4962080	So, it's not very clear to me why it is so, but because it's very clear what Michelson says
4962080	4968560	in that abstract is very clear. Referring to his 1904 paper, he says that
4970960	4977680	if the ether is there, this is the kind of signal which is expected. And in 1925 writes
4977680	4986880	that the expected signal is measured. It is seen in the experiment. It is very clear.
4986880	5000720	But he was also very careful. He says that this is consistent with Einstein's
5003680	5012240	formulation. In a way, it is actually very subtle. And to explain, it will take some
5013200	5022160	effort. But the point is, even today, you see, Sainac's discovery was very important in terms of
5022160	5027360	practical application. It's a Sainac interferometer which is used today to measure
5029440	5036160	what's called a gyroscope to measure rotations in aeroplanes and so on. If you are in an
5037040	5044720	aircraft, if you want to measure how its direction is changing, you need a gyroscope.
5045600	5051440	What is used today is a laser-based gyroscope, active laser gyroscope,
5051440	5061360	or a fiber laser gyroscope. All this based on Sainac's idea that if you are in a rotating
5062080	5070320	situation, light takes more time to travel the distance and that can be measured.
5070320	5079840	And that is a measure of rotation. So everywhere Sainac gyro is very important in practical
5079840	5087040	applications. However, nobody realizes that this was originally proposed as evidence for
5087920	5097600	the existence of the ether. Okay. But Microsoft experiment is, since it was looking at the rotation
5097600	5103760	of the Earth, it is not that well known as the Sainac experiment.
5107840	5115040	Let's talk a little bit about how we could interpret all of this data in a slightly
5115120	5125600	different light by considering the fact that there's an invalid assumption about empty space
5125600	5130720	spaked into all of this and that if we start to consider that the universe is filled with
5130720	5136560	matter that's all exerting gravity upon one another, we can reframe some of these results.
5137120	5143200	Yes. Yes, we should get to that. But before that, I thought there's one more point
5144720	5150400	related to what you asked earlier, where Henry Buxton comes into picture.
5152080	5156960	See, that is a question of what is called the concept of simultaneity.
5158720	5166320	When do we say two events are simultaneous? Of course, if two events happen at our own
5166320	5173440	location, we are sitting in some location in space. If some two events occur in the same
5174000	5182080	location, we don't have any ambiguity about whether they are simultaneous or not simultaneous.
5183120	5189920	But if these two events happen at a distance from us at two different points,
5190880	5196480	then some signal has to bring in this information about these events to us.
5198000	5201520	How do we decide whether these two events are simultaneous or not?
5203520	5212480	It's an important problem in physics, it's an important problem in general life and it's an
5212480	5221440	important problem of philosophy as well. So Buxton was an expert on issues related to time,
5222240	5231520	duration, simultaneity and he had certain philosophical views on it, maybe prejudices or views
5233280	5238720	along the direction of thinking about absolute time, absolute simultaneity and so on.
5238880	5249200	And it is in this context, in the early 1900s, philosophers came into contact with the
5251120	5259360	relativity theories, in which all these concepts were thrown away,
5260160	5272080	concept of simultaneity, concept of clocks, time, because the rate of clocks,
5272880	5279120	since it depended on the motion of the clocks, moving clock went slow, moving clock was
5279760	5286400	running slower, time dilation. So for every observer, there was his own type,
5287280	5294160	multitude of times. This was not really palatable to philosophers at that time,
5294160	5300720	because philosophers thought there is one universal time, there's one universal concept of
5300720	5309440	simultaneity. So people like Buxton got very interested in studying relativity theory and
5309440	5318720	they did study it very carefully. It is in this context, if you look at Einstein's writing,
5318720	5325600	both his paper in 1905 and he wrote a popular book in 1960, it's called Relativity,
5326160	5334800	Suspicion and General Theory. It's almost written for a popular, common man,
5335760	5343520	that kind of a very, it starts from very basic concepts about time, space, clocks,
5345200	5350800	coordinate systems and so on. Now there is a long discussion about simultaneity in this book,
5352000	5359120	which is described in the context of a moving train, there's a platform. So one is talking
5359120	5364480	about the relativity between the person on the platform and the person in the moving train.
5365120	5373680	So in 1922 when Einstein visited Paris, there was one session, discussion,
5373680	5381840	session of discussions arranged by the Philosophical Society out there. This was a
5382960	5390800	session in Sorbonne and Buxton happened to be there. Buxton was a very prominent,
5391600	5399520	most popular philosopher at that time. His lectures were very popular in Paris
5401200	5409120	and in that session he was just one of the persons who came to listen to what Einstein had to say.
5410400	5418800	At some stage there were some discussions, very short discussions and in which Buxton
5419520	5426560	was asked to comment on Einstein's theory because people knew that Buxton had studied this series.
5427600	5435040	And Buxton said in this short time he has studied it, he studied it for his own benefit
5436000	5442160	and it's a very interesting theory. But in the short discussion he cannot express all that he
5442160	5447840	thinks about this theory. However, he wanted to point out something about this concept of
5447920	5454480	simultaneity in Einstein's theory and he made short comments for a few minutes in which he said
5455600	5464160	there is, he indicated, he didn't explain it but he indicated there is some real problem,
5465120	5472240	the way Einstein deals with simultaneity in relativity theory. Einstein did not take it very
5472240	5482160	seriously. However, in the same year, Buxton wrote a book which is called duration and
5482160	5494640	simultaneity, written in France, published in 1922, in which he explains with extreme clarity
5495360	5503440	where Einstein had gone wrong, real wrong in dealing with simultaneity in relativity.
5505360	5515440	Okay, so I didn't want to explain the whole writing here but it's, if Einstein had paid
5515440	5524000	attention to what Buxton had to say in that book, he, Einstein himself would have been able
5524000	5535600	to correct his theory because what he talks about simultaneity in his theory is actually a blunder,
5535600	5542320	blunder in the sense that once you assume that the velocity, relative velocity of light
5543760	5550320	is the same for everybody. Suppose we say, relative velocity of light is invariant
5551120	5559520	and the same for everybody, then the concept of simultaneity which follows from that postulate
5560400	5566560	is in direct conflict with our experience, what we experience as simultaneity.
5569600	5572640	Not as a common, I'm not talking about mathematical,
5572800	5582720	mathematical subtleties of relativity, we can experience directly in real life certain examples
5582720	5590160	of simultaneity and we know what the result is. The concept of the postulate of the
5590160	5598080	invariant velocity of light is inconsistent with our experience of simultaneity. This was pointed
5598080	5605280	out. What are the examples that Buxton uses of simultaneity that is experienced? So he analyzes
5607760	5618720	the same example what Einstein describes in his book of the strain and the platform.
5619440	5625600	So the experiment, the example with Einstein uses is very, very simple. He says there's a train
5626160	5637200	moving along a platform. The platform has n points A and B. Train has n points A prime and B prime.
5639040	5647360	Now let's assume that when the train reaches the platform, these points coincide,
5648480	5654320	a point on the platform coinciding with a point on the train and the second point on
5654320	5661360	the platform coinciding with the second point on the train. Let's assume that there is an observer
5661360	5666880	on the platform, there's an observer on the train at the midpoints, midpoint of platform,
5666880	5674560	midpoint of the train and they are coinciding at some point of time. They are in line with each
5674560	5682480	other. Let's assume that at that time two strokes of lighting happened at the two ends of the train.
5684320	5691920	Somehow, so on end A and end B, two strokes of lighting has happened. Light from these
5693760	5703280	strokes of lightning will reach both observers. Now since the person on the platform is at the
5703280	5712720	midpoint, if he gets these light flashes from these two strokes of lighting at the same time
5712720	5719360	in his clock, he will say the lighting happened simultaneously at the two points
5719920	5724640	because he is at the midpoint. Now the question Einstein asks is,
5726240	5731760	for the observer in the train, are the two strokes simultaneous or not?
5734080	5738800	He is moving, he is moving relative to what at the at this particular point when the strokes
5738880	5748240	happened that two observers coincided. And then there is analysis of what would the person
5748240	5752400	inside the train conclude about simultaneity. That's the only question which is answered
5752960	5759280	by both Einstein and Berkson. And the correct experience if you think about it,
5760320	5765440	the person in the train will not see it simultaneously because he is moving away.
5765440	5770880	By the time the lightings come from both sides, he would have moved away from the midpoint.
5770880	5777600	Therefore, he cannot see these two strokes of lighting simultaneously. That's our experience
5777600	5784560	also. However, if the relative velocity is same for the observer on the platform
5785360	5791360	and the observer on the train, suppose it is same, then their experience also has to be
5791360	5797040	exactly same. When you analyze this, suppose a person on the platform sees this,
5798160	5803920	how will we, how will he argue, he is on the midpoint, light from the left side,
5803920	5809760	left side and the light from the right side are coming at the same relative velocity of velocity.
5809760	5815040	So therefore, since I am in the midpoint, they will reach at the same time. So therefore,
5815040	5823120	it's all simultaneous. Now the person in the train, how will he argue? He will say,
5824160	5830480	when I was in the midpoint, the lighting happened. But the velocity of light does not depend on the
5830480	5840320	velocity of the source. Okay. The relative, if the relative velocity of light from the left side
5840320	5846560	and from the right side are exactly the same for the person on the train as well,
5847760	5854880	then both pulses have to reach him also at the same time. There is no escape from that conclusion.
5856480	5865360	So experience contradicts the postulate very clearly. However, Einstein in his book, as well
5865440	5873920	as in his paper, when he argues about simultaneity, he forgets the fact that he has already assumed
5874560	5881360	that the relative velocity of light is invariant constant. He ignores that he makes a blunder
5881360	5891360	really. And this blunder, Berkson points out very clearly in his book as one paragraph, one paragraph.
5892000	5900800	But nobody took Berkson seriously at that time. It's a real blunder. Now there is a direct
5902560	5913920	consequence of all this. You know, GPS, GPS, all this only information, where GPS works,
5914880	5920640	the only information which comes from these satellites to our receiver in our mobile phone and so
5921360	5930400	are timing signals. The time at a satellite at about 20,000 kilometers away,
5931680	5938800	the timing signal comes saying that my position is this and I am sending the signal,
5938800	5945680	this is the time in this atomic clock. And similar timing signals are coming from multiple
5945680	5954400	satellites. To localize somebody in position, in space, you need to convert these timing signals
5954400	5961440	to distances. So there is a time of emission of the signal. There is a time of the arrival
5961440	5968480	of the signal in the receiver. The difference is the duration. This duration has to be converted to
5968480	5977760	a distance. Now we know that the relative velocity does not depend on the velocity of the source.
5977760	5984080	So the fact that the satellites are moving doesn't matter. It will only contribute to some
5984080	5990160	Doppler shift, Doppler shift in the frequency of signal, but not in the type because relative
5990160	5996880	velocity does not depend on the velocity of the source. Now the question is, in Einstein's theory,
5996960	6001680	the relative velocity does not depend on the velocity of the observer also, the receiver
6001680	6009040	as well. Therefore, the distance conversion from duration to this duration to distance
6009040	6015120	is a simple formula, invariant velocity multiplied by the duration. Distance is
6016080	6023920	just invariant constant velocity C multiplied by the duration. So when we have three such
6023920	6034640	durations, we can localize a person, a receiver. Okay. So it's a question of something like
6034640	6042080	simultaneity from three different satellites, which is a point where things are simultaneously
6042960	6055120	localized. However, suppose this concept of Einstein's concept of postulate of invariant
6055120	6065200	velocity is conflict with the concept of simultaneity. Then Einstein's formula cannot be used in
6065200	6074400	actual practice of GPS operation. You need to use the formula which is used in a Galilean theory,
6074400	6080240	like a velocity of relative velocity of sound. Because if the receiver is moving away from the
6080240	6085680	satellite, you have to say C minus V. If the receiver is moving towards a satellite,
6085680	6093760	you have to say C plus V and so on. Now it turns out the actual formula, the formula which is
6093760	6101680	actually used in GPS. If you can ask any expert in GPS, you will say it is not Einstein's formula.
6101680	6110800	It is not C times duration to calculate the distance. It is C minus V times the duration.
6112560	6118560	Okay. But that's a detail. What I'm saying is what Berkson said in 1922.
6119040	6128320	It has its resonance echoing today in GPS operation. And all this has to do with the fact that the
6128320	6138880	relative velocity is not an invariant concept. The GPS example is an elegant proof of the way that
6138880	6146960	a mathematical theory is perhaps elegant and beloved, but in practice is not used. And I think
6147920	6153440	that that's the core of the argument here, which is that there are inconsistencies with the way that
6153440	6162640	we mathematically apply these rules to reality, which is that we like the ideas behind relativity,
6162640	6168160	but when push comes to shove and we have to design a system, we use different mathematics. And those
6168160	6176000	mathematics seem to imply that the velocity is not constant, that the motion is affecting the
6176000	6184720	perceived velocity. Well, not the mathematics. What I mean is experience. Experience is what
6184720	6196000	contradicts the postulate, the basic postulate of a special theory of relativity. See, if you
6196000	6203120	look at Einstein's theory of relativity, that's the basis of all physics today.
6205120	6212480	So one cannot say that everything what is said in the theory is incorrect, because most of the
6212480	6220800	things I had to be working in practice to say that the theory was successful, which is a fact,
6220800	6227520	for example, various particle physics experiments and so on. See, if you really look at the theories
6227520	6235600	of relativity, there are two vital physical effects which you actually see in phenomena.
6235600	6244400	One is the fact that moving clocks runs slowly, time dilation. In fact, that's the most important
6245360	6253520	physical effects coming from theory of relativity. But this is a common effect. This effect is there
6253520	6259920	in both, both kind of theories. It was there in the Lawrence's theory with either, it's there in
6259920	6270800	Einstein's theory without either. So there are several physical effects which are described
6270800	6277760	correctly in both theories and they are all seen in actual empirical situations.
6279680	6287760	But really crucial, when you test a theory in physics especially, there is a concept of what's
6287760	6293440	called a crucial experiment. Even one experiment, even one experiment going against a theory
6293440	6302160	will invalidate the theory. You don't have to test a whole lot of things. Even if 99 experiments
6302720	6308640	are favouring the theory, if one experiment goes against a theory, then the whole theory can get
6308640	6318320	replaced. In fact, there is a particular quotation from Einstein which I would like to read out
6318880	6326080	which may be interesting. He says, the theoretical scientific researcher is not to be envied
6326720	6335120	because nature or more precisely put experiment is a merciless and not very kindly judge of his
6335120	6345040	efforts. She never says yes to a theory. In the best case, merely perhaps. But in most cases simply
6345040	6354000	no. If an experiment agrees with a theory, it means perhaps. If it does not agree, then it means no.
6355040	6363920	If every theory is sure to experience, it's no someday. Most theories already do so soon after
6363920	6373440	their formulation. So this crucial experiment, that is a critical element here. Even one
6373440	6383760	experiment going against a theory invalidates a theory. Here we have many examples of experience
6383760	6392640	where the postulate seems to go against experience. Therefore, there must be an alternate theory
6393600	6400320	where these things are consistent. That is what we should discuss. What is that consistent theory
6400400	6403760	which will explain everything which we know in a empirical situation
6404560	6413280	and also consistent with the fact that light can propagate with a variable velocity?
6417840	6426320	Yeah, I assume that this leads us neatly to Mach and the involvement of the rest of the universe.
6426800	6430640	Yes, that's right. Now, one point.
6431920	6436480	Can I say one thing though? I love that Einstein quote. I haven't heard that one before. But one
6436480	6442160	thing I love about it is that Einstein captures the essence of science, which is that it whittles
6442160	6448880	down possibilities. Nature never says yes to your theory. It can only say eh, maybe.
6450160	6453760	And people get so married to their theories because they think their yes is.
6454480	6460720	And I just love the humility in that Einstein quote of just recognizing that these theories
6460720	6465280	all get chopped down and replaced eventually because new data becomes available, new ways
6465280	6470320	of looking at things appear in people's imaginations. I just think that's underlining
6470320	6476320	the possibility nature of theories. We permit these ideas into the sphere of possibility
6476320	6479440	when they become theories, especially when they're widely accepted theories.
6480000	6484400	They pass lots of different tests, but that doesn't mean that they are necessarily so.
6484400	6489760	It just means they haven't been proven to be not so. That's really, really remarkable.
6491920	6499680	He wrote it in 1912 in a paper which he wrote about superconductivity. Superconductivity was
6499680	6506640	discovered in 1911. In 1912, he wrote a theoretical paper. And I think he was aware that he could
6506640	6512880	be wrong about what you were saying. That is where he has his quotation. Of course,
6514080	6520880	looking at edging from Einstein's personality, I wonder he ever thought his theory of
6520880	6528080	relativity would be subject to the same fate someday. I would assume so from the tone of
6528080	6534400	that statement. I do like that about him a lot. All right, so let's talk about Mark. Let's talk
6534400	6539280	about the cause of these discrepancies and what you think the solution said.
6541120	6546720	Before we get there, I've been rolling this thing around in my head about the Michelson-Gale
6546720	6558960	experiment. Is it possible to do this experiment on a larger scale with experimental apparatuses
6558960	6565920	that are already in place? You look at the Michelson-Gale paper and they spent a ton of money.
6565920	6573600	They had an army engineer who helped them design this massive kilometer-long path. Is there some
6573600	6577760	place where this experiment could be repeated in the modern day without having to invest?
6578480	6583920	Yeah, I know. It is always investment. If it costs at that time, it will cost much more today.
6584160	6592800	However, you see the Michelson-Gale experiment. The interferometer was already a size of a
6592800	6602320	kilometer size interferometer. There was some mild vacuum and so on based on whatever technology
6602320	6609920	was available then. But today, the gravitational wave detectors are also Michelson interferometers,
6610000	6615760	standard Michelson interferometers. Now, the next generation gravitational detectors,
6615760	6623440	which are supposed to come up after about 10 years, they are sort of triangular configuration.
6625440	6635920	In some sense, one can get similar data similar to what Michelson and Gale got in their
6635920	6641360	rectangular interferometers in this closed triangular
6643760	6651840	detectors of next generation. So it is not very difficult to do this kind of experiment
6651840	6658480	with today's technology. You don't even need one kilometer size with today's technology because
6658480	6666080	when Michelson did these experiments, there was no laser. Laser was discovered after 1960.
6667600	6673920	Michelson was doing all these experiments using discharge lamps and things like that.
6674720	6681360	Very, very small amount of light. But today, the same experiments can be done with much more
6681360	6690240	sensitivity on even a smaller scale with good vacuuming. So doing the experiment is not a problem.
6691440	6696480	What is the problem? The problem is in convincing people that here there is something
6697440	6704160	to be explained. And it's very difficult to convince people that there is a deviation
6705120	6714720	which doesn't agree with Einstein's postulate. But doesn't the GPS make it apparent?
6715760	6720720	Well, they just discounted based on the non-inertial business that we talked about.
6721280	6725280	Yeah, most of the time, that's what they do. Even there, there is an issue.
6725920	6732800	See, GPS was a technology which was implemented not by physics people. It was implemented by
6732800	6739360	defense people, okay, military and all that. So there were physicists and engineers working in that,
6739360	6746880	but mostly engineers, the physics people who are working in that tried to use and they knew about
6746880	6754160	the effects of relativity. And when the first two satellites which were sent up in the GPS
6754160	6760160	constellation, of course, now there are many, many such constellations. But when the first satellites
6760160	6768560	went up, they assumed that Einstein's formulae, formulae based on Einstein's special theory of
6768560	6774720	relativity would be sufficient, apart from the gravitational effects of one-two clocks and so
6774720	6783440	on. But soon they realized that those formulae did not work. So there were post facto corrections
6784320	6792640	introduced in the GPS algorithms. And one of them is this correction for using,
6793200	6799520	correction using C minus V and C plus V instead of C. Instead of using a constant velocity,
6800160	6807200	you use a variable velocity. But the justification given by GPS physicist's
6807440	6821760	name is Neil Ashby. He writes a lot on this Neil Ashby. The main logical basis he talks about
6822480	6830080	is about this non-inertial motion and things like that. Same objections which was raised again
6830080	6838480	about SANAX experiments. People now write about GPS assessment. But they are not
6842240	6847680	sufficient, I would say. I will give you one example, which is a very interesting example.
6848880	6858560	Suppose you see a flock of birds flying backwards carrying a clock. So there's a flock of birds,
6859280	6866400	they carry a clock, but they're flying backwards. You of course immediately know,
6866400	6874640	any commonsense person will know that birds cannot fly backwards with flapping their wings.
6875600	6885120	The only way this can happen is when we, our observer himself, is moving faster than the birds
6885760	6892560	in the same direction. We have the illusion that the birds are flying backwards.
6893920	6901760	Now you ask the question, where the clocks carried by these birds, will it go faster and slow or
6901760	6908640	slower? Will it have a time dilation? Einstein's theory says yes, because the clock is moving
6908720	6915760	relatively, the clock is moving relatively, therefore it should go slower. But I know
6916560	6924000	from common sense that I must be moving faster than the birds. That is why birds are flying
6924000	6932640	backwards. Therefore the clock carried by me should be going slower. Okay. It is just a
6932640	6938080	common sense objection. It is not an evidence against Einstein's theory. I'm not presenting it
6938080	6946800	as an evidence. I already see common sense of even an uneducated man can conflict with the
6946800	6956320	best theories of physics. And one should take this common sense conflicts very seriously
6956320	6962560	and think about it. Sometimes it may be irrelevant, but sometimes it can be very relevant.
6963360	6971520	Okay. Now we can get back to Mark. What's actually going on in your opinion?
6973520	6979840	What's actually? What's the hidden story here? There's these problems,
6979840	6983680	there's some contradictions. What does the solution set look like?
6984400	6993600	Yes. Now we come back to this issue of cosmology. We know very well that these theories were
6993600	7003760	formulated, perfected and so on. Before we knew about the extent of the cosmos, the amount of
7003760	7014800	matter in the cosmos and so on. So after 1930, after Edwin Hubble's observation that there are
7014800	7022320	a lot of extragalactic objects which seems to be going away from us at velocity proportional to
7022320	7032960	their distance, people started looking at the galaxies outside far away using the new generation
7032960	7040080	of large telescopes, one meter telescope, Palomar and various other places. Then slowly
7041760	7049120	we realized that the universe was at least a thousand times larger than what we thought it is.
7050560	7058240	Okay. We knew this Milky Way and a few Nebulae around this Magellanic clouds and so on.
7059120	7065360	But with these new telescopes, we realized that the universe is at least thousand times larger.
7066480	7073120	If it is thousand times larger, of course, the volume is a billion times larger, cube of this
7073120	7082160	thousand. So if the volume is billion times larger, we also expect the matter in this universe,
7082240	7085040	also a billion times larger than what we thought it was.
7087760	7096880	All that is fine. But now, if there is so much matter, there has to be corresponding amount of
7096880	7109280	gravity. And gravity is a very special interaction because it can affect logs, it can affect propagation
7109280	7117440	of objects, it can affect all dynamics. Even Einstein's theory itself, the general theory of
7117440	7125120	relativity, which is a theory of gravity, also says these things. We already know from experiments
7125680	7131680	that if you have two clocks at two different gravitational potentials, one at a lower potential,
7131680	7138000	another at a higher distance, a different potential, these two clocks will run at different rates,
7138720	7145360	depending on the value of the potential at the location of the clocks. So there is gravitational
7145360	7154240	time dilation. And there is a difference in gravitational potential, it can affect the rate
7154240	7164080	at which the clock runs. However, such effects are not included in the present theories, in the sense
7164400	7171360	with this enormous gravity in this universe, with this enormous gravitational potentials,
7172240	7178720	if there is any effect on clocks and propagation of light and so on, those effects are not part
7178720	7186480	of our current theories because in the current theories, the matter in the universe is not
7186480	7195760	even considered. So there is a very big missing factor. Of course, we don't know a priori that
7195760	7205280	this gravity has a significant effect or not, that we have to calculate. But the fact that gravity
7205280	7213920	affects everything means we need to reconsider our theories that because we have this new information
7214000	7223520	about the universe and if the gravity has any importance, if its magnitude is sufficient to
7223520	7231680	affect phenomena in the laboratory, we have to reconsider these theories and calculate all
7231680	7238800	these effects and see whether this is significant to change the theories or not. That's a basic
7238800	7249360	premise. Now this calculation can be done and some very interesting facts come out when you do a
7249360	7257600	even a rough calculation. See today, cosmology has developed to a stage where we have a
7258560	7264640	reasonably good idea about the average density of matter and energy in the universe.
7265280	7275280	Okay. So we have direct observation of galaxies and various sources which emit light,
7276320	7282320	but that is not all the matter. There is what is called dark matter, for example. They are
7282320	7289760	indirectly measured using their gravitational effects. So we have some measurements of this
7289760	7296960	average density of the universe. There is some uncertainty, both conceptual and quantitative
7296960	7302640	uncertainty in all these measurements. But if you have a reasonable idea, how much
7302640	7306720	matter is there, how much energy is there and so on in the universe today.
7308560	7314640	If you use these observational values and calculate the total gravitational potential
7314640	7320800	in our rooms, for example, in your room or in the room I am sitting, the same value because the
7320800	7328720	universe has the same kind of appearance relative to our small earth. The number which comes out
7328720	7334560	is a very interesting number. The total gravitational potential due to all the matter in the universe,
7334560	7340880	all the matter and energy in the universe, if you calculate, you get a number which is numerically
7341840	7354800	very close to the square of the velocity of light. That velocity of light is 300,000
7354800	7362640	kilometer per second. Take the square of that. That is a number. That number matches
7364160	7369360	the value of the total gravitational potential of all the matter and energy in the universe.
7370160	7373440	So, this is not a coincidence. There is something profound
7376000	7378800	in the fact that these two numbers match.
7381920	7387360	First suggestion is the propagation of light is controlled by the gravity of the matter in the
7387360	7394400	universe. That is why there is a relation between the velocity of light and the gravitational potential
7394400	7400320	of all the matter and energy in the universe. The cosmic gravity, its value
7401680	7409760	is equal to the square of the velocity of light. Okay. So, not only that it is enormous,
7409760	7416800	enormous gravity, it is also this particular value rate optimal. This can be calculated.
7416800	7421920	This fact was known for a long time. People did not connect it up with anything else,
7422480	7429200	but this fact was known for a long time. It is not a new fact. That is one thing.
7430000	7437920	Now, referring back to Mark's principle. See, why did what Mark said was very profound? Everybody
7437920	7444960	agrees that what Mark said and what is called Mark's principle today, it was named Mark's principle
7444960	7452800	by Einstein himself. Even Einstein said is a very profound principle. But you all know that
7452800	7456000	Mark's principle is not part of our standard physics today.
7458320	7465600	Mark's principle is talked about as an extraneous principle. It is not part of any standard theories
7465600	7474080	of physics today. There is a reason for that, which I, when I first realized this, I was really
7474080	7483760	amazed. Mark's principle implies that there is one universal frame, one universe. Because Mark's
7483760	7493600	principle takes effects of dynamics centrifugal force and things like that happens because of
7493600	7500160	some interaction with the rest of the matter in the universe. Whatever that interaction is,
7501120	7507760	since universe is one preference frame, accepting Mark's principle immediately implies
7508320	7515440	accepting an absolute frame like ether and so on. But once you accept an absolute frame,
7517120	7522560	the direct consequence is that propagation of light is Galilean. The velocity, relative
7522560	7528800	velocity of light will depend on the velocity of the observable. So, Mark's principle cannot
7528880	7534160	be incorporated in current physics without breaking Einstein's theory, without throwing away
7534720	7542480	Einstein's theory of relativity. So, because of this, though Einstein really, if you look at the
7542480	7549680	history of the development of general theory of relativity, how Einstein developed that theory.
7550320	7556240	For about five years, Einstein could not decide whether Mark's principle should be
7557120	7562400	taken as a basis of general theory of relativity or some other principle.
7563680	7570560	He tried incorporating Mark's principle into his theory of gravity, the general theory of
7570560	7576880	relativity. He could not because general theory of relativity was based on specific theory of
7576880	7584160	relativity, in which he already assumed the invariance of the velocity of light. But Mark's
7584160	7590720	principle needs an absolute frame, which will deny the basic postulate of special theory of
7590720	7597520	relativity. Therefore, he finally discarded Mark's principle. That is why Mark's principle is not
7598160	7610080	any more discussed in physics. So anyway, so the interaction, gravitational interaction with
7610080	7615040	all the matter in the universe provides just gravitational potential affecting everything
7615040	7622320	in the universe. So, if you take two clocks, one clock, which is stationary in this universe,
7623040	7628960	and another clock, which is moving in this universe, the gravitational potential experience
7628960	7634320	by the moving clock is slightly different from gravitational potential experience by the stationary
7634320	7641680	clock. And this can be calculated. Then you know what is the gravitational potential for a stationary
7642400	7649200	frame, which is, I said, the score of the velocity of light. You can very precisely calculate
7649920	7653200	what is the gravitational potential felt by a clock, which is moving.
7655040	7659200	And then it turns out that the time dilation, which we see, beyond some
7659280	7667840	accelerators and so on, or moving real clocks in the laboratory, all the time dilations,
7667840	7675600	which we see experimentally, match us exactly with the gravitational effect of the universe.
7676960	7683280	So therefore, we have an explanation of, explanation for
7684240	7694880	phenomena like time dilation, which is a prime effect of relativity we see in the laboratory.
7695760	7704320	Laboratory evidence for relativity is prime example is time dilation. We know that you don't
7704320	7708880	need Einstein's theory to explain that. We need only the gravity of the universe.
7709600	7716880	Similarly, for many, many physical effects in the laboratory, we can do this calculation,
7716880	7724080	the effect of the gravity of the cosmos, cosmic matter on what we see in the laboratory.
7724800	7732560	And for every instance, without any exception, it matches. The calculation matches what we see
7733280	7740960	in the laboratory. So every relativistic effect, which we see in the laboratory today,
7742560	7748080	can be explained as a consequence of the gravity of the matter in the universe.
7750480	7756480	I mean, that's a very, very profound framing of the interrelation
7757280	7764640	of the cosmos and the effect that the distant stars have upon us. It's a formulation that's
7764640	7773600	been around since Mox time, which he was writing in the 1920s. I think like 1870, 1880, those.
7774640	7781120	Right, because Einstein was familiar with it. And so it fell out of favor because relativity
7781120	7787760	offers these very tantalizing thought experiments and purports to put us into a,
7789040	7794160	personally, I think a more fantastical universe. Yes. And so now we're up against the challenge
7794160	7801040	where you have two theories where the mathematics give you, they can describe the same observed
7801040	7807440	phenomenon. Here, the mathematics is different. The mathematics is different, but the end point
7807440	7812160	is that you have an observation and you can use one set of mathematics, which is Einsteinian
7812160	7817760	relativity, to describe it. And then you have another set of mathematics, which refers to the
7817760	7824160	cosmos to describe it, but the observation is the same. And so this comes down to preference and
7824160	7831040	and belief really, like this is a cultural state of affairs. Here there is no choice.
7832000	7841120	Okay. Because we can see the objects in the universe with a telescope,
7843600	7849760	or various measurements related. So there are galaxies and so on. They are really there.
7850800	7858000	They are not an illusion. If those gravities, if those objects are there, there has to be
7858640	7865600	gravity of corresponding to those objects. There's no choice. Right? So if gravity is there,
7865600	7872960	those gravitational effects would be there. So now if Einstein was, if suppose Einstein's theory
7872960	7882080	is right, then you will have a doubled effects, one due to Einstein's formulation, whatever that is.
7883040	7888560	And this gravitational effect, which has to be there because there is also objects are really
7888560	7895920	there. But you cannot have both together because that will have doubled the effect. So you have to
7895920	7902720	make a choice between the two. And the choice is obvious because those objects are there.
7904160	7910960	You cannot choose Einstein's theory and say, though those objects are there, their gravity is not.
7912640	7919440	Again, you cannot make such a front. I love that it simplifies things and speaks in terms of
7920000	7926720	the real material objects. But gravity itself is still a nightmare, right? So why do two atoms
7926720	7931040	attract to one another at the end of the day? Do you spend any time thinking about that at a
7931040	7935120	material scale? Like what are the atoms actually doing to pull each other together?
7936000	7942400	Yes, you can ask the same question about electrical forces as well. Okay, so why
7944880	7951840	matter interacts with matter in this particular way is a deeper question. I would say it's a deeper
7951840	7959680	question. So for example, take the concept of a field, gravitational field, magnetic field,
7960480	7967440	and electric field. We cannot experience any of these fields. All we can see is when we put two
7968240	7974080	pieces of matter together with certain properties, they either attract or dribble,
7974080	7980080	there's a force, we can push one with another. Yeah, they're like maps of effects, essentially.
7980080	7986720	They're like predictable maps of effects. And because we like continuity, the concept of
7986720	7995120	continuity, we don't want, we don't like action at a distance. We like only when we see something
7995120	8003520	being pushed, we want to associate something local pushing it. By proposing, by postulating a field,
8004160	8009760	we can say, okay, I have a piece of matter, this creates a field, which is everywhere.
8009760	8015760	Then that field acts on another piece of matter. It's a nice concept. But every field,
8016400	8023280	whether it is gravitational, or electric or magnetic, they are all unobservable entities in
8023280	8031200	physics. Okay, they are postulated. They are what we would call free creations of our mind.
8032080	8038560	Right, they're abstract. Yeah, we can never verify their reality, the way we verify the
8038560	8048400	reality of matter, solid matter. So there is a gradation of realities, which we use in physics,
8048400	8054400	but there is no escape from that using such concepts. That's the way we understand it.
8054400	8059280	You think there's no escape, or do you think that we just haven't conceptualized it fully?
8059280	8066720	No. Any other way of talking about this becomes very complicated. There is a formulation of
8067280	8071680	interaction between two objects to matter, whether it's gravitation or
8072720	8079840	electrodynamics. There's a formulation of action at a distance. There are mathematical
8079840	8087200	formulations of how two objects interact without a field intervening, these two objects.
8087200	8094960	They are called action at a distance theories. But they are mathematically very formidable.
8095920	8103040	But the question is not necessarily whether or not there's not a field in between the two
8103040	8107280	objects. The question is, is the field made of something?
8108080	8116880	Yes, so how do we decide that? That's a problem. So now one thing which we seem to agree,
8116880	8122560	even that is debatable, but seem to agree is that this field contains energy.
8123120	8130400	And when we are talking about attraction of two objects, it's not so obvious. But when we talk
8130400	8138960	about a propagating wave, for example, you move an object, either a mass or a charge,
8139600	8145520	it generates electromagnetic wave, which can transfer energy from here to there.
8146560	8152480	Because we can do all this communication with electromagnetic waves. So there seems
8152480	8159200	to be some reason in proposing that there is a field which is independent of matter,
8159200	8164960	which can propagate, which can affect and so on. There seem to be reasonable concepts.
8168240	8174560	Again, it's not necessarily that there isn't the effects of the field. It's like,
8174560	8180960	when we talk about energy, well, I think one of my favorite definitions for energy is
8180960	8187200	material in motion or material that can be in terms of potential energy. It's material that
8187840	8194320	under other circumstances will go into motion. And so when we talk about energy in terms of
8194320	8199200	electromagnetic waves, all of the sudden, we kind of throw our hands up and we say, well,
8201200	8205440	the field itself is in motion, but the field is mathematical. The field is a set of measurements
8205440	8216720	that we have made. Yeah. So this would have been a puzzle, but for the relation which Einstein
8216720	8225440	himself clarified, equating energy and mass. So when he said there is a equivalence between
8225520	8236560	energy and mass, that in some way, not solved, but at least reconcile this problem,
8237360	8245200	that energy equivalence to some kind of a matter. So when you come to quantum theories,
8245200	8252640	for example, we talk about photons, particles of light, instead of just waves.
8253280	8261760	And there, at least, we think of photon as some localized quanta of energy,
8262480	8268080	very similar to matter, though it is not really as real as matter.
8270320	8275680	But at least we talk about quanta of energy very much like a particle.
8276640	8283360	In that sense, there is a close analogy. I agree that they are not the same.
8284960	8290800	They are not the same. It is not exactly matter in the normal sense, like an electron moving
8290800	8296720	for a fundamental particle moving. But photon is treated as a fundamental particle
8296720	8302880	with the properties of a particle today. I guess the thing that leaves me deeply
8302880	8308880	unsatisfied comes back to this human intuition, which is that if quantum fields,
8310080	8315920	when you come down to the bottom of it, are pure energy, which is determined by the measurements
8315920	8322320	made of, let's say, the zero point energy of the vacuum, or inside of a particle collider,
8322320	8329200	you have some kind of momentum transfer between the thing that you're measuring and your detector.
8330160	8338000	In the current models, those things are not material. And yet, they produce material
8338000	8346400	objects somehow. And there is this void where no one has yet figured out how to cross it,
8346400	8351280	because you have, on one hand, pure energy, and then on the other hand, you have tangible matter.
8352240	8356000	And it seems like people stopped looking because of this Michelson-Morley experiment.
8356000	8362480	They gave up on the static ether, and it seems very much impossible to explain these
8362480	8368480	action at distances without the material objects being in contact with one another somehow to
8368480	8372800	affect this momentum transfer. And the field stands in for that object, right? We're like,
8372800	8376080	look, there's a field in between them, so there's no action at a distance. Really,
8376080	8382400	it's the field that's propagating these effects. But it's like, how does the field become a material?
8383360	8390720	Yeah, but if you look at modern theoretical physics, it has gone even beyond this.
8390720	8398720	In fact, something which even a practicing physicist like me find a bit strange,
8399600	8403040	because field theories say that even particles are fields.
8404560	8408720	Electrons, protons, and various things are actually fields.
8408720	8411920	But they're particular excitation of the underlying field.
8412000	8416880	That's what that's, but that is only a theoretical formulation. These are just
8418160	8426160	our own creations. No, this is, this is the all this kind of concept evolved out of
8426800	8431840	mathematics. I see the theories further and further so that people could explain
8432560	8440640	everything in the unified some picture. This, that doesn't mean that what we created in our
8440640	8447040	theories is what is there in real nature. But this is how we treat everything today as fields.
8449200	8458320	And what if instead of fields, and instead of the static ether, we imagine that the atoms themselves
8458960	8463680	have, obviously they have some surface that we consider as the atom, right, the shell of the
8463680	8468480	electron or whatever it is for the chemist, but that there is some rarefied portion of the atom
8468480	8473520	beyond that shell, which connects them to their neighbors, which is imponderable, but is carried
8473520	8480160	with the atom wherever it moves. Then you have a dynamical ether that's not actually static as a
8480160	8485200	background. It can't be measured separately because it moves wherever the atoms move. And what if
8485200	8490160	there's a structure there still? What if we don't have to give up on material explanations for these
8490160	8499680	things? Yeah, sir. I mean, when you ask this question, I feel a bit strange. That's because
8500800	8511200	of another reason. See, today, we think of dynamics as consisting of matter,
8511280	8521040	fields, motion, and those kinds of concepts. However, there is a formulation of mechanics
8522640	8530320	due to William Roman Hamilton, Hamilton's formulation, Hamiltonian mechanics.
8530960	8540640	In the Hamiltonian mechanics, which came in the 1830s, the fundamental object there,
8540640	8548800	entity, is what is called action. So there is a principle of least action or stationary action
8549440	8555520	where you say the path of dynamics, the actual path of dynamics, is a path where
8556000	8565600	this quantity called action is minimized. And you can derive all dynamics, every aspect of
8565600	8572080	dynamics, whether it's electrodynamics or any other kind of dynamics from these action principles
8572720	8579680	using Hamiltonian formulation. Now, if you think of this action, what is this action? Is it something
8580640	8588000	like a field or something real? People have not spent much time thinking about it. It is still
8588000	8595840	used as a mathematical convenience. Because action without actors is sort of nonsensical
8596880	8605200	in our everyday conception. However, if you think about action, you see this principle
8605200	8613280	of least action works in real space and time. So you are saying there are various possible paths
8613280	8622080	in space and time. And one of those paths or one set of those paths is chosen,
8623680	8632800	cancelling all other paths possible. You know that a path cannot be cancelled with another path.
8633760	8639440	The only way you can cancel something is when you have something like a wave,
8640240	8647120	something which can go positive or negative. So there has to be something in real space and time
8647760	8654640	with the properties of waves so that you can cancel some paths and enhance some other paths.
8656320	8662720	If you think that way, something like action has to be a real step in real space and time.
8662800	8669520	Otherwise, how can action principle work? So the fact that action principle works in every
8669520	8677840	instance of physical dynamics, where it is standard particle mechanics or electrodynamics
8677840	8682640	or gravity or any other field theory, everywhere action principle works.
8684240	8689200	Then you might say, okay, action might be something in real space, we cannot feel it,
8689200	8692720	we cannot see it, we cannot experience, sense it.
8695200	8704960	But if such a thing is there as a real entity, it is around every atom, every particle and so on
8704960	8716480	as some real extended entity with the properties of a wave. So though your question was
8716720	8725920	not in this context, already we see that there is a possibility that there are things which we
8725920	8734160	cannot feel, sense and so on directly, but which could be really there in space and time
8734160	8742000	around matter, which controls all dynamics. And this is the greatest challenge of physics,
8742560	8750320	because physics is unseen. Physics is things that we have to spend so much time and effort
8750320	8757760	designing detectors and measurement apparatuses in order to be able to feel something,
8757760	8763200	which we then have to translate to some mental theoretical model. And biology doesn't work
8763200	8767120	in the same way. You can look through a microscope and you can see the structures as they go.
8767840	8774960	And so it forces it to be physical, it forces it to be material. And physics just doesn't
8774960	8783040	have that because it is so, so small and so undetectable that we are left with the limits
8783040	8790480	of imagination. Yeah, but at the same time, physics has an advantage that things don't change.
8791200	8795680	The same thing repeats every time you do. You create a situation,
8796960	8804880	everything happens in the same way, not like a living matter. Things are not changing.
8805600	8815600	So therefore, a consistent picture can be obtained by persistently probing something
8815680	8823040	the same way again and again. Here you mentioned this question of energy, energy of motion,
8823040	8828080	kinetic energy that we understand, something new, and we call it kinetic energy. But you
8828080	8833920	also mentioned potential energy. Now when you say potential, electric potential for example,
8834560	8841840	we cannot see a potential. What we can see is only the variation of a potential in space,
8841920	8848080	which we call a field, electric field when we say electric field. It's a variation of
8848080	8857040	electric potential in space. For example, we can, there are these demonstrations where we have
8857040	8864800	a room which is electrically elevated to 1000 volts. We can stand inside that room without
8864800	8871680	getting a truck because it's a constant potential. But if we test something with a different potential,
8871680	8880480	we'll get a truck. So potential which we use, it's a term which we use very often in physics,
8880480	8885760	but we cannot sense a potential. We cannot see a potential. What we can sense is only a
8885760	8893760	variation of the potential in space or a change of potential in time. A time variation of a potential
8893760	8901360	we can detect as a field. We can also detect a spatial variation of a potential as a force.
8901680	8907840	Electrical force and so on. So it's very much like this action in dynamics is very much like that.
8907840	8913600	We cannot feel action, but the spatial variation of action is what we call momentum.
8914480	8921200	In the Hamiltonian dynamics, the spatial variation of action is what is called momentum. Momentum,
8921200	8931120	we have a sense of what momentum is. Also, the time variation of action is what we call energy.
8932640	8944640	In dynamics. But unless the action has a reality, we cannot have a spatial variation of action
8944640	8950640	and a time dependence of action. So action must be real and is some extended object
8951440	8958240	around every material body and so on which controls all dynamics. So these are things which are still
8958960	8966480	unexplored sufficiently in physics. We know the mathematics. We know all the mathematical
8966480	8972320	expressions related to this. But what is the physical reality of these things? We are not
8972320	8978560	explored sufficiently. And I would say, go ahead. I think that's the perfect place to
8978560	8985520	pause for now. I think that's a beautiful realization. I think it points to a huge
8985600	8992160	conceptual body of work that has yet to come. Yes. Of explanation versus just description.
8993200	8999920	Yes. Description is easy. Description is easy because that is what we see in the laboratory,
8999920	9005600	phenomenon. When we see a lot of phenomena, we can say, we can describe it. We can even sort of
9006320	9014320	give a plausible framework, but explaining something starting from a small number of
9015360	9026400	premises without making a new premise for each explanation. That is where the power of theory,
9027280	9034800	physical theory comes. And whether it is a consistent theory or not, is again determined by
9034800	9040960	these crucial experiments. So it's a back and forth interaction between
9042480	9050000	sufficiently, cleverly designed experiments and this imagination, free creations of our mind.
9051600	9057440	I love that. I also, before we leave, I want to say how beautifully written your papers are.
9058400	9060800	You know, oftentimes, scientific papers are
9061520	9067200	abstruse, especially about physics. They can be very complex and heavy in the language,
9067200	9075680	but your prose is very clear. And the logic that the ideas follow is so beautifully laid out
9075680	9081920	that it was a joy to read your papers. So thank you for that. See the clarity. Clarity is the most
9081920	9090160	important when you want to communicate. Okay. And that comes with only a wish. One has to have
9090160	9100560	the desire to be clear. And the most clear expositions I have seen in my life is by Einstein.
9100560	9107120	If you read Einstein's writings, that clarity, and that's the kind of clarity one
9108000	9114240	desires to achieve. Of course, his language is very fine and all that, you know, achieving that
9114240	9125440	is difficult. But when I write a paper, I also try to ask people around me to see it and try to
9125440	9139360	explain it to me. I'm very keen that whatever I think of as a conceptual, even a deep thought
9139360	9145360	in physics, I should be able to explain to a schoolboy. I love that. I should be able to explain
9145360	9152480	because, or, okay, forget schoolboy, I should be able to explain to my parents, my sister or
9153280	9157840	brother or somebody, because they will ask me, what are you doing? I should be able to explain.
9160560	9164320	That's such a huge motivation for our work as well. Like when we were in graduate school,
9164320	9169760	we started, we were both studying electrical phenomena. And we came up against this question
9169760	9177680	of what is charge. And that doesn't have an explanation. It has a measurement. And that
9177680	9182640	was what set us on this path where we're exploring physics and trying to find theories that can
9182640	9188080	actually hold together for a full explanation because you can't talk to people about these ideas
9188080	9193280	if you can't explain them even to yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because, you know, finally,
9193280	9202000	why are we doing all this? You see, when we try to make a theory or when we try to think of physics,
9202000	9207680	why explanations in physics or any other science, that is for the whole community.
9207680	9213760	It is not for the, it's a personal, of course, personal desire is the first thing which comes.
9214400	9220320	You have a passion to understand. You want to understand, but understanding is not just for
9220320	9228160	yourself. Having understood, you want to talk about it to people around you, explain it,
9229040	9235440	students and various things like that. So achieving a certain level of clarity is very
9235440	9242400	important for me always. Good shines through. Yeah, you're doing a great job. Thank you so much.
9242400	9249440	And, and thanks for taking the time to, you know, get into some of these issues. I think that we
9249440	9255280	have made more sense of particularly a lot of these basic inforometer ideas that we've talked
9255280	9259120	around in the show. I think that we've gotten a lot more clarity. So I thank you for that.
9259120	9262640	By the way, before you go, if people want to find out more about you,
9263680	9269280	is there a way for them to, what's the best place? Should they read your papers,
9269280	9274800	do you have a website or how do you do this? There is a Wikipedia page. There's a Wikipedia page
9276640	9283840	with some information. I maintain a YouTube channel, though I have not updated it for some
9283840	9291040	time. I should do that with some of my talks and so on. Of course, I work in what is called a
9291040	9298880	Defense Institute of Advanced Technology in Pune in India. Earlier, I was in the Tata Institute
9298880	9308320	of Fundamental Research. So I have a website, one of those Google site website, again, it's not
9308320	9319040	updated. I will update. But then two years ago, I wrote a book called New Relativity in the
9319040	9325760	Gravitational Universe. It is published by Springer. So there is enough information on the web.
9326960	9333520	When you do a search, there is enough information about me, various places scattered maybe.
9334480	9342160	And so it's not difficult to find out more about me. And I always reply to emails and so on when
9342160	9353840	people write to me. It was really a very nice experience talking to you both. I really enjoyed
9355680	9362960	just talking to you on various things. Because this is what I will do when some of my friends come
9362960	9373440	here and sit. We talk about various things. And I learned from them. They want to learn from me
9373440	9379600	and so on. That's beautiful. That's what we're going for. Yeah, that's why we built this project
9379600	9385120	really. Because it's hard to find those kind of friends. So we reached out across the internet
9385120	9391360	to have these conversations. Yes, yes. I'm really glad you have met you. I hope this isn't our last
9391360	9399120	time meeting. Yes. Yeah, some other time we can talk a bit about quantum mechanics probably,
9399120	9410480	because that is conceptual issues. When you come to what one would call the unsold
9410480	9417840	conceptual issues, you always associate quantum physics with this unsold conceptual issues.
9418480	9426640	Today, I talked to you about this action and things like that. And it was not a random thought,
9427280	9431760	because that's the kind of thing which I very passionately following up.
9433920	9437920	Excellent. Let's do that. A couple of months down the line. I think we have a
9437920	9444560	beautiful calendar right now. Yeah, please. It's very reassuring to find people who are
9444560	9451760	thinking along your lines. I feel like the world is a saner, more legible place for having you in
9451760	9458640	it. And so thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll see you again soon. Yeah, have a
9458640	9465680	great rest of your night. It's pretty late there. So thank you. Thank you and take care. Bye everybody.
9465680	9468800	See you later.
