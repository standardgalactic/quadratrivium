0	3320	Today on the podcast we have our third conversation with Mike Eleven to
3320	7480	kick off the new year and we talk a lot about the developments that he's been
7480	12480	making in his lab that all centered around the idea of embodied cognition,
12480	17720	intelligence versus consciousness, some of the specifics of the way that the
17720	21760	experiments work because the last time that we talked to him he had just
21760	25960	published his paper on frog skin Xenobots where they had taken frog skin
26600	31280	cells from frog skin, grown them in special conditions and then created these
31280	36600	ambulatory little creatures that could then corral other skin cells to produce
36600	42720	more of themselves and so basically in I think a pretty transparent way made a
42720	50680	new life form out of a cellular format that you wouldn't really expect would be
50680	53920	able to do something new and he kind of teased us with the idea that they were
53920	58040	working on doing the same thing with mammalian cells and this paper was
58040	61360	published over the course of the last year and so a lot of our discussion
61360	65200	centered on what are called antherbots which are tracheal epithelial cells
65200	70360	that grown in a 3d matrix then released from the 3d matrix are now become these
70360	77160	multicellular ciliated structures that astonishingly migrate to the location of
77320	85480	wounds inside of plated neuronal cells and then act to heal the break in the
85480	92000	cellular layer and so it opens all of these questions that are kind of a
92000	97160	perpetual topic with Michael Levin right like what are the parameters that
97160	102960	create the design limitations that we associate with the bodies that we live
103080	107160	in and as always it's a absolutely fascinating discussion because I think
107160	111000	that Levin is thinking about these questions in a way that honestly very
111000	114720	very few people are Levin and collaborators as he mentions towards the end
114720	119440	of the episode and there's extraordinary second third-order effects from the
119440	125160	instrumentalization of these experiments as well right so what does it
125160	129720	world with truly regenerative medicine look like how do we account for the
129720	134080	ability that we can build our bodies back but our minds are perhaps wrestling
134080	141920	with the longevity issue and also how does disembodied consciousness appear at
141920	146880	other scales throughout the cosmos in systems that we might not have access
146880	152640	to how to examine those systems in a way where we can poke at them if they're on
152640	155400	different time scales and different spatial scales that we're used to these
155400	161760	are huge questions so it's a wide-ranging conversation part three and we'll look
161760	165840	forward maybe next year to doing part four we wanted to say a huge thank you
165840	169160	to our patrons for being here all year this is our first podcast for the new
169160	173280	year it's actually New Year's Day today we're really stoked on the next year
173280	177280	we're having our first conference out in Austin Texas we would love to see you
177280	182280	there it's gonna be a really close-knit conversation circle we have some
182280	185880	incredible speakers lined up you can check out all of those things at the
185880	190760	link down in the description and up here and I really hope to meet you guys out
190760	194680	there and check out the total solar eclipse which is happening that weekend
194680	198480	we also have live stream tickets that are gonna be on sale and right now those
198480	203840	are $10 but the price is gonna go up in the next few weeks so get those now on
203840	207800	the early sale and it's still affordable and we're gonna be making a big road
207800	211520	trip out there and playing music shows along the way so if you are on the path
211560	215960	of Oregon to Austin get in touch with us if you want us to play in your town and
215960	221920	we will figure out a way to make it happen and as always a huge thank you to
221920	225880	our patrons we could not do this without you guys because as you probably
225880	229960	well know we live in a society where you you got to make bread to eat bread and
229960	236600	we do eat a lot of peanut butter and jelly but this has been a transformative
236600	241400	experience because we have been able to build this show on the basis of having
241440	245000	an audience that believes in what we're doing and so if you've been listening to
245000	248520	the show for a while and you and you want to support us then come on over to
248520	252600	patreon.com that link is right here and you can join for just a couple dollars a
252600	255760	month and really help us keep the ship going and help us develop it and make
255760	260120	it so that we have more in-person conversations so we can go see you in
260120	264120	the towns where you're at and not have it just be something that is through the
264120	269360	computer screen where everyone is experiencing by themselves all right
269360	272200	let's talk to Michael
287200	292200	it seems like you're spending a lot of time thinking about this idea of
292200	297400	intelligence and the manifestations of intelligence and this the smallest
297440	303560	possible unit of what can be said to be intelligent and studying how it evolves
303560	309100	and organizes and sorts like there was a paper that was just on on the
309100	312960	Reeveson side where you were looking at the way that these different sorting
312960	320200	algorithms clustered during evolutionary experiences and I wonder if we could start
320200	326320	with a conversation about the minimum unit of intelligence and evolution and
326640	332040	behavior because if you can do it with such a simple system then it seems like
332040	337320	those principles are being applied actively in the bio about work sure sure
337320	342040	yeah I mean the thing is and I have some somewhere on my website I have a video
342040	346520	that I made of the word cloud of all our papers from every year and how it's
346520	350520	changed from I think 1992 or something all the way and you can watch them change
350520	355720	and the thing is that it's not that I've spent more time thinking about this now
355920	360360	I always thought about this stuff this was always what I'm interested in but
360360	364800	there was a time when that wasn't the right time to talk about any of it and
364800	369160	progressively over the years it's become more and more fruitful to start to talk
369160	374240	about it because these are topics that go sort of across the grain for a lot of
374240	378600	the way that people think about biology and so on and until we had a body of work
378600	382840	that really was able to say no look this is a useful way to think about things
382840	386960	because it leads to new discoveries right until that had reached a certain
386960	389920	level there was no point in becoming out and talking about basal cognition or
389920	393440	any of that stuff so so now I think I think we're in an interesting point now
393440	399240	where we can actually robustly talk about some of these things yeah and in
399240	402960	particular if you want to start with the with the sorting algorithm so so the
402960	406760	thing about the sorting algorithms is that there is no evolution there this is
406800	412480	purely the standard very few lines of code that a sort of what we're talking
412480	418280	six seven lines of code tops that a standard sorting algorithm has and the
418280	425240	reason I picked it is because understanding the very minimal system
425240	431760	that that exhibits some sort of very kind of basal aspects of intelligence of
431760	435520	cognitive behavior of problem-solving and so on is really important because a
435560	439480	lot of people have and this includes this includes you know professional
439480	444640	neuroscientists and so on they they think that a lot of these kinds of
444640	449320	capacities show up fairly late right and so so you know so so Nick Humphreys
449320	454440	would put it at birds and mammals for example I could mean really late and I
454440	461080	inevitably when I start talking about the symmetries or the invariances that
461080	466360	exist in terms of these different capacities across the tree the tree of
466360	471000	life across all kinds of weird implementations and so on inevitably the
471000	475160	question becomes well what's the smallest piece in other words are you then
475160	478320	saying that every rock has hopes and dreams and things I write that that's
478320	480920	the question that people ask and so so actually I think it's very important to
480920	484400	answer that question to say what do these things look like when they become
484400	488920	really minimal right you know what what are the earliest things that or the
488960	493000	simplest things that have these properties and so what was cool about the
493000	498160	sorting algorithms is that a few things they're well known so people have been
498160	500960	you know computer science students have been studying these things for many
500960	504800	decades they're completely deterministic there there is no even that
504800	508400	there's not even pseudo randomness there they're totally deterministic they're
508400	511560	completely transparent you can see all the code the next thing about that as
511560	515560	opposed to biology is that if I say look here's a biological system that's doing
515560	519120	something new and unexpected someone could say there's a mechanism for you
519120	521680	just haven't found it yet it there's always in biology there's always more
521680	525000	details to be discovered right and you never know that you've got it all and
525000	528800	you probably will never have it all so so but but with these things I can say
528800	531880	no look here are the six lines of code like there's nothing else there literally
531880	537200	is not no other place for anything to hide that this is it and so then if you
537200	540720	have something like that it also has the interesting property that people think
540720	544880	they know how it works and what it can do and this is showing up a lot in the
544880	548240	current AI debates because people it's not everybody of course there are other
548240	551560	people who disagree but but a lot of people are saying well this is just
551560	554720	linear algebra we know we made it we know how it works it does you know and
554720	558240	people have very strong feelings it can't this and it doesn't that and you
558240	562760	know it it there's no there's no way it has whatever interesting thing they
562760	567880	think they have as biological creatures because they made it and I want to say
567880	573920	that even even these incredibly minimal things where we think we know exactly how
573920	579640	they work in these and have very small parts we don't know everything they're
579640	583040	capable of there are major surprises and that and that's what we found in this
583040	585960	paper now I should also be clear this is a preprint so it's not been peer
585960	590000	reviewed so so you know I always like to kind of point out that that's what we're
590000	595720	talking about and so can we go into some of the details about what is the system
595720	601320	that these algorithms are inside of in the behavior that you see yeah so so the
601320	604440	things that we're looking for we're looking for the two two main things
604440	609720	number one we're looking for what I call basal intelligence which which I define
609720	618000	as the ability to solve problems and get to the same outcome by different means
618000	621800	this is William James's definition of intelligence you know same goal by
621800	624880	different means and in particular there's one very particular thing that we
624880	628960	looked for and found which I call delayed gratification and it's the idea and in
628960	634080	fact William James talks about this imagine imagine two magnets and you
634080	636800	know they're trying to get together and you put a piece of wood between them
636800	641640	that's it right what the magnet is never going to do is go around and the wood
641640	645280	and get to where it wants to go because because that would temporarily
645280	648520	actually take it further away from its goal right the energy the free energy
648520	651520	would actually rise as and they can't do that all they do is they go down the
651520	656640	gradient if you have an animal or certain kinds of self-driving vehicles or in
656640	662800	James's example Romeo and Juliet right facing all kinds of physical and
662800	665760	social barriers they have all kinds of tools to do this they understand delayed
665760	668960	gratification they know that temporarily you might have to go away from your goal
668960	673600	in order to reach it later and and so that's a kind of metric of cognitive
673600	677000	sophistication right but but the ability to do it at all is already
677000	682360	something so so one thing one thing that I would that we were looking for is the
682360	686280	ability to to do that kind of problem-solving or delay gratification
686280	692800	the second thing we were looking for is unexpected unexpected goals and when I
692800	697000	say goals I don't mean human level metacognitive goals like I know what my
697000	701040	goal is I don't mean that I mean very simple cybernetic goals which are states
701040	705000	that you spend energy to try to achieve and if somebody sort of pulls you away
705000	708920	from it you'll you know you'll you'll you'll continue to try to get there in
708920	713240	some kind of way so those are those are the those are the two things that we were
713240	717080	looking for and so so let's just go from the beginning what do these sorting
717080	720840	algorithms do all the ideas that you start with a with an array of numbers
720840	725320	these are random random numbers they're there you know let's say from one to a
725320	728000	hundred you have a hundred numbers and they're shuffled they're all randomly
728000	732840	distributed so the sort of the job of the sorting algorithm is we're gonna crank
732840	735320	through this algorithm we're gonna we're gonna look at what the numbers and we're
735320	738840	gonna follow a very simple recipe and by the end of it all of them are gonna be
738840	741600	in order that's all it's gonna do it's gonna arrange the numbers in order it's
741600	746840	a very short algorithm now the main way that it works is there's a there's a
746840	751760	centralized kind of top-down mind that or in this case a computer that knows the
751760	754600	algorithm and is just sitting there rearranging the numbers and there are
754600	759640	many different sorting algorithms is bubble sort selection sort whatever we
759640	763200	made we made two small modifications to allow us to ask all of these
763200	766800	interesting questions and by the way what the the other thing we did is to
767120	772800	visualize that process as a walk in a navigation in a certain space in other
772800	777720	words a walk in sorting space so you start out over here and in many potential
777720	780920	configurations where all the numbers are shuffled but everybody's got to get to
780920	784280	one particular point which is when all the numbers are in place and it's
784280	787360	guaranteed these sorting algorithms are guaranteed to eventually get you there
787360	789760	right it might take a while depending on the length of the stream but they all
789760	793120	get there so they all sort of walk around and they get to this they get to
793120	796480	this one spot okay so and that's that's what we're interested in in terms of
796480	800800	intelligence we're interested in ability to navigate in some kind of problem
800800	805680	space so we so we made two changes number one so we made this a little more
805680	812480	biological instead of having a top-down controller that sees all the numbers and
812480	817360	is following one algorithm and doing its thing we made it distributed and bottom
817360	822080	up meaning that we gave each each each number we call them cells now in each
822160	826400	cell has a has associated with a certain number they all have their own tiny
826400	832960	little agency and all they know how to do is look around and they have preferences
832960	836400	about their neighbors so if you're a five what you would like to have is a four on
836400	840720	your left and a six on your right that that's it so instead of and but you're
840720	843680	going to follow that same algorithm so you've got you've got the algorithm but
843680	848120	now every single cell is following the algorithm it's not top-down you know
848120	853880	omniscient single agent that's sorting them but every cell has its own little
853880	857000	little preferences right so that's very biological because in biology you're
857000	860840	dealing with an agential material where every cell has local local knowledge
860840	865480	local preferences and so on but we don't add anything new so there's no memory we
865480	869160	don't we don't give them all kinds of complex all they have is that same
869160	873000	original algorithm it's just they can't see the whole string all they see is some
873000	876760	some distance away all they see is local so it's we haven't added anything we've
876760	881480	just sort of distributed it out and and by the way the first amazing result of
881480	884760	the paper is that that actually works when you do that you still get sorted
884760	889720	numbers so so if you break the if when nobody nobody knows what all the
889720	893240	numbers are you can still get them sorted that's kind of cool so so that
893240	896600	kind of distributed source so that's that's the first thing then then we
896600	900200	added something else which is very biological and is really the key to
900200	906520	testing this intelligence which is that we stepped away from the notion of a
906520	910920	of an infallible algorithm in other words normally when you do the algorithm you
910920	915400	assume that it works in other words when i say swap the the the five and the seven
915400	919880	you assume that they in fact get swapped we introduce a notion of an unreliable
919880	923880	medium the algorithm might say you want to swap one of the cells could be broken it
923880	927880	could be damaged maybe it can't be moved maybe it can't initiate moves so so we
927880	931720	introduce this notion of a frozen cell now notice that in the traditional
931800	938600	algorithm there is no notion of hey did my did the operation succeed how am i
938600	943240	doing what what am i actually uh you know am i going in the right direction
943240	946360	nothing the algorithm doesn't have any of that all it has is a set of steps and
946360	949720	you sort of blindly take those steps and that's it so so you see this is a
949720	954280	super minimal system uh initially you would look at and you would say well
954280	959000	there is no machinery here for any any of the things you want to find there's no
959000	962120	machinery here for dealing with broken cells there's no machinery here for
962120	966280	delayed gratification there's no sense of how am i doing or what path am i taking
966280	970520	through that space not none of that is there and that's why i i like this
970520	977080	system so much because it shows us that even in scenarios where you you think
977080	981000	you know what's there and what it does you can you can be significantly
981000	985480	surprised so so here's what we found here here are surprised first of all we
985480	990680	found that if if you do introduce these broken cells which can't move
990680	995960	and then you track the progress of the sorting algorithm across the space you
995960	999320	find out that in fact what it does know how to do is delay gratification it
999320	1004120	knows how to go backwards which means in this case un-sort the string a little
1004120	1009080	and in order to have gains later on that that's an amazing thing because that is
1009080	1012840	not in the algorithm if you look at the actual algorithm there's nothing in
1012920	1016200	there like that you don't see you don't see that so so that already
1016200	1019720	starting to tell you that that there are competencies that are not obvious from
1019720	1026760	looking at the material so that's the first thing and then we were able
1026760	1031080	to do something else because you know in the traditional way of doing this
1031080	1034360	there's one single algorithm that's sorting the whole string right you're
1034360	1037320	you're sort of god looking at it from the top down and you're following
1037320	1040200	selection sort or insertion sort or whatever it's going to be and you're
1040280	1044040	moving whatever you need to move around to get them sorted in this case
1044040	1047960	everything's bottom up every cell has its own uh is following its own algorithm
1047960	1051080	so we were able to do something something very unusual which in fact we do in
1051080	1055880	the biology too we made a chimera and that is a mix of cells where some cells
1055880	1059320	are following one algorithm but other cells are following another algorithm
1059320	1063080	and for example our our frog allotle is a chimera when you take cells from a
1063080	1065880	frog embryo and you take cells from an axolotl embryo they have
1065880	1068760	different local rules that they're going to follow because one's going to make a
1068760	1071640	frog one's going to make an axolotl but you can put them together in a single
1071640	1076200	organism you can ask what happens right so we did that here we we um we mixed
1076200	1079720	two two algorithms in the same string now the way you do it is you when that um
1080840	1084840	as you assign them randomly so we have a bunch of random numbers and each one
1084840	1087960	gets a random assignment you're either you're either going to follow selection
1087960	1091480	sort or you're going to follow a bubble sort something like that right and it's
1091480	1094600	and it's random it's mixed up you can think about that as the genetic sort of
1094600	1097720	right it's the thing that determines your policy of action it determines what
1097720	1100840	you're going to do and there's two different there's two different kinds
1100840	1105080	um again surprise the first the first kind of interesting thing is that that
1105080	1109880	works in other words you don't need to both have the same uh journey through
1109880	1113560	that space in order to get to where it's going and so you can have a chimera
1113560	1116200	string that still gets sorted even though half of it's following one set of
1116200	1121000	rules and half of it's following another okay that's cool then we asked that we
1121000	1126600	asked a really wild question which is if you if you look at the string in the
1126600	1130760	middle of the process what's the distribution of the of the cells that
1130760	1133320	are following the two different algorithms like where do they hang out in the
1133320	1137480	string now now here's what we know we know that at the very beginning it's
1137480	1141000	going to be random so so let's define a notion of clustering which is just this
1141000	1144600	I look to my left I look to my right and I ask what are the odds that the that
1144600	1147880	the guy sitting next to me is using exactly the same algorithm as I am we
1147880	1151560	call it we defined a new a new term um Adam Goldstein came up with this he
1151560	1155960	calls it an algotype like you have genotype phenotype so algotype right
1156040	1160120	and so and so okay so clustering is just I look to my left I look to my right
1160120	1164040	what's the odds that my neighbor is the same algotype as me
1164040	1167880	we know that in the beginning it's 50% because they're random we assign them
1167880	1170920	randomly we also know that at the end it's also going
1170920	1174120	to be 50% because at the end everybody's got to be sorted according to their
1174120	1177320	number but the algotypes who are signed randomly they weren't
1177320	1180520	assigned according to number so that means if we really if we sort you on
1180520	1183400	the number the other types are gonna be of course just like at the beginning
1183400	1187240	they'll be all over the place they're gonna be 50 50 what happens in the
1187240	1190200	middle and this is the amazing part what happens in the middle
1190200	1194280	is that what the curve so so so 50 it's clamped at 50 50 but in the middle it
1194280	1199160	kind of goes like this so what happens is that in between the sorting process
1199160	1203000	cells with the same algotype like to hang out together they spend
1203000	1207000	a bunch of time in these clusters where we are all the same type of we're all
1207000	1210600	following the same procedure but then they inevitably get dragged apart
1210600	1214440	you know I sometimes joke that this is like a it's a minimal model of the
1214440	1217560	human condition of you know for any living being
1217560	1221000	like for a period of time in your life you get to do some things that are
1221000	1225320	against the general trend of the physics of your world but eventually
1225320	1228520	you all end up in the same place right it's like this really minimal
1228520	1232040	minimal way you have you have a period of time where you get to do some things
1232040	1235400	that you want but eventually the inevitable physics of your universe
1235400	1237880	sort of grinds you down right that's that's like
1237960	1241720	like a minimal model of our of our existential state
1241720	1246280	so what's what's amazing about it is that again
1246280	1250280	nowhere in the algorithm does it say I know what algotype I am
1250280	1253480	or how you find that out nowhere in the algorithm does it talk about checking
1253480	1257240	the algotype of your neighbors none of that is there it's completely
1257240	1260840	emergent and it's not just emergent complexity the way that you know
1260840	1263640	fractals are an emergent complexity the game of life
1263640	1268600	cellular automata emergent complexity from very simple rules is not just that
1268600	1272120	it's what one step beyond that it's actually
1272120	1278120	in the case of the the the delay gratification it's emergent competencies
1278120	1282040	and in the case of the the clustering or hanging out together
1282040	1286040	it's some sort of it's some sort of emergent computational goal that you as
1286040	1290280	the programmer did not put in there this is a very simple system
1290280	1294040	that has goals and competencies that you did not put in there
1294040	1297480	even though you wrote the algorithm the algorithm is deterministic it's small
1297480	1301800	and transparent and you know this is I this is why I think it's
1301800	1305960	significant because if if that's the case in these little things
1305960	1309640	when people say they think they know what you know various AI
1309640	1314360	architectures do or various you know collective
1314360	1317480	swarm robotics or swarm you know various things like that
1317480	1321080	I mean I I think there are so many surprises
1321080	1324520	in store for us that we really need to develop a science of
1324520	1328040	guessing guessing these kind of emerging goals and so this
1328040	1331000	so the last thing I want to say is that this takes us back to your point at the
1331000	1333240	very beginning that okay so what does this have to do with the various
1333240	1337720	biobots because much like with with these
1337720	1341560	with these algorithms when when we make novel biologicals
1341560	1345000	where the answer to well what what are going to be
1345000	1348440	its goals all while have a you know long history of of a selection
1348440	1351560	but determined well they don't have a long history of selection they've never
1351560	1354920	been here before these biobots there was never a
1354920	1357880	selection to be a good zanibot or a good anthropobot
1357880	1360280	so how do you know what the goals are going to be where do they come from
1360280	1364200	right so that I think is the is the emergence of a new science of
1364200	1367880	figuring out the novel goals of systems where you cannot
1367880	1372360	say that evolution is what did it and that's I think that's going to be really
1372360	1375320	important for us as a species going forward
1375320	1381800	I love that we have this really straightforward experiment that's so
1381800	1385880	simplified available to be able to consider the larger implications and
1385880	1389160	so I want to spend a little bit more time really understanding
1389160	1392440	the dynamics that emerge from it and so when you say that
1392440	1398280	these algorithms in the midpoint cluster according to type
1398360	1406120	do you have a sense for why that is yeah um
1406120	1411880	why it why is interesting because we have to think about what kind of answer
1411880	1417320	we're looking for so on the one hand and this is also true in biology
1417320	1420360	there's no magic here I'm not saying that these things are doing anything that
1420360	1425560	isn't allowed by the by the algorithm if you were to track
1425560	1431480	the data flow you would say well this is perfectly consistent with the algorithm
1431480	1435480	there's nothing to see here which is exactly what some people do for biology
1435480	1437480	they look at you and your brain and they say
1437480	1440920	well this is just chemistry this is just just electrons moving around there's
1440920	1444920	nothing there's nothing special here right if you if you insist on the lowest
1444920	1447720	level of description that is all that's all you're ever going to see
1447720	1451640	and that's it's not false it's just a very limiting world view
1451720	1457960	um on the other hand if you if you if you take a step back and you ask yeah but
1457960	1462120	knowing what you know about the algorithm why why didn't you predict that that
1462120	1465560	was going to happen yeah and this is this is kind of my my
1465560	1469800	my thing about a lot of biology is that after the fact after somebody has done
1469800	1472840	something interesting and shows you a new phenomenon you've never seen before
1472840	1476840	it's very easy to go back and look at the micro details and say yep no miracles
1476840	1479880	here therefore all good like we can explain it you know
1479880	1483160	yeah you can always track down the the steps that you took
1483160	1486600	but unless you had a theory that actually told you in advance that this was
1486600	1490360	going to happen in other words you know not not just explanation looking
1490360	1494680	backwards but invention looking forwards then then you then you're missing
1494680	1497800	something and so now so so what we're missing in this case
1497800	1502520	is a system that would have allowed us to say ahead of time
1502520	1505800	oh i know that's what your algorithm says but i can see what's going to happen
1505800	1508200	here these guys are going to want to travel together
1508200	1511240	right that's that's what we're that's what we're looking for and and
1511240	1515400	do i have that theory no although um i will um
1515400	1518680	i'll propose a hypothesis which which we're going to test
1518680	1525640	soon um the hypothesis is this uh based on uh kind of carl friston's
1525640	1530600	framework of surprise minimization um chris fields and i had this had this
1530600	1535400	paper a few years ago now on why it is
1535480	1539320	basically he calls it an imperial model of multi-cellularity the idea goes
1539320	1541800	like this why why would cells want to get together
1541800	1546120	right and and one way to think about this is that well if every cell
1546120	1548840	doesn't like to be surprised let's face it if you're a living thing and you're
1548840	1551640	constantly getting surprised you're not going to last very long
1551640	1555000	so so everything is is trying to minimize uh minimize surprise
1555000	1558200	well one of the least surprising things out there
1558200	1563160	is you so what might be nice is to make some copies of yourself and put
1563160	1567400	them around you to make a sort of like stem cell niche kind of thing where the
1567400	1570680	cells on the outside are frontline infantry they're facing the uncertainty
1570680	1574520	of the outside world the cell on the inside is protected and has a very
1574520	1578120	consistent environment because everything it's dealing with is basically a copy of
1578120	1581560	itself so um that's our idea so that that was our
1581560	1585880	idea and so so so uh following this firstonian paradigm
1585880	1590040	what you really want are neighbors that are predictable
1590040	1592840	well how will they be predictable well they could be like you if they're like
1592840	1596760	you they're they're they're pretty predictable so my gut feeling is that
1596760	1600680	that's what's going on here i suspect that this is a primitive
1600680	1604200	version a very early version of of surprise minimization
1604200	1608360	that the reason they're traveling together is uh because they're trying to
1608360	1611320	minimize joint free energy or some such thing i'm sure carl would
1611320	1614760	would say it much more much more elegantly but but i think that's probably
1614760	1617880	what's going on here they're they're traveling together for as long as they
1617880	1621320	can because it minimizes their uncertainty about
1621320	1624200	their environment and we again notice that they don't have any explicit
1624200	1627560	mechanism for this there's nothing in the algorithm that says
1627560	1631400	uh you know make a prediction to compare it to your
1631400	1634360	reward model that there's nothing in there it's it's it's emergent
1634360	1637640	although this is emergent and i think it's consistent with
1637640	1641480	carl and chris and and other people when they apply this active
1641480	1645480	inference framework to particles you know they apply it to things that do not
1645480	1649000	have explicit mechanisms and we knew this from a long time ago
1649000	1653400	when you do um some kind of a least action model and you say hey look this
1653400	1656680	beam of light gets to where it picks the path
1656680	1660440	where it loses the you know the least amount of of effort
1660440	1663720	right and you say yeah but how does that work it doesn't have any mechanisms
1663720	1666760	inside to compute all the paths and right it doesn't have explicit
1666760	1669960	mechanisms for it but i think this is what we're learning is that you don't
1669960	1672360	need explicit mechanisms to do some of this stuff
1672360	1676680	that's and i think that's really important well there's an aspect of
1676680	1679880	with you know the path of least resistance for light
1679880	1684040	which i imagine has to do with like permissivity
1684040	1687640	which is that if you're traveling through a field
1687640	1691000	where there's a bunch of different potential paths
1691000	1695880	one path will have less resistance than a different path and so you fall and
1695880	1699880	that that's i've realized that you know physics
1699880	1704280	doesn't necessarily have a material model for light like it's field
1704760	1711000	but i think that there is probably a material property of of the substances
1711000	1715000	that it's traveling through that that affects it like one atom
1715000	1718840	will transmit light more easily than a different atom
1718840	1721720	and so when i think about the sorting algorithms
1721720	1727560	my first thought is algorithms take different amounts of time to run
1727560	1731080	right and so do you think that there's an aspect of
1731080	1735800	time that is important here where you have
1735800	1742040	the information of a of one sorting algorithm
1742040	1745400	is more quickly accessible than the information
1745400	1749480	of let's say another and so they're running on different time scales
1749480	1753560	and so at the beginning when they're sorting they're sorting relative to
1753560	1759480	which neighbor has a an answer that matches the time scale
1759480	1763400	of the cell itself does that make sense yeah it does um
1763400	1766440	yeah it's an interesting it's it's definitely an interesting point i mean
1766440	1769720	the thing just to go back and and i'm not a physicist so i don't want to get
1769720	1772920	like too deep into this and say something stupid but my understanding of
1772920	1776680	the the least what's cool about the least action business is that
1776680	1779880	you're right of course the different paths of different permissivities but
1779880	1784120	in order to pick the right path in some sense you have to try them all out
1784120	1787160	right you don't know that you're on the least path until unless you have some
1787160	1791000	information about all of them and and so and so that that kind of
1791000	1795320	non-locality i i think i think in in our case in
1795320	1799960	the case of the the algorithms there could well be a time component because
1799960	1804520	in order to know whether your neighbor is like you or not
1804520	1808280	you need to spend some time with them so so one of the things we're doing now is
1808280	1813160	tracking their life histories to figure out things like well how much time do
1813160	1816760	you need to spend next to someone before you decide that hey they're like me or
1816760	1820360	they're not like me and i think that um uh the active
1820360	1823960	inference framework is going to make some clear predictions about that you know
1823960	1827160	in terms of i'm just just in general bayesian you know reasoning is going to
1827160	1831080	just going to tell you like how many experiences do you need to have
1831080	1835400	with someone before you know whether their policies are surprising to you or
1835400	1839560	not right um again underlying the underlining the
1839560	1843320	idea that none of this is explicit these things don't have the the algorithms
1843320	1846920	don't have explicit code for doing any of that but we can track it from from
1846920	1850840	you know from observations so so stay tuned this is this is super super
1850840	1854600	early still um but i do think it's interesting that
1854600	1858040	i'm gonna i'm gonna have a discussion with uh with carlin also mark solans
1858040	1862280	about this because you know it has this it to me anyway maybe
1862280	1866680	maybe they'll tell me this is nonsense but to me it has this weird um
1866680	1872440	resonance with uh this idea of of conscious and unconscious drives
1872440	1876120	right we tell stories about why we did things and you sort of have this like
1876120	1879400	logical thatcher algorithm those like i well i did it because xyz
1879400	1883000	but it turns out that actually there may be some underlying pattern that isn't
1883000	1886920	apparent to you at all and may or may not be apparent to somebody else who's a
1886920	1890360	different observer may you know maybe an analyst a psychoanalyst or whatever
1890360	1894680	who's looking and say yeah well you think that's what you did and in that local
1894680	1898040	you know in that situation that story kind of makes sense but look at the
1898040	1900840	bigger pattern if you look at the bigger pattern you find out that
1900920	1906600	actually you tend to xyz right and so i just wonder whether this is also a
1906600	1912280	really minimal model of how we understand implicit goals which are
1912280	1918120	there directly in whatever um algorithm you're following uh sorry those would
1918120	1920840	be explicit goals and then and then there are some implicit goals
1920840	1924040	that you're following and i have no idea where those come from right and that's
1924040	1927080	i think that's an exciting area for the futures to figure out where they come
1927240	1935320	i'm curious about the instrumentalization of this because it seems well is is that
1935320	1939240	the goal of studying these systems is so that perhaps you can program these
1939240	1946840	bio bots eventually to towards some end and then if that is the case is it ideal
1946840	1950600	for the bio bots to be intelligent like would you really want them choosing
1950600	1956440	their own goals or making decisions um perhaps it is but but it's it's a bit
1957240	1962440	hazy for me how that would be useful um yeah yeah that's a that's a great point
1962440	1966840	well well the first let's just let's just start off here uh if they if in fact they
1966840	1971240	do have their own goals we would love to know about that before we use them in
1971240	1975400	some particular context right and this is true with bots it's true with bacteria
1975400	1981800	with CAR T cells with swarm robotics with the internet of things with financial
1981800	1985400	institutions with social structures if these things are going to have goals
1985400	1989480	beyond what we think of when we built them we need to know about it right so
1989480	1992440	whether you whether you want them to have goals or not they may or may not so
1992440	1996200	you need to know so it seems like the the on the spot developments of goals
1996200	1999320	right the changing of goals is i guess more what i was concerned about you know
1999320	2003160	if they decide well we had this goal before but now we're now we've changed
2003160	2007160	our minds so to speak yeah yeah second order right second order goals you know
2008040	2014520	choosing your own goals again i don't know that that and by the way i've made no
2014520	2017880	claims that either the answer or either either the bots or the algorithms do
2017880	2021720	that all we've done so far is find some goals they have that we don't didn't
2021720	2025720	know about we i've made no claims that they have the second order ability to
2025720	2030520	choose their goals but if that's true we need to know right whether that's
2030520	2034360	whether that's true or not so that's that's the first step now why now let's
2034360	2038280	answer the other question why do you want them to have goals well
2038280	2044760	imagine um think of uh the the spectrum of of intelligence all the way from
2044760	2049480	very simple machines that do very specific things and they're sort of you know
2049480	2052440	whatever else happens they're just going to do the same thing over again
2052440	2057240	all the way through various cybernetics creations that have goal directed
2057240	2060040	abilities and then some animals that can be trained and then some humans that
2060040	2064600	can set their own goals to some extent and so on um think about think about
2064600	2070840	medicine you know biomedicine uh where do our interventions fit on that scale
2070840	2075640	right now almost all of with with only a couple interesting examples all of our
2075640	2078520	interventions are way on the left side of that spectrum
2078520	2082520	they're extremely simple mechanical things drugs for example right so
2082520	2087000	typical drugs they just do what they do they're not context sensitive
2087000	2089640	if they're binding something they're going to bind it and that's it and
2089640	2092680	whether that's good for you or bad for you and this is why we're having
2092680	2096840	massive divergence of efficacy and side effects in people because they just do
2096840	2100040	what they do imagine if we could get beyond that and we could have
2100040	2103080	interventions that are higher agency interventions where you could push some
2103080	2108120	of the complexity onto the reagent such that it would have some and so so now
2108120	2111880	the obvious thing that people think about here are like smart insulin pumps
2111880	2114520	right they don't just sort of pump out you know they have a little bit of
2114520	2118520	sensing and they kind of know what's going on right so smart insulin pumps um
2118520	2121720	I think our example which I think we talked about last time
2121720	2125320	of HCN2 which is this ion channel that we use to
2125320	2130200	repair various birth defects that's a step in this direction because that
2130200	2135320	that the drugs that open that channel are they act in a context sensitive way
2135320	2138680	that's what allows them to fix very complex structures like brain face heart
2138680	2141000	and gut it's not because they do the same thing no
2141000	2143960	matter what they're actually trying to do a very
2143960	2147000	particular thing which is to increase voltage depending on what's going on in
2147000	2150520	the environment increase the difference in voltage the
2150520	2154040	sharpen the boundaries so that's that's already a step up
2154040	2159640	and I think that what what the opportunity here is with the for
2159640	2164360	specifically with the antherobots and we could talk about what they do and why
2164360	2170840	is we can take advantage of the various competencies of parts of your own body
2170840	2173000	in this case these are tracheal cells from the same
2173000	2179000	patient to do complex things that we have no idea how to
2179000	2182760	how to force in medicine so we could take advantage of the intelligence of
2182760	2186200	your own cells to heal things and to do sensing in
2186200	2189960	both directions of the push meaning meaning to to heal and to improve
2189960	2193560	and then to to read which is the the sensing side you know
2193560	2196840	these cells probably know more about each other than we even know
2196840	2200680	to ask questions about nevermind have sensors for and so I think having these
2200680	2204840	kind of reagents that actually do have a processing they have
2204840	2209000	you know signal detection amplification memory decision making readouts
2209000	2213400	all of these things that are part of a a a simple cognitive system
2213400	2217080	you you want your your medical intervention to have that because
2217080	2220680	then you can do things that we couldn't possibly micromanage
2220680	2223800	and the thing that we found the antherobots could do which is just
2223800	2231320	mind-boggling to me is that if you if you put them on a
2231320	2234760	on a on a scratch that you've made in the two-dimensional culture of neurons
2234760	2238440	so you take human pluripotent stem cell derived neurons you grow a
2238440	2242040	lawn of them on a on a on a petri dish you scratch
2242040	2245240	you put a scratch through it that's that's you know so when people use that
2245240	2247560	as a simple model of wound healing it's a scratch
2247560	2251800	scratch assay you put down these antherobots and what they'll do is over a
2251800	2254920	few days they'll they'll take the edges of that wound
2254920	2258840	and they'll knit the they'll knit the neurons together now who knew
2258840	2262920	who could have said that um the cells of your trachea which
2262920	2266040	normally sit there quietly for whatever 80 plus years
2266040	2269560	that if you that if you let them go and let them reboot their life
2269560	2273000	they can actually run around on their own and find neural
2273000	2275720	wounds to heal and who knows what else i mean that was just the first thing you
2275720	2277640	try it who knows what else what else they know how to do
2277640	2281400	like that's that's a competency of these cells that we had no idea about
2281400	2287000	and again it's that sort of thing where uh i'm sure somebody reading that paper
2287000	2291720	could say well uh there must be some pro you know pro neural molecule that
2291720	2294280	they're putting out and i'm sure we'll find it yeah no
2294280	2296840	sure of course there's going to be a physical explanation for it's not going
2296840	2299400	to be magic there's going to be there's going to be some after the fact there's
2299400	2303160	going to be some explanation for it which we are of course investigating
2303160	2306200	but how come no theory predicted that ahead of time how come we didn't know to
2306200	2308280	expect that that's what i think is much more
2308280	2311400	interesting it's easy to tell stories afterwards the question is
2311400	2317080	you know uh yeah how you know what what what what models what models in world
2317080	2319880	used you have to get you to do the experiment in the first place
2319880	2323800	and so that being the first thing we tried my my i don't think you know we
2323800	2326600	should be playing the lottery every day it's we're not the luckiest people in
2326600	2330760	the world i think what this is telling us is that they have tons of unexpected
2330760	2334520	capacities and we're going to be of course looking for these
2334520	2340120	is naming them bots ambitious or because it seems like you're you want to have
2340120	2344200	control over their behavior that's the way i think about robots anyways
2344200	2347080	i'm not a robotic scientist or anything but
2347080	2351800	do you is that the ultimate goal is to tell them exactly what part of the
2351800	2356280	dish to go to or what which of the cuts to heal perhaps
2356280	2360520	something like that and and what what's the road to that
2360520	2364280	yeah um well first first let's just talk about the terminology for a moment
2364280	2371000	yeah um it's it's certainly true that we could have just called them organoids
2371000	2374680	uh but but the thing with organoids is that organoids are typically
2374680	2378760	the perp so so here's what i think words are for and and nomenclature is for i
2378760	2385480	think words are um just protocols for for interacting with something
2385480	2388600	so so when you name something what you're doing is
2389320	2394120	facilitating or preventing ways to interact with it so if you call it a if
2394120	2396920	you call something an organoid what you're really saying is
2396920	2404040	i'm focused on making this as uh as as best of a model of the of the real
2404040	2407480	organ as possible i want it to be exact i'm going to screen drugs on it i'm
2407480	2411800	going to you know study airway biology i want it to be a little
2411800	2416200	model of a lung that's what i want by calling it bot what i'm saying is
2416200	2419080	yes all that and there are plenty of people who have made airway organoids
2419080	2423160	and and and so on but actually there's much more here to do because because
2423160	2427000	you can we can in fact in the future program them and this this came up
2427000	2431640	when we were doing the zenobots people said why are you calling them zenobots
2431640	2436680	i mean developmental biologists who who study amphibian embryos have seen
2436680	2441080	ciliated epithelium for decades we call them animal caps
2441080	2444280	these are just animal caps why why do you need a new word for and i couldn't
2444280	2447480	say it at the time because this stuff was was not published but
2447480	2450760	the point is yeah and if you call them animal caps you'll never make an
2450760	2453800	anthrabot because because why would you because if
2453800	2458120	because that's an amphibian specific embryonic thing why would you take an
2458120	2461800	adult human trachea that you wouldn't get there
2461800	2466040	and so words have real power they they they tell you how you're thinking about
2466040	2469320	something and they facilitate once you once you call them bots you say well
2469320	2472760	bots can be made out of a lot of things maybe it's not just a frog thing maybe
2472760	2476200	we could make this out of out of human cells right and so they facilitate so
2476200	2479320	that's what i'm interested in is terminology that facilitates research
2479320	2483240	programs and um and so and so yeah so the future
2483240	2486280	is definitely to program them in in various ways
2486280	2491160	uh much like with the zenobots you know the first three zenobot papers
2491160	2495240	were basically just studying the native properties of these things and so i mean
2495240	2501000	you dug did some super cool stuff about sculpting them and and and so on
2501000	2504840	but the thing is uh what what what i really want to do
2504840	2508920	is focus on surprising native capacities because if the first thing we
2508920	2512120	did was knock in a bunch of synthetic biology circuits
2512120	2515400	people would say ah well but you've engineered the heck out of them so yes
2515400	2518280	of course they do whatever you made them do and that's fine
2518280	2521720	i want to say we've we've in the in the case of the anthrabots we've done
2521720	2525320	almost nothing to them right we've so so gizem came up with it with a with a
2525320	2528440	protocol to to get them to to grow from a single cell
2528440	2531480	and then turn inside out so that the cilia are on the outside surface and all
2531480	2535880	that but but we didn't do anything to make them heal uh neural
2535880	2539480	wounds they already do that and and that that i think is really
2539480	2542360	valuable because yes of course we'll get to programming them and this means
2542360	2545640	giving them all sorts of stimuli when they're assembling and it means putting
2545640	2549320	in different cell types perhaps and it means training them maybe so we haven't
2549320	2552600	we haven't shown that yet but we're working on that both with them and with
2552600	2555480	the zenobots uh can they be trained can they be you
2555480	2558440	know what native preferences do they have all that kind of stuff
2558440	2562360	um that that will all come but but what i think is really critical much like
2562360	2566520	what the algorithms is to say we thought we knew what tracheal
2566520	2569880	epithelium does and we thought we knew what organoids are for and look there's
2569880	2573160	a lot more to it than that
2573640	2578040	yeah that make that clears it up a lot it's interesting that in some sense that
2578040	2582120	golf between doing what you want and doing what they want
2582120	2587400	is both dangerous and exciting and it it seems like there's a lot of crossover
2587400	2590600	with the ai world because a lot of people are very concerned with that
2590600	2596520	valley between the two now do you have conversations with ai
2596520	2600440	engineers about the similarities and what you're finding
2600440	2604360	yeah yeah um yes and and there's some uh there's some fun that
2604360	2608760	twitter threads are about it too um uh and and we have you know about
2608760	2612760	probably a quarter of my group is uh uh computational machine learning
2612760	2615880	expert so we certainly you know we certainly think about that stuff a lot
2615880	2621080	um yeah i i think i think the main limiting factor in a lot of these
2621080	2626040	discussions is that they take place in a vacuum that neglects the wider context
2626040	2629800	of diverse intelligence i mean people people well first
2629800	2633560	of all first of all this this this focus on specifically language models and
2633560	2637240	things like that it that's like a tiny corner of what's
2637240	2640360	actually coming right diverse intelligence is gonna be so much more
2640360	2644760	challenging and interesting than than than just what we have now and that's
2644760	2648120	really important i think a lot of people are not not i'm not getting it and
2648120	2653160	also you know a lot of people are saying things like
2653160	2656520	it's it's intelligent like us and therefore it's dangerous there are plenty
2656520	2659640	things that are incredibly dangerous that are not intelligent like us you don't
2659640	2662920	need to be super intelligent to be extremely dangerous you don't need to
2662920	2666840	be like us to be intelligent like there are all kinds of leaps here that
2666920	2671720	people tend to make that i think are not warranted but just um
2671720	2676680	just in general like a real uh
2676680	2682360	understanding of the fact that intelligence can be uh expressed in
2682360	2686440	unfamiliar guises and some and some humility around like how bad we really
2686440	2691720	are at recognizing other other forms of it you know besides what we're
2691720	2694520	used to would be what i would be i think really useful and
2694520	2698040	essential i think it's an existential need for us going forward if we're
2698040	2701960	going to survive with the antherbots and the xenobots
2701960	2705720	both they're derived from organisms that have
2705720	2712120	immune systems and the action of cells migrating to a place where
2712120	2717320	there is a wound seems really immune like to me
2717320	2723640	do you think that there is a significant relationship between
2723640	2728120	those two functions where there is a certain drive inside
2728120	2732120	the body to produce cells that will heal that is
2732120	2738280	encoded somehow in the substrate genetically where it's like once you
2738280	2742600	liberate a cell from its context there's some sort of other
2742600	2747640	deeper level programming which is like okay my job now that i'm free
2747640	2751640	since i'm not a cancer cell is to do the the opposite of proliferate
2751640	2757320	and is in fact to go into fix yeah um that's a very interesting hypothesis i
2757320	2761880	mean these are uh epithelial cells are not specifically
2761880	2765320	immune cells and in the in normally in the body they don't do any of that they
2765320	2769000	just sit quietly basically but but i like i like where you're going with
2769000	2773240	this and i think that one advantage that these things
2773240	2778920	have over other kinds of um robotics that we might make or drugs or various
2778920	2782120	other things is that they probably share with us the
2782120	2785960	priors about what it's like to be healthy about about what's good
2785960	2790200	about being a being because not only are they mammals not only are they human
2790200	2794680	not only but but they're also your own cells so it's entirely plausible to me
2794680	2797640	now we haven't proven any of this i want to be super clear we don't know that
2797640	2800600	they home to wounds we don't know what they can recognize
2800600	2805000	you know we don't know any of that um but it's very plausible to me that they
2805000	2809560	share with us this notion of what damages and what repair is
2809560	2813240	um yeah this this this may be you know this may be
2813240	2817960	something that that is really uh advantageous about this technology
2817960	2820680	you know is that you don't have to teach them what's good and bad about
2820680	2825480	being a multicellular organism and from from what i read of the
2825480	2829000	antherbot's paper the way that you're generating these cells is that you take
2829000	2833480	them you grow them in an extracellular matrix that's three-dimensional
2833480	2837160	from single cells and then you put them into
2837160	2842360	what you call it a low viscosity medium and in the low viscosity medium you see
2842360	2846440	these changes occur and
2846440	2850600	the changes are like you said pretty stark so you have these
2850600	2854520	these cells that normally would be ciliated
2854520	2858440	on the interior of the cells you turn them so that they're ciliated on the
2858440	2860760	outside and so all of a sudden you have this
2860840	2865960	motile collection of cells and
2865960	2872600	i wonder if you have looked to see what the actual changes are inside of the
2872600	2876840	cell that permits this kind of new organization
2876840	2880600	as a consequence of the different growth conditions
2880600	2887160	yeah um no we we don't know the details yet it's
2887160	2890920	the change is a multicellular in other words
2890920	2895080	it's not an individual cell that does much of anything it's the whole thing
2895080	2898920	turns itself inside out so you start with a ball where the cili are pointing
2898920	2902440	into the center of the ball and then then the whole thing just turns inside out
2902440	2907080	when when we wash it out of the out of the matrix it turns inside out
2907080	2912520	now what exactly does that we we don't know my gut feeling is that there are
2912520	2916600	going to be some pathways looking that that probably
2916600	2920440	would look like embryonic gastrulation and some things like that i'm going to
2920440	2924040	guess it's probably reusing some of that that's a total guess we don't know
2924040	2929080	yeah the answer is we don't know but embryonic gastrulation to me
2929080	2934440	is a almost quasi stem cell property
2934440	2938360	where it's where stem cells probably the wrong the wrong word to use but
2938360	2941000	there's early development like early development like they
2941000	2945400	aren't differentiated to their context yet and so
2945400	2949000	do you think that it's just a property of cells that once you take them out
2949000	2952360	of the context of the body where they have grown used to being and now you
2952360	2955000	put them into this matrix where they have to
2955000	2959080	recontextualize themselves that this is an opportunity for them to
2959080	2962760	to kind of redesign their own their own relationship to the environment
2962760	2966200	suddenly that's that that is a yeah that's a great
2966200	2970280	point uh what this is all currently under investigation
2970280	2975240	uh do they think they're recapitulating some kind of embryogenesis we
2975240	2979880	we don't know so so the xenobots for example the normal xenobot
2979880	2983480	lives for about a week but we've been able to if
2983480	2987240	if you feed them and keep them ridiculously clean
2987240	2991320	they can go longer and they will go uh i think our record is like
2991320	2994920	84 days or something and during those weeks
2994920	2998680	it changes shape it changes shape it becomes transparent it
2998680	3003720	it does some other stuff and uh i don't know is that is that some new
3003720	3006920	developmental sequence that you know that normally
3006920	3011800	no no one ever does um yeah we you know we we don't know and the same thing with
3011800	3015320	the anthrobots like like is this uh is this a developmental
3015320	3018360	sequence basically for this it does it think it's an embryo we're gonna find
3018360	3021480	out we're doing all the you know we're we're characterizing all the new
3021480	3025000	genes that they express both the xenobot and the anthrobot side
3025000	3028280	uh yeah we're gonna we're gonna find out but we don't know yet
3028280	3031160	there was a there was a science fiction story i want to say it was
3031160	3035720	arthur clark but maybe not uh a long time ago where um
3035720	3039640	they cracked uh aging and so people started living longer
3039640	3043960	and what they found out was that at around 120 humans undergo all these
3043960	3046440	changes it's just you've never seen it before because nobody ever lived that
3046440	3049960	long and so you know they start growing a third like a new set of teeth and all
3049960	3052040	this stuff and i think i think at the end
3052040	3055640	what i think they they grew wings and look like angels i forget what it was
3055640	3058200	but but it was the point where yes actually there was this new
3058200	3062600	developmental stage it's just you know what you we had didn't access it before
3062600	3066520	but but so so maybe this is like that maybe these these things have a new
3066520	3070440	a new developmental sequence that they can do i don't know
3070440	3074920	it seems like uh when i think about the major health crises
3074920	3077960	let's say the threats in most people's lives assuming they don't die from an
3077960	3082040	accident or something it's cancer and heart disease
3082040	3087640	and those are very different bioengineering projects
3087640	3092360	one where you're in the case of cancer perhaps trying to
3092360	3095320	teach cells how to behave themselves again something like that
3095320	3098520	i mean i suppose the approach right now is to just destroy them
3098520	3102760	but i i i suppose ultimately you would want your bots to be teachers
3102760	3106360	in a sense and perhaps it's similar with with
3106360	3110280	cardiovascular disease as well but that seems like more of a
3110280	3115640	a repair in the wound healing sense uh perhaps a cleanup job
3115640	3119400	is there some uh well do you think about this
3119400	3123400	in terms of the bots in terms of what their ultimate functionality will be
3123400	3129400	in terms of maybe not simply joining or or obeying some
3129400	3133480	specific program goal but in terms of teaching and
3133480	3136200	interacting with their new environments and
3136200	3141080	re-instructing them and what yeah what is the future of that look like
3141080	3146520	in your mind yeah i think that uh there's a there's a few there's a few
3146520	3150680	different uh use cases for the bots the most
3150680	3154360	the most obvious things are we're going to make
3154360	3157480	useful synthetic living machines for specific purposes
3157480	3161560	so maybe they drop off pro regenerative molecules maybe they clean up cancer
3161560	3165240	cells maybe they scrape the plaque off your artery
3165240	3167560	walls maybe they they clean up arthritic knee
3167560	3171800	joints they repair you know retina or spinal cord we like
3171800	3174440	very specific things so so we'll be some of that
3174440	3177720	i i think bigger picture what both they and the xenobots
3177720	3185000	are are a kind of uh platform in which we get to learn to control morphogenesis
3185000	3188200	so so cracking the code the mapping between
3188200	3192440	the experiences you received as a cell and the pattern that a group of you are
3192440	3196760	going to build because if we solve that that's it that's a completely
3196760	3199400	different path to regenerative medicine that has nothing to do with the bots
3199400	3202840	per se in other words at some point we're going to know
3202840	3206680	how to grow a new heart how to grow new limbs how to grow new organs why you
3206680	3209800	know and and and the stuff what we're working on right now in the lab which
3209800	3213000	is trying to understand why do they forget why do
3213000	3216280	tissues forget what the correct pattern is why does everything fall apart after
3216280	3221080	some number of decades right so so using the bots as a kind of sandbox
3221080	3224520	platform to understand how do collections of cells make decisions
3224520	3227400	about what they're going to do so that's kind of that's kind of the second
3227400	3229880	thing and then there's this is more philosophical stuff but
3229880	3233480	but but for biomedicine right there are the direct use cases and then
3233480	3237000	there's the bigger picture of you know what we really want is complete control
3237000	3239960	over growth and form that's that's what we really do do you imagine that to be
3239960	3243560	like an in situ process at the end of the day or is it ex vivo are you going to
3243560	3248360	be growing the do you imagine these medical technicians
3248360	3252280	i don't know how many years from now are growing these externally and replacing
3252360	3256600	diseased organs or is it more something that's happening inside of the body
3256600	3260360	like you're actually you know in the sense reprogramming your body or giving
3260360	3264280	it the external environment that needs in order to regenerate itself
3264280	3268920	it seems like two very different approaches yeah i think i think uh long
3268920	3273400	term it's all going to be in situ and uh
3273400	3279960	in in the meantime are we going to crack the uh ex vivo morphogenesis and
3279960	3282920	transplant before we crack the in vivo stuff i'm not sure
3282920	3286760	i'm not sure uh down the line it's it's it's all going to be
3286760	3290520	it's all going to be in vivo but maybe maybe maybe the uh
3290520	3294360	the bioengineered organs will get cracked first i'm not sure
3294360	3298120	that seems to be the more traditional approach as far as i can tell
3298120	3301560	you know we are we're already doing organ transplants with varying levels of
3301560	3305320	success um obviously the huge advantage here is
3305320	3309480	just that you have ideally your own cells right or
3309480	3313000	something that matches and you don't have the horrible immune problems with the
3313000	3317560	transplantation yeah um i mean so you could argue
3317560	3321640	both ways on the one hand you could say well uh just just growing a specific or
3321640	3324680	a single specific organ should be easier and then we'll just
3324680	3328840	pop it in maybe but but look at look at for example the case so
3328840	3334200	so back in 2010 or so we show that there's a particular um bioelectric
3334200	3337720	pattern that causes frog embryos to make new eyes
3337720	3341800	in weird locations when your eyes on the gut on the tail whatever
3341800	3346200	um we are nowhere near being able to bioengineer
3346200	3351400	and grow an eye in in vitro right i mean so so so people have shown like if you
3351400	3354920	explained the eye progenitor cells and you sort of
3354920	3357560	leave them alone they can make an optic cup and some things like that
3357560	3361320	but but it's not that it's not that we knew how to how to engineer an eye eyes
3361320	3363960	are very complex they have lots of different tissue types
3363960	3367400	what we simply did was to take advantage of the competency of the material
3367400	3371400	meaning the cells of the in vivo they they they know how to make an eye
3371400	3374040	they they've already done it twice they they certainly have all that
3374040	3377160	information what you need to be able to do is convince them to do it again
3377160	3380440	somewhere else and so if you look at this problem as
3380440	3384280	can i micromanage the cells to be an organ
3384280	3387800	you know using traditional bioengineering maybe we make a bladder
3387800	3391960	maybe we make you know ears are not hard we can make things where we can make a
3391960	3394280	scaffold we see a bunch of cells on tops
3394360	3399480	maybe 3d print some things maybe you know you might think that's the way to go
3399480	3403480	but i actually think the easier way to do it is not to try to control
3403480	3408840	any of that it's to convince the collective what you want them to build
3408840	3412680	and just do that in vivo where the surrounding material is
3412680	3415240	is basically much smarter than we are about how it's done
3415240	3419800	so i'm not sure i we'll see how we will see how it goes
3419800	3423320	there's a really interesting aspect of this where if you can
3423320	3430360	reprogram an embryo to grow eyes in places where you wouldn't expect eyes
3435400	3438120	okay so there's two places where my mind immediately goes number one
3439400	3442840	there's a certain permissivity of the embryo
3442840	3448280	where the entire context of the being is that okay we are in the process we are
3448280	3451720	we are we are creating the structure we get instructions
3451720	3455320	we make it and then we get to a place where we cease our differentiation
3455320	3459160	and the structures are more or less fixed and they get repaired in place
3459160	3463480	and so one question and you can you can go either way with us
3463480	3470200	is a do you think that once the structures are fixed you have a completely
3470200	3473800	different problem where you would then have to inflict some kind of damage
3474520	3478680	in order to get them to regenerate and number two which is kind of orthogonal
3478680	3482520	is the eyes that form in places where you don't expect
3482520	3485960	are they then wired into the brain in the way that you would expect
3486920	3489960	yeah let me let me do the first one and then remind me of the second one
3489960	3491640	because i'll forget by the time i'm done
3493640	3497880	the first thing i want to say which is which is kind of a cool point it has to do with
3498520	3505160	the permissivity or the competency so and this is something that one of these things that i
3505160	3509640	couldn't you know say back in 2010 but now now that we're talking about development as a
3510520	3514200	as a collective intelligence process now we can start to think about it this way
3515400	3519880	if you look in the developmental biology textbook they will tell you that only in the frog
3519880	3525480	only the anterior norectoderm so the stuff you know basically from here up is competent to be i
3526120	3530280	and it's that's the only stuff that can make i and the reason is because if you prompt it with
3530280	3535400	what they call the master i gene which is this thing called pack six then yeah that those are
3535400	3543560	the only regions that ever make i but it turns out that actually that limited competency and
3543560	3547240	developmental biology competency is a narrow definition which is what it's able to make
3547240	3552360	i use it more broadly but more generically the competency of your material is opaque to you
3552360	3557560	unless you probe it with the correct prompt we need to and this is you know when people say
3557640	3562360	aw it can't do this you know this this doesn't do that whenever you're making an assessment
3562360	3567880	and an assessment of intelligence in some system you are basically taking an IQ test yourself as
3567880	3573000	an external observer you are saying this is what i have noticed how to make it do that doesn't mean
3573000	3577320	that's all it knows how to do that's just what you know so so in this is a great case for that
3577320	3582680	because actually it turns out that if you go to the bioelectric level no i have almost any cell
3582680	3586920	in as far as we can tell any region in the in the tadpole is it is competent to do this we just
3586920	3592760	didn't know that because we were using the wrong prompt and so and so this should all of this everything
3592760	3601240	we've talked about should really fill us with significant humility about about what we know
3601240	3606440	about the material that we're working with you don't necessarily know if you know i've i don't
3606440	3610440	know if you've ever seen these things i've got pictures of them on my blog and and a couple of
3610440	3615480	papers um these these plant galls you know these amazing just about to ask about that because they
3615480	3623640	create these insane structures prompted by the presence of like wasps and bugs that move inside
3623640	3629560	the leaves yeah and and if you didn't know that if you didn't have that example you would never
3629560	3634040	in a million years say that the that the oak genome could make this red spiky brown thing you
3634040	3639960	would say no it makes a flat green leaf and and it takes a living bioengineer who as dan
3639960	3645000	then it would say you know competency without comprehension uh is able to to prompt the leaf
3645000	3649800	to do this crazy to build this crazy thing you would never know it knows how to do that so um
3650440	3655720	that's uh you know that that's the important thing is that we really need to understand the
3655720	3661400	competency of our material and what what we're working with and i i actually don't think that
3661400	3667080	adulthood is when all of that ceases there's a there's a there's a ship a thesis thing going on
3667080	3671880	here which is that in a standard body right cells and materials are coming and going all the time
3672440	3678920	and you need to be able to um it's this thing like uh like like in allison wonderland where you uh
3678920	3683160	you have to work really hard to stay in one place you you in order to maintain a body you
3683160	3687400	can't just say well okay now i don't need this information i you know i'm just gonna hang out
3687400	3691720	you will not last very long um and and i think there probably are insects in other organisms
3691720	3696200	that that you know that live a day or a couple of days where that's where that's true but typically
3696280	3704920	if you want to persist you have to continuously re repair remodel replace and and and so on and um
3705880	3713080	so so i think uh the only thing that happens during uh during maturation is that the scale
3713080	3718680	of those projects gets smaller so instead of re shaping the whole embryo during neuralation and
3718680	3724040	gastrulation all that you're now saying okay well these few cells are gone how do i maintain the
3724040	3729240	integrity of my epithelium and things like that right so but but i think i think that process of
3729240	3738840	of homeostasis anatomical homeostasis which which i am really into is uh continues your your whole
3738840	3745800	life and and without that process uh i in fact that's what i think aging is is a is a a defect in
3745800	3751160	that process it's just it's basically a you know i think i think aging is a version of failure to
3751160	3756120	regenerate it's a which and development is basically just a set of regenerative repairs
3756120	3760840	from each embryonic stage to the next stage i think all of this boils down to regenerative
3760840	3767960	remodeling which boils down to homeostasis humans can't really grow gauze though sorry say again i
3767960	3775000	said humans can't really grow gauze though which is we don't know that we don't know that you know
3775000	3781560	sure sure i guess i guess the only thing that i'm saying is that if i think about the various human
3781560	3787000	diseases right because if if there's a parallel between okay oak gall would you say that that's a
3787000	3793400	disease no no i don't think no i don't think it's a disease i think it's uh now now there are there
3793400	3799320	are virus induced galls that uh that screw up cells and so on so and those those are basically
3799320	3804600	featureless lumps they're kind of like a tumor but maybe you can say that's a disease a standard one
3804600	3809960	of these galls i mean from the perspective of the plant it might be a disease but i i think
3809960	3814440	it's morphogenetic hacking i think i think all you've done is you've with the what the wasp has
3814440	3819960	done is to um hack the material to go to undertake a different journey in morpheus space and i don't
3819960	3824760	think that's i don't think that's it that that that that's a disease do we have any sense of
3825880	3832440	what's the different morphological purpose is like why does one wasp make one gall another
3832440	3837640	wasp make another gall um i do not know there are people who study this so so um
3837640	3843640	uh insect ecologists and uh and such there are a couple of folks that i'm in touch with that study
3843640	3849960	that kind of stuff i i don't know uh for me the interesting thing is the space of the possible
3849960	3857160	and how little so so if you think about this giant multi-dimensional uh anatomical morpheus
3857240	3863960	space which holds all the different shapes that things can be normal standard reliable
3863960	3869000	development gives you one pointless tiny little keyhole into that space and all you see is the
3869000	3873480	embryo and the normal thing that it builds and then sometimes you have what they call developmental
3873480	3876920	plasticity and look this plant can have two different shapes depending on if it's a dry
3876920	3880600	environment or a wet okay so so instead of a single point you see kind of like a little
3880600	3885800	little halo or up through your keyhole but through that keyhole is a giant space of possibilities
3885800	3893480	that we are still very bad at mapping out and what i think these uh all the synthetic stuff
3893480	3897320	that antherobots the xenobots other other things that people the goo galls other things that people
3897320	3902920	build are all vehicles for exploring that space they let you they let you take that little keyhole
3902920	3908200	and like like stick your head in and look around like a like a periscope and and look around and
3908200	3914520	say here are the other possibilities you know and and what human cells can do uh well we didn't
3914520	3920600	think they made antherobots until you know we did it a few years ago so i don't know my guess is
3921320	3928760	i so so so the way to um uh kind of uh uh just just drill down on on that question is uh
3929480	3934360	are there any limits so people ask is there any limit to what a given cell can build and some
3934360	3938520	people say yeah they're called developmental constraints there are things that the i'm not
3938520	3944200	sure i believe in developmental constraints i i think that in a given context there are limits
3944280	3948040	to what it's going to do does that mean that if you knew what you were doing you couldn't
3948040	3954360	prompt it to do something completely different no i i think um and and again this is conjecture on
3954360	3960360	my part but here's here's here's what i think um that basically there are going to be like like for
3960360	3966760	example if you have planaria if planaria don't have genes to make bone you know the the the hard
3966760	3971560	minerals and all that okay you're not you're not going to get them to to you know to to make bone
3971560	3977000	because if the if the hardware isn't there it isn't there but beyond that in terms of shape
3977560	3983160	i'm not sure there are any limits i i don't i i just i you know i think in the end um except
3983160	3987880	for materials limits and the laws of physics i don't believe there's going to be any limitations
3987880	3994440	on what shape you could build i guess this ties back to the question of whether or not the eyes
3994440	4000520	are tied into the brain right because if you have a crazy body plan and all of a sudden
4000520	4006840	your like elementary canal is all screwed up and you're just dumping waste into your internal
4006840	4014440	cavity you're gonna have a bad time yeah so uh yeah um i'm glad you remember that um okay i'm
4014440	4020040	i'm not gonna say that there aren't ways to screw things up because absolutely there are and uh the
4020040	4026200	competency of regulative development that fixes all these problems is not infinite and there's
4026200	4032520	many ways to screw up an embryo for sure for sure but this is some work that um Doug Blackiston in
4032520	4039320	my group did same same person who did all the zen the zen about biology um but by the way if you
4039320	4045480	can get him on you'll have a great time uh he's he's amazing but anyway back back in the well yeah
4045480	4053320	around 2013 2014 something like that we uh we we did some experiments where what we did was we we
4053320	4059960	we grew ectopic eyes on the backs and the tails of tadpoles and we asked that question can i see
4059960	4065000	out of these eyes what happens when you have this new architecture is it is it functional
4066120	4070440	the the answer is super interesting first of all it turns out that yeah they can see we we we actually
4070440	4075880	built a machine that um trains them on on visual cues and and and and we made tadpoles that did
4075880	4080920	not have primary eyes but they had this you know this one eye on its tail yeah they can learn in
4080920	4086040	visual or visual assay so they can absolutely see the next question is you know you said does it
4086040	4090040	connect to the brain well it doesn't connect to the brain actually it connects to either the
4090040	4095080	spinal cord or in some cases nothing obvious that we can figure out and they can see anyway
4095800	4104440	so so not only is it um plastic in terms of um making the right uh the right organs and the right
4104440	4114600	structure excuse me but actually um even even the wiring is uh is up for uh is is you know is
4114600	4119960	is up for change and you know just imagine like you you you come into this world and you have this
4119960	4124520	weird itchy patch of tissue on your back like how do you even know that's visual data you know but
4124520	4130040	the brain is able to is able to use it and um and and and i'll tell you two two two fun fun things
4130040	4137720	about that one is that um we we then uh let some of those okay so imagine you got an eye on the tail
4137720	4144920	you let that animal grow eventually that tadpole is going to turn into a frog well the tail has to
4144920	4150200	disappear and what happens is normally the tail gets these signals it it degrades it you know
4150200	4156040	basically um apoptosis uh you know it eats itself and so on and then the tail disappears so we had
4156040	4161400	a pool going in the lab about well what's going to happen to the eye right and uh because the whole
4161400	4166200	tail is going to die what what about the eye does the eye think it's part of the tail does it so so
4166200	4170440	this was this was super cool and we watched this thing and uh i'm not sure if we publish i don't
4170440	4174920	remember if we published it but i i i got these amazing pictures of um frogs with eyes on their
4174920	4180600	butts because what happens is the tail gets smaller and smaller the eye gets bigger and bigger and the
4180600	4186040	eye of it just rides it back and eventually just ends up sitting on the butt of the frog the tail
4186040	4191960	is long gone that eye is is is perfectly clear that it's not part of the tail and it's not going to
4191960	4197080	you know degrade the way the tail will and we we don't know if it's functional on the adult frog
4197080	4201960	because we don't really have a good um behavioral method for adult frogs the way we had for tadpole
4201960	4207240	so i don't i don't know if the adult frog can see backwards we don't know but um but but yeah the
4207240	4214040	the eye survived the death of the tail and so just just more broadly you might think about why
4214920	4219800	i mean why is the frog why is the tadpole ready for this for for eyes to be formed like that
4219800	4225080	doesn't happen in nature why would ever and why would evolution do that and i think the lesson
4225080	4231160	that uh i think we not not just from this work but from from a lot of work is this evolution
4231160	4235320	i don't think makes solutions to specific problems but i think evolution does is make
4235320	4242360	problem-solving machines and part of that is the um and and i got a paper from a few months ago um
4242360	4248120	where i beat this uh you know in in significant detail this this idea that because because evolution
4248120	4254280	is working with an agential material it naturally makes systems that um that that can solve these
4254280	4260920	problems and and here's one of my favorite examples of of of this kind of thing is um this
4261160	4268600	was found back in the 40s that if you if you have a salamander and um what you can do is in in for
4268600	4273720	the very early embryos you can you can do this procedure which causes them to multiply their
4273720	4279400	genetic material so instead of two n you can have four n five n six n and so on so the first
4279400	4283320	amazing thing if you do that you still get a normal salamander so that's why it like extra
4283320	4287560	genetic material doesn't seem to confuse it but that's already kind of cool the next thing that
4287560	4293000	happens is that the cells get bigger in order to accommodate all that all the copies of the genome
4293000	4297880	but the salamander sees exactly the same size so that means that as your cells get bigger you need
4297880	4303000	to know to use fewer of them to build the same the exact same organs and so what what he did was he
4303000	4308920	took um um this was uh frank hauser and he took cross sections of this tubule that it's a kidney
4308920	4313080	tubule and he takes cross sections of it and he shows that in a normal uh animal there's like
4313080	4316760	eight to ten cells that go around and they sort of make this tubule in the middle is a big empty
4316760	4323640	space and then and then you make these cells big and now there's fewer there's like four or five of
4323640	4329720	them going around so that's amazing thing number two is that if uh if your cells are the wrong size
4329720	4334520	you know to adapt their numbers so that you can have the same overall structure here's the real
4334520	4339400	kicker if you make the cells gigantic and i believe these were maybe like five n or six n
4339400	4344920	nudes or something like that the cells are so big only one of them fits and so what does the cell
4344920	4351000	do it bends around itself like this leaving a hole in the middle to make the exact same tubule now
4351000	4354760	the reason that's super cool is that that's a different molecular mechanism in the former
4354760	4358840	case you have cell to cell communication tubular genesis blah blah blah in this case you have
4358840	4365000	cytoskeletal bending so so this is top down causation this is crazy this is calling up different
4365000	4371000	new more different molecular mechanisms to achieve the same high level anatomical goal
4371000	4374760	right that that's i mean if that's not intelligence i don't know if we had if we had any kind of a
4376040	4379320	machine that could do this i mean this would be super amazing intelligence because you're
4379320	4384200	faced with a problem you've not seen before you can you can call up different resources of yours
4384200	4390040	to get to get the job the same job done if you're prevented from and and now think of think of the
4390040	4394920	amazing thing that this that this embryo has to has to deal with i'm going to come into the world
4394920	4398440	i don't know how many copies of my genetic material i'm going to have i don't know the
4398440	4402200	size of my cells i don't know the number of my cells i don't know if somebody's going to cut me in
4402200	4408520	half uh early on i have to be able to make a salamander despite all of this changes in the
4408520	4414040	environment changes in my own parts for god's sake right like i don't i can't even depend on my own
4414040	4418600	components i i don't know what what dna i'm gonna have but but i'm gonna make this salamander right
4418600	4423160	and and so and so i think that is what evolution gives us it gives us in for many species not not
4423160	4428360	all i'm not sure c elegans does any of that but but for for many species what evolution has given
4428360	4434920	you is this amazing uh problem-solving machine that does not make too many assumptions about
4434920	4441000	what the world is going to be like now you now you would think that um that's what evolution is for
4441000	4446600	is to is to is to progressively over time extract information about the environment and make sure
4446600	4452200	that whatever you're born in you've got the benefit of all those prior generations but in machine
4452200	4456920	learning you've got this notion of overfitting you know overtraining on your examples you don't
4456920	4461960	want to just memorize your training data set you want to uh you want to be smarter than that and i
4461960	4467720	think um absolutely uh development is smarter than that i don't think development over trains on
4467720	4472040	on on these priors i think it learns a lesson of how to solve these problems and i think really
4472600	4478760	every life multicellular but probably all but but certainly the multicellular life
4478760	4484280	is um is is is born into the world solving problems i don't think it you don't know what
4484280	4488200	you have until you sort of take stuff and this is why you can take an early embryo and cut it
4488200	4493720	into pieces and have multiple twins instead of you know half embryos and and so on yeah i know
4493720	4499800	that shyla has a bunch of stuff uh do you want to do you want to pick up on the on the idea of the
4500360	4506520	platonic salamander form that remains even with five n i mean i have some more like divergent
4506520	4511240	philosophical questions about this regenerative medicine that i can hang out if you got if you
4511240	4516840	want to keep pulling on this thread i mean the let's let's stay here for a little bit because
4516840	4521160	i think the regenerative medicine is what this all kind of centers around right because we want
4521160	4528840	to be able to see as as much as i don't like the idea of science being an instrumentalizable process
4528840	4533720	where there's there's discovery simply for the sake of discovery we we all live within a system where
4534680	4538440	the discoveries at some point need to be instrumentalized onto something in order to
4538520	4544280	get people to really see the point of it and to really get people viscerally invested in it and
4544280	4551640	so i think that that's that might be a good place to end but where do you think the platonic form
4551640	4555720	of the salamander comes from the idea that you can take this embryo and you can screw with it you
4555720	4559960	can change the genetic organization you can make the cells enormous so that it goes from
4560520	4567000	cell cell signaling to create a kidney tubule to just one cell that wraps around it like
4567800	4575800	what is that yeah boy uh yeah um that that is the uh the hard question isn't it um i mean i should
4575800	4584200	say from the beginning that uh i don't know but um i think we definitely start with that but um we
4584520	4592200	we can we can say a few things about it um one one thing is that uh
4594440	4601480	there there are um there are a lot of what what physicists would call free lunches in this kind
4601480	4608040	of scenario in the following in the following way imagine imagine that um you're you're running
4608040	4615800	evolution in a particular world where the most fit um the thing is a particular kind of triangle
4615800	4620520	yeah it's it's it's a certain kind of triangle so here comes evolution and it does a bunch of
4620520	4625800	generations and it nails down the first angle and it optimizes the first angle and then
4625800	4630760	bunch more generations and it optimizes the second angle now it's done it doesn't have to
4630760	4635160	look for the third angle because we already know that once you know two angles in flat space you
4635160	4641160	know what the third angle is supposed to be uh isn't that amazing isn't it where did that come
4641160	4648120	from it's certainly not in the genome uh it's a free gift from the laws of geometry physics i don't
4648120	4655720	know but but it's it's super practical because whereas one can think you know the old this this
4655720	4662120	whole idea this this platonic Pythagorean idea of of these um these information structures that hang
4662120	4665880	out somewhere else not in the physical world then when you make specific physical
4666760	4671160	embodiments for them then you get to to to to to interface with them you know when you
4671160	4676920	have a fulcrum you get to have um you know our committees uh so simple machines and things like
4676920	4685320	that um it it it all sounds initially it all sounds very um philosophical in the bad in the
4685320	4689400	in the pejorative sense it's like why we need any of that we you know it's it's all you're just adding
4689480	4695160	you know crazy stuff onto our ontology you don't need it but when you're saving 33 percent of
4695160	4701320	evolutionary time now this is quite practical now this is this is you you really have to ask
4701320	4706360	where does this where do these things come from and there are tons of these throughout mathematics
4706360	4712600	so i you know think of all the truths of number theory uh all of the all you know the distribution
4712600	4718120	of primes all this other stuff where where where do those things hang out presumably all the all
4718120	4723240	the physical structures at the beginning of the big bang that set all the you know the the
4723240	4727160	forces the relative strengths of the forces all that all that stuff could have been completely
4727160	4735080	different and still the truths of number theory are what they are and so i'm partial to this idea
4735080	4742520	that there is a platonic realm of some sort um that it does contain a bunch of free lunches that
4742520	4749480	evolution is really good at searching it that i i don't think that what evolution is doing is
4749480	4756280	searching the really hard space of microstates on on the on the on the output outcome i think that
4756280	4762120	what it's really basically searching for is and this is this is a bad analogy but we don't have
4762120	4767240	better ones yet it's searching the space of pointers into this platonic space it's searching
4767240	4772760	for ways to capitalize on these free lunches this idea that i mean there's so many of these like
4773400	4782520	i can imagine if you if you have a uh when you um evolve a voltage gated ion channel what you
4782520	4787560	really have is a voltage gated current conductance you have a transistor and if you have a couple of
4787560	4794360	those you can make a logic gate and when you have a logic gate you have a truth table you have the
4794360	4799800	basis of rational thought you have a truth table and you have the fact that nand gates so not and
4799800	4805160	gates are actually quite special compared to all the other gates so where is all that stuff all you
4805160	4808920	did was make a voltage gated ion channel where'd you get all that stuff from you you didn't need to
4808920	4813640	evolve a truth table you didn't need to nail down all the components uh you you get all of that for
4813640	4823880	free and so so so i see everything we're doing as a research program in which we develop tools
4823880	4829240	to map out that space what else is out there because because again you have to ask yourself
4829240	4834840	what what what is this crazy world you do for you well i think what it does for you is it sensitizes
4834840	4839080	you to look for things that you didn't expect things that you didn't bake in it helps you think
4839080	4846840	about making tools to explore that right um and uh i think that the way that you know if you look at
4846840	4850680	um somebody made this thing called the map of mathematics and it's just like this literally
4850680	4855560	this map and you get different areas of math and how they relate to each other i i i think i
4855560	4860920	think platonic space has a structure to it i think there are all kinds of interesting things there
4860920	4866360	from from from geometry and the things we call geometry and algebra and and you know computation
4866360	4873800	and so on and evolution is really good at capitalizing on some of that stuff and so so what
4873800	4878920	else so so to get back to your question does does the form of the salamander hang out there
4879640	4887400	maybe but also form and function of the antherobots and zenobots and who and galls and who knows
4887400	4894120	what the heck else is there um and i think i think that structure is um rich i don't think it's
4894120	4898920	flat and homogenous in the for example when we when we studied the behavior and the shape of these
4898920	4905480	of the antherobots we didn't just see a continuum of here's every possible thing it came in in in
4905640	4910120	in morphotypes it came in in in chunks like this there's this kind there's that kind there's this
4910120	4915480	kind and so yeah i think i think this the the space has structure and i think we need to
4915480	4921080	and so i'm i'm also working on and this this you know we'll take a little bit and we can
4921080	4925560	maybe talk about it at some future time because i don't have it all worked out but i think there's
4925560	4932200	even there's even an interesting uh thing where like under under my understanding of this of the
4932200	4937560	standard um kind of view of this this platonic space thing is that the contents are supposed to
4937560	4941400	be eternal and unchanging right it's sort of fixed they're all they just hang out and they are what
4941400	4946600	they are and like that's it so so i'm not sure that's true i think i think we can start to develop a
4947880	4953480	kind of chemistry of it that ways in which these things actually are active in some sense
4954040	4958920	distinct from the way they actually manifest here and i think there are useful i think there
4958920	4964120	are useful models of that that we can that we can develop to say how do those things combine and
4965800	4972360	and change and how does that impact which ones and how we are able to implement in in you know
4972360	4976840	in engineering and biology and so on i wonder to what extent those forms are stored in the
4976840	4981160	external environment too like when you were talking about the nephron tubule things i was
4981160	4986280	thinking i wonder how much the hydrostatic pressures and so forth are sculpting the cell
4986280	4994120	into the form that it takes and how much of the salamander is a product of forcing by the world
4994120	4999480	the entire i mean i hate to say the entire universe but essentially everything collaborating to make
4999480	5008600	the salamander yeah yeah yeah it's well for sure for sure the context of those cells matters
5009160	5015400	right and and it's entirely possible that in order to explain what's going on we need to consider
5015480	5021560	inputs from the biophysical environment from the energetics and from the from all kinds of stuff
5021560	5027640	i'm sure i'm sure that's true um the question is is and this isn't this is an open question
5027640	5035560	is there a more informative meaning a more um a model that leads to better in invention
5036280	5041800	where what you're talking about is ways in which those parameters index into a pre-existing space
5041800	5047960	of options versus some other i mean frankly i don't know what the what the what the you know
5047960	5053320	competing model would be but but some some way of just um you know sort of calculating locally
5053320	5057480	all the forces and and things like that which i'm sure can be done the question is does it help
5057480	5070040	you find the next thing you know there's a really interesting limit to the kinds of synthetic
5070040	5076120	organisms that can be produced and the routes to them like i know that craig vent craig ventner
5076120	5082920	was working on you know what is the minimal cell that can be produced and the way that they arrived
5082920	5090440	at it was not from bottom up production it was they took a cell and they continuously deleted
5090440	5095720	portions of it until they got to some minimum component and the minimum component was some
5095720	5104120	thing is like 350 protein coding genes and if you look at the papers they're pretty wonky looking
5104120	5112520	cells like they're not really super functional anymore and there's a there's a there's a limit
5112520	5119640	there that i think is breachable with a different kind of design right because none of ventner's
5119640	5127000	work was about this idea of okay environment forcing parameters what can we take to produce
5127000	5138280	a cell that rises from a different environment and matures into something new and with a salamander
5138280	5145000	i like you could probably produce a different kind of salamander with a different kind of
5145000	5153320	body plan with different organs but like do you think that without genetic modification you could
5153320	5161560	produce something that's like a bird probably not right well i'll tell you what what we have done
5162120	5173720	in planaria so so so two examples and again on the on the on the bird thing how about those
5173720	5178200	galls like there's no genetic modification there right like we would have again the
5179080	5183720	looking backwards somebody's going to say oh yeah i can see how this particular growth factor is
5183720	5187880	this and that right so you got flat leaf and you got gall great but the bigger issue here you would
5187880	5192360	have not known that there's a gall you don't know what the next gall is capable of like right so
5192360	5199080	there's more to it um here's here's what we did in planaria first of all we made two-headed planaria
5199080	5204280	by altering the bioelectric pattern we talked about this last time there's no genetic modification
5204280	5208200	there they're permanently two-headed so that's something it's not another species but it's
5208200	5213320	definitely different than the original species so it's something also we've shown that you can
5213320	5218520	actually make planaria with heads that belong to other species so about other species about 100 to
5218520	5226120	150 million years evolutionary distance so again no no genetic modification now can you go can you
5226120	5230440	go further and you can you know can you make it look like a bird you're not going to get bone
5230440	5235560	i don't think but could you could you get patterns that look like other animals i bet you could
5235560	5240360	if you've ever seen um uh there's another thing that's uh that that speaks to this those uh i
5240360	5246360	forget i forget what the name of the the fly it's it's a little fly and on its wings it has a picture
5246360	5253000	of ants and it's right you know i'm talking about so so yeah so so there you're what it's doing is
5253000	5258360	running a stripped down like low resolution two-dimensional morphogenesis program on its on
5258360	5264040	its wings and so i think the the reprogrammability and the virtualization is massive i think we've
5264040	5268280	not scratched the surface of it so so you know could i tell you what the limits of that are or
5268280	5273720	whether there are limits no i don't know but i would i would bet large amounts of money that the
5273720	5280520	the uh the narrow view that we have now of the mapping between genome and anatomy is way too
5280520	5293000	narrow for reality so one of the things that comes up a lot when i when i discuss your work
5293000	5297480	with people who maybe aren't scientists or aren't really thinking deeply about these questions
5298280	5304440	is okay great we'll be able to regenerate our organs maybe we'll live for a very long time but
5304440	5310360	the brain or the mind starts to become an issue at some point and there's something about the
5310360	5318680	mind that's very different from a kidney in that it seems to be that the cells the functionality
5318680	5324120	of the brain let's say i i know that the mind is sort of delocalized but let's say the central
5324120	5330600	nervous system or whatever you want to call it the thinking machine of the body those cells
5330600	5335400	patterning depends on their experience and so if you had a disease of the brain like a
5335480	5344360	brain tumor or something in terms of treating damage to the brain or regenerating the brain
5345640	5353400	is it conceivable that we'll be able to in some sense pattern these experiences without
5353400	5358840	having gone through the entire path of the life in order to have those connections it just seems
5358840	5365800	like kind of the the expert level regenerative medicine would be this very dynamic architecture
5365800	5375000	this this web like network which it just depends on on a past almost in a way that perhaps a kidney
5375000	5380680	doesn't is that something you've given any thought to yeah yeah yeah we yeah i think about this a
5380680	5386600	lot um a few a few things um first of all uh your brain is different from the kidney but
5386600	5391480	i don't think it's because the kidney doesn't think i do you know i like right now you my
5391480	5395960	left hemisphere is having a chat with your left hemisphere and and we're sort of pretty proud
5395960	5401240	of ourselves for having language and stuff but um there are plenty of other uh systems in the body
5401240	5407160	that solve problems that navigate physiological and other spaces and and we just don't sense them
5407160	5412200	anymore than we sense each other's consciousness so i'm actually not sure it's it's special in that
5412200	5418360	way but um to address your other point about how do we how do we deal with long-term memories i'll
5418360	5423560	give you i'll give you the kind of bummer idea and then the positive idea after that uh the bummer
5423560	5428040	idea is is is this i i don't know let's let's imagine and this this goes back to like the
5428040	5432840	traditional view of of heaven right like this idea of eternal let's say let's say your your you live
5433640	5439000	unlimited amounts of time it's aside from any issues of regeneration or damage or anything
5439080	5443320	like that it isn't obvious to me that any cognitive system can stay sane for an
5443320	5448120	unlimited amount of time like i'm pretty sure i could keep myself busy for 10 000 years probably
5448120	5453720	but like 10 million years i i don't know you know of a while and would you be able to integrate
5453720	5457960	your experiences from 10 000 years ago at some point it's like i wonder if we just start pasting
5457960	5462920	i feel like i paced over my experiences at some point you know i replaced them with new experiences
5462920	5468120	there's obviously the cognitive psychological modeling where we're constantly rehearsing our
5468120	5474280	memories as we go and it's not clear that you would even have access to your experience at
5474280	5478680	some range and that would maybe that's what you mean by going insane is you just lose track of who
5478680	5484920	you are i'm worried about more than that actually in that in that case um so so so it's entirely
5484920	5491960	possible and for example i'm i'm pretty sure that uh you know most of my memories past a few years
5491960	5497320	ago are pasted to a certain degree in the sense that if somebody said oh no you got that all wrong
5497320	5500920	this is how it really went down and we have video i'd be like all right i suppose that's it
5500920	5505880	like fine you know like i i don't know that my memories really go like you know that i would
5505880	5511800	really trust to go back very far at all anyway so so that's fine maybe that would just keep happening
5511800	5517880	and i think that some creatures like could could a dog stay perfectly sane and happy on a farm with
5517880	5522280	rabbits to chase and all that good stuff for like a billion years like maybe right maybe every day
5522280	5526520	would be as joyous as every other day and it would all be super cool like maybe that's fine
5526520	5533640	could a human do that i'm not sure i'm just not sure i don't know um but uh but let's let's let's
5533640	5538760	let's talk about the more the more realistic case um i think i think it's actually a lot a lot more
5538760	5547240	hopeful than than it sounds for the following reason uh the work on planaria and this was uh
5547240	5551800	first discovered by mcconnell in the 60s and 70s and then we replicated the important parts of it
5551800	5559320	in 2013 ourselves um they that you can train them and then you can cut off their entire head
5559320	5563800	brain and all and the tail will sit there doing nothing over the next eight days it regenerates
5563800	5569480	a new brain and now they remember the original information assuming and when we have to say
5569480	5574200	it's an assumption i don't know what the alternative is but let's let's assume that it's stored elsewhere
5574200	5580040	in the body what that shows is that you can actually imprint information onto a new developing
5580040	5584280	brain because until then they do nothing it's only once the brain is there that you see the
5584280	5589160	behavior whatever the information was maybe it was neural maybe it wasn't maybe it's holographic
5589160	5594120	throughout you know there's an amazing book called shuffle brain um about salamanders by this guy paul
5594120	5599640	peach and uh incredible and and he talks about this holographic theory of memory but maybe it's
5599640	5606440	all over the body who knows uh it's imprinted on the new brain now i'm not saying we're exactly
5606440	5611000	like planaria but they're telling us that it's possible they're telling us that it's possible
5611000	5617640	to uh imprint learned information onto new brain tissue um i actually don't believe that memories
5617640	5624920	are encoded by the specific micro um the architecture of your synapses that that story there are
5624920	5630440	increase that story is increasingly sort of cracking at this point and um whatever it is
5630440	5638520	i i have a feeling that if if we do regeneration correctly uh the memories will regenerate now
5639080	5644360	that's now now so i think i think that part is optimistic the part we have to keep keep track
5644360	5651320	of is that in an important way i think we are all like planaria in that we don't have access to our
5651320	5656200	past what we have access to are the engrams that the past has left in our brains and bodies
5656600	5660920	at any given moment and i don't know the thickness of that moment for for for each of us
5660920	5665960	but at any given moment all we're doing is reconstructing a plausible story based on those
5665960	5670760	engrams about what happened before and we all know it's fallible and it's you know we and every
5670760	5675640	time we do it we sort of alter the thing you were just talking about we're all doing that anyway
5675640	5680280	all the time like we are basically like people say oh my god these planaria are amazing yeah we
5680280	5687400	were pretty much all doing that you know all the time i think so so given that that that the core
5687400	5694040	self is a process it's a continuous homeodynamic process it's a reconstruction that's not a physical
5694040	5698040	structure that kind of sits there and you might lose it and then what happens um i think we're
5698040	5702760	fine i i think we're gonna if when we get to the point of being able to regenerate brain tissue
5703320	5707800	i think we're gonna be fine and and and i want to um also put in a couple of other
5708360	5712760	pointers to some stuff first of all and i have a student um carina with whom we are
5713480	5720760	writing a review of the of of all the mismatches between brain state and um uh and and cognitive
5720760	5726760	state but you know there are these cases of uh well there are many cases many different kinds
5726760	5731240	of cases but i'll just talk about one which is these these specific specific cases of of
5731240	5738440	hydrocephaly where somebody's someone someone is born with um fluid a very high fluid pressure in
5738440	5743560	there in there in their skull and that prevents the brain from developing and so you know this guy
5743560	5749400	Lorber in the 80s documented um some guy that had less than a third of the the uh the brain
5749400	5754440	volume of a chimpanzee and he was doing a master's program in math and he had above normal IQ and
5754440	5757960	like he wouldn't know he would you know he would introduce himself and meet people who take a
5757960	5761320	flashlight and shine it in one ear and it would sort of you know like pink light will come up the
5761320	5769400	other end and uh and he was completely fine and so um so so i think i think our mapping of information
5769400	5777240	to to um brain uh medium is we we don't understand how it works we have we have no idea and um
5777960	5785960	and there are many other clinical cases uh that underscore that underscore this idea so so so yeah
5785960	5793880	so i think uh i i think it's going to be fine i think i think it's much more um robust and you
5793880	5799320	can think about think about the um the caterpillar butterfly thing right like not only so so so
5799320	5804200	caterpillars basically destroy their brain they break up most of the connections but
5804200	5807960	when you do these experiments this is against some of Doug Blackistan's old work when you
5808840	5813240	check the moth or butterfly they remember the original information that you train the caterpillar
5813240	5817720	on not only do they remember but they actually generalize across that process because if you
5817720	5824040	train them to eat a particular kind of leaf on a particular color background the the moth or
5824040	5828920	butterfly will go feed the same way but they don't eat leaves they drink nectar and so you're not
5828920	5833640	remembering that leaves you know this particular color means leaves which you're remembering is food
5833640	5838120	so you're actually smart enough to generalize the category to a complete one when i'm a completely
5838120	5841720	different kind of being that doesn't care about leaves at all whereas before that's all i wanted
5841720	5845560	but now i don't care about leaves at all i i'm still going to generalize and i still know what i
5845560	5852440	want so right so amazing during like there's so much plasticity here i think we're going to be fine
5854120	5861000	this makes me think of the reports that i've read of people who have organ transplants
5861960	5867560	and appear to manifest the characteristics of the people that they get a heart transplant
5867560	5873480	or a lung transplant from yeah yeah we wanted to cover it in that review there's not enough
5874040	5877960	clinical well documented clinical cases but you're right and i've talked to i've talked to
5877960	5883560	transplant surgeons about this kind of stuff interestingly enough kidney donors liver donors
5883560	5888600	they don't talk about that stuff it's heart lung i don't know why but you know again the numbers
5888600	5894360	are small so not sure what you know the really egregious cases are are you know there's not that
5894360	5899080	many documented but yeah yeah there's there's something going on here and we have we have a
5899080	5907080	bunch of unpublished data generated by Johanna Bischoff in our group where we transplanted little
5907080	5913320	pieces of two-headed planaria into one headed planaria and some percentage of them if you
5913320	5919560	recut them again they convert to two-headed and so so this idea of transplanting information
5919560	5923400	be it morphogenetic information or be it behavioral information i don't make that much
5923400	5928280	distinction between them i think they're the same process it moves it moves with tissue
5928280	5933160	and it spreads when you put the little implant in it actually spreads across that information
5933160	5939240	not the cells the information spreads across the host so ultimately you know you know mcconnell
5939240	5945880	joked at the time it was 67 68 he joked about the concept of professor burgers this idea that
5946600	5952920	you could actually you know get somebody else's knowledge by eating you know pieces of
5953800	5959400	flesh made made from their body i don't know right like we know nobody's shown that you know
5959400	5965080	you can learn calculus and then pass that along in a burger but some kind of information maybe and
5965080	5971160	if we knew what the proper encoding and decoding was i think there would be all sorts of interesting
5971160	5978280	new routes for for memories this is i mean a dysfunctional example but prions seem like their
5979240	5988920	the transfer of information without any kind of organ or genetic relationship yep yep i agree um
5989640	5996760	yeah i think yeah prions are a kind of non-genetic inheritance um glansman shows uh RNA um so he
5996760	6003480	trains these aplizia and he and he takes uh you know extracts RNA and injects it into a new animal
6003480	6009720	and they um and they acquire some of the information yeah i mean it's just really fascinating
6009720	6014680	because when we were talking about the tadpoles with the eyes some of them are wired into the
6014680	6019320	brain and some of them can see without being wired into the brain and so you have all of the sudden
6019320	6026040	this new framework for understanding even something as basic as visual perception where we equate it
6027000	6036200	from conventional frameworks as being a necessary you know eye brain relationship and so if you
6036200	6043560	start to release that and all of a sudden it's actually in the body does that radically change
6043560	6050520	the way that we have to consider of bodies and minds and and consciousness to me it seems like
6050600	6059960	it must yeah yeah i think so i think that um all of this has a lot to say about what fundamentally
6059960	6069640	what we are and uh what it is that that persists through time and where things are encoded i mean
6069640	6076760	in planaria you can chop them into multiple pieces and each of those pieces will become an animal
6076760	6083800	and that's you know in philosophy of mind 101 you know you go over this example of the
6083800	6088200	malfunctioning transporter right so it sort of replicates you puts a copy over there but it
6088200	6091880	forgets to delete the you know the old star trek episode right like it forgets to delete the original
6091880	6096440	and now which one's the real one well yeah you can do that you can actually do that in planaria
6096440	6104040	so i think our concept of this this idea that there's a discrete border between me and not me
6104120	6107240	you know me between yourself and the outside world between different individuals between
6107240	6111880	the memories that belong to you or the memories that belong to somebody else i i think our uh
6113000	6118680	conceptions of all that stuff are are pretty primitive and probably um you know wrong
6120040	6126760	you you mentioned uh the the danger of overfitting with training uh machine learning models and
6127720	6134760	that links to this kind of tangentially where i think that the way that i've been thinking about
6134760	6143400	consciousness and awareness and intelligence has to do with the presence of a sensory system
6143400	6151800	that can then integrate information and then have effects upon the world and when we discuss
6151880	6159560	the ability of computer scientists to produce consciousness or intelligence to me i always
6159560	6166040	see there being a limitation in these sensory systems i'm like yeah you can have a brain on a chip
6166840	6171960	but in order for that to be something that i recognize as conscious it has to be tied into
6171960	6178280	some kind of body that is able to process multiple modes of sensory information integrate them and
6178280	6186360	then apply them to goal directed behavior and if there is not a necessity for a brain
6187720	6192520	the way that i've conventionally thought about it it really changes the way that i think about
6193240	6197720	machine consciousness because as we start to develop these systems and even if they're not
6197720	6204440	embodied in the way that i'm used to thinking of embodied systems it seems like we we are opening
6204440	6209160	the door into what don hoffman calls you know like another conscious portal that we're booting up
6209160	6215960	yeah yeah um well a couple of things uh first i would be really careful not to lump consciousness
6215960	6220840	and intelligence in the same bucket i don't think these are synonyms and so we have to i
6220840	6227320	think talk about them separately um with respect to embodiment i would say that i agree with you
6227320	6233480	that uh some sort of perception action loop is really important but i don't think three-dimensional
6233480	6238840	space is the only space in which to do that and so if you're doing that in physiological state space
6238840	6242760	or you're doing it in transcriptional space or you're doing it in anatomical morpheus space or
6243320	6248840	metabolic space or linguistic space i think that's good enough i don't think there's anything
6249720	6253240	i don't think this three-dimensional space is privileged i think we treat it that way because
6253240	6259400	that's how our sensory motor system developed and we're really used to things that move around well
6259400	6265640	in the three-dimensional world being the interesting intelligent things like us but uh that's just i
6265640	6270280	think that's just prejudice on our part i think these other spaces in which other beings strive
6270280	6278120	and suffer are equally real and so you can have embodiment that is not obvious to us um that
6278120	6284520	is that is in these other spaces um that was the last thing that was it was a third oh well and so
6284760	6290760	and so and so another another example of that is uh some is people with locked-in syndrome right so
6290760	6297560	so you can you can be locked in syndrome where you have basically zero ability to have uh functional
6297560	6303560	efficacy in terms of anybody noticing you doing anything but you're perfectly conscious and and
6303560	6308760	you know you've you've got a rich inner life so um i think i think i think we have to be careful and i
6308760	6317400	think um uh it it used to be that intelligence and consciousness were very closely tied together
6317400	6323400	i think that evolution kind of makes sure that those things go together and things that are naturally
6323400	6328680	evolved you can kind of gauge one from the other probably like again we really don't know right so
6328680	6333560	so the other mind's problem is is serious when you when you start to think about unconventional
6333560	6337880	things like it's it's pretty easy to say oh come on i know you and i both have minds even though i
6337880	6342040	don't have access to yours but but i'm giving i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt well
6342040	6347000	that's that's that's easy until you get to things that don't actually look like you or are made of
6347000	6351480	something different right it gets it gets really hard intelligence is easy because because problem
6351480	6359080	solving abilities is a third person verifiable objective competency um first person consciousness
6359880	6367320	is is different different and difficult um yeah but uh but but yeah i i think uh i think it's uh
6367320	6372360	it's much it's much wider than than we normally think and it's and it's not hard to come up with
6372360	6378920	cases that basically break almost any um i mean this is the one of the main things i work on now
6378920	6383480	is to try to the one my tame framework is is trying to do is to come up with a
6384440	6392680	um a framework for understanding uh cognition and agency in extremely diverse across extremely
6392680	6398440	diverse embodiments because because all of the existing frameworks they they break very easily
6398440	6404440	with with biological examples most of the things that people um walk around you know kind of talking
6404440	6409960	about okay here's my criterion you can come up with you know seven examples that will just like
6409960	6414280	crush it within you know within minutes it's pretty easy it's it's hard to come up with a good
6414280	6420680	with a good framework yeah i wonder to what extent this mode of re-envisioning intelligence
6420680	6425160	could be applied to other scale systems like i always thought it was really interesting that the
6425160	6435800	physicists got uh let's say dominion over astrophysical or cosmic scale processes um it could
6435960	6441240	i could imagine a different planet with humans on it that the biologists took over that that work
6441240	6446360	and saw different things different patterns in the sky and different uh let's say behaviors of
6446360	6452120	galaxies or or systems and and approach them as intelligence and that that wouldn't be treated
6452120	6459400	as superstitious or rational uh in some sense uh to what extent have you had you do have you
6459400	6464520	collaborated with astrophys is this about about this possibility um i don't know it just seems like
6464520	6469000	in some sense very heretical but it but at the same time i can't find a rational cause for why
6469000	6476200	that's so yeah um i i think uh two two two things to to think about there one is that
6477000	6483720	i i i think uh the reason that um i i think you need an impedance match a kind of um
6484840	6491400	kind of uh cohesion between the tools you're using and what you're hoping to find
6491400	6496600	i think the reason that physicists always see dumb matter and dumb machines and never mind is
6496600	6501560	because they're using tools that are very low agency tools voltmeters and rulers and you know
6501560	6505880	telescopes and things like that these are very low agency things all they're ever gonna see is
6505880	6512600	low agency stuff uh i think you need minds to recognize other minds and um uh so that's that's
6512600	6519240	one thing another thing is is this uh i feel very strongly that assessments of whether
6519240	6523560	any people say this to me all the time and say oh uh you know your your team framework is very kind
6523560	6528360	of panpsychist so what you're just going to say that um that the weather and and and the sun are
6528360	6534280	conscious to well my point is is this but you can't say that you can't just say anything you can't say
6534280	6539800	it is or it isn't you have to do experiments and so um but both directions are bad right so so in
6539800	6545800	the olden days every every rock had a spirit behind it and every you know whatever like that that's
6545880	6550440	so that's problematic because then you say well what what is that doing for you and your ability
6550440	6555160	to understand the rock and whatever but the other option when you say oh no the weather definitely
6555160	6560120	doesn't have any any you know any agency to it i i don't know have you tried training it because we
6560120	6566360	have tools in in behavior science where you can actually address novel systems and ask does this
6566360	6571400	thing have habituation sensitization associate of learning predictive predictive coding uh you
6571400	6576920	know a metacognitive assessment all that these are not things you can have feelings about or
6576920	6583720	preconceptions about you have to do experiments so so my question is um you know uh yeah you can
6584360	6590120	you can you can entertain i i think you can entertain the idea that wow what if the you know
6590120	6595640	the whole galaxy is this like giant intelligence totally possible but you can't say that until
6595640	6600200	you've done some sort of experiment and they have to be perturbational experiments you can't do it
6600200	6605720	just by observation that's really key um you know they did these experiments uh in the 70s where
6605720	6610520	this guy made these um movies where there were different shapes moving around so triangles and
6610520	6615480	squares and circles and things and he would show them to people and people go oh look it's very obvious
6615480	6618920	the the the circles in love with the square and then they're trying to run away but the triangle
6618920	6625160	keeps trying to break them like you can tell these stories all day long but the only way to to develop
6625160	6629800	them into things that help your research and help you understand nature is to do perturbational
6629800	6634040	experiments is they find if i put my finger on the triangle and don't let it go what's going
6634040	6637960	to happen or i put a barrier does the circle really go around and get this way like what's
6637960	6644360	actually going to happen and so i'm completely open to um potential intelligence is at other
6644360	6650520	scales of time and space in fact i did i did annoy a bunch of physicists at one point asking them
6650520	6656680	could redesign a planetary scale synapse so so some kind of a gravitational system where a pulse
6656680	6660840	comes in and so it's some sort of asteroid comes flying in something changes and then the next time
6660840	6664120	you know the next three asteroids come flying in it does something different because it's learned
6664120	6670040	and it's got you know it's it's a synapse right so it has a historicity to it um and yes i think
6670040	6674680	you can design such things whether they occur in nature i have no idea um well there's some
6674680	6679480	interesting anecdotes i think there's some flyby anomalies with anomalies it's hard to say there's
6679480	6685640	some flyby anomalies with uh the jupiter probes you know that that end up leaving their orbit set
6685640	6691400	you know and and and they're just kind of catalogued and moved on and and again like it's not
6691400	6696520	such a perturbation it's actually terrifying to think about uh perturbing another galaxy or
6696520	6700840	something and all of the people in that galaxy are like what's going on um but i suppose you
6700840	6704360	wouldn't need to do that because there there are these anomaly i mean the galactic rotation problem
6704360	6709800	is another really interesting one it's like we have a very robust model of gravity quantitatively
6709800	6713720	we've checked it out locally in our solar system to the best of our ability on earth
6713720	6718280	and then we look at these large-scale structures and it's like well they're moving by some other
6718280	6724840	means and uh it really opens the door but i suppose without being able to mess with it
6724840	6729880	you can't really see if it's responsive or or if it's just some physical process that we are not
6729880	6736440	aware of yet i mean that's the thing right crossing crossing levels between local physical process
6737320	6743400	suppose you have a you have a conversation with somebody and uh you convince them to go to grad
6743400	6747480	school you have this you know four argue four really good arguments why they should go get their
6747480	6752840	phd and they do and then and then here you know along comes the physics is how did you do that
6752840	6758200	and and you say well here's and they say okay so let's measure so there was this air vibration and
6758200	6763720	it went into the eardrum and then there's a okay it's not that that story is false it's just completely
6763720	6768200	useless that the next time somebody else needs to be talked into whatever it is right it doesn't
6768200	6774280	capture the essence of what's going on even though even though at the local scale yes it all was
6774280	6778440	true and it all held together and these are the sets of frequencies and air vibrations that happen
6778440	6785960	it misses the whole point of the story so um it's almost i i feel it's like um uh and again this is
6785960	6790760	this is just you know kind of very very hand-wavy stuff but but i'm working on something something
6790760	6796600	a little better um the the notion of synchronicity right the idea that there are large scale patterns
6796600	6802840	that show up at specific observational scales when you as the observer know what to look for
6802840	6809480	but down below they are just chance or they're you know it's it's never magic it's never against
6809480	6813640	the laws of physics but it but but if you look at a larger scale there's often like yeah wait a
6813640	6818200	minute though yeah i know each one of these things kind of was was random by itself but all together
6818280	6823240	there's some there's something going on here and so you have to know how to look for those patterns
6823240	6827400	and even better you have to know how to read and write those patterns which means perturbational
6827400	6832760	experiments so you know i i don't have any ideas on how to um do perturbational experiments on on
6832760	6840440	galaxies but but like the weather kind of a thing should be absolutely uh uh tractable and and we
6840440	6844840	did something like that with um with gene regulatory networks because they're very simple
6844840	6849560	dynamical systems and you look at them you say well that's things kind of it's we you know for
6849560	6853160	sure it's dumb it's never gonna look turns out they're capable of six different kinds of memory
6853160	6857000	including pavlovian conditioning and all it takes it doesn't you don't need cells you don't need
6857000	6861080	synapses you don't need any of that it's it's a it's a handful of genes that turn each other on
6861080	6865880	and off and already you get this amazing free gift which is that some of the biological ones
6865880	6871480	anyway they can they can learn why do you think that the physicists have such preeminence in our
6871480	6877480	academic tower you know i feel like people all like if you look at nsf at least last time i looked
6877480	6885000	it was mostly physicists that were in charge uh it just seems like people expect physicists to answer
6885000	6890360	these really huge cosmic questions and i've always found that a little bit bizarre but and i've been
6890360	6898280	trying to trace how that came about and if it's arbitrary or if it's is there something innate
6898280	6902280	about the way that we perceive the world that demands that kind of explanation even if it's
6902280	6911240	not capable of it yeah um i would argue that it's because uh they make cd players right like they
6911240	6916040	i mean they they're the ones and and it's because they pick the low-hanging fruit i mean literally
6916040	6920360	not to take anything away like physics is amazing and it lots of hard problems and all of that but
6920360	6925320	but um as as anybody who does computer science or physics when they try to reach bio they get
6925400	6929480	into biology they want to rip the hair out of their heads because because they're used to systems
6929480	6935400	that are precise uh basically the low end of the spectrum you can you can we know how to deal with
6935400	6939880	the low end of the spectrum and now we do anyway after all the hard work and those are the things
6939880	6945640	where we make reliable technology so so you know if you want a washing machine or you want a cd player
6945640	6951240	you didn't get there without the physicists now you need some other stuff but but but but the
6951320	6956760	stuff from the right side of that spectrum so so psychoanalysis and uh but you all that kind of
6956760	6962920	stuff in and art and everything like it's great but it is notoriously unreliable for doing any
6962920	6969160	particular thing you know it sort of will enrich some of us and not others and who knows but but
6969160	6973480	if you really want you know if you if you um if you want to build a house or you want to you want
6973480	6978200	to you know antibiotics or something like that it's physics and then chemistry and i i i think
6978200	6983880	that's that's what it is it's just people people can see what works and and it's going to take a
6983880	6992440	lot of hard work uh to get that degree of um a predictive utility out of these higher higher
6992440	7002760	agency things if we live in a world of platonic forms that are being biologically manifest and
7002760	7008120	evolution is you described it as being something that makes problem solving machines
7009320	7016280	do you have a sense of your own role in that as like what is the what is the platonic form of the
7016280	7028360	problem that you see yourself as solving yeah so so this is uh just my phenomenology of it i i don't
7028360	7033240	know because i'm not able to do experiments controlled experiments on the scale of you know
7033240	7037400	life and science and all of that right so so i i don't know if any of this is has any truth to it
7037400	7047560	this is just how how i feel um yeah um it certainly feels to me like i'm discovering not inventing
7047560	7054040	and that the people in my lab uh we are we are uncovering something um i don't know if they
7054040	7061160	would agree by the way but but uh but me personally everything that that we've done over the decades
7061160	7067560	i feel like we're unearthing something that already existed and that has a particular
7067560	7073080	structure to it we don't make it up we find it and we kind of uh we can do better or worse at
7073080	7077000	figuring out what it is and how to relate to it and how to bring it out into the world
7077000	7083640	um that's how it feels to me i don't know that any of that is true um but um yeah and i also think
7083640	7090600	that so so here's another kind of wacky thing uh and i've told this to some of my students um
7091720	7098360	i i also feel like some of that stuff is under positive pressure in other words it wants to
7098360	7103080	come out in other words it's there for you to like like when you poke that little hole into
7103080	7109160	that platonic space by making uh the you know a bot or some kind of new technology stuff comes
7109240	7113480	rushing through that hole and i really feel like again this is very non-scientific i'm just
7113480	7119560	telling you how it feels to to to me um that that's what we do we figure out ways to kind of
7119560	7124360	put a crack in that in that boundary and then stuff starts pouring through the boundary you
7124360	7128760	don't have to you don't have to pull it out if you if you make the if you if you if you um
7129640	7135400	make make a make that barrier porous it it comes out i think i think it's under pressure it it it
7135400	7143000	whatever you whatever you create in this world that's uh uh it will it will um pull patterns
7143000	7148280	that that are that are there and is that how you approach your own goal orientation in your science
7148280	7152680	like you know we're starting a new year here and and it's almost like if it's a miracle year for
7152680	7160280	you what would it look like but i sense that it's almost like you see it as just chasing that that
7160280	7165400	you know positive pressure that positive pressure yeah you're sort of flowing with it do you set
7166200	7170840	that that's sort of objective bar for yourself when you when you look out onto the immediate
7170840	7178200	future as a scientist or are you are you just kind of going with the muse um well i well i
7178200	7183880	definitely think there's a muse no no doubt about that but um i also think that the space of possible
7183960	7190600	things to chase after is infinite and so i actually like like on the spectrum you know in some labs
7190600	7195080	you you know you sort of show up and whatever you do as long as you discover something cool
7195080	7199240	everybody's you know happy with it but i'm on the other spectrum so i have a very specific
7199240	7204200	research agenda i would like everybody who joins the higher than my lab we're all working on
7204200	7211000	very specific things where i know what i want to to come out of this um so and that's that's not
7211000	7216680	to say that uh that i'm you know uh defining it like designing any of these things it's just that
7217240	7221560	there are many many different things that different muses that one could tune into
7221560	7226600	and i have one particular one that you know i'm sort of flowing with and that means being very
7226600	7232040	thoughtful about um what are the channels through which you write these these findings will hopefully
7232040	7237320	hopefully flow the center i've got a i've got a mind map that hangs in our um in our in our lab
7237320	7242120	and it's like this this this this giant poster that we put like nine feet wide that we printed on
7242120	7247400	silk and the center of the mind map is called embodied mind that's the center so so it's all
7247400	7251480	the different ways and you know all the different questions and things that we're doing and then
7251480	7255240	different people's specific projects are sort of peppered around the leaves of the trail of that of
7255240	7260280	that graph and so that everybody can see where where they kind of plug into this but it's no
7260280	7266680	it's very specific and it's very curated it's a beautiful world that you're building i really
7266680	7271480	think that when i i think i've told you this before that when i went to go study biology i
7271480	7277800	imagined that it would be the the study of what is life and i very quickly realized that it was
7277800	7283320	much more mechanistic and much more molecular than that in most cases and one of the reasons
7283320	7287560	that we started this podcast was because i was certain that there were people out there who
7287560	7294040	were asking the larger questions of the significance and pushing the boundaries of what it meant to
7294040	7302120	understand bodies and life itself because it does seem to be a very weird center of the universe
7302920	7307560	and obviously that's like a very you know earth centric or human centric perspective but
7307560	7315800	there is something that is there's a motive force of life which is the solving of problems
7315800	7321160	and the universe seems full of problems to solve and so figuring out the process by which
7321160	7327960	we can do that in novel ways seems to me to be the passage into something that is
7328920	7333720	greater than the past because at every single juncture where humans have run into problems
7333720	7339240	the way that we have solved them is by figuring out technological approaches to resolving what
7339240	7345560	has happened and obviously that creates downstream problems like you look at the you know the green
7345560	7350840	revolution or something we have solved the problem of mass starvation but now we have
7350840	7355480	phosphate runoff and pollution of waters and now we have so many people that we don't have regenerative
7355480	7363480	agriculture that prevents us from just decimating animal life on the planet and i think that the
7365080	7370360	the passage into the next era is the passage of understanding or biology much better than we ever
7370440	7375480	have before and i think that your work is really really at the center of this and i just
7376600	7382840	i'm i'm i'm grateful to have to have met you and to know that that someone is is doing this
7382840	7388280	it's really it gives me a lot of hope for the future well thank you so much yeah i'm i that's
7388280	7392680	one of the things i'm happiest about is when people get hope from some of the things i say
7393560	7399880	and i this is maybe a good time to point out that it obviously isn't just me so in addition
7399880	7404280	to the people in my lab that do a lot of the hard work it's also i have i have some amazing
7404280	7410520	collaborators that that have been pulled together some of whom you may want to have on so people
7410520	7414520	like Richard Watson and you know and chris fields and mark solmes and some other folks
7416440	7423960	they really make a lot of this possible because these are some of the things i say these ideas
7423960	7428920	have been around for really long time but they've gotten no traction because there's a huge difference
7428920	7434760	between saying something and pushing it to the point where it actually generates new discoveries
7434760	7440120	and until you do that second thing it doesn't move the needle and that that's the really hard part
7440120	7444920	and so so there have been a lot of people that i've worked with that enable that they have
7444920	7451160	enabled some of that some of that to happen and i think i think what you're saying is super important
7451160	7457960	in the sense of understanding life beyond kind of the lowest levels of it meaning the the
7457960	7463240	mechanistic molecular stuff is is critical it's going to be important for us going into the you
7463240	7469720	know whatever the future of humanity is the one thing i want to say though is people get
7469720	7475560	hyper fixated when when they hear life people get hyper fixated on the material and on how it
7475560	7484040	gets here so so the biological wet the cytoplasm stuff and the product of evolution and i just
7484040	7491880	want to say that i think life and and that kind of focus on what's important is really critical
7491880	7499880	but we have to remember the protoplasm isn't magic and it isn't unique and the meandering
7499880	7506360	course of the evolutionary process is not the only way that mind enters this world and we have to
7506360	7511480	get broader than than a focus on the easy stuff which is the material it's really easy to say
7511480	7516680	oh you're made of silicon yeah you're not real you're just you're just faking it and and really
7516680	7522440	the hard work that we have to do as a as a species is to get beyond those those kind of superficial
7522440	7527640	criteria and to really say what what do we really mean by um i don't i don't know about life i you
7527640	7533480	know you can you can keep life what it is but but but cognition um i think goes way beyond the living
7533480	7540360	world and we we have to understand we have to develop um the rigorous frameworks of of recognizing
7540440	7545720	in novel guises that we wouldn't necessarily say are alive and i think that this next year is going
7545720	7552360	to be really interesting to see what happens because i feel like we're approaching that question
7552360	7561480	in a massive way technologically yeah we we are um i i'm i'm really um disappointed about how
7561480	7569960	narrow that debate has been and the hyper focus on language models and and uh the kind of
7570760	7576520	ai's that we have today and the things you know the people people just get so so focused on these
7576520	7583560	examples and and and the broader lessons of the field of diverse intelligence are haven't even
7583560	7587880	been scratched yet everybody's just like really focused on this on this one thing i think i think
7587880	7594440	we get much bigger issues actually coming than than just than just this yeah i mean i think that we
7594440	7600120	can plan to spend the next year reading up and studying more on the the diverse intelligence
7600120	7605320	and hopefully we can see you again in at the beginning of the next year yeah absolutely anytime
7605320	7610200	thank you so much it's always awesome thanks for so eye-opening talking to you and i really
7610200	7614600	appreciate you giving us your time and giving it to our audience as well that's great i appreciate
7614680	7618920	thank you always a great discussion be well um yeah stay in touch happy new year
7618920	7622280	happy new year all right happy new year yeah send me uh send me a link when this comes up
7622280	7630520	we'll do you got it all right bye everybody bye
7644600	7645980	you
