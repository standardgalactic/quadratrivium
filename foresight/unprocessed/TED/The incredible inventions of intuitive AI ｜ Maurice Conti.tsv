0	15000	How many of you are creatives, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists,
15000	18000	or maybe you just have a really big imagination?
18000	20000	Show of hands?
20000	22000	Hey, that's most of you.
22000	25000	I have some news for us creatives.
25000	29000	Over the course of the next 20 years,
29000	33000	more will change around the way we do our work
33000	36000	than has happened in the last 2,000.
36000	41000	In fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.
41000	47000	Now, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.
47000	51000	The hunter-gatherer age lasted several million years.
51000	55000	And then the agricultural age lasted several thousand years.
55000	58000	The industrial age lasted a couple of centuries,
58000	63000	and now the information age has lasted just a few decades.
63000	69000	And now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.
69000	72000	Welcome to the augmented age.
72000	75000	In this new era, your natural human capabilities
75000	77000	are going to be augmented by computational systems
77000	81000	that help you think, robotic systems that help you make,
81000	87000	and digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.
87000	89000	Let's start with cognitive augmentation.
89000	92000	How many of you are augmented cyborgs?
92000	98000	I would actually argue that we're already augmented.
98000	101000	Imagine you're at a party and somebody asks you a question
101000	103000	that you don't know the answer to.
103000	107000	If you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.
107000	110000	But this is just a primitive beginning.
110000	114000	Even Siri is just a passive tool.
114000	117000	In fact, for the last three and a half million years,
117000	121000	the tools that we've had have been completely passive.
121000	125000	They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.
125000	129000	Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.
129000	133000	The chisel only carves where the artist points it.
133000	139000	And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.
139000	142000	In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,
142000	147000	we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools,
147000	152000	like manually, like literally using our hands, even with computers.
152000	155000	But I'm more like Scotty in Star Trek.
156000	159000	I want to have a conversation with a computer.
159000	162000	I want to say, computer, let's design a car.
162000	164000	And the computer shows me a car.
164000	167000	And I say, no, more fast-looking and less German.
167000	170000	And bang, the computer shows me an option.
170000	173000	Now, that conversation might be a little ways off.
173000	176000	It's actually probably less than many of us think.
176000	179000	But right now, we're working on it.
179000	182000	Tools are making this leap from being passive
182000	184000	to being generative.
184000	190000	Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry,
190000	193000	to come up with new designs all by themselves.
193000	196000	All it needs are your goals and your constraints.
196000	198000	I'll give you an example.
198000	200000	In the case of this aerial drone chassis,
200000	204000	all you would need to do is tell it something like it has four propellers,
204000	206000	you want it to be as lightweight as possible,
206000	209000	and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.
210000	215000	And then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space.
215000	219000	Every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria,
219000	222000	millions of them, takes big computers to do this.
222000	226000	But it comes back to us with designs that we, by ourselves,
226000	228000	never could have imagined.
228000	231000	And the computer is coming up with this stuff all by itself.
231000	235000	No one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch.
236000	240000	And by the way, it's no accident that the drone body looks
240000	243000	just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.
245000	249000	It's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way that evolution does.
250000	254000	And what's exciting is we're starting to see this technology out in the real world.
254000	258000	We've been working with Airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future.
258000	260000	Now, it's a ways out still.
260000	264000	But just recently, we used a generative design AI
264000	267000	to come up with this.
267000	272000	This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.
272000	275000	It's stronger than the original, yet half the weight.
275000	279000	And it'll be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.
279000	281000	So computers can now generate.
281000	286000	They can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.
286000	288000	But they're not intuitive.
288000	291000	They still have to start from scratch every single time.
291000	296000	And that's because they never learn, unlike Maggie.
297000	301000	Maggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools.
301000	303000	What do I mean by that?
303000	306000	If her owner picks up that leash, Maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty
306000	308000	that it's time to go for a walk.
308000	309000	And how did she learn?
309000	312000	Well, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk.
312000	314000	And Maggie did three things.
314000	316000	She had to pay attention.
316000	318000	She had to remember what happened.
318000	323000	And she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.
323000	326000	Interestingly, that's exactly what computer scientists
326000	330000	have been trying to get AIs to do for the last 60 or so years.
330000	336000	Back in 1952, they built this computer that could play tic-tac-toe.
336000	338000	Big deal.
338000	345000	Then 45 years later, in 1997, deep blue beats Kasparov at chess.
346000	351000	In 2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy,
351000	354000	which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.
354000	358000	In fact, rather than working from predefined recipes,
358000	362000	Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.
362000	365000	And then, what, a couple of weeks ago,
365000	369000	Deep Mind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go,
369000	371000	which is the most difficult game that we have.
371000	374000	In fact, in Go, there are more possible moves
374000	378000	than there are atoms in the universe.
378000	380000	So in order to win,
380000	383000	what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.
383000	385000	And in fact, at some points,
385000	387000	AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand
387000	391000	why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.
391000	393000	And things are moving really fast.
393000	396000	I mean, consider, in the space of a human lifetime,
396000	400000	computers have gone from a child's game
400000	404000	to what's recognized as a pinnacle of strategic thought.
404000	406000	What's basically happening
406000	410000	is computers are going from being like Spock
410000	412000	to being a lot more like Kirk.
412000	416000	All right?
416000	420000	From pure logic to intuition.
420000	422000	Would you cross this bridge?
422000	426000	Most of you are saying, oh, hell no.
426000	429000	And you arrived at that decision in a split second.
429000	431000	You just sort of knew that that bridge was unsafe.
431000	433000	And that's exactly the kind of intuition
433000	437000	that our deep learning systems are starting to develop right now.
437000	439000	Very soon, you'll literally be able to show something
439000	441000	that you've made, you've designed to a computer,
441000	443000	and it'll look at it and say,
443000	445000	sorry, homie, that'll never work.
445000	447000	You have to try again.
447000	451000	Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song.
451000	455000	Or your next flavor of ice cream.
455000	458000	Or much more importantly,
458000	460000	you could work with a computer to solve a problem
460000	462000	that we've never faced before.
462000	464000	For instance, climate change.
464000	466000	We're not doing a very good job on our own.
466000	468000	We could certainly use all the help we can get.
468000	470000	That's what I'm talking about.
470000	472000	Technology amplifying our cognitive abilities
472000	474000	so we can imagine and design things
474000	476000	that we were simply out of our reach
476000	480000	as plain old, unaugmented humans.
480000	483000	So what about making all of this crazy new stuff
483000	486000	that we're going to invent and design?
486000	488000	I think the era of human augmentation
488000	490000	is just as much about the physical world
490000	494000	as it is about the virtual intellectual realm.
494000	496000	So how will technology augment us?
496000	499000	In the physical world, robotic systems.
499000	501000	Okay, there's certainly a fear
501000	504000	that robots are going to take jobs away from humans,
504000	506000	and that is true in certain sectors.
506000	509000	But I'm much more interested in this idea
509000	512000	that humans and robots working together
512000	514000	are going to augment each other
514000	516000	and start to inhabit a new space.
516000	518000	This is our Applied Research Lab in San Francisco,
518000	521000	where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,
521000	525000	specifically human-robot collaboration.
525000	527000	And this is Bishop, one of our robots.
527000	529000	And as an experiment,
529000	531000	we set it up to help a person working in construction
531000	533000	doing repetitive tasks.
533000	536000	Tasks like cutting out holes for outlets
536000	538000	or light switches in drywall.
538000	543000	So Bishop's human partner
543000	545000	can tell him what to do in plain English
545000	547000	and with simple gestures, kind of like talking to a dog,
547000	549000	and then Bishop executes on those instructions
549000	551000	with perfect precision.
551000	554000	We're using the human for what the human is good at, right?
554000	557000	Awareness, perception, and decision-making,
557000	559000	and we're using the robot for what it's good at,
559000	561000	precision and repetitiveness.
561000	564000	Here's another cool project that Bishop worked on.
564000	567000	The goal of this project, which we called The Hive,
567000	570000	was to prototype the experience of humans, computers,
570000	572000	and robots all working together
572000	575000	to solve a highly complex design problem.
575000	577000	The humans acted as labor.
577000	579000	They cruised around the construction site.
579000	581000	They manipulated the bamboo, which, by the way,
581000	583000	because it's a non-isomorphic material,
583000	585000	is super hard for robots to deal with.
585000	587000	But then the robots did this fiber-winding,
587000	589000	which was almost impossible for a human to do.
589000	593000	And then we had an AI that was controlling everything.
593000	595000	It was telling the humans what to do,
595000	597000	telling the robots what to do,
597000	600000	and keeping track of thousands of individual components.
600000	603000	What's interesting is building this pavilion
603000	606000	was simply not possible without human, robot,
606000	609000	and AI augmenting each other.
609000	611000	Okay, I'll share one more project.
611000	613000	This one's a little bit crazy.
613000	616000	We're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Larmann
616000	618000	and his team at MX3D
618000	621000	to generatively design and robotically print
621000	624000	the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.
624000	627000	So Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now,
627000	629000	as we speak, in Amsterdam.
629000	631000	And when they're done, we're going to hit Go,
631000	634000	and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,
634000	636000	and then they're going to keep printing
636000	640000	without human intervention until the bridge is finished.
640000	643000	So as computers are going to augment our ability
643000	645000	to imagine and design new stuff,
645000	648000	robotic systems are going to help us build and make
648000	651000	things that we've never been able to make before.
652000	656000	But what about our ability to sense and control these things?
656000	660000	What about a nervous system for the things that we make?
660000	663000	Our nervous system, the human nervous system,
663000	666000	tells us everything that's going on around us.
666000	668000	But the nervous system of the things we make
668000	670000	is rudimentary at best.
670000	673000	For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department
673000	676000	that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway in Morrison.
676000	678000	A building doesn't tell its designers
678000	681000	whether or not the people inside like being there.
681000	684000	And the toy manufacturer doesn't know
684000	686000	if a toy is actually being played with,
686000	689000	how and where, and whether or not it's any fun.
689000	691000	Look, I'm sure that the designers
691000	695000	imagined this lifestyle for Barbie when they designed her.
695000	696000	Right?
696000	699000	But what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?
699000	705000	If the designers had known what was really happening
705000	707000	in the real world with their designs,
707000	709000	the road, the building, and Barbie,
709000	711000	they could have used that knowledge
711000	713000	to create an experience that was better for the user.
713000	715000	Now, what's missing is a nervous system
715000	719000	connecting us to all of the things that we design, make, and use.
719000	723000	What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you
723000	727000	from the things you create in the real world?
727000	729000	With all of the stuff we make,
729000	731000	we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy,
731000	733000	in fact, last year, about $2 trillion,
733000	736000	convincing people to buy the things that we've made.
736000	739000	But if you had this connection to the things that you design and create,
739000	741000	after they're out in the real world,
741000	745000	after they've been sold or launched or whatever,
745000	747000	we could actually change that
747000	750000	and go from making people want our stuff
750000	753000	to just making stuff that people want in the first place.
753000	756000	The good news is we're working on digital nervous systems
756000	760000	that connect us to the things we design.
760000	763000	We're working on one project with a couple of guys
763000	767000	down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers and their team,
767000	770000	and one of the things these guys do is build insane cars
770000	774000	that do absolutely insane things.
774000	781000	These guys are crazy in the best way.
781000	783000	And what we're doing with them
783000	785000	is taking a traditional race car chassis
785000	787000	and giving it a nervous system.
787000	790000	So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors,
790000	792000	and then we put a world-class driver behind the wheel,
792000	795000	took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.
795000	797000	And the car's nervous system
797000	799000	captured everything that was happening to the car.
799000	802000	We captured four billion data points,
802000	804000	all of the forces that it was subjected to.
804000	807000	And then we did something crazy.
807000	810000	We took all of that data and plugged it into a generative design AI
810000	813000	that we call Dreamcatcher.
813000	817000	So what do you get when you give a design tool and nervous system
817000	820000	and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis?
821000	824000	You get this.
824000	828000	This is something that a human could never have designed,
828000	830000	except a human did design this.
830000	834000	But it was a human that was augmented by a generative design AI,
834000	836000	a digital nervous system,
836000	839000	and robots that can actually fabricate something like this.
839000	843000	So if this is the future, the augmented age,
843000	845000	and we're going to be augmented cognitively,
845000	847000	physically, and perceptually,
847000	849000	what will that look like?
849000	852000	What are this wonderland going to be like?
852000	854000	I think we're going to see a world
854000	857000	where we're moving from things that are fabricated
857000	859000	to things that are farmed,
859000	863000	where we're moving from things that are constructed
863000	865000	to that which is grown.
865000	870000	We're going to move from being isolated to being connected,
870000	875000	and we'll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation.
876000	879000	I also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things
879000	882000	to valuing autonomy.
882000	884000	Thanks to our augmented capabilities,
884000	887000	our world is going to change dramatically.
887000	890000	We're going to have a world with more variety,
890000	892000	more connectedness, more dynamism,
892000	894000	more complexity, more adaptability,
894000	897000	and, of course, more beauty.
897000	899000	The shape of things to come
899000	901000	will be unlike anything we've ever seen before.
901000	904000	Why? Because what we'll be shaping those things
904000	906000	is this new partnership
906000	911000	between technology, nature, and humanity.
911000	915000	That, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.
915000	916000	Thank you all so much.
916000	918000	Thank you.
