0	7720	I want to tell you what I see coming.
7740	12700	I've been lucky enough to be working on AI for almost 15 years now.
12720	17820	Back when I started to describe it as fringe would be an understatement,
17840	19280	researchers would say,
19300	21920	no, we're only working on machine learning,
21940	25060	because working on AI was seen as way too out there.
25080	29460	In 2010, just a very mention of the phrase AGI,
29480	31640	artificial general intelligence,
31660	34540	would get you some seriously strange looks,
34560	36400	and even a cold shoulder.
36420	40280	You're actually building AGI, people would say.
40300	42940	Isn't that something out of science fiction?
42960	45400	People thought it was 50 years away or 100 years away,
45420	47820	if it was even possible at all.
47840	51680	Talk of AI was, I guess, kind of embarrassing.
51700	54260	People generally thought we were weird,
54280	56800	and I guess in some ways we kind of were.
56860	57980	It wasn't long, though,
58000	61580	before AI started beating humans at a whole range of tasks
61600	65080	that people previously thought were way out of reach,
65100	67200	understanding images,
67220	69160	translating languages,
69180	70740	transcribing speech,
70760	72900	playing go and chess,
72920	74780	and even diagnosing diseases.
75980	77500	People started waking up to the fact
77520	81200	that AI was going to have an enormous impact,
81220	84020	and they were rightly asking technologists like me
84040	85780	some pretty tough questions.
85800	89140	Is it true that AI is going to solve the climate crisis?
89160	92920	Will it make personalized education available to everyone?
92940	94920	Does it mean we'll all get universal basic income
94940	97240	and we won't have to work anymore?
97260	98800	Should I be afraid?
98820	101620	What does it mean for weapons and war?
101640	103080	And of course, will China win?
103100	104320	Are we in a race?
105580	109180	Are we headed for a mass misinformation apocalypse?
109200	110640	All good questions.
111620	115560	But it was actually a simpler and much more kind of fundamental question
115620	116960	that left me puzzled.
118100	121800	One that actually gets to the very heart of my work every day.
123720	125760	One morning over breakfast,
125780	129160	my six-year-old nephew, Caspian, was playing with pie,
129180	131940	the AI I created at my last company, Inflection.
132580	134480	With a mouthful of scrambled eggs,
134500	137960	he looked at me plain in the face and said,
137980	139460	but Mustafa,
139480	141140	what is an AI anyway?
142000	145540	He's such a sincere and curious and optimistic little guy,
145560	148080	he'd been talking to buy about how cool it would be
148100	152220	if one day in the future he could visit dinosaurs at the zoo
152240	155320	and how he could make infinite amounts of chocolate at home.
156060	158640	And why pie couldn't yet play AI spy?
159900	162900	Well, I said, it's a clever piece of software that's read
162920	164620	most of the text on the open internet
164640	166800	and it can talk to you about anything you want.
168580	169720	Right.
169740	171500	So like a person then,
172000	173240	I was stumped,
174960	177260	genuinely left scratching my head.
178340	182120	All my boring stock answers came rushing through my mind.
182620	185480	No, but AI is just another general-purpose technology,
185500	186980	like printing or steam.
187320	189780	It'll be a tool that will augment us
189800	192080	and make us smarter and more productive.
192580	194480	And when it gets better over time,
194500	196440	it'll be like an all-knowing oracle
196460	199560	that will help us solve grand scientific challenges.
199860	203260	You know, all of these responses started to feel, I guess,
203280	205040	a little bit defensive
206040	208320	and actually better suited to a policy seminar
208340	210480	than breakfast with a no-nonsense six-year-old.
210500	213820	Why am I hesitating, I thought to myself?
215660	217100	You know, let's be honest.
217600	220600	My nephew was asking me a simple question
220620	224580	that those of us in AI just don't confront often enough.
226060	228520	What is it that we are not familiar with
228540	231180	and what is it that we are actually creating?
232040	235040	What does it mean to make something totally new,
235820	239640	fundamentally different to any invention that we have known before?
240800	243580	It is clear that we are at an inflection point
243600	245320	in the history of humanity.
246580	248500	On our current trajectory,
248520	250540	we're headed towards the emergence of something
250560	253000	that we are all struggling to describe.
253960	258420	And yet, we cannot control what we don't understand.
259520	263760	And so, the metaphors, the mental models, the names,
263780	266900	these all matter if we are to get the most out of AI
266920	269080	whilst limiting its potential downsides.
270320	273720	As someone who embraces the possibilities of this technology,
273740	277420	but who's also always cared deeply about its ethics,
277440	281780	we should, I think, be able to easily describe what it is we are building,
281800	284160	and that includes the six-year-olds.
284180	286640	So it's in that spirit that I offer up today
286780	288620	the following metaphor
288640	292000	for helping us to try to grapple with what this moment really is.
292620	295240	I think AI should best be understood
295260	299280	as something like a new digital species.
300360	302620	Now, don't take this too literally,
302640	307320	but I predict that we'll come to see them as digital companions,
307340	310600	new partners in the journeys of all our lives.
310620	314720	Whether you think we're on a 10-, 20- or 30-year path here,
314740	317280	this is, in my view, the most accurate
317300	322640	and most fundamentally honest way of describing what's actually coming.
322660	326640	And above all, it enables everybody to prepare for
326660	329060	and shape what comes next.
329920	331840	Now, I totally get this as a strong claim,
331860	336320	and I'm going to explain to everyone as best I can why I'm making it.
336340	339300	But first, let me just try to set the context.
339320	342080	From the very first microscopic organisms,
342100	345580	life on Earth stretches back billions of years.
345600	349820	Over that time, life evolved and diversified.
349840	353380	Then a few million years ago, something began to shift.
354260	357880	After countless cycles of growth and adaptation,
357900	361900	one of life's branches began using tools,
361920	364840	and that branch grew into us.
364860	368980	We went on to produce a mesmerizing variety of tools,
368980	372660	at first slowly, and then with astonishing speed,
372680	376320	we went from stone axes and fire
376340	381080	to language, writing, and eventually, industrial technologies.
381940	385240	One invention unleashed a thousand more,
385260	388800	and in time, we became Homo Technologicus.
389660	394000	Around 80 years ago, another new branch of technology began.
394020	395780	With the invention of computers,
395800	399120	we quickly jumped from the first mainframes and transistors
399140	402620	to today's smartphones and virtual reality headsets.
402640	407660	Information, knowledge, communication, computation.
407680	412280	In this revolution, creation has exploded like never before.
413320	417940	And now a new wave is upon us, artificial intelligence.
417960	420560	These waves of history are clearly speeding up,
420580	425180	as each one is amplified and accelerated by the last.
425200	426320	And if you look back,
426340	430900	it's clear that we are in the fastest and most consequential wave ever.
431940	436580	The journeys of humanity and technology are now deeply intertwined.
436600	438160	In just 18 months,
438180	441820	over a billion people have used large language models.
441840	445760	We've witnessed one landmark event after another.
445780	449220	Just a few years ago, people said that AI would never be creative.
450220	454280	And yet, AI now feels like an endless river of creativity,
454300	457240	making poetry and images and music and video
457260	458900	that stretch the imagination.
459780	462500	People said it would never be empathetic.
462520	467840	And yet today, millions of people enjoy meaningful conversations with AIs,
467860	469840	talking about their hopes and dreams
469860	473300	and helping them work through difficult emotional challenges.
473320	475580	AIs can now drive cars,
475600	479420	manage energy grids and even invent new molecules.
479440	483000	Just a few years ago, each of these was impossible.
483860	485980	And all of this is turbocharged
486000	491040	by spiralling exponentials of data and computation.
491060	496340	Last year, Inflation 2.5, our last model,
496360	500480	used five billion times more computation
500500	504120	than the DeepMind AI that beat the old-school Atari games
504140	506180	just over 10 years ago.
506200	510180	That's nine orders of magnitude more computation.
510180	515060	10x per year, every year, for almost a decade.
515080	517920	Over the same time, the size of these models has grown,
517940	521880	from first tens of millions of parameters to then billions of parameters,
521900	525360	and very soon tens of trillions of parameters.
525380	530140	If someone did nothing but read 24 hours a day for their entire life,
530160	533520	they'd consume eight billion words.
533540	535400	And of course, that's a lot of words.
535420	541200	But today, the most advanced AIs consume more than eight trillion words
541220	543920	in a single month of training.
543940	545920	And all of this is set to continue.
545940	549060	The long arc of technological history
549080	552320	is now in an extraordinary new phase.
552340	555480	So what does this mean in practice?
555500	558400	Well, just as the internet gave us the browser
558420	560940	and the smartphone gave us apps,
560960	562960	the cloud-based supercomputer
562960	567500	is ushering in a new era of ubiquitous AIs.
567520	572080	Everything will soon be represented by a conversational interface,
572100	574820	or to put it another way, a personal AI.
575820	578180	And these AIs will be infinitely knowledgeable,
578200	582100	and soon they'll be factually accurate and reliable.
582120	584000	They'll have near-perfect IQ.
584980	587360	They'll also have exceptional EQ.
587380	591320	They'll be kind, supportive, empathetic,
592020	593980	and a kind of personalised tutor.
596000	598700	These elements on their own would be transformational.
598720	602380	Just imagine if everybody had a personalised tutor in their pocket
602400	604900	and access to low-cost medical advice.
604920	608820	A lawyer and a doctor, a business strategist and coach,
608840	611260	all in your pocket 24 hours a day.
611280	613760	But things really start to change
613780	618120	when they develop what I call AQ, their actions quotient.
618140	621000	This is their ability to actually get stuff done
621000	624440	and, before long, it won't just be people that have AIs.
624460	626120	Strangers, it may sound.
626140	630660	Every organisation, from small business to nonprofit to national government,
630680	632120	each will have their own.
632900	635620	Every town, building and object
635640	639360	will be represented by a unique interactive persona.
639380	642300	And these won't just be mechanistic assistants.
642320	644300	They'll be companions,
644320	646120	confidants,
646140	647500	colleagues,
647540	651400	friends and partners, as varied and unique as we all are.
652400	653560	At this point,
653580	656880	AIs will convincingly imitate humans at most tasks.
657840	661040	And we'll fill this at the most intimate of scales,
661060	664700	an AI organising a community get-together for an elderly neighbour,
664720	666240	a sympathetic expert
666260	669320	helping you make sense of a difficult diagnosis.
669340	672120	But we'll also feel it at the largest scales,
672140	674700	accelerating scientific discovery,
674720	676900	autonomous cars on the roads,
676920	679080	drones in the skies.
679100	682200	They'll both order the takeout and run the power station.
683060	686440	They'll interact with us and, of course, with each other.
686460	688380	They'll speak every language,
688400	691240	take in every pattern of sensor data,
691260	693580	sights, sounds,
693600	696000	streams and streams of information,
696020	700000	faster passing what any one of us could consume in a thousand lifetime.
700880	703080	So what is this?
703100	704860	What are these AIs?
705860	710360	If we are to prioritise safety above all else,
710380	715360	to ensure that this new wave always serves and amplifies humanity,
715380	720800	then we need to find the right metaphors for what this might become.
720820	725580	For years, we in the AI community and I specifically
725600	729800	have had a tendency to refer to this as just tools.
729820	733720	But that doesn't really capture what's actually happening here.
734720	737260	AIs are clearly more dynamic,
737280	738900	more ambiguous,
738920	742640	more integrated and more emergent than mere tools,
742660	745560	which are entirely subject to human control.
745580	748100	So to contain this wave,
748120	751180	to put human agency at its centre,
751200	753900	and to mitigate the inevitable unintended consequences
753920	755780	that are likely to arise,
755800	757500	we should start to think about them
757520	761140	as we might a new kind of digital species.
761160	762940	Now, it's just an analogy.
763020	766080	It's not a literal description, and it's not perfect.
766100	770180	For a start, they clearly aren't biological in any traditional sense,
770200	772580	but just pause for a moment
772600	775580	and really think about what they already do.
775600	778120	They communicate in our languages.
778140	780320	They see what we see.
780340	783720	They consume unimaginably large amounts of information.
784860	787060	They have memory.
787080	788640	They have personality.
789620	791020	They have creativity.
792020	796700	They can even reason to some extent and formulate rudimentary plans.
796720	800520	They can act autonomously if we allow them.
800540	802840	And they do all this at levels of sophistication
802860	806420	that is far beyond anything that we've ever known from a mere tool.
807740	812080	And so saying AI is mainly about the math or the code
812100	816680	is like saying we humans are mainly about carbon and water.
817900	819240	It's true,
819320	821640	but it completely misses the point.
822920	826540	And yes, I get it, this is a super-arresting thought,
826560	828460	but I honestly think this frame
828480	831760	helps sharpen our focus on the critical issues.
832820	834260	What are the risks?
835880	838360	What are the boundaries that we need to impose?
839360	843520	What kind of AI do we want to build or allow to be built?
844560	846960	This is a story that's still unfolding.
846980	849080	Nothing should be accepted as a given.
849480	852720	We all must choose what we create,
852740	854760	what AIs we bring into the world,
855760	856760	or not.
858680	861480	These are the questions for all of us here today
861500	863800	and all of us alive at this moment.
864760	869000	For me, the benefits of this technology are stunningly obvious
869020	872320	and they inspire my life's work every single day.
873720	876560	But quite frankly, they'll speak for themselves.
877560	880560	Over the years, I've never shied away from highlighting risks
880580	882080	and talking about downsides.
883000	886160	Thinking in this way helps us focus on the huge challenges
886180	887640	that lie ahead for all of us.
888680	889840	But let's be clear.
890560	894480	There is no path to progress where we leave technology behind.
895480	899120	The prize for all of civilization is immense.
899880	903760	We need solutions in health care and education to our climate crisis,
904000	907960	and if AI delivers just a fraction of its potential,
907980	912000	the next decade is going to be the most productive in human history.
913760	915800	Here's another way to think about it.
915820	920760	In the past, unlocking economic growth often came with huge downsides.
921560	925300	The economy expanded as people discovered new continents
925320	927000	and opened up new frontiers.
928720	931400	But they colonized populations at the same time.
932400	936720	We built factories, but they were grim and dangerous places to work.
937880	941040	We struck oil, but we polluted the planet.
941960	945160	Now, because we are still designing and building AI,
945200	950040	we have the potential and opportunity to do it better, radically better.
950960	953560	And today, we're not discovering a new continent
953600	955280	and plundering its resources.
956120	957680	We're building one from scratch.
958680	962880	Sometimes people say that data or chips are the 21st century's new oil.
964000	965560	But that's totally the wrong image.
966600	971000	AI is to the mind what nuclear fusion is to energy.
972320	976040	Limitless, abundant, world-changing.
977400	979680	And AI really is different.
980400	984640	That means we have to think about it creatively and honestly.
984720	989120	We have to push our analogies and our metaphors to the very limits
989160	991400	to be able to grapple with what's coming,
991440	993800	because this is not just another invention.
995000	998240	AI is itself an infinite inventor.
998960	1002240	And yes, this is exciting and promising and concerning
1002280	1004000	and intriguing all at once.
1005360	1007160	To be quite honest, it's pretty surreal.
1007920	1012720	But step back, see it on the long view of glacial time,
1012720	1017520	and these really are the very most appropriate metaphors that we have today.
1017560	1019400	Since the beginning of life on Earth,
1020560	1023560	we've been evolving, changing,
1023600	1027320	and then creating everything around us in our human world today.
1028320	1031000	And AI isn't something outside of this story.
1031680	1034320	In fact, it's the very opposite.
1035240	1038440	It's the whole of everything that we have created
1038440	1043040	distilled down into something that we can all interact with and benefit from.
1043960	1046600	It's a reflection of humanity across time.
1047480	1050520	And in this sense, it isn't a new species at all.
1051320	1053000	This is where the metaphors end.
1053680	1056040	Here's what Al-Talqaspian next time he asks.
1057320	1058640	AI isn't separate.
1059480	1062400	AI isn't even, in some senses, new.
1063600	1064720	AI is us.
1065480	1066480	It's all of us.
1067120	1070920	And this is perhaps the most promising and vital thing of all
1070960	1073160	that even a six-year-old can get a sense for.
1074640	1079600	As we build out AI, we can and must reflect all that is good,
1079640	1083560	all that we love, all that is special about humanity,
1083600	1087840	our empathy, our kindness, our curiosity and our creativity.
1089440	1094480	This, I would argue, is the greatest challenge of the 21st century,
1094520	1099840	but also the most wonderful, inspiring and hopeful opportunity for all of us.
1100560	1101560	Thank you.
1101600	1103080	APPLAUSE
1106680	1108080	Thank you. Thank you, Moustap.
1108120	1111680	It's an amazing vision and a super powerful metaphor.
1112240	1114000	You're in an amazing position right now.
1114040	1118080	You were connected at the hip to the amazing work happening at OpenAI.
1118760	1120760	You're going to have resources made available.
1120760	1124960	There are reports of these giant new data centers,
1125000	1127000	$100 billion invested and so forth.
1128200	1131720	And a new species can emerge from it.
1132400	1134280	I mean, you've done, in your book, you did,
1134320	1136360	as well as painting an incredible optimistic vision.
1136400	1140520	You were super eloquent on the dangers of AI.
1140560	1144520	And I'm just curious where, from the view that you have now,
1144560	1146680	what is it that most keeps you up at night?
1147200	1149920	I think the great risk is that we get stuck in what I call
1149920	1151560	the pessimism aversion trap.
1151600	1156520	You know, we have to have the courage to confront the potential of dark scenarios
1156560	1159640	in order to get the most out of all the benefits that we see, right?
1159680	1163400	So the good news is that if you look at the last two or three years,
1163440	1166360	there have been very, very few downsides, right?
1166400	1171280	It's very hard to say explicitly what harm an LLM has caused.
1171320	1173920	But that doesn't mean that that's what the trajectory is going to be
1173960	1175120	over the next 10 years.
1175160	1179240	So I think if you pay attention to a few specific capabilities,
1179280	1181120	take, for example, autonomy.
1181160	1186360	Autonomy is very obviously a threshold over which we increase risk in our society,
1186400	1189280	and it's something that we should step towards very, very closely.
1189320	1192920	The other would be something like recursive self-improvement.
1192960	1196560	If you allow the model to independently self-improve,
1196600	1200680	update its own code, explore an environment without oversight,
1200720	1204760	and without a human in control to change how it operates,
1204800	1206240	that would obviously be more dangerous.
1206280	1208680	But I think that we're still some way away from that.
1208680	1212120	I think it's still a good five to 10 years before we have to really confront that,
1212160	1213960	but it's time to start talking about it now.
1214000	1217000	A digital species, unlike any biological species,
1217040	1221360	can replicate not in nine months, but in nine nanoseconds
1221400	1224840	and produce an indefinite number of copies of itself,
1224880	1228720	all of which have more power than we have in many ways.
1228760	1233560	I mean, the possibility for unintended consequences seems pretty immense,
1233600	1237680	and isn't it true that if a problem happens, it could happen in an hour?
1237720	1240800	No, that is really not true.
1240840	1242840	I think there's no evidence to suggest that,
1242880	1247400	and I think that's often referred to as the intelligence explosion,
1247440	1251120	and I think it is a theoretical, hypothetical maybe
1251160	1253560	that we're all kind of curious to explore,
1253600	1256520	but there's no evidence that we're anywhere near anything like that.
1256560	1259320	And I think it's very important that we choose our words super carefully,
1259360	1263840	because you're right, that's one of the weaknesses of the species framing.
1263920	1268240	We will design the capability for self-replication into it
1268280	1271920	if people choose to do that, and I would actually argue that we should not.
1271960	1274240	That would be one of the dangerous capabilities
1274280	1276000	that we should step back from.
1276040	1280000	So there's no chance that this will emerge accidentally.
1280040	1282560	I really think that's a very low probability.
1282600	1286920	It will happen if engineers deliberately design those capabilities in,
1286960	1289880	and if they don't take enough efforts to deliberately design them out.
1289920	1293280	And so this is the point of being explicit and transparent
1293320	1297920	about trying to introduce safety by design very early on.
1299160	1300160	So thank you.
1300200	1305120	I mean, your vision of humanity injecting into this new thing
1305160	1307000	the best parts of ourselves,
1307040	1310760	avoiding all those weird biological, freaky, horrible tendencies
1310800	1312440	that we can have in certain circumstances.
1312480	1315040	I mean, that is a very inspiring vision,
1315080	1318400	and thank you so much for coming here and sharing it at TED.
1318440	1319440	Thank you, good luck.
1319480	1320480	Thanks a lot.
1320520	1321520	I appreciate it.
