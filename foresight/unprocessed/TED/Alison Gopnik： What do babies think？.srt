1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,480
What is going on in this baby's mind?

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,880
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,920
have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric, that he couldn't take the perspective

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,440
of another person or understand cause and effect.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,640
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,440
So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,960
brilliant scientists.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,360
Let me give you just one example of this.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,400
One thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,440
trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,800
One of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,320
are thinking and feeling.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,080
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,240
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,040
Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,160
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,680
about other people.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Now the question is, how could we ask them?

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Babies after all can't talk, and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he thinks,

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,280
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,480
like that.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,280
So how could we actually ask them the question?

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Well, it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,720
What we did, Betty Repicoli, who is one of my students and I, was actually to give the

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,960
baby's two bowls of food, one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,280
Now all of the babies, even in Berkeley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,480
But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl, and she would

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,080
act as if she liked it or she didn't.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,320
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli,

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,120
just like the baby and any other sane person.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,560
But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, hmm,

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
broccoli.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,080
I tasted the broccoli.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,800
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she'd go, oh, yuck, crackers.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,680
I tasted the crackers.

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,440
Oh, yuck.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,400
So she acted as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
We did this with 15 and 18 month old babies.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,560
And then she would simply put her hand out and say, can you give me some?

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,720
So the question is, what would the baby give her?

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,120
What they liked or what she liked?

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,200
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month old babies just barely walking and talking

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,480
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
if she liked the broccoli.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,120
On the other hand, 15 month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,960
liked the broccoli, like they couldn't figure this out.

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,520
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,240
they thought everybody must like.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,640
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,600
The first one is that these little 18 month old babies have already discovered this really

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,720
profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,240
And once more, they thought that they should actually do things to help other people get

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
what they wanted.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,360
Even more remarkably though, the fact that the 15 month olds didn't do this suggests

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,920
that these 18 month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,680
months from the time they were 15 months old.

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,160
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,560
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
demonstrated this.

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,760
The question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,240
for them to learn so much in such a short time?

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,160
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,040
And actually, in many ways, they're worse than useless because we have to put so much

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,200
time and energy into just keeping them alive.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,840
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,120
taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,760
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates but also

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,240
including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,720
that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,800
brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.

71
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,560
And sort of the poster birds for this idea are the birds up there.

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,640
On one side is a new caledonian crow.

73
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,040
And crows and other corvids, ravens, rocks and so forth are incredibly smart birds.

74
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,160
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,400
And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,920
On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,520
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,400
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
anything else.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,720
Well, it turns out that the babies, the new caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,120
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two

82
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,160
years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird, whereas the chickens are actually

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,920
mature within a couple of months.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
end up in the soup pot.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,840
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
learning.

88
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Well, what kind of explanation could we have for this?

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,960
Well, some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,480
thing very well.

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,280
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,360
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,000
they're extremely good at learning about lots of different environments.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,200
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution, like the crows.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,440
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
We're smarter.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
We're more flexible.

98
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
We can learn more.

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,800
We survive in more different environments.

100
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,160
We've migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

101
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,760
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
other species.

103
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:55,320
My son is 23, and at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
little open mouths.

105
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
All right.

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,560
Why would we see this correlation?

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,040
Well, an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,320
great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,240
And that one big disadvantage is that until you actually do all that learning, you're

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,640
going to be helpless.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,640
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, a slingshot

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,280
or maybe a spear might work, which would actually be better.

113
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,720
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.

114
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,080
And the way that evolution seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of

115
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
labor.

116
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,760
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected, we don't

117
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
have to do anything.

118
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
All we have to do is learn.

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,600
And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies

120
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,000
and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,360
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,120
development division of the human species.

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,280
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good

124
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,160
ideas and we're production and marketing.

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,720
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,000
to use.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,560
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking about babies and children as being

128
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,160
like defective grown-ups, we should think about them as being a different developmental

129
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,960
stage of the same species, kind of like caterpillars and butterflies, except that they're actually

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,040
the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring and we're

131
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,080
the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow grown-up adult path.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,640
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would

133
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,600
say children are for learning, that's what they're for, we might expect that they would

134
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
have really powerful learning mechanisms.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,840
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the

136
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,940
planet.

137
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,460
Real computers are actually getting to be a lot better and there's been a revolution

138
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,100
in our understanding of machine learning recently and it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

139
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,340
the Reverend Thomas Bayes who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

140
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:12,860
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way, using probability theory,

141
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,180
to characterize, to describe the way that scientists find out about the world.

142
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,020
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with,

143
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,540
they go out and test it against the evidence, the evidence makes them change that hypothesis,

144
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,740
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.

145
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,820
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics

146
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,660
is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

147
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,060
And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

148
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,820
So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually

149
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,020
looks something like this.

150
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,780
This is Reverend Bayes' notebook.

151
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,740
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional

152
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,300
probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.

153
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,980
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate because

154
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,260
after all, if you ask even grown-ups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.

155
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,340
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

156
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,220
So to test this, we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.

157
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,660
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.

158
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,700
And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing

159
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,020
just how good babies are at learning about the world.

160
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,140
Let me mention just one that we did with Tamara Kushner, my student.

161
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,660
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way

162
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,700
to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.

163
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,500
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way, because if you wave a block

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,900
over the top of the detector, something you would never think of to begin with, the detector

165
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,580
will actually activate two out of three times, whereas if you do the likely thing, put the

166
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,780
block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.

167
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,620
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.

168
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,860
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

169
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,980
So we did just this.

170
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,140
We gave four-year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.

171
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,980
And sure enough, the four-year-olds use the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.

172
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,900
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

173
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,220
The first one is, again, remember, these are four-year-olds.

174
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,900
They're just learning how to count.

175
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,420
But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them

176
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,940
a conditional probability measure.

177
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,140
And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get

178
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,620
to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with.

179
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,940
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've shown that four-year-olds

180
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,140
are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,500
exactly the same task.

182
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,020
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world.

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,540
But after all, scientists also do experiments.

184
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,380
And we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

185
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,900
When children do experiments, we call it getting into everything or else playing.

186
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,140
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown that this playing

187
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,460
around is really a kind of experimental research program.

188
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,580
Here's one from Christine Laguerre's lab.

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,100
What Christine did was use our Blicket Detectors, and what she did was show children that yellow

190
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,380
ones made it go and red ones didn't.

191
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,020
And then she showed them an anomaly.

192
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,300
And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space

193
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,300
of two minutes.

194
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Okay, so just his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

195
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:22,820
Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

196
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair, right?

197
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:38,140
Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.

198
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,620
Okay, hypothesis two.

199
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,740
That's right.

200
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,860
Now this is his next idea.

201
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,460
He tells the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out over onto the other location.

202
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Not working on it.

203
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:09,420
Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.

204
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:17,300
Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesn't have electricity.

205
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,460
Okay, that's the fourth hypothesis.

206
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:40,220
Now that is a particularly, that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what

207
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,580
Christine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

208
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,980
If you look at the way children play when you ask them to explain something, what they

209
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,380
really do is do a series of experiments.

210
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,980
This is actually pretty typical of four-year-olds.

211
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,300
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

212
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,340
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in

213
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
two minutes?

214
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,220
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them had said

215
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,420
that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.

216
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,940
And I think just the opposite is true.

217
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,940
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

218
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,020
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

219
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,900
And adult attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.

220
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,980
So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should

221
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,060
pay attention to it, our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes

222
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,060
extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.

223
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,300
And we even know something about the brain, the way the brain does this.

224
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,460
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive

225
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,860
part of our brain, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

226
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,780
more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.

227
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,060
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

228
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,700
If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.

229
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,980
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than

230
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,940
a spotlight of consciousness.

231
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,300
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.

232
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,140
But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources

233
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,260
it wants.

234
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,420
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

235
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,660
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't

236
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,180
come on yet.

237
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,820
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really

238
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,500
mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

239
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,580
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and

240
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,940
just looking at the thing that's important.

241
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,900
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness that we might expect from those

242
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,340
butterflies who are designed to learn.

243
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,780
Well, if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness

244
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,620
as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation

245
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,540
that we've never been in before, when we fall in love with someone new or when we're in

246
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,740
a new city for the first time.

247
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,660
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands so that those three days

248
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,420
in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being

249
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:19,140
a walking, talking, faculty meeting, attending zombie back home.

250
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,220
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually

251
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,540
mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.

252
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,060
So what's it like to be a baby?

253
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:35,260
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-expressives,

254
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,260
which is...

255
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,460
That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three

256
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,180
o'clock in the morning.

257
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,660
Now it's good to be a grown-up.

258
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,340
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

259
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
It's good to be a grown-up.

260
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,180
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves, and it makes

261
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,460
sense that we put a lot of effort into actually making babies think like adults do.

262
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,580
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open-learning, imagination,

263
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,780
creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults

264
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,580
to start thinking more like children.
