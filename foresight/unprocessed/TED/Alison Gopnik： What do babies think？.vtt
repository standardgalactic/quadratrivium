00:00.000 --> 00:19.480
What is going on in this baby's mind?

00:19.480 --> 00:23.880
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would

00:23.880 --> 00:29.920
have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric, that he couldn't take the perspective

00:29.920 --> 00:33.440
of another person or understand cause and effect.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.640
In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.440
So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most

00:44.440 --> 00:45.960
brilliant scientists.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.360
Let me give you just one example of this.

00:48.360 --> 00:53.400
One thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is

00:53.400 --> 00:57.440
trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.800
One of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people

01:02.800 --> 01:04.320
are thinking and feeling.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.080
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel

01:08.080 --> 01:11.240
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.040
Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.

01:16.040 --> 01:21.160
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing

01:21.160 --> 01:22.680
about other people.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.720
Now the question is, how could we ask them?

01:25.720 --> 01:30.720
Babies after all can't talk, and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he thinks,

01:30.720 --> 01:35.280
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things

01:35.280 --> 01:36.480
like that.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.280
So how could we actually ask them the question?

01:39.280 --> 01:43.440
Well, it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.720
What we did, Betty Repicoli, who is one of my students and I, was actually to give the

01:47.720 --> 01:54.960
baby's two bowls of food, one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

01:54.960 --> 02:03.280
Now all of the babies, even in Berkeley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

02:03.280 --> 02:08.480
But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl, and she would

02:08.480 --> 02:10.080
act as if she liked it or she didn't.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.320
So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli,

02:14.320 --> 02:17.120
just like the baby and any other sane person.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.560
But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, hmm,

02:22.560 --> 02:23.560
broccoli.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.080
I tasted the broccoli.

02:27.080 --> 02:32.800
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she'd go, oh, yuck, crackers.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.680
I tasted the crackers.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.440
Oh, yuck.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.400
So she acted as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.200
We did this with 15 and 18 month old babies.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.560
And then she would simply put her hand out and say, can you give me some?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.720
So the question is, what would the baby give her?

02:49.720 --> 02:52.120
What they liked or what she liked?

02:52.120 --> 02:57.200
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month old babies just barely walking and talking

02:57.200 --> 03:01.480
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli

03:01.480 --> 03:03.480
if she liked the broccoli.

03:03.480 --> 03:08.120
On the other hand, 15 month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she

03:08.120 --> 03:11.960
liked the broccoli, like they couldn't figure this out.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.520
But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what

03:15.520 --> 03:18.240
they thought everybody must like.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.640
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.600
The first one is that these little 18 month old babies have already discovered this really

03:25.600 --> 03:29.720
profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.240
And once more, they thought that they should actually do things to help other people get

03:33.240 --> 03:35.240
what they wanted.

03:35.240 --> 03:40.360
Even more remarkably though, the fact that the 15 month olds didn't do this suggests

03:40.360 --> 03:45.920
that these 18 month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three

03:45.920 --> 03:48.680
months from the time they were 15 months old.

03:48.680 --> 03:53.160
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.

03:53.160 --> 03:57.560
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually

03:57.560 --> 03:59.400
demonstrated this.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.760
The question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible

04:04.760 --> 04:07.240
for them to learn so much in such a short time?

04:07.240 --> 04:12.160
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.040
And actually, in many ways, they're worse than useless because we have to put so much

04:16.040 --> 04:19.200
time and energy into just keeping them alive.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.840
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time

04:24.840 --> 04:30.120
taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.

04:30.120 --> 04:35.760
If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates but also

04:35.760 --> 04:42.240
including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out

04:42.240 --> 04:49.720
that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their

04:49.720 --> 04:53.800
brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.560
And sort of the poster birds for this idea are the birds up there.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.640
On one side is a new caledonian crow.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.040
And crows and other corvids, ravens, rocks and so forth are incredibly smart birds.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.160
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

05:09.160 --> 05:14.400
And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.920
On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.520
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.400
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
anything else.

05:28.400 --> 05:33.720
Well, it turns out that the babies, the new caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

05:33.720 --> 05:39.120
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two

05:39.120 --> 05:43.160
years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird, whereas the chickens are actually

05:43.160 --> 05:45.920
mature within a couple of months.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.600
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens

05:51.600 --> 05:53.400
end up in the soup pot.

05:53.400 --> 05:58.840
There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
learning.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.520
Well, what kind of explanation could we have for this?

06:03.520 --> 06:08.960
Well, some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one

06:08.960 --> 06:10.480
thing very well.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.280
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.360
Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but

06:19.360 --> 06:23.000
they're extremely good at learning about lots of different environments.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.200
And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution, like the crows.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.440
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.440
We're smarter.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.440
We're more flexible.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.680
We can learn more.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.800
We survive in more different environments.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.160
We've migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.760
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any

06:45.760 --> 06:46.760
other species.

06:46.760 --> 06:55.320
My son is 23, and at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those

06:55.320 --> 06:57.320
little open mouths.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.480
All right.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.560
Why would we see this correlation?

07:00.560 --> 07:06.040
Well, an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful

07:06.040 --> 07:10.320
great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.

07:10.320 --> 07:15.240
And that one big disadvantage is that until you actually do all that learning, you're

07:15.240 --> 07:16.640
going to be helpless.

07:16.640 --> 07:22.640
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, a slingshot

07:22.640 --> 07:26.280
or maybe a spear might work, which would actually be better.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.720
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.

07:29.720 --> 07:34.080
And the way that evolution seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of

07:34.080 --> 07:35.080
labor.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.760
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected, we don't

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
have to do anything.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.400
All we have to do is learn.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.600
And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies

07:44.600 --> 07:49.000
and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.360
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and

07:53.360 --> 07:56.120
development division of the human species.

07:56.120 --> 08:00.280
So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good

08:00.280 --> 08:03.160
ideas and we're production and marketing.

08:03.160 --> 08:07.720
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them

08:07.720 --> 08:09.000
to use.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.560
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking about babies and children as being

08:12.560 --> 08:17.160
like defective grown-ups, we should think about them as being a different developmental

08:17.160 --> 08:22.960
stage of the same species, kind of like caterpillars and butterflies, except that they're actually

08:22.960 --> 08:27.040
the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring and we're

08:27.040 --> 08:32.080
the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow grown-up adult path.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.640
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would

08:36.640 --> 08:41.600
say children are for learning, that's what they're for, we might expect that they would

08:41.600 --> 08:44.320
have really powerful learning mechanisms.

08:44.320 --> 08:49.840
And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the

08:49.840 --> 08:50.940
planet.

08:51.380 --> 08:55.460
Real computers are actually getting to be a lot better and there's been a revolution

08:55.460 --> 09:01.100
in our understanding of machine learning recently and it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

09:01.100 --> 09:06.340
the Reverend Thomas Bayes who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

09:06.340 --> 09:12.860
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way, using probability theory,

09:12.860 --> 09:17.180
to characterize, to describe the way that scientists find out about the world.

09:17.180 --> 09:22.020
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with,

09:22.020 --> 09:26.540
they go out and test it against the evidence, the evidence makes them change that hypothesis,

09:26.540 --> 09:29.740
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.

09:29.740 --> 09:33.820
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics

09:33.820 --> 09:37.660
is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

09:37.660 --> 09:43.060
And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.820
So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually

09:47.820 --> 09:49.020
looks something like this.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.780
This is Reverend Bayes' notebook.

09:50.780 --> 09:54.740
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional

09:54.740 --> 09:58.300
probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.

09:58.300 --> 10:02.980
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate because

10:02.980 --> 10:07.260
after all, if you ask even grown-ups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.

10:07.260 --> 10:10.340
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

10:10.340 --> 10:14.220
So to test this, we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.

10:14.220 --> 10:18.660
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.

10:18.660 --> 10:23.700
And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing

10:23.700 --> 10:27.020
just how good babies are at learning about the world.

10:27.020 --> 10:31.140
Let me mention just one that we did with Tamara Kushner, my student.

10:31.140 --> 10:35.660
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way

10:35.660 --> 10:39.700
to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.

10:39.700 --> 10:45.500
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way, because if you wave a block

10:45.500 --> 10:49.900
over the top of the detector, something you would never think of to begin with, the detector

10:49.900 --> 10:54.580
will actually activate two out of three times, whereas if you do the likely thing, put the

10:54.580 --> 10:59.780
block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.

10:59.780 --> 11:03.620
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.

11:03.620 --> 11:07.860
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

11:07.860 --> 11:08.980
So we did just this.

11:08.980 --> 11:13.140
We gave four-year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.

11:13.140 --> 11:18.980
And sure enough, the four-year-olds use the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.

11:18.980 --> 11:21.900
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.220
The first one is, again, remember, these are four-year-olds.

11:24.220 --> 11:26.900
They're just learning how to count.

11:26.900 --> 11:31.420
But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them

11:31.420 --> 11:33.940
a conditional probability measure.

11:33.940 --> 11:39.140
And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get

11:39.140 --> 11:43.620
to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.940
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've shown that four-year-olds

11:47.940 --> 11:53.140
are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them

11:53.140 --> 11:55.500
exactly the same task.

11:55.500 --> 12:00.020
So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.540
But after all, scientists also do experiments.

12:03.540 --> 12:06.380
And we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

12:06.380 --> 12:10.900
When children do experiments, we call it getting into everything or else playing.

12:10.900 --> 12:16.140
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown that this playing

12:16.140 --> 12:19.460
around is really a kind of experimental research program.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.580
Here's one from Christine Laguerre's lab.

12:21.580 --> 12:27.100
What Christine did was use our Blicket Detectors, and what she did was show children that yellow

12:27.100 --> 12:29.380
ones made it go and red ones didn't.

12:29.380 --> 12:33.020
And then she showed them an anomaly.

12:33.020 --> 12:37.300
And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space

12:37.300 --> 12:42.300
of two minutes.

12:42.300 --> 12:55.300
Okay, so just his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

12:55.300 --> 13:22.820
Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

13:22.820 --> 13:29.820
Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair, right?

13:29.820 --> 13:38.140
Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.

13:38.140 --> 13:44.620
Okay, hypothesis two.

13:44.620 --> 13:50.740
That's right.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.860
Now this is his next idea.

13:51.860 --> 13:58.460
He tells the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out over onto the other location.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.460
Not working on it.

14:01.460 --> 14:09.420
Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.

14:09.420 --> 14:17.300
Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesn't have electricity.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.460
Okay, that's the fourth hypothesis.

14:20.460 --> 14:40.220
Now that is a particularly, that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what

14:40.220 --> 14:42.580
Christine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.980
If you look at the way children play when you ask them to explain something, what they

14:45.980 --> 14:49.380
really do is do a series of experiments.

14:49.380 --> 14:51.980
This is actually pretty typical of four-year-olds.

14:51.980 --> 14:55.300
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

14:55.300 --> 15:00.340
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in

15:00.340 --> 15:01.340
two minutes?

15:01.340 --> 15:05.220
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them had said

15:05.220 --> 15:09.420
that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.

15:09.420 --> 15:10.940
And I think just the opposite is true.

15:10.940 --> 15:14.940
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.020
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

15:18.020 --> 15:21.900
And adult attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.980
So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should

15:25.980 --> 15:30.060
pay attention to it, our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes

15:30.060 --> 15:35.060
extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.300
And we even know something about the brain, the way the brain does this.

15:38.300 --> 15:42.460
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive

15:42.460 --> 15:47.860
part of our brain, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

15:47.860 --> 15:52.780
more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.

15:52.780 --> 15:57.060
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

15:57.060 --> 16:00.700
If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.980
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than

16:04.980 --> 16:06.940
a spotlight of consciousness.

16:06.940 --> 16:13.300
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.

16:13.300 --> 16:17.140
But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources

16:17.180 --> 16:18.260
it wants.

16:18.260 --> 16:22.420
And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

16:22.420 --> 16:26.660
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't

16:26.660 --> 16:28.180
come on yet.

16:28.180 --> 16:32.820
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really

16:32.820 --> 16:35.500
mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.580
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and

16:39.580 --> 16:41.940
just looking at the thing that's important.

16:41.940 --> 16:46.900
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness that we might expect from those

16:46.980 --> 16:49.340
butterflies who are designed to learn.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.780
Well, if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness

16:53.780 --> 16:58.620
as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation

16:58.620 --> 17:02.540
that we've never been in before, when we fall in love with someone new or when we're in

17:02.540 --> 17:04.740
a new city for the first time.

17:04.740 --> 17:09.660
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands so that those three days

17:09.660 --> 17:14.420
in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being

17:14.460 --> 17:19.140
a walking, talking, faculty meeting, attending zombie back home.

17:19.140 --> 17:23.220
And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually

17:23.220 --> 17:26.540
mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.060
So what's it like to be a baby?

17:29.060 --> 17:35.260
It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-expressives,

17:35.260 --> 17:36.260
which is...

17:36.260 --> 17:42.460
That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three

17:42.500 --> 17:46.180
o'clock in the morning.

17:46.180 --> 17:48.660
Now it's good to be a grown-up.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.340
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

17:51.340 --> 17:52.340
It's good to be a grown-up.

17:52.340 --> 17:56.180
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves, and it makes

17:56.180 --> 18:02.460
sense that we put a lot of effort into actually making babies think like adults do.

18:02.460 --> 18:08.580
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies, to have open-mindedness, open-learning, imagination,

18:08.620 --> 18:13.780
creativity, innovation, maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults

18:13.780 --> 18:15.580
to start thinking more like children.
