1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How many of you are creatives, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
or maybe you just have a really big imagination?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Show of hands?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey, that's most of you.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I have some news for us creatives.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Over the course of the next 20 years,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
more will change around the way we do our work

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
than has happened in the last 2,000.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The hunter-gatherer age lasted several million years.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then the agricultural age lasted several thousand years.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The industrial age lasted a couple of centuries,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and now the information age has lasted just a few decades.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome to the augmented age.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In this new era, your natural human capabilities

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
are going to be augmented by computational systems

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
that help you think, robotic systems that help you make,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I would actually argue that we're already augmented.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Imagine you're at a party and somebody asks you a question

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that you don't know the answer to.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But this is just a primitive beginning.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In fact, for the last three and a half million years,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the tools that we've had have been completely passive.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
like manually, like literally using our hands, even with computers.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I'm more like Scotty in Star Trek.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want to have a conversation with a computer.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to say, computer, let's design a car.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the computer shows me a car.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I say, no, more fast-looking and less German.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And bang, the computer shows me an option.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, that conversation might be a little ways off.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's actually probably less than many of us think.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But right now, we're working on it.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tools are making this leap from being passive

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to being generative.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
to come up with new designs all by themselves.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All it needs are your goals and your constraints.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll give you an example.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
all you would need to do is tell it something like it has four propellers,

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you want it to be as lightweight as possible,

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria,

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
millions of them, takes big computers to do this.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But it comes back to us with designs that we, by ourselves,

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
never could have imagined.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And the computer is coming up with this stuff all by itself.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And by the way, it's no accident that the drone body looks

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way that evolution does.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And what's exciting is we're starting to see this technology out in the real world.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We've been working with Airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, it's a ways out still.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But just recently, we used a generative design AI

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to come up with this.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's stronger than the original, yet half the weight.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And it'll be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So computers can now generate.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But they're not intuitive.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They still have to start from scratch every single time.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And that's because they never learn, unlike Maggie.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do I mean by that?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If her owner picks up that leash, Maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that it's time to go for a walk.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And how did she learn?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And Maggie did three things.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She had to pay attention.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She had to remember what happened.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Interestingly, that's exactly what computer scientists

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
have been trying to get AIs to do for the last 60 or so years.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Back in 1952, they built this computer that could play tic-tac-toe.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Big deal.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then 45 years later, in 1997, deep blue beats Kasparov at chess.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In 2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy,

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In fact, rather than working from predefined recipes,

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then, what, a couple of weeks ago,

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Deep Mind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go,

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
which is the most difficult game that we have.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In fact, in Go, there are more possible moves

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
than there are atoms in the universe.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So in order to win,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And in fact, at some points,

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And things are moving really fast.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, consider, in the space of a human lifetime,

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
computers have gone from a child's game

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to what's recognized as a pinnacle of strategic thought.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's basically happening

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is computers are going from being like Spock

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to being a lot more like Kirk.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
All right?

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
From pure logic to intuition.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Would you cross this bridge?

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Most of you are saying, oh, hell no.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And you arrived at that decision in a split second.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You just sort of knew that that bridge was unsafe.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that our deep learning systems are starting to develop right now.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Very soon, you'll literally be able to show something

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that you've made, you've designed to a computer,

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and it'll look at it and say,

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
sorry, homie, that'll never work.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You have to try again.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or your next flavor of ice cream.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or much more importantly,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you could work with a computer to solve a problem

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that we've never faced before.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
For instance, climate change.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We're not doing a very good job on our own.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We could certainly use all the help we can get.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's what I'm talking about.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Technology amplifying our cognitive abilities

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
so we can imagine and design things

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that we were simply out of our reach

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
as plain old, unaugmented humans.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So what about making all of this crazy new stuff

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that we're going to invent and design?

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think the era of human augmentation

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is just as much about the physical world

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
as it is about the virtual intellectual realm.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So how will technology augment us?

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In the physical world, robotic systems.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, there's certainly a fear

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that robots are going to take jobs away from humans,

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and that is true in certain sectors.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I'm much more interested in this idea

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that humans and robots working together

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
are going to augment each other

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and start to inhabit a new space.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is our Applied Research Lab in San Francisco,

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
specifically human-robot collaboration.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And as an experiment,

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
we set it up to help a person working in construction

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
doing repetitive tasks.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Tasks like cutting out holes for outlets

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
or light switches in drywall.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So Bishop's human partner

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
can tell him what to do in plain English

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and with simple gestures, kind of like talking to a dog,

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and then Bishop executes on those instructions

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
with perfect precision.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We're using the human for what the human is good at, right?

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Awareness, perception, and decision-making,

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and we're using the robot for what it's good at,

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
precision and repetitiveness.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Here's another cool project that Bishop worked on.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The goal of this project, which we called The Hive,

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
was to prototype the experience of humans, computers,

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and robots all working together

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
to solve a highly complex design problem.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The humans acted as labor.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They cruised around the construction site.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They manipulated the bamboo, which, by the way,

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
because it's a non-isomorphic material,

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
is super hard for robots to deal with.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But then the robots did this fiber-winding,

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
which was almost impossible for a human to do.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And then we had an AI that was controlling everything.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was telling the humans what to do,

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
telling the robots what to do,

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and keeping track of thousands of individual components.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What's interesting is building this pavilion

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
was simply not possible without human, robot,

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and AI augmenting each other.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, I'll share one more project.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This one's a little bit crazy.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Larmann

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and his team at MX3D

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to generatively design and robotically print

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now,

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
as we speak, in Amsterdam.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And when they're done, we're going to hit Go,

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and then they're going to keep printing

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
without human intervention until the bridge is finished.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So as computers are going to augment our ability

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to imagine and design new stuff,

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
robotic systems are going to help us build and make

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
things that we've never been able to make before.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But what about our ability to sense and control these things?

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What about a nervous system for the things that we make?

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Our nervous system, the human nervous system,

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
tells us everything that's going on around us.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But the nervous system of the things we make

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
is rudimentary at best.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway in Morrison.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A building doesn't tell its designers

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
whether or not the people inside like being there.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And the toy manufacturer doesn't know

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
if a toy is actually being played with,

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
how and where, and whether or not it's any fun.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Look, I'm sure that the designers

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie when they designed her.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right?

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If the designers had known what was really happening

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in the real world with their designs,

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the road, the building, and Barbie,

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
they could have used that knowledge

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to create an experience that was better for the user.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now, what's missing is a nervous system

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
connecting us to all of the things that we design, make, and use.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
from the things you create in the real world?

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
With all of the stuff we make,

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy,

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in fact, last year, about $2 trillion,

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
convincing people to buy the things that we've made.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But if you had this connection to the things that you design and create,

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
after they're out in the real world,

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
after they've been sold or launched or whatever,

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we could actually change that

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and go from making people want our stuff

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to just making stuff that people want in the first place.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The good news is we're working on digital nervous systems

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that connect us to the things we design.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We're working on one project with a couple of guys

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers and their team,

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and one of the things these guys do is build insane cars

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that do absolutely insane things.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
These guys are crazy in the best way.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And what we're doing with them

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is taking a traditional race car chassis

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and giving it a nervous system.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors,

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and then we put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And the car's nervous system

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
captured everything that was happening to the car.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We captured four billion data points,

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
all of the forces that it was subjected to.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And then we did something crazy.

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We took all of that data and plugged it into a generative design AI

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that we call Dreamcatcher.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So what do you get when you give a design tool and nervous system

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis?

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You get this.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is something that a human could never have designed,

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
except a human did design this.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But it was a human that was augmented by a generative design AI,

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
a digital nervous system,

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and robots that can actually fabricate something like this.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So if this is the future, the augmented age,

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and we're going to be augmented cognitively,

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
physically, and perceptually,

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
what will that look like?

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are this wonderland going to be like?

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think we're going to see a world

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
where we're moving from things that are fabricated

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
to things that are farmed,

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
where we're moving from things that are constructed

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to that which is grown.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We're going to move from being isolated to being connected,

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and we'll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation.

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things

286
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to valuing autonomy.

287
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
our world is going to change dramatically.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We're going to have a world with more variety,

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
more connectedness, more dynamism,

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
more complexity, more adaptability,

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and, of course, more beauty.

293
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The shape of things to come

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
will be unlike anything we've ever seen before.

295
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why? Because what we'll be shaping those things

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is this new partnership

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
between technology, nature, and humanity.

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.

299
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Thank you all so much.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you.
