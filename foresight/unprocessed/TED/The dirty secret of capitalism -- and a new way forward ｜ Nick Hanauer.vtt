00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
I am a capitalist.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.880
And after a 30-year career in capitalism,

00:08.900 --> 00:11.320
spanning three dozen companies,

00:11.340 --> 00:14.780
generating tens of billions of dollars in market value,

00:14.800 --> 00:16.640
I'm not just in the top one percent,

00:16.660 --> 00:21.540
I'm in the top .0% of the world.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.100
So I am a capitalist.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.060
I'm not just in the top one percent,

00:25.080 --> 00:26.620
I'm in the top point zero,

00:26.620 --> 00:31.980
in the top 1%, I'm in the top .01% of all earners.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.500
Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success,

00:36.520 --> 00:40.740
because rich capitalists like me have never been richer.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.340
So the question is, how do we do it?

00:44.260 --> 00:47.760
How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share

00:47.780 --> 00:49.820
of the economic pie every year?

00:50.860 --> 00:54.700
Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago?

00:55.700 --> 00:58.500
Is it that we're working harder than we once did?

00:59.420 --> 01:01.980
Are we taller, better looking?

01:03.140 --> 01:04.380
Sadly, no.

01:05.380 --> 01:08.980
It all comes down to just one thing, economics.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.780
Because here's the dirty secret.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.540
There was a time in which the economics profession

01:14.580 --> 01:16.380
worked in the public interest for everyone,

01:16.420 --> 01:19.260
but in the neoliberal era today,

01:20.140 --> 01:24.100
they work only for big corporations and billionaires,

01:24.220 --> 01:26.900
and that is creating a little bit of a problem.

01:27.740 --> 01:31.580
We could choose to enact economic policies

01:31.620 --> 01:33.540
that raise taxes on the rich,

01:34.380 --> 01:36.980
regulate powerful corporations,

01:37.020 --> 01:38.300
or raise wages for workers.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.740
We have done it before,

01:39.780 --> 01:42.260
but neoliberal economists would warn

01:42.300 --> 01:46.340
that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake,

01:46.380 --> 01:49.140
because raising taxes always kills economic growth.

01:50.020 --> 01:53.300
And any form of government regulation is inefficient.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.420
And raising wages always kills jobs.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.580
Well, as a consequence of that thinking,

02:00.580 --> 02:04.780
over the last 30 years in the USA alone,

02:04.820 --> 02:09.100
the top 1% has grown $21 trillion richer,

02:09.140 --> 02:14.540
while the bottom 50% have grown $900 billion poorer,

02:14.580 --> 02:16.580
a pattern of widening inequality

02:16.620 --> 02:19.940
that has largely repeated itself across the world.

02:19.940 --> 02:24.580
And yet, as middle-class families struggle to get by

02:24.620 --> 02:28.460
on wages that have not budged in about 40 years,

02:28.500 --> 02:30.300
neoliberal economists continue to warn

02:30.340 --> 02:32.700
that the only reasonable response

02:32.740 --> 02:36.820
to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization

02:36.860 --> 02:39.660
is even more austerity and globalization.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.500
So what is a society to do?

02:44.860 --> 02:47.700
Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do.

02:47.740 --> 02:49.460
We need a new economics.

02:50.940 --> 02:54.980
So economics has been described as the dismal science,

02:55.020 --> 02:58.140
and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today,

02:58.180 --> 03:03.100
it isn't a science at all in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.340
In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners

03:06.380 --> 03:12.340
have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong,

03:12.380 --> 03:15.980
and that today's growing crises of rising inequality

03:16.020 --> 03:17.700
and growing political instability

03:17.940 --> 03:23.060
are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory.

03:23.100 --> 03:27.260
What we now know is that the economics that made me so rich

03:27.300 --> 03:31.140
isn't just wrong, it's backwards,

03:31.180 --> 03:36.860
because it turns out it isn't capital that creates economic growth,

03:36.900 --> 03:39.180
it's people,

03:39.220 --> 03:43.940
and it isn't self-interest that promotes the public good,

03:43.980 --> 03:46.460
it's reciprocity,

03:46.500 --> 03:50.820
and it isn't competition that produces our prosperity,

03:50.860 --> 03:53.300
it's cooperation.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.340
What we can now see is that in economics that is neither just nor inclusive

03:58.380 --> 04:02.740
can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation

04:02.780 --> 04:05.420
necessary to enable a modern society to thrive.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.980
So where did we go wrong?

04:09.220 --> 04:13.420
Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious

04:13.420 --> 04:19.500
that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory

04:19.540 --> 04:22.580
are just objectively false.

04:22.620 --> 04:26.420
And so today, first, I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions,

04:26.460 --> 04:28.060
and then after,

04:28.100 --> 04:33.380
describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.540
So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is

04:37.580 --> 04:41.980
that the market is an efficient equilibrium system,

04:41.980 --> 04:43.860
which basically means

04:43.900 --> 04:48.060
that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up,

04:48.100 --> 04:52.380
another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.940
So, for example, in Seattle, where I live,

04:56.980 --> 05:01.980
when in 2014 we passed our nation's first $15 minimum wage,

05:02.020 --> 05:07.340
the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium.

05:07.380 --> 05:10.260
If you raise the price of labor, they warned.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.260
Businesses will purchase less of it.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.820
Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs,

05:14.860 --> 05:16.700
the restaurants will close,

05:16.740 --> 05:20.900
except they didn't.

05:20.940 --> 05:25.060
The unemployment rate fell dramatically.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.980
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.940
Why?

05:29.980 --> 05:32.580
Because there is no equilibrium.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.700
Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them.

05:36.700 --> 05:40.020
Because, for instance, when restaurant owners

05:40.060 --> 05:43.100
are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough

05:43.140 --> 05:47.140
so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

05:47.180 --> 05:49.220
it doesn't shrink the restaurant business,

05:49.260 --> 05:51.580
it grows it, obviously.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.980
Thank you.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.420
Thank you.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.860
The second assumption is

06:01.900 --> 06:06.860
that the price of something is always equal to its value,

06:06.900 --> 06:10.460
which basically means that if you earn $50,000 a year

06:10.500 --> 06:13.460
and I earn $50 million a year,

06:13.500 --> 06:18.540
that's because I produce 1,000 times as much value as you.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.900
Now, it will not surprise you to learn

06:23.940 --> 06:25.620
that this is a very comforting assumption

06:25.660 --> 06:27.980
if you're a CEO paying yourself $50 million a year,

06:28.020 --> 06:31.540
but you're paying your workers poverty wages.

06:31.540 --> 06:35.700
But please, take it from somebody who's run dozens of businesses.

06:35.740 --> 06:38.100
This is nonsense.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.500
People are not paid what they are worth.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.780
They are paid what they have the power to negotiate.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.460
And wages falling share of GDP is not

06:47.500 --> 06:50.140
because workers have become less productive,

06:50.180 --> 06:54.260
but because employers have become more powerful.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.300
And...

06:55.340 --> 06:59.140
APPLAUSE

06:59.220 --> 07:03.620
And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power

07:03.660 --> 07:06.260
between capital and labor doesn't exist,

07:06.300 --> 07:09.980
neoliberal economic theory became essentially

07:10.020 --> 07:12.540
a protection racket for the rich.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious,

07:15.540 --> 07:18.700
is a behavioral model that describes human beings

07:18.740 --> 07:21.260
as something called Homo economicus,

07:21.300 --> 07:26.500
which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish,

07:26.580 --> 07:30.660
perfectly rational, and relentlessly self-maximizing.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.580
But just ask yourselves,

07:33.620 --> 07:37.420
is it plausible that every single time for your entire life,

07:37.460 --> 07:39.580
when you did something nice for somebody else,

07:39.620 --> 07:42.940
all you were doing was maximizing your own utility?

07:42.980 --> 07:45.300
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade

07:45.340 --> 07:46.740
to defend fellow soldiers,

07:46.780 --> 07:49.540
they're just promoting their narrow self-interest?

07:49.580 --> 07:51.380
If you think that's nuts,

07:51.420 --> 07:54.500
contrary to any reasonable moral intuition,

07:54.540 --> 07:56.300
that's because it is.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.740
And according to the latest science, not true.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.300
But it is this behavioral model,

08:02.340 --> 08:05.580
which is at the cold, cruel heart of neoliberal economics,

08:05.620 --> 08:09.300
and it is as morally corrosive

08:09.340 --> 08:11.820
as it is scientifically wrong,

08:11.860 --> 08:16.900
because if we accept at face value

08:16.940 --> 08:19.780
that humans are fundamentally selfish,

08:19.820 --> 08:22.020
and then we look around the world

08:22.060 --> 08:26.060
at all of the unambiguous prosperity in it,

08:26.060 --> 08:28.900
then it follows logically.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.740
Then it must be true by definition

08:30.780 --> 08:34.580
that billions of individual acts of selfishness

08:34.620 --> 08:38.660
magically transubstantiate into prosperity and the common good.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.580
If we humans are merely selfish maximizers,

08:41.620 --> 08:45.340
then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity.

08:46.140 --> 08:50.740
Under this economic logic, greed is good.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.020
Widening inequality is efficient,

08:54.060 --> 08:56.380
and the only purpose of the corporation

08:56.420 --> 08:58.860
can be to enrich shareholders,

08:58.900 --> 09:01.980
because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth

09:02.020 --> 09:03.860
and harm the economy overall.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.700
And it is this gospel of selfishness

09:08.740 --> 09:12.940
which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics,

09:12.980 --> 09:16.620
a way of thinking which has produced economic policies,

09:16.660 --> 09:20.380
which have enabled me and my rich buddies in the top 1%

09:20.460 --> 09:25.100
to grab virtually all of the benefits of growth over the last 40 years.

09:25.140 --> 09:32.700
But if instead we accept the latest empirical research,

09:32.740 --> 09:36.060
real science, which correctly describes human beings

09:36.100 --> 09:39.300
as highly cooperative,

09:39.340 --> 09:43.500
reciprocal and intuitively moral creatures,

09:43.540 --> 09:48.780
then it follows logically that it must be cooperation

09:48.820 --> 09:51.900
and not selfishness that is the cause of our prosperity,

09:51.940 --> 09:54.540
and it isn't our self-interest,

09:54.580 --> 09:58.260
but rather our inherent reciprocity

09:58.300 --> 10:01.820
that is humanity's economic superpower.

10:01.860 --> 10:06.300
So, you know, at the heart of this new economics

10:06.340 --> 10:11.100
is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves,

10:11.140 --> 10:14.020
and unlike the old economics,

10:14.060 --> 10:16.860
this is a story that is virtuous

10:16.860 --> 10:19.860
and also has the virtue of being true.

10:20.980 --> 10:25.100
Now, I want to emphasize that this new economics

10:25.140 --> 10:27.700
is not something I have personally imagined or invented.

10:27.740 --> 10:30.620
Its theories and models are being developed and refined

10:30.660 --> 10:32.660
in universities around the world,

10:32.700 --> 10:35.980
building on some of the best new research in economics,

10:36.020 --> 10:38.580
complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology,

10:38.620 --> 10:41.020
anthropology and other disciplines.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.420
And although this new economics

10:43.460 --> 10:45.820
does not yet have its own textbook

10:45.860 --> 10:50.220
or even a commonly agreed upon name in broad strokes,

10:50.260 --> 10:54.540
its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this.

10:55.420 --> 10:59.980
So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system

11:00.020 --> 11:02.420
in which prosperity emerges

11:02.460 --> 11:06.020
through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation

11:06.060 --> 11:08.980
and increasing amounts of consumer demand.

11:09.020 --> 11:13.380
Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems

11:13.420 --> 11:16.100
and consumer demand is the mechanism

11:16.140 --> 11:20.300
through which the market selects for useful innovations.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.540
And as we solve more problems, we become more prosperous.

11:23.580 --> 11:27.540
But as we become more prosperous,

11:27.580 --> 11:32.180
our problems and solutions become more complex.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.380
And this increasing technical complexity

11:35.420 --> 11:39.860
requires ever higher levels of social and economic cooperation

11:39.900 --> 11:42.860
in order to produce the more highly specialized products

11:42.860 --> 11:47.140
that define a modern economy.

11:48.020 --> 11:52.660
Now, the old economics is correct, of course,

11:52.700 --> 11:56.300
that competition plays a crucial role in how markets work.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.340
But what it fails to see

11:58.380 --> 12:03.100
is that it is largely a competition between highly cooperative groups,

12:03.140 --> 12:07.900
competition between firms, competition between networks of firms,

12:07.940 --> 12:10.620
competition between nations.

12:10.660 --> 12:14.300
And anyone who knows, who's ever run a successful business,

12:14.340 --> 12:19.740
knows that building a cooperative team by including the talents of everyone

12:19.780 --> 12:24.340
is almost always a better strategy than just a bunch of selfish jerks.

12:25.380 --> 12:32.460
So, how do we leave neoliberalism behind

12:32.500 --> 12:37.060
and build a more sustainable, more prosperous

12:37.100 --> 12:39.980
and more equitable society?

12:40.020 --> 12:44.060
The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb.

12:44.100 --> 12:49.540
First is that successful economies are not jungles,

12:49.580 --> 12:51.620
they're gardens,

12:51.660 --> 12:59.140
which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended,

12:59.180 --> 13:03.900
that the market is the greatest social technology ever invented

13:03.940 --> 13:05.420
for solving human problems,

13:05.420 --> 13:10.620
but unconstrained by social norms or democratic regulation,

13:10.660 --> 13:14.020
markets inevitably create more problems than they solve.

13:14.060 --> 13:19.460
Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples.

13:19.500 --> 13:26.940
The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth.

13:28.180 --> 13:33.380
So, the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury

13:33.380 --> 13:37.860
to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards.

13:39.180 --> 13:42.660
The economy is people,

13:42.700 --> 13:44.740
including more people in more ways

13:44.780 --> 13:48.380
is what causes economic growth in market economies.

13:49.860 --> 13:54.020
The third principle is the purpose of the corporation

13:54.060 --> 13:58.100
is not merely to enrich shareholders.

13:58.140 --> 14:01.900
The greatest grift in contemporary economic life

14:01.900 --> 14:04.900
is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation

14:04.940 --> 14:07.820
and the only responsibility of executives

14:07.860 --> 14:10.900
is to enrich themselves and shareholders.

14:11.980 --> 14:17.420
The new economics must and can insist

14:17.460 --> 14:18.820
that the purpose of the corporation

14:18.860 --> 14:22.060
is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders,

14:22.100 --> 14:26.460
customers, workers, community and shareholders alike.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.820
Rule four, greed is not good.

14:33.860 --> 14:37.620
Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.620
It makes you a sociopath.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.020
LAUGHTER

14:41.060 --> 14:42.820
APPLAUSE

14:46.380 --> 14:51.460
And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours,

14:51.500 --> 14:55.820
sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.100
And fifth and finally,

14:59.700 --> 15:02.060
unlike the laws of physics,

15:03.100 --> 15:06.700
the laws of economics are a choice.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.980
Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you

15:11.020 --> 15:14.340
as unchangeable natural law,

15:14.380 --> 15:18.540
when in fact, it's social norms and constructed narratives

15:18.580 --> 15:19.900
based on pseudoscience.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.540
If we truly want a more equitable,

15:25.380 --> 15:28.940
more prosperous and more sustainable economy,

15:28.980 --> 15:33.900
if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society,

15:33.940 --> 15:36.740
we must have a new economics.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.740
And here's the good news.

15:38.780 --> 15:40.860
If we want a new economics,

15:40.900 --> 15:44.820
all we have to do is choose to have it.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.860
Thank you.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.900
APPLAUSE

15:52.660 --> 15:53.660
Thank you.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.540
APPLAUSE

16:03.700 --> 16:06.620
So, Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot.

16:08.340 --> 16:11.460
If you're so unhappy with the economic system,

16:11.500 --> 16:16.180
why not just give all your money away and join the 99%?

16:16.220 --> 16:19.020
Yeah, no, yes, right.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.900
You get that a lot, you get that a lot.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.340
If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more?

16:23.380 --> 16:26.380
If you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.740
And I could do that.

16:29.020 --> 16:32.020
The problem is, it doesn't make that much difference,

16:32.060 --> 16:35.140
and I have discovered a strategy that works literally

16:35.180 --> 16:37.460
100,000 times better,

16:37.500 --> 16:41.780
which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws

16:41.820 --> 16:44.500
that require all the other rich people to pay taxes

16:44.540 --> 16:46.340
and pay their workers better.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.620
And so, for example, the $15 minimum wage

16:50.700 --> 16:54.620
that we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers.

16:54.660 --> 16:55.940
So, that works better.

16:55.980 --> 16:56.980
That's great.

16:57.020 --> 16:59.740
If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you.

16:59.780 --> 17:00.780
Thank you.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.820
