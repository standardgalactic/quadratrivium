00:00.000 --> 00:22.300
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.

00:22.300 --> 00:27.680
Now it's generally understood that questions of morality, questions of good and evil and

00:27.680 --> 00:33.040
right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.280
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what

00:37.280 --> 00:39.320
we ought to value.

00:39.320 --> 00:43.720
And consequently, most people, I think most people probably hear, think that science will

00:43.720 --> 00:47.840
never answer the most important questions in human life.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.680
Questions like what is worth living for, what is worth dying for, what constitutes a good

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
life.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.720
So I'm going to argue that this is an illusion, that the separation between science and human

00:58.720 --> 01:04.960
values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.

01:04.960 --> 01:10.000
Now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values

01:10.000 --> 01:16.760
because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.

01:16.760 --> 01:22.320
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how

01:22.360 --> 01:25.280
the world ought to be.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.800
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.000
Values are a certain kind of fact.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.880
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.680
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?

01:39.680 --> 01:41.520
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?

01:41.520 --> 01:45.480
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow

01:45.480 --> 01:51.000
primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed

01:51.040 --> 01:54.640
to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.840
Now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.000
This is something we could be right or wrong about.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.720
If we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities

02:05.720 --> 02:11.160
of experience, well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

02:11.160 --> 02:19.160
There is no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across

02:19.240 --> 02:25.240
that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible

02:25.240 --> 02:26.960
changes.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.520
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately

02:31.520 --> 02:36.840
relate to conditions after death, either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity

02:36.840 --> 02:42.280
of suffering in hell, you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.960
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which of course

02:48.000 --> 02:50.920
may or may not be true.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.920
Now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings, we know that

02:55.920 --> 02:58.680
there's a continuum of such facts.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.240
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong

03:03.240 --> 03:09.080
does go wrong, where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the

03:09.080 --> 03:13.280
basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.120
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit

03:18.120 --> 03:23.360
more idyllic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

03:23.360 --> 03:30.360
And we know, we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.

03:30.720 --> 03:37.720
It would, would adding cholera to the water be a good idea or probably not.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.240
It would be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen

03:43.280 --> 03:47.160
to them, they immediately blame their neighbors.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.000
Probably not.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.520
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand

03:53.520 --> 03:57.200
these truths, and morality relates to these truths.

03:57.200 --> 04:02.200
So in talking about values, we are talking about facts.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.800
Now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels, from the level

04:05.800 --> 04:10.400
of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.040
But if we're going to talk about human well-being, we are of necessity talking about the human

04:15.040 --> 04:19.000
brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is

04:19.000 --> 04:23.720
realized in the brain, whatever happens after death.

04:23.720 --> 04:30.720
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality,

04:31.760 --> 04:36.440
his rather unfortunate personality, is the product of his brain.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.720
The contributions of culture, if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing

04:42.720 --> 04:48.400
our brains and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish

04:48.400 --> 04:53.280
can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind,

04:53.280 --> 04:57.160
neuroscience, psychology, etc.

04:57.160 --> 05:02.880
So what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts, to facts about the conscious experience

05:02.920 --> 05:09.920
of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience

05:10.840 --> 05:12.160
of these beings.

05:12.160 --> 05:16.000
And I think of this as a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to

05:16.000 --> 05:21.160
differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.

05:21.160 --> 05:25.600
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely

05:25.600 --> 05:29.840
access, that few people access and these await our discovery.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.680
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.160
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured

05:38.160 --> 05:42.160
but other minds possibly could access them.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.680
Now let me be clear about what I'm not saying.

05:43.680 --> 05:50.520
I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific

05:50.520 --> 05:53.480
answers to every conceivable moral question.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.680
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether

05:57.680 --> 06:03.520
you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or

06:03.520 --> 06:09.120
whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.520
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
find them.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.800
And just admitting this, just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question

06:18.800 --> 06:23.200
of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and it will change

06:23.200 --> 06:28.280
our expectations of human cooperation in the future.

06:28.280 --> 06:34.880
And for instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom

06:34.880 --> 06:35.880
is legal.

06:35.880 --> 06:42.080
Where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large

06:42.080 --> 06:47.080
bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and hundreds of thousands of children

06:47.080 --> 06:50.160
incidentally are subjected to this every year.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.080
The locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.840
We're not talking about Connecticut.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.640
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.

07:01.640 --> 07:06.040
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod unless we spoil the

07:06.040 --> 07:07.040
child.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.600
This is in Proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23.

07:12.600 --> 07:19.400
But we can ask the obvious question, is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject

07:19.400 --> 07:25.920
children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy

07:25.920 --> 07:30.400
emotional development and good behavior?

07:30.400 --> 07:39.160
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters?

07:39.160 --> 07:44.440
Now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly

07:44.440 --> 07:46.440
perpetually open to be reconstrued.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.000
So then how, therefore, can there be an objective notion of well-being?

07:51.000 --> 07:55.560
Well, consider by analogy the concept of physical health.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.160
The concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.240
It has changed over the years.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.480
When this statue was carved, the average life expectancy was probably 30.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.140
It's now around 80 in the developed world.

08:09.140 --> 08:13.520
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able

08:13.520 --> 08:18.840
to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.

08:18.840 --> 08:24.480
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.

08:24.480 --> 08:30.360
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does

08:30.360 --> 08:33.040
not make it vacuous.

08:33.040 --> 08:38.920
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential

08:38.920 --> 08:43.440
as any we make in science.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.760
Now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.880
There may be equivalent ways to thrive.

08:48.880 --> 08:54.000
There may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.560
Now why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality?

08:58.560 --> 09:02.640
Well, think of how we talk about food.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.680
I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.480
There's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.

09:11.480 --> 09:16.200
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.

09:16.200 --> 09:22.720
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, what is food, does not tempt

09:22.720 --> 09:29.600
us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.

09:29.600 --> 09:35.560
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
no exceptions.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.960
So for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie.

09:40.960 --> 09:46.040
And if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.920
Why would we think this?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.240
Consider by analogy the game chess.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.240
Now if you're going to play good chess, a principle like don't lose your queen is very

09:55.240 --> 09:57.120
good to follow.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.800
But it clearly admits of exceptions.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.480
There are moments where losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.680
There are moments where it's the only good thing you can do.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.200
And yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.920
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.

10:14.920 --> 10:22.640
Now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.520
Consider the great problem of women's bodies.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
What to do about them?

10:26.520 --> 10:29.200
Well this is one thing you can do about them.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.160
You can cover them up.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.320
Now it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that well we

10:35.320 --> 10:37.180
might not like this.

10:37.180 --> 10:42.200
We might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto.

10:42.200 --> 10:48.320
Who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their

10:48.320 --> 10:51.920
wives and daughters to live in cloth bags?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.720
Who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or

10:55.720 --> 10:59.960
throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in

10:59.960 --> 11:02.120
this way?

11:02.120 --> 11:05.000
Who are we not to say this?

11:05.000 --> 11:11.040
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be

11:11.040 --> 11:14.720
non-judgmental about a practice like this?

11:14.720 --> 11:18.480
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.200
And women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.

11:21.200 --> 11:28.800
But what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped, her father's

11:28.800 --> 11:36.680
first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame.

11:36.680 --> 11:42.440
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute.

11:42.440 --> 11:53.400
Your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her.

11:53.400 --> 12:02.320
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?

12:02.320 --> 12:09.160
Now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.

12:09.160 --> 12:13.200
For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized

12:13.200 --> 12:14.200
world.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.720
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong

12:18.720 --> 12:22.640
with these images.

12:23.640 --> 12:30.880
If we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, is this the perfect expression of psychological

12:30.880 --> 12:34.800
balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?

12:34.800 --> 12:40.560
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.560
Probably not.

12:41.560 --> 12:46.400
Okay, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that

12:46.400 --> 12:58.280
represents a place of better balance.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.720
Perhaps there are many such places.

12:59.720 --> 13:05.200
Again, given other changes in human culture, there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.040
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.

13:10.040 --> 13:15.320
Now, the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree

13:15.360 --> 13:20.240
with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious

13:20.240 --> 13:22.960
demagogues of one form or another.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.720
And of course, they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got

13:25.720 --> 13:29.680
these answers from a voice in a whirlwind.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.000
Not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
well-being.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.280
In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions

13:41.280 --> 13:49.160
has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.

13:49.160 --> 13:54.800
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide

13:54.800 --> 14:01.200
or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
But the demagogues are right about one thing.

14:03.200 --> 14:08.120
We need a universal conception of human values.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.240
Now what stands in the way of this?

14:09.240 --> 14:13.760
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality, especially

14:13.760 --> 14:17.720
secular academic scientist types.

14:17.720 --> 14:22.000
When talking about morality, we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any

14:22.000 --> 14:23.080
other area of our lives.

14:23.080 --> 14:28.440
So for instance, the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks

14:28.440 --> 14:33.000
that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.640
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy.

14:34.640 --> 14:39.080
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.

14:39.360 --> 14:46.120
We appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time.

14:46.120 --> 14:52.040
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, well, there's nothing for the Dalai

14:52.040 --> 14:56.560
Lama to be really right about, really right about, or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong

14:56.560 --> 15:05.560
about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.800
He likes chocolate.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.800
He likes vanilla.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.280
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
other.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.960
Now notice that we don't do this in science.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.560
On the left, you have Edward Whitten.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.160
He's a string theorist.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.640
If you ask the smartest physicists around, who's the smartest physicist around?

15:25.640 --> 15:28.760
In my experience, half of them will say Ed Whitten.

15:28.760 --> 15:34.840
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.640
What would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.960
It doesn't resonate with me.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.160
It's not how I choose to view the universe at the smallest scale.

15:45.160 --> 15:51.000
I'm not a fan.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.600
Nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.120
I don't understand string theory.

15:54.120 --> 15:59.040
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.640
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
This is just the point.

16:04.880 --> 16:10.160
Whenever we are talking about facts, certain opinions must be excluded.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.160
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.040
That is what it is for knowledge to count.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.720
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral

16:20.720 --> 16:25.920
expertise or moral talent or moral genius even?

16:25.920 --> 16:30.120
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count?

16:30.120 --> 16:35.000
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects

16:35.000 --> 16:37.280
worth considering?

16:37.280 --> 16:42.360
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering?

16:42.360 --> 16:45.560
No.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.800
How is there ignorance?

16:48.800 --> 17:00.000
How is there ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?

17:00.480 --> 17:03.480
This I think is what the world needs now.

17:03.480 --> 17:09.680
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions

17:09.680 --> 17:16.160
of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts.

17:16.160 --> 17:24.040
It is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things,

17:24.040 --> 17:28.560
which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead

17:28.560 --> 17:31.320
to needless human suffering.

17:31.320 --> 17:36.360
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.

17:36.360 --> 17:41.600
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they

17:41.600 --> 17:44.360
will one day mean nothing.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.320
We live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
uninvented.

17:49.320 --> 17:53.560
It will always be easier to break things than to fix them.

17:54.200 --> 18:03.280
It seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast

18:03.280 --> 18:09.800
differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences

18:09.800 --> 18:15.560
in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.

18:15.560 --> 18:22.720
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

18:22.720 --> 18:28.160
To do that we have to admit that these questions have answers.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
Thank you very much.

18:29.160 --> 18:57.360
So, some combustible material there.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.000
Here in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this, they will

19:01.000 --> 19:06.800
be doing the screaming with rage thing as well.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.720
Language seems to be really important here.

19:08.720 --> 19:14.440
When you talk about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.280
I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
say something else.

19:19.280 --> 19:25.920
They would say, no, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that

19:25.920 --> 19:30.880
and it's a result of the fact that, and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological

19:30.880 --> 19:34.920
view, that male lust is not to be trusted.

19:34.920 --> 19:43.000
Can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing a cultural imperialist?

19:43.000 --> 19:49.880
I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking, but the question is what

19:49.880 --> 19:58.080
is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and you're guaranteed to be treated

19:58.080 --> 20:00.880
in a certain way if you don't veil yourself.

20:00.880 --> 20:08.200
If anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces,

20:08.200 --> 20:12.360
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest

20:12.360 --> 20:15.760
about the constraints that these women are placed under.

20:15.760 --> 20:21.360
I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's

20:21.360 --> 20:25.440
120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.

20:25.440 --> 20:30.840
A lot of people want to believe in this, this concept of moral progress, but can you reconcile

20:30.840 --> 20:31.840
that?

20:31.840 --> 20:36.320
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become

20:36.320 --> 20:39.040
one-dimensional where we all have to think the same.

20:39.040 --> 20:45.160
Paint your picture of what, you know, rolling the clock 50 years forward or 100 years forward,

20:45.160 --> 20:50.520
how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness?

20:50.520 --> 20:57.040
Well, I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the

20:57.040 --> 21:03.640
level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to

21:03.640 --> 21:09.680
understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.

21:09.680 --> 21:14.200
So we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're

21:14.200 --> 21:18.600
going to understand the factors that encourage it, whether they're genetic, whether they're

21:18.600 --> 21:21.560
how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems.

21:21.560 --> 21:26.600
And insofar as we begin to shine light on that, we are inevitably going to converge

21:26.600 --> 21:29.040
on that fact space.

21:29.040 --> 21:33.600
So everything is not going to be up for grabs, it's not going to be like, you know, veiling

21:33.600 --> 21:43.160
my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated

21:43.160 --> 21:45.960
in the context of men who do desire women.

21:45.960 --> 21:51.760
So I mean, I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that vailing, compulsory veiling is

21:51.760 --> 21:56.600
a bad idea, but at a certain point, we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone

21:56.600 --> 22:01.000
involved and actually interrogate them.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.480
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.680
And I think they're clearly right answers to that.

22:08.680 --> 22:14.120
And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive

22:14.120 --> 22:16.160
current judgment on some of these issues?

22:16.160 --> 22:22.800
Well, yeah, Modulo, one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly

22:22.800 --> 22:27.240
delusional belief system so that you can say like, because I knew my gay son was going

22:27.240 --> 22:31.840
to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
thing I can do.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.960
If you get all those parts aligned, yes, I think you could probably be feeling the emotion

22:36.960 --> 22:38.040
of love.

22:38.040 --> 22:42.440
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context, you know, and it's all

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
of us in this together.

22:43.440 --> 22:49.240
It's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.

22:49.240 --> 22:53.680
Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.320
We don't have that maybe another time.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.320
Thank you for coming today.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.320
Really an honor.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.320
Thank you.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.320
Thank you.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.320
Thank you.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.320
Bye.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.320
Bye.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
Bye.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
Bye.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.320
Bye.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.320
Bye.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
Bye.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
Bye.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
Bye.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
Bye.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
Bye.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.320
Bye.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.320
Bye.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
Bye.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.320
Bye.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.320
Bye.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
Bye.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.320
Bye.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.320
Bye.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.320
Bye.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
Bye.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.320
Bye.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.320
Bye.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.320
Bye.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.320
Bye.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.320
Bye.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
Bye.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.320
Bye.
