0	5040	I am a capitalist.
5920	8880	And after a 30-year career in capitalism,
8900	11320	spanning three dozen companies,
11340	14780	generating tens of billions of dollars in market value,
14800	16640	I'm not just in the top one percent,
16660	21540	I'm in the top .0% of the world.
21560	23100	So I am a capitalist.
23120	25060	I'm not just in the top one percent,
25080	26620	I'm in the top point zero,
26620	31980	in the top 1%, I'm in the top .01% of all earners.
33500	36500	Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success,
36520	40740	because rich capitalists like me have never been richer.
40760	43340	So the question is, how do we do it?
44260	47760	How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share
47780	49820	of the economic pie every year?
50860	54700	Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago?
55700	58500	Is it that we're working harder than we once did?
59420	61980	Are we taller, better looking?
63140	64380	Sadly, no.
65380	68980	It all comes down to just one thing, economics.
70100	71780	Because here's the dirty secret.
72540	74540	There was a time in which the economics profession
74580	76380	worked in the public interest for everyone,
76420	79260	but in the neoliberal era today,
80140	84100	they work only for big corporations and billionaires,
84220	86900	and that is creating a little bit of a problem.
87740	91580	We could choose to enact economic policies
91620	93540	that raise taxes on the rich,
94380	96980	regulate powerful corporations,
97020	98300	or raise wages for workers.
98340	99740	We have done it before,
99780	102260	but neoliberal economists would warn
102300	106340	that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake,
106380	109140	because raising taxes always kills economic growth.
110020	113300	And any form of government regulation is inefficient.
114100	116420	And raising wages always kills jobs.
117380	119580	Well, as a consequence of that thinking,
120580	124780	over the last 30 years in the USA alone,
124820	129100	the top 1% has grown $21 trillion richer,
129140	134540	while the bottom 50% have grown $900 billion poorer,
134580	136580	a pattern of widening inequality
136620	139940	that has largely repeated itself across the world.
139940	144580	And yet, as middle-class families struggle to get by
144620	148460	on wages that have not budged in about 40 years,
148500	150300	neoliberal economists continue to warn
150340	152700	that the only reasonable response
152740	156820	to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization
156860	159660	is even more austerity and globalization.
160660	163500	So what is a society to do?
164860	167700	Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do.
167740	169460	We need a new economics.
170940	174980	So economics has been described as the dismal science,
175020	178140	and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today,
178180	183100	it isn't a science at all in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics.
183140	186340	In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners
186380	192340	have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong,
192380	195980	and that today's growing crises of rising inequality
196020	197700	and growing political instability
197940	203060	are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory.
203100	207260	What we now know is that the economics that made me so rich
207300	211140	isn't just wrong, it's backwards,
211180	216860	because it turns out it isn't capital that creates economic growth,
216900	219180	it's people,
219220	223940	and it isn't self-interest that promotes the public good,
223980	226460	it's reciprocity,
226500	230820	and it isn't competition that produces our prosperity,
230860	233300	it's cooperation.
233340	238340	What we can now see is that in economics that is neither just nor inclusive
238380	242740	can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation
242780	245420	necessary to enable a modern society to thrive.
245460	247980	So where did we go wrong?
249220	253420	Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious
253420	259500	that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory
259540	262580	are just objectively false.
262620	266420	And so today, first, I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions,
266460	268060	and then after,
268100	273380	describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from.
273420	277540	So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is
277580	281980	that the market is an efficient equilibrium system,
281980	283860	which basically means
283900	288060	that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up,
288100	292380	another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down.
293380	296940	So, for example, in Seattle, where I live,
296980	301980	when in 2014 we passed our nation's first $15 minimum wage,
302020	307340	the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium.
307380	310260	If you raise the price of labor, they warned.
310260	312260	Businesses will purchase less of it.
312300	314820	Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs,
314860	316700	the restaurants will close,
316740	320900	except they didn't.
320940	325060	The unemployment rate fell dramatically.
325100	327980	The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.
328020	329940	Why?
329980	332580	Because there is no equilibrium.
333900	336700	Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them.
336700	340020	Because, for instance, when restaurant owners
340060	343100	are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough
343140	347140	so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants,
347180	349220	it doesn't shrink the restaurant business,
349260	351580	it grows it, obviously.
353620	354980	Thank you.
355020	356420	Thank you.
358180	361860	The second assumption is
361900	366860	that the price of something is always equal to its value,
366900	370460	which basically means that if you earn $50,000 a year
370500	373460	and I earn $50 million a year,
373500	378540	that's because I produce 1,000 times as much value as you.
378580	383900	Now, it will not surprise you to learn
383940	385620	that this is a very comforting assumption
385660	387980	if you're a CEO paying yourself $50 million a year,
388020	391540	but you're paying your workers poverty wages.
391540	395700	But please, take it from somebody who's run dozens of businesses.
395740	398100	This is nonsense.
398140	400500	People are not paid what they are worth.
400540	403780	They are paid what they have the power to negotiate.
403820	407460	And wages falling share of GDP is not
407500	410140	because workers have become less productive,
410180	414260	but because employers have become more powerful.
414300	415300	And...
415340	419140	APPLAUSE
419220	423620	And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power
423660	426260	between capital and labor doesn't exist,
426300	429980	neoliberal economic theory became essentially
430020	432540	a protection racket for the rich.
433500	435500	The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious,
435540	438700	is a behavioral model that describes human beings
438740	441260	as something called Homo economicus,
441300	446500	which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish,
446580	450660	perfectly rational, and relentlessly self-maximizing.
451980	453580	But just ask yourselves,
453620	457420	is it plausible that every single time for your entire life,
457460	459580	when you did something nice for somebody else,
459620	462940	all you were doing was maximizing your own utility?
462980	465300	Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade
465340	466740	to defend fellow soldiers,
466780	469540	they're just promoting their narrow self-interest?
469580	471380	If you think that's nuts,
471420	474500	contrary to any reasonable moral intuition,
474540	476300	that's because it is.
476300	479740	And according to the latest science, not true.
479780	482300	But it is this behavioral model,
482340	485580	which is at the cold, cruel heart of neoliberal economics,
485620	489300	and it is as morally corrosive
489340	491820	as it is scientifically wrong,
491860	496900	because if we accept at face value
496940	499780	that humans are fundamentally selfish,
499820	502020	and then we look around the world
502060	506060	at all of the unambiguous prosperity in it,
506060	508900	then it follows logically.
508940	510740	Then it must be true by definition
510780	514580	that billions of individual acts of selfishness
514620	518660	magically transubstantiate into prosperity and the common good.
518700	521580	If we humans are merely selfish maximizers,
521620	525340	then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity.
526140	530740	Under this economic logic, greed is good.
531660	534020	Widening inequality is efficient,
534060	536380	and the only purpose of the corporation
536420	538860	can be to enrich shareholders,
538900	541980	because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth
542020	543860	and harm the economy overall.
545340	548700	And it is this gospel of selfishness
548740	552940	which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics,
552980	556620	a way of thinking which has produced economic policies,
556660	560380	which have enabled me and my rich buddies in the top 1%
560460	565100	to grab virtually all of the benefits of growth over the last 40 years.
565140	572700	But if instead we accept the latest empirical research,
572740	576060	real science, which correctly describes human beings
576100	579300	as highly cooperative,
579340	583500	reciprocal and intuitively moral creatures,
583540	588780	then it follows logically that it must be cooperation
588820	591900	and not selfishness that is the cause of our prosperity,
591940	594540	and it isn't our self-interest,
594580	598260	but rather our inherent reciprocity
598300	601820	that is humanity's economic superpower.
601860	606300	So, you know, at the heart of this new economics
606340	611100	is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves,
611140	614020	and unlike the old economics,
614060	616860	this is a story that is virtuous
616860	619860	and also has the virtue of being true.
620980	625100	Now, I want to emphasize that this new economics
625140	627700	is not something I have personally imagined or invented.
627740	630620	Its theories and models are being developed and refined
630660	632660	in universities around the world,
632700	635980	building on some of the best new research in economics,
636020	638580	complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology,
638620	641020	anthropology and other disciplines.
641060	643420	And although this new economics
643460	645820	does not yet have its own textbook
645860	650220	or even a commonly agreed upon name in broad strokes,
650260	654540	its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this.
655420	659980	So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system
660020	662420	in which prosperity emerges
662460	666020	through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation
666060	668980	and increasing amounts of consumer demand.
669020	673380	Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems
673420	676100	and consumer demand is the mechanism
676140	680300	through which the market selects for useful innovations.
680340	683540	And as we solve more problems, we become more prosperous.
683580	687540	But as we become more prosperous,
687580	692180	our problems and solutions become more complex.
692220	695380	And this increasing technical complexity
695420	699860	requires ever higher levels of social and economic cooperation
699900	702860	in order to produce the more highly specialized products
702860	707140	that define a modern economy.
708020	712660	Now, the old economics is correct, of course,
712700	716300	that competition plays a crucial role in how markets work.
716340	718340	But what it fails to see
718380	723100	is that it is largely a competition between highly cooperative groups,
723140	727900	competition between firms, competition between networks of firms,
727940	730620	competition between nations.
730660	734300	And anyone who knows, who's ever run a successful business,
734340	739740	knows that building a cooperative team by including the talents of everyone
739780	744340	is almost always a better strategy than just a bunch of selfish jerks.
745380	752460	So, how do we leave neoliberalism behind
752500	757060	and build a more sustainable, more prosperous
757100	759980	and more equitable society?
760020	764060	The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb.
764100	769540	First is that successful economies are not jungles,
769580	771620	they're gardens,
771660	779140	which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended,
779180	783900	that the market is the greatest social technology ever invented
783940	785420	for solving human problems,
785420	790620	but unconstrained by social norms or democratic regulation,
790660	794020	markets inevitably create more problems than they solve.
794060	799460	Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples.
799500	806940	The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth.
808180	813380	So, the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury
813380	817860	to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards.
819180	822660	The economy is people,
822700	824740	including more people in more ways
824780	828380	is what causes economic growth in market economies.
829860	834020	The third principle is the purpose of the corporation
834060	838100	is not merely to enrich shareholders.
838140	841900	The greatest grift in contemporary economic life
841900	844900	is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation
844940	847820	and the only responsibility of executives
847860	850900	is to enrich themselves and shareholders.
851980	857420	The new economics must and can insist
857460	858820	that the purpose of the corporation
858860	862060	is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders,
862100	866460	customers, workers, community and shareholders alike.
867460	871820	Rule four, greed is not good.
873860	877620	Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist.
877660	879620	It makes you a sociopath.
879660	881020	LAUGHTER
881060	882820	APPLAUSE
886380	891460	And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours,
891500	895820	sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society.
896820	898100	And fifth and finally,
899700	902060	unlike the laws of physics,
903100	906700	the laws of economics are a choice.
907900	910980	Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you
911020	914340	as unchangeable natural law,
914380	918540	when in fact, it's social norms and constructed narratives
918580	919900	based on pseudoscience.
921380	924540	If we truly want a more equitable,
925380	928940	more prosperous and more sustainable economy,
928980	933900	if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society,
933940	936740	we must have a new economics.
936780	938740	And here's the good news.
938780	940860	If we want a new economics,
940900	944820	all we have to do is choose to have it.
944860	945860	Thank you.
945900	947900	APPLAUSE
952660	953660	Thank you.
954540	956540	APPLAUSE
963700	966620	So, Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot.
968340	971460	If you're so unhappy with the economic system,
971500	976180	why not just give all your money away and join the 99%?
976220	979020	Yeah, no, yes, right.
979060	980900	You get that a lot, you get that a lot.
980940	983340	If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more?
983380	986380	If you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more?
986420	987740	And I could do that.
989020	992020	The problem is, it doesn't make that much difference,
992060	995140	and I have discovered a strategy that works literally
995180	997460	100,000 times better,
997500	1001780	which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws
1001820	1004500	that require all the other rich people to pay taxes
1004540	1006340	and pay their workers better.
1006380	1010620	And so, for example, the $15 minimum wage
1010700	1014620	that we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers.
1014660	1015940	So, that works better.
1015980	1016980	That's great.
1017020	1019740	If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you.
1019780	1020780	Thank you.
1020820	1022820	APPLAUSE
