0	19480	What is going on in this baby's mind?
19480	23880	If you'd asked people this 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would
23880	29920	have said that this baby was irrational, illogical, egocentric, that he couldn't take the perspective
29920	33440	of another person or understand cause and effect.
33440	38640	In the last 20 years, developmental science has completely overturned that picture.
38640	44440	So in some ways, we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most
44440	45960	brilliant scientists.
45960	48360	Let me give you just one example of this.
48360	53400	One thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is
53400	57440	trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby.
57480	62800	One of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people
62800	64320	are thinking and feeling.
64320	68080	And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel
68080	71240	isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
71240	76040	Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get.
76040	81160	We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing
81160	82680	about other people.
82680	85720	Now the question is, how could we ask them?
85720	90720	Babies after all can't talk, and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what he thinks,
90720	95280	what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things
95280	96480	like that.
96480	99280	So how could we actually ask them the question?
99280	103440	Well, it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
103440	107720	What we did, Betty Repicoli, who is one of my students and I, was actually to give the
107720	114960	baby's two bowls of food, one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
114960	123280	Now all of the babies, even in Berkeley, like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
123280	128480	But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl, and she would
128480	130080	act as if she liked it or she didn't.
130080	134320	So half the time, she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli,
134320	137120	just like the baby and any other sane person.
137120	142560	But half the time, what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go, hmm,
142560	143560	broccoli.
143560	147080	I tasted the broccoli.
147080	152800	And then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she'd go, oh, yuck, crackers.
152800	154680	I tasted the crackers.
154680	156440	Oh, yuck.
156440	160400	So she acted as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
160400	163200	We did this with 15 and 18 month old babies.
163200	167560	And then she would simply put her hand out and say, can you give me some?
167560	169720	So the question is, what would the baby give her?
169720	172120	What they liked or what she liked?
172120	177200	And the remarkable thing was that 18 month old babies just barely walking and talking
177200	181480	would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers, but they would give her the broccoli
181480	183480	if she liked the broccoli.
183480	188120	On the other hand, 15 month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she
188120	191960	liked the broccoli, like they couldn't figure this out.
191960	195520	But then after they stared for a long time, they would just give her the crackers, what
195520	198240	they thought everybody must like.
198240	200640	So there are two really remarkable things about this.
200640	205600	The first one is that these little 18 month old babies have already discovered this really
205600	209720	profound fact about human nature, that we don't always want the same thing.
209720	213240	And once more, they thought that they should actually do things to help other people get
213240	215240	what they wanted.
215240	220360	Even more remarkably though, the fact that the 15 month olds didn't do this suggests
220360	225920	that these 18 month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three
225920	228680	months from the time they were 15 months old.
228680	233160	So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought.
233160	237560	And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that's actually
237560	239400	demonstrated this.
239400	244760	The question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible
244760	247240	for them to learn so much in such a short time?
247240	252160	I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially, they seem pretty useless.
252160	256040	And actually, in many ways, they're worse than useless because we have to put so much
256040	259200	time and energy into just keeping them alive.
259200	264840	But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time
264840	270120	taking care of useless babies, it turns out that there's actually an answer.
270120	275760	If we look across many, many different species of animals, not just us primates but also
275760	282240	including other mammals, birds, even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats, it turns out
282240	289720	that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their
289720	293800	brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are.
293800	297560	And sort of the poster birds for this idea are the birds up there.
297560	300640	On one side is a new caledonian crow.
300640	306040	And crows and other corvids, ravens, rocks and so forth are incredibly smart birds.
306040	309160	They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
309160	314400	And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food.
314400	317920	On the other hand, we have our friend the domestic chicken.
317920	322520	And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps.
322520	327400	So they're very, very good at pecking for grain, and they're not much good at doing
327400	328400	anything else.
328400	333720	Well, it turns out that the babies, the new caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
333720	339120	They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two
339120	343160	years, which is a really long time in the life of a bird, whereas the chickens are actually
343160	345920	mature within a couple of months.
345920	351600	So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens
351600	353400	end up in the soup pot.
353400	358840	There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and
358840	359840	learning.
359840	363520	Well, what kind of explanation could we have for this?
363520	368960	Well, some animals, like the chicken, seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one
368960	370480	thing very well.
370480	375280	So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment.
375280	379360	Other creatures, like the crows, aren't very good at doing anything in particular, but
379360	383000	they're extremely good at learning about lots of different environments.
383000	388200	And of course, we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution, like the crows.
388200	392440	We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal.
392440	393440	We're smarter.
393440	394440	We're more flexible.
394440	395680	We can learn more.
395680	397800	We survive in more different environments.
397800	401160	We've migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
401160	405760	And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any
405760	406760	other species.
406760	415320	My son is 23, and at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those
415320	417320	little open mouths.
417320	418480	All right.
418480	420560	Why would we see this correlation?
420560	426040	Well, an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful
426040	430320	great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.
430320	435240	And that one big disadvantage is that until you actually do all that learning, you're
435240	436640	going to be helpless.
436640	442640	So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself, a slingshot
442640	446280	or maybe a spear might work, which would actually be better.
446280	449720	You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up.
449720	454080	And the way that evolution seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of
454080	455080	labor.
455080	458760	So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected, we don't
458760	459760	have to do anything.
459760	461400	All we have to do is learn.
461400	464600	And then as adults, we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies
464600	469000	and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
469000	473360	So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and
473360	476120	development division of the human species.
476120	480280	So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good
480280	483160	ideas and we're production and marketing.
483160	487720	We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them
487720	489000	to use.
489000	492560	Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking about babies and children as being
492560	497160	like defective grown-ups, we should think about them as being a different developmental
497160	502960	stage of the same species, kind of like caterpillars and butterflies, except that they're actually
502960	507040	the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring and we're
507040	512080	the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow grown-up adult path.
512080	516640	If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would
516640	521600	say children are for learning, that's what they're for, we might expect that they would
521600	524320	have really powerful learning mechanisms.
524320	529840	And in fact, the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the
529840	530940	planet.
531380	535460	Real computers are actually getting to be a lot better and there's been a revolution
535460	541100	in our understanding of machine learning recently and it all depends on the ideas of this guy,
541100	546340	the Reverend Thomas Bayes who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
546340	552860	And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way, using probability theory,
552860	557180	to characterize, to describe the way that scientists find out about the world.
557180	562020	So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with,
562020	566540	they go out and test it against the evidence, the evidence makes them change that hypothesis,
566540	569740	then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth.
569740	573820	And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics
573820	577660	is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now.
577660	583060	And some 10 years ago, I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
583060	587820	So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes, I think it actually
587820	589020	looks something like this.
589020	590780	This is Reverend Bayes' notebook.
590780	594740	So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional
594740	598300	probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works.
598300	602980	All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate because
602980	607260	after all, if you ask even grown-ups about statistics, they look extremely stupid.
607260	610340	How could it be that children are doing statistics?
610340	614220	So to test this, we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector.
614220	618660	This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others.
618660	623700	And using this very simple machine, my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing
623700	627020	just how good babies are at learning about the world.
627020	631140	Let me mention just one that we did with Tamara Kushner, my student.
631140	635660	If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way
635660	639700	to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
639700	645500	But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way, because if you wave a block
645500	649900	over the top of the detector, something you would never think of to begin with, the detector
649900	654580	will actually activate two out of three times, whereas if you do the likely thing, put the
654580	659780	block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.
659780	663620	So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence.
663620	667860	It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
667860	668980	So we did just this.
668980	673140	We gave four-year-olds this pattern of evidence, and we just asked them to make it go.
673140	678980	And sure enough, the four-year-olds use the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector.
678980	681900	Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.
681900	684220	The first one is, again, remember, these are four-year-olds.
684220	686900	They're just learning how to count.
686900	691420	But unconsciously, they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them
691420	693940	a conditional probability measure.
693940	699140	And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea, get
699140	703620	to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with.
703620	707940	And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies, we've shown that four-year-olds
707940	713140	are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them
713140	715500	exactly the same task.
715500	720020	So in these circumstances, the children are using statistics to find out about the world.
720020	723540	But after all, scientists also do experiments.
723540	726380	And we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
726380	730900	When children do experiments, we call it getting into everything or else playing.
730900	736140	And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown that this playing
736140	739460	around is really a kind of experimental research program.
739460	741580	Here's one from Christine Laguerre's lab.
741580	747100	What Christine did was use our Blicket Detectors, and what she did was show children that yellow
747100	749380	ones made it go and red ones didn't.
749380	753020	And then she showed them an anomaly.
753020	757300	And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space
757300	762300	of two minutes.
762300	775300	Okay, so just his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
775300	802820	Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
802820	809820	Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair, right?
809820	818140	Oh, it's because this needs to be like this, and this needs to be like this.
818140	824620	Okay, hypothesis two.
824620	830740	That's right.
830740	831860	Now this is his next idea.
831860	838460	He tells the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out over onto the other location.
838460	841460	Not working on it.
841460	849420	Oh, because the light goes only to here, not here.
849420	857300	Oh, the bottom of this box has electricity in here, but this doesn't have electricity.
857300	859460	Okay, that's the fourth hypothesis.
860460	880220	Now that is a particularly, that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy, but what
880220	882580	Christine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
882580	885980	If you look at the way children play when you ask them to explain something, what they
885980	889380	really do is do a series of experiments.
889380	891980	This is actually pretty typical of four-year-olds.
891980	895300	Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
895300	900340	What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in
900340	901340	two minutes?
901340	905220	Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers, a lot of them had said
905220	909420	that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all.
909420	910940	And I think just the opposite is true.
910940	914940	I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
914940	918020	Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
918020	921900	And adult attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight.
921900	925980	So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important, we should
925980	930060	pay attention to it, our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes
930060	935060	extremely bright and vivid, and everything else sort of goes dark.
935060	938300	And we even know something about the brain, the way the brain does this.
938300	942460	So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive
942460	947860	part of our brain, sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,
947860	952780	more plastic, better at learning, and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains.
952780	957060	So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
957060	960700	If we look at babies and young children, we see something very different.
960700	964980	I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than
964980	966940	a spotlight of consciousness.
966940	973300	So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing.
973300	977140	But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources
977180	978260	it wants.
978260	982420	And if you actually look in their brains, you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters
982420	986660	that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity, and the inhibitory parts haven't
986660	988180	come on yet.
988180	992820	So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention, what we really
992820	995500	mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
995500	999580	So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and
999580	1001940	just looking at the thing that's important.
1001940	1006900	That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness that we might expect from those
1006980	1009340	butterflies who are designed to learn.
1009340	1013780	Well, if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness
1013780	1018620	as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation
1018620	1022540	that we've never been in before, when we fall in love with someone new or when we're in
1022540	1024740	a new city for the first time.
1024740	1029660	And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands so that those three days
1029660	1034420	in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being
1034460	1039140	a walking, talking, faculty meeting, attending zombie back home.
1039140	1043220	And by the way, that coffee, that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs, actually
1043220	1046540	mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters.
1046540	1049060	So what's it like to be a baby?
1049060	1055260	It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double-expressives,
1055260	1056260	which is...
1056260	1062460	That's a fantastic way to be, but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three
1062500	1066180	o'clock in the morning.
1066180	1068660	Now it's good to be a grown-up.
1068660	1071340	I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
1071340	1072340	It's good to be a grown-up.
1072340	1076180	We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves, and it makes
