1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,300
I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,680
Now it's generally understood that questions of morality, questions of good and evil and

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion.

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,320
we ought to value.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,720
And consequently, most people, I think most people probably hear, think that science will

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,840
never answer the most important questions in human life.

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,680
Questions like what is worth living for, what is worth dying for, what constitutes a good

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
life.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,720
So I'm going to argue that this is an illusion, that the separation between science and human

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,960
values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,000
Now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,760
because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,320
It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,280
the world ought to be.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,800
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Values are a certain kind of fact.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,880
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,680
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,480
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,000
primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
This is something we could be right or wrong about.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,720
If we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,160
of experience, well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,160
There is no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,240
that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
changes.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,840
relate to conditions after death, either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,280
of suffering in hell, you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,960
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which of course

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,920
may or may not be true.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings, we know that

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,680
there's a continuum of such facts.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,240
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,080
does go wrong, where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,280
basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,120
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,360
more idyllic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,360
And we know, we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,720
It would, would adding cholera to the water be a good idea or probably not.

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,240
It would be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,160
to them, they immediately blame their neighbors.

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Probably not.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,520
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,200
these truths, and morality relates to these truths.

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,200
So in talking about values, we are talking about facts.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels, from the level

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,400
of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
But if we're going to talk about human well-being, we are of necessity talking about the human

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,000
brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,720
realized in the brain, whatever happens after death.

56
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality,

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,440
his rather unfortunate personality, is the product of his brain.

58
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,720
The contributions of culture, if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
our brains and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind,

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,160
neuroscience, psychology, etc.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,880
So what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts, to facts about the conscious experience

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,920
of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
of these beings.

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,000
And I think of this as a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,160
differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,600
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely

68
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
access, that few people access and these await our discovery.

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured

71
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
but other minds possibly could access them.

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Now let me be clear about what I'm not saying.

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,480
answers to every conceivable moral question.

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,680
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,520
you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,120
whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
find them.

80
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,800
And just admitting this, just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question

81
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,200
of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and it will change

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,280
our expectations of human cooperation in the future.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,880
And for instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
is legal.

85
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,080
bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and hundreds of thousands of children

87
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,160
incidentally are subjected to this every year.

88
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,080
The locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you.

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,840
We're not talking about Connecticut.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,640
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.

91
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,040
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod unless we spoil the

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
child.

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,600
This is in Proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23.

94
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,400
But we can ask the obvious question, is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject

95
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,920
children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy

96
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,400
emotional development and good behavior?

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:39,160
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters?

98
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,440
Now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
perpetually open to be reconstrued.

100
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,000
So then how, therefore, can there be an objective notion of well-being?

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,560
Well, consider by analogy the concept of physical health.

102
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,160
The concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector.

103
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,240
It has changed over the years.

104
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,480
When this statue was carved, the average life expectancy was probably 30.

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,140
It's now around 80 in the developed world.

106
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,520
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,840
to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.

108
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,480
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,360
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does

110
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,040
not make it vacuous.

111
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,920
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential

112
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,440
as any we make in science.

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,760
Now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,880
There may be equivalent ways to thrive.

115
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,000
There may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
Now why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality?

117
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
Well, think of how we talk about food.

118
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.

119
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,480
There's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.

120
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,200
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.

121
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,720
The fact that there are many right answers to the question, what is food, does not tempt

122
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,600
us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,560
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of

124
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
no exceptions.

125
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,960
So for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie.

126
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,040
And if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth.

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Why would we think this?

128
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,240
Consider by analogy the game chess.

129
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Now if you're going to play good chess, a principle like don't lose your queen is very

130
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,120
good to follow.

131
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
But it clearly admits of exceptions.

132
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,480
There are moments where losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do.

133
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,680
There are moments where it's the only good thing you can do.

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,200
And yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,920
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.

136
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,640
Now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.

137
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,520
Consider the great problem of women's bodies.

138
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
What to do about them?

139
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,200
Well this is one thing you can do about them.

140
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,160
You can cover them up.

141
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,320
Now it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that well we

142
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,180
might not like this.

143
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,200
We might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto.

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their

145
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
wives and daughters to live in cloth bags?

146
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,720
Who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,960
throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in

148
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,120
this way?

149
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,000
Who are we not to say this?

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,040
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be

151
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
non-judgmental about a practice like this?

152
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil.

153
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
And women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.

154
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,800
But what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped, her father's

155
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,680
first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame.

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,440
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute.

157
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her.

158
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:02,320
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?

159
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,160
Now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,200
For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
world.

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,720
Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong

163
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,640
with these images.

164
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,880
If we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, is this the perfect expression of psychological

165
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,800
balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?

166
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,560
I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?

167
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Probably not.

168
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,400
Okay, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:58,280
represents a place of better balance.

170
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Perhaps there are many such places.

171
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,200
Again, given other changes in human culture, there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

172
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,040
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.

173
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,320
Now, the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree

174
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,240
with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious

175
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,960
demagogues of one form or another.

176
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,720
And of course, they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,680
these answers from a voice in a whirlwind.

178
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,000
Not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal

179
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
well-being.

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,280
In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions

181
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:49,160
has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.

182
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,800
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide

183
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,200
or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

184
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
But the demagogues are right about one thing.

185
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,120
We need a universal conception of human values.

186
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,240
Now what stands in the way of this?

187
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,760
Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality, especially

188
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,720
secular academic scientist types.

189
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,000
When talking about morality, we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
other area of our lives.

191
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,440
So for instance, the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks

192
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,000
that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,640
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy.

194
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,080
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.

195
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,120
We appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time.

196
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,040
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, well, there's nothing for the Dalai

197
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,560
Lama to be really right about, really right about, or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong

198
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:05,560
about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science.

199
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
He likes chocolate.

200
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
He likes vanilla.

201
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,280
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the

202
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
other.

203
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,960
Now notice that we don't do this in science.

204
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,560
On the left, you have Edward Whitten.

205
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,160
He's a string theorist.

206
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,640
If you ask the smartest physicists around, who's the smartest physicist around?

207
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,760
In my experience, half of them will say Ed Whitten.

208
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,840
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.

209
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,640
What would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus?

210
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,960
It doesn't resonate with me.

211
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,160
It's not how I choose to view the universe at the smallest scale.

212
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm not a fan.

213
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,600
Nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist.

214
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,120
I don't understand string theory.

215
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.

216
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,640
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.

217
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
This is just the point.

218
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Whenever we are talking about facts, certain opinions must be excluded.

219
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.

220
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,040
That is what it is for knowledge to count.

221
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,720
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral

222
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,920
expertise or moral talent or moral genius even?

223
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,120
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count?

224
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,000
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,280
worth considering?

226
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,360
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering?

227
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,560
No.

228
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,800
How is there ignorance?

229
00:16:48,800 --> 00:17:00,000
How is there ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?

230
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,480
This I think is what the world needs now.

231
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,680
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions

232
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:16,160
of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts.

233
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,040
It is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things,

234
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,560
which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead

235
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,320
to needless human suffering.

236
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,360
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.

237
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,600
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they

238
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,360
will one day mean nothing.

239
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,320
We live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be

240
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
uninvented.

241
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,560
It will always be easier to break things than to fix them.

242
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:03,280
It seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast

243
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,800
differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences

244
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,560
in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,720
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

246
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,160
To do that we have to admit that these questions have answers.

247
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Thank you very much.

248
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:57,360
So, some combustible material there.

249
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Here in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this, they will

250
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,800
be doing the screaming with rage thing as well.

251
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,720
Language seems to be really important here.

252
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,440
When you talk about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

253
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,280
I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would

254
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
say something else.

255
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,920
They would say, no, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that

256
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,880
and it's a result of the fact that, and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological

257
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,920
view, that male lust is not to be trusted.

258
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing a cultural imperialist?

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,880
I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking, but the question is what

260
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:58,080
is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and you're guaranteed to be treated

261
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
in a certain way if you don't veil yourself.

262
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:08,200
If anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces,

263
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,360
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest

264
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,760
about the constraints that these women are placed under.

265
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,360
I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's

266
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,440
120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.

267
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,840
A lot of people want to believe in this, this concept of moral progress, but can you reconcile

268
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
that?

269
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,320
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become

270
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,040
one-dimensional where we all have to think the same.

271
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,160
Paint your picture of what, you know, rolling the clock 50 years forward or 100 years forward,

272
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,520
how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness?

273
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,040
Well, I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the

274
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,640
level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to

275
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,680
understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.

276
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,200
So we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're

277
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,600
going to understand the factors that encourage it, whether they're genetic, whether they're

278
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,560
how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems.

279
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,600
And insofar as we begin to shine light on that, we are inevitably going to converge

280
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,040
on that fact space.

281
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,600
So everything is not going to be up for grabs, it's not going to be like, you know, veiling

282
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:43,160
my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated

283
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,960
in the context of men who do desire women.

284
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,760
So I mean, I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that vailing, compulsory veiling is

285
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,600
a bad idea, but at a certain point, we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone

286
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,000
involved and actually interrogate them.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,480
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?

288
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,680
And I think they're clearly right answers to that.

289
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,120
And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive

290
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,160
current judgment on some of these issues?

291
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Well, yeah, Modulo, one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly

292
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,240
delusional belief system so that you can say like, because I knew my gay son was going

293
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,840
to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate

294
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
thing I can do.

295
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,960
If you get all those parts aligned, yes, I think you could probably be feeling the emotion

296
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,040
of love.

297
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,440
But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context, you know, and it's all

298
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
of us in this together.

299
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,240
It's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.

300
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,680
Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.

301
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,320
We don't have that maybe another time.

302
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Thank you for coming today.

303
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Really an honor.

304
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Thank you.

305
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Thank you.

306
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Thank you.

307
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Bye.

308
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Bye.

309
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Bye.

310
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Bye.

311
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Bye.

312
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Bye.

313
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Bye.

314
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Bye.

315
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Bye.

316
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Bye.

317
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Bye.

318
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Bye.

319
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Bye.

320
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Bye.

321
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Bye.

322
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Bye.

323
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Bye.

324
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Bye.

325
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Bye.

326
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Bye.

327
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Bye.

328
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Bye.

329
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Bye.

330
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Bye.

331
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Bye.

332
