00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
How many of you are creatives, designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
or maybe you just have a really big imagination?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Show of hands?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Hey, that's most of you.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
I have some news for us creatives.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Over the course of the next 20 years,

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
more will change around the way we do our work

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
than has happened in the last 2,000.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
In fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Now, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
The hunter-gatherer age lasted several million years.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
And then the agricultural age lasted several thousand years.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
The industrial age lasted a couple of centuries,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
and now the information age has lasted just a few decades.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
And now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Welcome to the augmented age.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
In this new era, your natural human capabilities

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
are going to be augmented by computational systems

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
that help you think, robotic systems that help you make,

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
and digital nervous system that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
I would actually argue that we're already augmented.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Imagine you're at a party and somebody asks you a question

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
that you don't know the answer to.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
If you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
But this is just a primitive beginning.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
In fact, for the last three and a half million years,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
the tools that we've had have been completely passive.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
we've always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools,

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
like manually, like literally using our hands, even with computers.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But I'm more like Scotty in Star Trek.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I want to have a conversation with a computer.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I want to say, computer, let's design a car.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And the computer shows me a car.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And I say, no, more fast-looking and less German.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
And bang, the computer shows me an option.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Now, that conversation might be a little ways off.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It's actually probably less than many of us think.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
But right now, we're working on it.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Tools are making this leap from being passive

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
to being generative.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
to come up with new designs all by themselves.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
All it needs are your goals and your constraints.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I'll give you an example.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
all you would need to do is tell it something like it has four propellers,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
you want it to be as lightweight as possible,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
And then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
Every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
millions of them, takes big computers to do this.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
But it comes back to us with designs that we, by ourselves,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
never could have imagined.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
And the computer is coming up with this stuff all by itself.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
No one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And by the way, it's no accident that the drone body looks

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
It's because the algorithms are designed to work the same way that evolution does.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
And what's exciting is we're starting to see this technology out in the real world.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
We've been working with Airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, it's a ways out still.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
But just recently, we used a generative design AI

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
to come up with this.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It's stronger than the original, yet half the weight.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
And it'll be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So computers can now generate.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
They can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But they're not intuitive.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
They still have to start from scratch every single time.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
And that's because they never learn, unlike Maggie.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Maggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
What do I mean by that?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
If her owner picks up that leash, Maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
that it's time to go for a walk.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
And how did she learn?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And Maggie did three things.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
She had to pay attention.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
She had to remember what happened.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
And she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Interestingly, that's exactly what computer scientists

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
have been trying to get AIs to do for the last 60 or so years.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
Back in 1952, they built this computer that could play tic-tac-toe.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Big deal.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
Then 45 years later, in 1997, deep blue beats Kasparov at chess.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
In 2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
In fact, rather than working from predefined recipes,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
And then, what, a couple of weeks ago,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Deep Mind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
which is the most difficult game that we have.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
In fact, in Go, there are more possible moves

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
than there are atoms in the universe.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
So in order to win,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And in fact, at some points,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And things are moving really fast.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, consider, in the space of a human lifetime,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
computers have gone from a child's game

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
to what's recognized as a pinnacle of strategic thought.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
What's basically happening

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
is computers are going from being like Spock

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
to being a lot more like Kirk.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
All right?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
From pure logic to intuition.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Would you cross this bridge?

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Most of you are saying, oh, hell no.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And you arrived at that decision in a split second.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You just sort of knew that that bridge was unsafe.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
that our deep learning systems are starting to develop right now.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Very soon, you'll literally be able to show something

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
that you've made, you've designed to a computer,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
and it'll look at it and say,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
sorry, homie, that'll never work.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You have to try again.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Or your next flavor of ice cream.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Or much more importantly,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
you could work with a computer to solve a problem

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
that we've never faced before.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
For instance, climate change.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We're not doing a very good job on our own.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
We could certainly use all the help we can get.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
That's what I'm talking about.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Technology amplifying our cognitive abilities

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
so we can imagine and design things

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
that we were simply out of our reach

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
as plain old, unaugmented humans.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
So what about making all of this crazy new stuff

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
that we're going to invent and design?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I think the era of human augmentation

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
is just as much about the physical world

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
as it is about the virtual intellectual realm.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So how will technology augment us?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
In the physical world, robotic systems.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Okay, there's certainly a fear

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
that robots are going to take jobs away from humans,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and that is true in certain sectors.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But I'm much more interested in this idea

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
that humans and robots working together

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
are going to augment each other

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and start to inhabit a new space.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This is our Applied Research Lab in San Francisco,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
specifically human-robot collaboration.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And as an experiment,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
we set it up to help a person working in construction

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
doing repetitive tasks.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Tasks like cutting out holes for outlets

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
or light switches in drywall.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
So Bishop's human partner

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
can tell him what to do in plain English

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
and with simple gestures, kind of like talking to a dog,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
and then Bishop executes on those instructions

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
with perfect precision.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
We're using the human for what the human is good at, right?

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
Awareness, perception, and decision-making,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
and we're using the robot for what it's good at,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
precision and repetitiveness.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Here's another cool project that Bishop worked on.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
The goal of this project, which we called The Hive,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
was to prototype the experience of humans, computers,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and robots all working together

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
to solve a highly complex design problem.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
The humans acted as labor.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
They cruised around the construction site.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
They manipulated the bamboo, which, by the way,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
because it's a non-isomorphic material,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
is super hard for robots to deal with.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
But then the robots did this fiber-winding,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
which was almost impossible for a human to do.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And then we had an AI that was controlling everything.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
It was telling the humans what to do,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
telling the robots what to do,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
and keeping track of thousands of individual components.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
What's interesting is building this pavilion

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
was simply not possible without human, robot,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
and AI augmenting each other.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Okay, I'll share one more project.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
This one's a little bit crazy.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Larmann

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and his team at MX3D

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
to generatively design and robotically print

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
So Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
as we speak, in Amsterdam.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And when they're done, we're going to hit Go,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and then they're going to keep printing

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
without human intervention until the bridge is finished.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So as computers are going to augment our ability

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
to imagine and design new stuff,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
robotic systems are going to help us build and make

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
things that we've never been able to make before.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
But what about our ability to sense and control these things?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
What about a nervous system for the things that we make?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Our nervous system, the human nervous system,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
tells us everything that's going on around us.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
But the nervous system of the things we make

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
is rudimentary at best.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway in Morrison.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
A building doesn't tell its designers

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
whether or not the people inside like being there.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And the toy manufacturer doesn't know

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
if a toy is actually being played with,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
how and where, and whether or not it's any fun.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Look, I'm sure that the designers

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie when they designed her.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Right?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
But what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
If the designers had known what was really happening

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
in the real world with their designs,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
the road, the building, and Barbie,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
they could have used that knowledge

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
to create an experience that was better for the user.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Now, what's missing is a nervous system

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
connecting us to all of the things that we design, make, and use.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
from the things you create in the real world?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
With all of the stuff we make,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
in fact, last year, about $2 trillion,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
convincing people to buy the things that we've made.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
But if you had this connection to the things that you design and create,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
after they're out in the real world,

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
after they've been sold or launched or whatever,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
we could actually change that

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
and go from making people want our stuff

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
to just making stuff that people want in the first place.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
The good news is we're working on digital nervous systems

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
that connect us to the things we design.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
We're working on one project with a couple of guys

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers and their team,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and one of the things these guys do is build insane cars

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
that do absolutely insane things.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
These guys are crazy in the best way.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And what we're doing with them

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
is taking a traditional race car chassis

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
and giving it a nervous system.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and then we put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And the car's nervous system

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
captured everything that was happening to the car.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
We captured four billion data points,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
all of the forces that it was subjected to.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
And then we did something crazy.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
We took all of that data and plugged it into a generative design AI

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
that we call Dreamcatcher.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
So what do you get when you give a design tool and nervous system

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
You get this.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
This is something that a human could never have designed,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
except a human did design this.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
But it was a human that was augmented by a generative design AI,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
a digital nervous system,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
and robots that can actually fabricate something like this.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
So if this is the future, the augmented age,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
and we're going to be augmented cognitively,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
physically, and perceptually,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
what will that look like?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
What are this wonderland going to be like?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I think we're going to see a world

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
where we're moving from things that are fabricated

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
to things that are farmed,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
where we're moving from things that are constructed

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
to that which is grown.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
We're going to move from being isolated to being connected,

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
and we'll move away from extraction to embrace aggregation.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
to valuing autonomy.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
our world is going to change dramatically.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
We're going to have a world with more variety,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
more connectedness, more dynamism,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
more complexity, more adaptability,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and, of course, more beauty.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
The shape of things to come

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
will be unlike anything we've ever seen before.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Why? Because what we'll be shaping those things

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
is this new partnership

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
between technology, nature, and humanity.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
That, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Thank you all so much.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Thank you.
