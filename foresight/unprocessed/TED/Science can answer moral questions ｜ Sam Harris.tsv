0	22300	I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.
22300	27680	Now it's generally understood that questions of morality, questions of good and evil and
27680	33040	right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
33040	37280	It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what
37280	39320	we ought to value.
39320	43720	And consequently, most people, I think most people probably hear, think that science will
43720	47840	never answer the most important questions in human life.
47840	52680	Questions like what is worth living for, what is worth dying for, what constitutes a good
52680	53680	life.
54120	58720	So I'm going to argue that this is an illusion, that the separation between science and human
58720	64960	values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history.
64960	70000	Now it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values
70000	76760	because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
76760	82320	It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how
82360	85280	the world ought to be.
85280	88800	But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
88800	92000	Values are a certain kind of fact.
92000	95880	They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
95880	99680	Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
99680	101520	Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?
101520	105480	It's because we don't think rocks can suffer and if we're more concerned about our fellow
105480	111000	primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed
111040	114640	to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.
114640	118840	Now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim.
118840	121000	This is something we could be right or wrong about.
121000	125720	If we've misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities
125720	131160	of experience, well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
131160	139160	There is no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across
139240	145240	that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible
145240	146960	changes.
146960	151520	Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately
151520	156840	relate to conditions after death, either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity
156840	162280	of suffering in hell, you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
162280	167960	And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which of course
168000	170920	may or may not be true.
170920	175920	Now to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life for human beings, we know that
175920	178680	there's a continuum of such facts.
178680	183240	We know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong
183240	189080	does go wrong, where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the
189080	193280	basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately.
193280	198120	And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit
198120	203360	more idyllic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
203360	210360	And we know, we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space.
210720	217720	It would, would adding cholera to the water be a good idea or probably not.
218720	223240	It would be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happen
223280	227160	to them, they immediately blame their neighbors.
227160	228000	Probably not.
228000	233520	There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand
233520	237200	these truths, and morality relates to these truths.
237200	242200	So in talking about values, we are talking about facts.
242200	245800	Now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels, from the level
245800	250400	of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements.
250400	255040	But if we're going to talk about human well-being, we are of necessity talking about the human
255040	259000	brain because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is
259000	263720	realized in the brain, whatever happens after death.
263720	270720	Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality,
271760	276440	his rather unfortunate personality, is the product of his brain.
277440	282720	The contributions of culture, if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing
282720	288400	our brains and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is and how human beings flourish
288400	293280	can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind,
293280	297160	neuroscience, psychology, etc.
297160	302880	So what I'm arguing is that values reduce to facts, to facts about the conscious experience
302920	309920	of conscious beings and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience
310840	312160	of these beings.
312160	316000	And I think of this as a kind of moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to
316000	321160	differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective.
321160	325600	And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely
325600	329840	access, that few people access and these await our discovery.
329840	333680	Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual.
333680	338160	Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured
338160	342160	but other minds possibly could access them.
342160	343680	Now let me be clear about what I'm not saying.
343680	350520	I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific
350520	353480	answers to every conceivable moral question.
353480	357680	I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether
357680	363520	you should have a second child or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities or
363520	369120	whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
369120	373520	But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can
373520	374520	find them.
374520	378800	And just admitting this, just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question
378800	383200	of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and it will change
383200	388280	our expectations of human cooperation in the future.
388280	394880	And for instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom
394880	395880	is legal.
395880	402080	Where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large
402080	407080	bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin and hundreds of thousands of children
407080	410160	incidentally are subjected to this every year.
410160	415080	The locations of these enlightened districts I think will fail to surprise you.
415080	417840	We're not talking about Connecticut.
417840	421640	And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
421640	426040	The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod unless we spoil the
426040	427040	child.
427040	432600	This is in Proverbs 13 and 20 and I believe 23.
432600	439400	But we can ask the obvious question, is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject
439400	445920	children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy
445920	450400	emotional development and good behavior?
450400	459160	Is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters?
459160	464440	Now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined and seemingly
464440	466440	perpetually open to be reconstrued.
466440	471000	So then how, therefore, can there be an objective notion of well-being?
471000	475560	Well, consider by analogy the concept of physical health.
475560	479160	The concept of physical health is undefined as we just heard from Michael Spector.
479160	481240	It has changed over the years.
481240	485480	When this statue was carved, the average life expectancy was probably 30.
485480	489140	It's now around 80 in the developed world.
489140	493520	There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able
493520	498840	to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
498840	504480	People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
504480	510360	Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does
510360	513040	not make it vacuous.
513040	518920	The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential
518920	523440	as any we make in science.
523440	526760	Now another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
526760	528880	There may be equivalent ways to thrive.
528880	534000	There may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.
534000	538560	Now why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality?
538560	542640	Well, think of how we talk about food.
542640	547680	I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat.
547680	551480	There's clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food.
551480	556200	But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison.
556200	562720	The fact that there are many right answers to the question, what is food, does not tempt
562720	569600	us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
569600	575560	Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of
575560	576560	no exceptions.
576560	580960	So for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie.
580960	586040	And if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth.
586040	587920	Why would we think this?
587920	590240	Consider by analogy the game chess.
590240	595240	Now if you're going to play good chess, a principle like don't lose your queen is very
595240	597120	good to follow.
597120	598800	But it clearly admits of exceptions.
598800	601480	There are moments where losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do.
601480	605680	There are moments where it's the only good thing you can do.
605680	609200	And yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
609200	614920	The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.
614920	622640	Now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
622640	625520	Consider the great problem of women's bodies.
625520	626520	What to do about them?
626520	629200	Well this is one thing you can do about them.
629200	631160	You can cover them up.
631160	635320	Now it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that well we
635320	637180	might not like this.
637180	642200	We might think of this as wrong in Boston or Palo Alto.
642200	648320	Who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their
648320	651920	wives and daughters to live in cloth bags?
651920	655720	Who are we to say even that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or
655720	659960	throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in
659960	662120	this way?
662120	665000	Who are we not to say this?
665000	671040	Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be
671040	674720	non-judgmental about a practice like this?
674720	678480	I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil.
678480	681200	And women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.
681200	688800	But what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped, her father's
688800	696680	first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame.
696680	702440	Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute.
702440	713400	Your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her.
713400	722320	What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?
722320	729160	Now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society.
729160	733200	For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized
733200	734200	world.
734200	738720	Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong
738720	742640	with these images.
743640	750880	If we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, is this the perfect expression of psychological
750880	754800	balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?
754800	760560	I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children?
760560	761560	Probably not.
761560	766400	Okay, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that
766400	778280	represents a place of better balance.
778280	779720	Perhaps there are many such places.
779720	785200	Again, given other changes in human culture, there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
785200	790040	But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.
790040	795320	Now, the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree
795360	800240	with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious
800240	802960	demagogues of one form or another.
802960	805720	And of course, they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got
805720	809680	these answers from a voice in a whirlwind.
809680	814000	Not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal
814000	815000	well-being.
815000	821280	In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions
821280	829160	has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering.
829160	834800	This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide
834800	841200	or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
841200	843200	But the demagogues are right about one thing.
843200	848120	We need a universal conception of human values.
848120	849240	Now what stands in the way of this?
849240	853760	Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality, especially
853760	857720	secular academic scientist types.
857720	862000	When talking about morality, we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any
862000	863080	other area of our lives.
863080	868440	So for instance, the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks
868440	873000	that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness.
873000	874640	On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy.
874640	879080	Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.
879360	886120	We appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time.
886120	892040	Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, well, there's nothing for the Dalai
892040	896560	Lama to be really right about, really right about, or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong
896560	905560	about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science.
905560	906800	He likes chocolate.
906800	907800	He likes vanilla.
907800	912280	There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the
912280	913280	other.
913280	916960	Now notice that we don't do this in science.
916960	918560	On the left, you have Edward Whitten.
918560	921160	He's a string theorist.
921160	925640	If you ask the smartest physicists around, who's the smartest physicist around?
925640	928760	In my experience, half of them will say Ed Whitten.
928760	934840	The other half will tell you they don't like the question.
935600	940640	What would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus?
940640	941960	It doesn't resonate with me.
941960	945160	It's not how I choose to view the universe at the smallest scale.
945160	951000	I'm not a fan.
951000	952600	Nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist.
952600	954120	I don't understand string theory.
954120	959040	I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
959040	963640	I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
963640	964640	This is just the point.
964880	970160	Whenever we are talking about facts, certain opinions must be excluded.
970160	973160	That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
973160	976040	That is what it is for knowledge to count.
976040	980720	How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral
980720	985920	expertise or moral talent or moral genius even?
985920	990120	How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count?
990120	995000	How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects
995000	997280	worth considering?
997280	1002360	Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering?
1002360	1005560	No.
1005560	1008800	How is there ignorance?
1008800	1020000	How is there ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?
1020480	1023480	This I think is what the world needs now.
1023480	1029680	It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions
1029680	1036160	of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts.
1036160	1044040	It is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things,
1044040	1048560	which is to say it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead
1048560	1051320	to needless human suffering.
1051320	1056360	Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
1056360	1061600	We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they
1061600	1064360	will one day mean nothing.
1064360	1068320	We live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be
1068320	1069320	uninvented.
1069320	1073560	It will always be easier to break things than to fix them.
1074200	1083280	It seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast
1083280	1089800	differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences
1089800	1095560	in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
1095560	1102720	We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
1102720	1108160	To do that we have to admit that these questions have answers.
1108160	1109160	Thank you very much.
1109160	1137360	So, some combustible material there.
1137360	1141000	Here in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this, they will
1141000	1146800	be doing the screaming with rage thing as well.
1146800	1148720	Language seems to be really important here.
1148720	1154440	When you talk about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
1154440	1158280	I've lived in the Muslim world spoken with a lot of Muslim women and some of them would
1158280	1159280	say something else.
1159280	1165920	They would say, no, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that
1165920	1170880	and it's a result of the fact that, and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological
1170880	1174920	view, that male lust is not to be trusted.
1174920	1183000	Can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeing a cultural imperialist?
1183000	1189880	I tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking, but the question is what
1189880	1198080	is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and you're guaranteed to be treated
1198080	1200880	in a certain way if you don't veil yourself.
1200880	1208200	If anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their faces,
1208200	1212360	I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest
1212360	1215760	about the constraints that these women are placed under.
1215760	1221360	I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's
1221360	1225440	120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.
1225440	1230840	A lot of people want to believe in this, this concept of moral progress, but can you reconcile
1230840	1231840	that?
1231840	1236320	I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become
1236320	1239040	one-dimensional where we all have to think the same.
1239040	1245160	Paint your picture of what, you know, rolling the clock 50 years forward or 100 years forward,
1245160	1250520	how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness?
1250520	1257040	Well, I think once you admit that we are on path toward understanding our minds at the
1257040	1263640	level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to
1263640	1269680	understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail.
1269680	1274200	So we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're
1274200	1278600	going to understand the factors that encourage it, whether they're genetic, whether they're
1278600	1281560	how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems.
1281560	1286600	And insofar as we begin to shine light on that, we are inevitably going to converge
1286600	1289040	on that fact space.
1289040	1293600	So everything is not going to be up for grabs, it's not going to be like, you know, veiling
1293600	1303160	my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated
1303160	1305960	in the context of men who do desire women.
1305960	1311760	So I mean, I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that vailing, compulsory veiling is
1311760	1316600	a bad idea, but at a certain point, we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone
1316600	1321000	involved and actually interrogate them.
1321000	1326480	Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems?
1326480	1328680	And I think they're clearly right answers to that.
1328680	1334120	And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive
1334120	1336160	current judgment on some of these issues?
1336160	1342800	Well, yeah, Modulo, one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly
1342800	1347240	delusional belief system so that you can say like, because I knew my gay son was going
1347240	1351840	to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate
1351840	1352840	thing I can do.
1352840	1356960	If you get all those parts aligned, yes, I think you could probably be feeling the emotion
1356960	1358040	of love.
1358040	1362440	But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context, you know, and it's all
1362440	1363440	of us in this together.
1363440	1369240	It's not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.
1369240	1373680	Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours.
1373680	1375320	We don't have that maybe another time.
1375320	1376320	Thank you for coming today.
1376320	1377320	Really an honor.
1377320	1378320	Thank you.
