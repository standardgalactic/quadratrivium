1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
I am a capitalist.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,880
And after a 30-year career in capitalism,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,320
spanning three dozen companies,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,780
generating tens of billions of dollars in market value,

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm not just in the top one percent,

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,540
I'm in the top .0% of the world.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,100
So I am a capitalist.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,060
I'm not just in the top one percent,

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,620
I'm in the top point zero,

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,980
in the top 1%, I'm in the top .01% of all earners.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,740
because rich capitalists like me have never been richer.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,340
So the question is, how do we do it?

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,760
How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,820
of the economic pie every year?

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,700
Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago?

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Is it that we're working harder than we once did?

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,980
Are we taller, better looking?

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,380
Sadly, no.

20
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,980
It all comes down to just one thing, economics.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,780
Because here's the dirty secret.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
There was a time in which the economics profession

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,380
worked in the public interest for everyone,

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,260
but in the neoliberal era today,

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,100
they work only for big corporations and billionaires,

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,900
and that is creating a little bit of a problem.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,580
We could choose to enact economic policies

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,540
that raise taxes on the rich,

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,980
regulate powerful corporations,

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,300
or raise wages for workers.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,740
We have done it before,

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,260
but neoliberal economists would warn

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,340
that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake,

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,140
because raising taxes always kills economic growth.

35
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,300
And any form of government regulation is inefficient.

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,420
And raising wages always kills jobs.

37
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,580
Well, as a consequence of that thinking,

38
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,780
over the last 30 years in the USA alone,

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,100
the top 1% has grown $21 trillion richer,

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,540
while the bottom 50% have grown $900 billion poorer,

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
a pattern of widening inequality

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,940
that has largely repeated itself across the world.

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,580
And yet, as middle-class families struggle to get by

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,460
on wages that have not budged in about 40 years,

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,300
neoliberal economists continue to warn

46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,700
that the only reasonable response

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,820
to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization

48
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,660
is even more austerity and globalization.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,500
So what is a society to do?

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,700
Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do.

51
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,460
We need a new economics.

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,980
So economics has been described as the dismal science,

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,140
and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today,

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,100
it isn't a science at all in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics.

55
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,340
In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners

56
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,340
have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong,

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,980
and that today's growing crises of rising inequality

58
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,700
and growing political instability

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,060
are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory.

60
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,260
What we now know is that the economics that made me so rich

61
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,140
isn't just wrong, it's backwards,

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,860
because it turns out it isn't capital that creates economic growth,

63
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
it's people,

64
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,940
and it isn't self-interest that promotes the public good,

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,460
it's reciprocity,

66
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,820
and it isn't competition that produces our prosperity,

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,300
it's cooperation.

68
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,340
What we can now see is that in economics that is neither just nor inclusive

69
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,740
can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation

70
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,420
necessary to enable a modern society to thrive.

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,980
So where did we go wrong?

72
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,420
Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,500
that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,580
are just objectively false.

75
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,420
And so today, first, I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions,

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,060
and then after,

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,380
describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from.

78
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,540
So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is

79
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,980
that the market is an efficient equilibrium system,

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,860
which basically means

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,060
that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up,

82
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,380
another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,940
So, for example, in Seattle, where I live,

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,980
when in 2014 we passed our nation's first $15 minimum wage,

85
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,340
the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium.

86
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,260
If you raise the price of labor, they warned.

87
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,260
Businesses will purchase less of it.

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,820
Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs,

89
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,700
the restaurants will close,

90
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,900
except they didn't.

91
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,060
The unemployment rate fell dramatically.

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,980
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed.

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,940
Why?

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,580
Because there is no equilibrium.

95
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,700
Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them.

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,020
Because, for instance, when restaurant owners

97
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,100
are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough

98
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,140
so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,220
it doesn't shrink the restaurant business,

100
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,580
it grows it, obviously.

101
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,980
Thank you.

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
Thank you.

103
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,860
The second assumption is

104
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,860
that the price of something is always equal to its value,

105
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,460
which basically means that if you earn $50,000 a year

106
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,460
and I earn $50 million a year,

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,540
that's because I produce 1,000 times as much value as you.

108
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,900
Now, it will not surprise you to learn

109
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,620
that this is a very comforting assumption

110
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,980
if you're a CEO paying yourself $50 million a year,

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,540
but you're paying your workers poverty wages.

112
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,700
But please, take it from somebody who's run dozens of businesses.

113
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,100
This is nonsense.

114
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,500
People are not paid what they are worth.

115
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,780
They are paid what they have the power to negotiate.

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,460
And wages falling share of GDP is not

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,140
because workers have become less productive,

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,260
but because employers have become more powerful.

119
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
And...

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,140
APPLAUSE

121
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,620
And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power

122
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,260
between capital and labor doesn't exist,

123
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,980
neoliberal economic theory became essentially

124
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,540
a protection racket for the rich.

125
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious,

126
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,700
is a behavioral model that describes human beings

127
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,260
as something called Homo economicus,

128
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,500
which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish,

129
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,660
perfectly rational, and relentlessly self-maximizing.

130
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,580
But just ask yourselves,

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,420
is it plausible that every single time for your entire life,

132
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,580
when you did something nice for somebody else,

133
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,940
all you were doing was maximizing your own utility?

134
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,300
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade

135
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,740
to defend fellow soldiers,

136
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,540
they're just promoting their narrow self-interest?

137
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,380
If you think that's nuts,

138
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,500
contrary to any reasonable moral intuition,

139
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,300
that's because it is.

140
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,740
And according to the latest science, not true.

141
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,300
But it is this behavioral model,

142
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,580
which is at the cold, cruel heart of neoliberal economics,

143
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,300
and it is as morally corrosive

144
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,820
as it is scientifically wrong,

145
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,900
because if we accept at face value

146
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,780
that humans are fundamentally selfish,

147
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,020
and then we look around the world

148
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,060
at all of the unambiguous prosperity in it,

149
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,900
then it follows logically.

150
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,740
Then it must be true by definition

151
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,580
that billions of individual acts of selfishness

152
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,660
magically transubstantiate into prosperity and the common good.

153
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,580
If we humans are merely selfish maximizers,

154
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,340
then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity.

155
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,740
Under this economic logic, greed is good.

156
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,020
Widening inequality is efficient,

157
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,380
and the only purpose of the corporation

158
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,860
can be to enrich shareholders,

159
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,980
because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth

160
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,860
and harm the economy overall.

161
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,700
And it is this gospel of selfishness

162
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,940
which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics,

163
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,620
a way of thinking which has produced economic policies,

164
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,380
which have enabled me and my rich buddies in the top 1%

165
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,100
to grab virtually all of the benefits of growth over the last 40 years.

166
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:32,700
But if instead we accept the latest empirical research,

167
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,060
real science, which correctly describes human beings

168
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,300
as highly cooperative,

169
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,500
reciprocal and intuitively moral creatures,

170
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,780
then it follows logically that it must be cooperation

171
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,900
and not selfishness that is the cause of our prosperity,

172
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,540
and it isn't our self-interest,

173
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,260
but rather our inherent reciprocity

174
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,820
that is humanity's economic superpower.

175
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,300
So, you know, at the heart of this new economics

176
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,100
is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves,

177
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,020
and unlike the old economics,

178
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,860
this is a story that is virtuous

179
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
and also has the virtue of being true.

180
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,100
Now, I want to emphasize that this new economics

181
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,700
is not something I have personally imagined or invented.

182
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,620
Its theories and models are being developed and refined

183
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
in universities around the world,

184
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,980
building on some of the best new research in economics,

185
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,580
complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology,

186
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,020
anthropology and other disciplines.

187
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,420
And although this new economics

188
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,820
does not yet have its own textbook

189
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,220
or even a commonly agreed upon name in broad strokes,

190
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,540
its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this.

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,980
So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system

192
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,420
in which prosperity emerges

193
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,020
through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation

194
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,980
and increasing amounts of consumer demand.

195
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,380
Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems

196
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,100
and consumer demand is the mechanism

197
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,300
through which the market selects for useful innovations.

198
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,540
And as we solve more problems, we become more prosperous.

199
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,540
But as we become more prosperous,

200
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,180
our problems and solutions become more complex.

201
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,380
And this increasing technical complexity

202
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,860
requires ever higher levels of social and economic cooperation

203
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,860
in order to produce the more highly specialized products

204
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,140
that define a modern economy.

205
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,660
Now, the old economics is correct, of course,

206
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,300
that competition plays a crucial role in how markets work.

207
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,340
But what it fails to see

208
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,100
is that it is largely a competition between highly cooperative groups,

209
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,900
competition between firms, competition between networks of firms,

210
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,620
competition between nations.

211
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,300
And anyone who knows, who's ever run a successful business,

212
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,740
knows that building a cooperative team by including the talents of everyone

213
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,340
is almost always a better strategy than just a bunch of selfish jerks.

214
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,460
So, how do we leave neoliberalism behind

215
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,060
and build a more sustainable, more prosperous

216
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,980
and more equitable society?

217
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,060
The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb.

218
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,540
First is that successful economies are not jungles,

219
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,620
they're gardens,

220
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,140
which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended,

221
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,900
that the market is the greatest social technology ever invented

222
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,420
for solving human problems,

223
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,620
but unconstrained by social norms or democratic regulation,

224
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,020
markets inevitably create more problems than they solve.

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,460
Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples.

226
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,940
The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth.

227
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,380
So, the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury

228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,860
to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards.

229
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,660
The economy is people,

230
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,740
including more people in more ways

231
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,380
is what causes economic growth in market economies.

232
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,020
The third principle is the purpose of the corporation

233
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,100
is not merely to enrich shareholders.

234
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,900
The greatest grift in contemporary economic life

235
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation

236
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,820
and the only responsibility of executives

237
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,900
is to enrich themselves and shareholders.

238
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,420
The new economics must and can insist

239
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,820
that the purpose of the corporation

240
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,060
is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders,

241
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,460
customers, workers, community and shareholders alike.

242
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,820
Rule four, greed is not good.

243
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,620
Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist.

244
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,620
It makes you a sociopath.

245
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,020
LAUGHTER

246
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,820
APPLAUSE

247
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,460
And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours,

248
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,820
sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society.

249
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,100
And fifth and finally,

250
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,060
unlike the laws of physics,

251
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,700
the laws of economics are a choice.

252
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,980
Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you

253
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,340
as unchangeable natural law,

254
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,540
when in fact, it's social norms and constructed narratives

255
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,900
based on pseudoscience.

256
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,540
If we truly want a more equitable,

257
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,940
more prosperous and more sustainable economy,

258
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,900
if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society,

259
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,740
we must have a new economics.

260
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,740
And here's the good news.

261
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,860
If we want a new economics,

262
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,820
all we have to do is choose to have it.

263
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Thank you.

264
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
APPLAUSE

265
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Thank you.

267
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,620
So, Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot.

268
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,460
If you're so unhappy with the economic system,

269
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,180
why not just give all your money away and join the 99%?

270
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah, no, yes, right.

271
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,900
You get that a lot, you get that a lot.

272
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,340
If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more?

273
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,380
If you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more?

274
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
And I could do that.

275
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,020
The problem is, it doesn't make that much difference,

276
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,140
and I have discovered a strategy that works literally

277
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,460
100,000 times better,

278
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,780
which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws

279
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,500
that require all the other rich people to pay taxes

280
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,340
and pay their workers better.

281
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,620
And so, for example, the $15 minimum wage

282
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,620
that we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers.

283
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,940
So, that works better.

284
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
That's great.

285
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,740
If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you.

286
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
Thank you.
