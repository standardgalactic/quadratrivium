00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Today, we are going to be talking about one of the many items behind me in this set, a set which,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,320
for some reason, some of you think isn't real. Even as I reach for the item in question, a physical

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,000
item in the physical set that I physically sit in front of, a few of you will convince yourselves

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,240
that this is all an elaborate compositing effort because, well, frankly, I don't know why. I mean,

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
it should be obvious from my videos that After Effects is a program that I open accidentally,

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,680
stare at in terror, and then feel guilty about never bothering to learn despite multiple

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,680
New Year's resolutions. And yet, some of you think me and Captain Disillusion are the same person?

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,040
How? We sound nothing— Anyway, I will now reach for the thing.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,640
That is a real dust spot, by the way. This is a Canon F1, a 35mm single-lens reflex camera

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,280
introduced in 1971. Single-lens reflex, often shortened to SLR, means that the view

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,240
through the viewfinder is through the same lens that exposes the film. This is done with the aid

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,520
of a mirror, which redirects light from the lens onto a ground-glass focusing screen to allow the

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,880
shot to be composed exactly as it will be captured on film, eliminating the parallax error from a

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,840
separate viewfinder and allowing you to preview the depth of field with a stopped-down lens.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
When the shutter is released, the mirror is swung up and out of the way, allowing the light from

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,200
the lens to land on the film itself, after the shutter has opened, of course. I love this camera,

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,880
though I haven't used it in quite some time, and we're going to talk a lot about analog photography

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,560
as time goes on, but this particular video is about one fundamental aspect of how you use it.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,480
It's light meter. Now, quick side note, there were plenty of cameras with automatic exposure

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,960
available to the consumer when this was released, like this Olympus Pen EES2, which you better believe

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,880
we'll be talking about someday because it's got all sorts of weirdness, but the Canon F1 is entirely

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
manual and, in fact, entirely mechanical. That's a large part of why I love it. It's built like a

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,720
tank weighing in at just shy of 850 grams or nearly two pounds. That's without a lens or film,

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,440
mind you. Lightness was never a priority. By the way, despite its uncanny resemblance to some sort

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,000
of LCD screen, this thing is in fact nothing but a holder for the torn-off end of a box of film

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,400
to serve as a reminder of what you put in it. Interacting with this camera is so delightful.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Everything is where it is because that's where it needed to be. All the controls are physically

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,240
connected to the mechanisms they activate, which makes them delightfully chunky. You can see how

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,400
turning the film in advance lever cocks the shutter by moving the two halves of the shutter curtain

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
in unison, and you can even hear the little clockwork mechanism that controls the shutter's

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,200
timing at long exposures. Take a listen. Still, even with the constraints in place,

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,520
Canon managed to make this brick of a camera decently ergonomic for righties, anyway. Your

33
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,880
thumb, index finger, and middle fingers rest naturally on the film advance shutter release

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,680
and front control, respectively. My personal favorite thing is that front control. Push the lever

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,960
towards the lens and it closes the aperture so you can get a depth of field preview in the viewfinder.

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,080
But turn it the other way, and you can feel that you're winding something up. Well,

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,440
I just love that. That's itself timer. Oh, and that little lever on the bottom? That is used to

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,680
lock the aperture preview in place and lift the mirror for vibration-free long exposures.

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,560
This camera requires no batteries to function, and yet it can do pretty much anything you can

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,680
reasonably expect a 35mm camera to do. Well, aside from autofocus and motorized film winding,

41
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,400
I did say this was entirely manual. The F1 was designed to be incredibly modular, though,

42
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
and you could accessorize it with all sorts of things from motor drives to different viewfinders

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,880
to bulk film backings. This one, though, is in its stock form. It has the standard everything.

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,360
And while it does not need any batteries whatsoever to function, it does have a battery compartment

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,680
on the bottom. In here lies a small coin battery which powers the light meter. What's a light meter?

46
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
Well, it's not a questionable astronomical unit, it's instead an information display.

47
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,040
All right, quick crash course in basic photography. Almost every camera ever can control the amount

48
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,520
of light that hits the film or image sensor in two ways, the lens aperture and the shutter speed.

49
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,360
Inside the lens is a multi-bladed diaphragm that can, to put it in rather basic terms,

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,720
reduce the size of the lens's opening through constriction. Those are what the f-numbers on a

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
lens are, and the higher the number, the more constricted that opening becomes. Thus, the less

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,840
light makes it through to the film or sensor. A side effect of this is that the depth of field,

53
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,480
that's the range of depths that are in focus, becomes deeper the more constricted the lens

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,440
becomes. That means that more of the image is in focus, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans,

55
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,080
when a higher f-number, and thus smaller aperture, is used. Note that for landscape photography

56
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,360
and other scenarios where nothing is close to the camera, the depth of field becomes more or less

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,600
irrelevant. The shutter speed, meanwhile, is, in still photography, the amount of time the shutter

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,680
remains open. Leave it open for longer and you can collect more light. Hardly open it at all

59
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,760
and you collect less of it. The trade-off here is that long exposures require very still scenery

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,280
and probably a tripod, as any motion will be blurred. Shorter exposures, on the other hand,

61
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,160
will freeze motion, but they require more light through a wider open aperture.

62
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second and this camera is capable of speeds from one

63
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,520
second to one two thousandth of a second. B, short for bulb, will leave the shutter open

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,880
as long as the shutter release is pressed. There's an inverse relationship between shutter speed

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,160
and aperture. Higher f-numbers allow less light through the lens, which means the shutter has

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,040
to stay open longer to collect the same amount of light. And, if a shorter shutter speed is desired,

67
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,880
the aperture has to open wider to allow more light through the lens. In order for the exposure to be

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,640
correct, the aperture and shutter speed must be an appropriate combination for the amount of light

69
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,800
available in the scene and the sensitivity of the film or sensor. However, once you know one

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,000
combination that works, you can adjust the shutter or aperture up or down so long as you

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,200
adjust the other setting appropriately in the opposite direction. The f-numbers, by the way,

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,960
are as weird as they seem to be because the number itself is a geometric ratio. But,

73
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,080
we want to have stops at each value that halves or doubles the amount of total light going through

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,000
the lens in order to correspond to the available shutter speeds. We call those stops. Stops.

75
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,720
So, now we've come to the metering bit. Every film stock has a certain sensitivity to light,

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,760
known as its film speed. The term speed comes from the fact that exposure time will vary

77
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,920
based upon sensitivity, all else being equal. We now call that the ISO, though back when this

78
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,280
camera was made, it was called the ASA, the Initialism for the American Standards Association,

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,960
now known as ANSI. See, back then, Germany was doing its own thing with a logarithmic system

80
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,360
they called DIN, the acronym for their standards organization, incidentally. But, in 1974,

81
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,480
the International Standards Organization said, you know, we're just going to mash the ASA and

82
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,560
the DIN together, and now that's the ISO. But, nobody ever remembers the DIN half of it. The

83
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,320
ISO 100 should really be 100 slash 21 degrees. So, in a weird way, we're still using ASA,

84
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,400
but calling it ISO, at least outside of Germany. Anyway, nope, one more tangent, ISO. I say the

85
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
three letters. Why? Because ISO and ISO are so close to each other that I don't think it makes

86
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,560
sense to force the acronym. Does it matter? Of course not. It's just, like, my opinion, but

87
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,920
I will at least grant that it's less atrocious than calling this NHTSA, which they're trying real

88
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,840
hard to make a thing in case you hadn't noticed, and I regret to inform you that it's working.

89
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Anyway, modern digital cameras have an ISO setting because you can change the sensitivity of the

90
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,400
image sensor. But, back when we were using good ol' emulsions of silver halides on a clear plastic

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,160
backing, you'd be stuck with whatever the sensitivity was of the film you bought. Of course,

92
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,960
there are many kinds of films from many manufacturers, and the film speed is itself

93
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,000
something of a trade-off. More sensitive films are usually grainier, so you'd want to pick the

94
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,480
appropriate film for your situation. But now, well, how are you supposed to know what shutter

95
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,280
speed and aperture setting you should use? You have to get the exposure correct if you want the

96
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,280
resulting image to have decent dynamic range. Otherwise, it will be blown out from overexposure,

97
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,280
or a dark mess without any detail. Well, there are some general rules of thumb you can use in

98
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,200
certain situations. For example, on a clear sunny day, you can use the sunny 16 rule. Set

99
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,400
the aperture to 16 and the shutter speed to the value that most closely matches the film speed.

100
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,360
So, if your ISO is 100, 1 1⁄100 of a second, or the closest available setting, on this camera

101
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,720
it would be 125. This works because a doubling in film speed equals one stop in exposure. It requires

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,640
half as much light. And at f16, the correct shutter speeds happen to match the film speed

103
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,320
numerically. If you need a faster shutter speed for a given shot, just open up the aperture in

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,920
equal number of stops that you increase the shutter speed to compensate. But news flash,

105
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,360
not every photograph is taken outdoors on a sunny day. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that

106
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,680
can tell you the correct exposure for any given scenario? Enter the light meter. These devices

107
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,560
are able to, with the aid of some sort of light sensor, provide the user with an appropriate

108
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,080
exposure value. These devices were originally handheld and were fairly crude. Generally,

109
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,080
they just have a needle type readout which would point to the appropriate aperture value for a

110
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,280
given film and shutter speed. To use them, you'd bring them to your subject and point them at

111
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,920
something which was close to a middle gray in terms of brightness. Then you'd set your camera up

112
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,440
appropriately. You can still buy handheld light meters today, though they've been digitified

113
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,640
of course, but before long they were integrated into camera bodies themselves. And that's why

114
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,800
this otherwise mechanical camera has a battery compartment. Now, keep in mind that this camera

115
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,640
was originally released in 1971, though this example is a later revision. Its light meter

116
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
will be limited to the same sort of analog tech that was found in the handheld meters of the time.

117
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,000
But, and this is why I wanted to make this video, it was done in an extremely clever way that not

118
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,360
only simplified its operation to the user, but allowed for more flexible use of the camera.

119
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,840
The meter appears as a small display to the right of the image in the viewfinder.

120
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Right now, the camera doesn't have a lens on it, but watch what happens when I put one on.

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,160
The small circle moved upwards. That circle is mechanically linked to this little piece here.

122
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,040
You can see that as I move it with my finger, the ring moves up and down. This engages with

123
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,200
a small peg on the lens itself. Once installed on the camera, moving the aperture ring on the lens

124
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,280
causes that ring to move. Now, in addition to the ring, there's a small horizontal line.

125
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,960
Right now, it's sitting in the bottom red area. This is actually a needle that will move depending

126
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,920
on how much light the camera sees. And this is where the battery comes into play. You may have

127
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,200
noticed this power switch. All that does is turn on the light meter. That little blue mark in the

128
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,400
meter's display is used as a battery level check. You can see there's a little sticker here reminding

129
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,240
you that to check the battery level, the shutter speed should be set to 2000 and the ASA to 100.

130
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,920
Then, when you move the switch to the check position, the needle should jump up to the

131
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,200
blue mark, and so long as it does, the battery's okay. If it doesn't make it to the blue mark,

132
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,200
well, it's flat, and if it overshoots it, we'll get to that. When the meter is turned on,

133
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,000
you can see the needle move with the amount of light that hits the camera. The brighter the image,

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,720
the higher it goes. But where exactly is it measuring? You probably noticed the darker

135
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,920
portion of the viewfinder towards the center. That is the sensitive area of the light meter.

136
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,800
With a lens on, you can see that it's only what's in this area that affects the needle's behavior.

137
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,840
But how is that possible? Where is the actual sensor? Surely we didn't have

138
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,080
transparent light sensors in 1971. Well, maybe we did, but that's not what's going on here.

139
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,440
Again, it's extremely clever. One of the many things you could customize on this camera is the

140
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,560
focusing screen. To remove it, you simply remove the viewfinder by pressing in these little lock

141
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,080
buttons and sliding it towards the rear. And there's the focusing screen. Kind of trippy, huh?

142
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,760
That's what we were looking at in the viewfinder, but now we're looking

143
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,600
down at it. In fact, all the viewfinder is is a prism, a roof pentaprism to be precise,

144
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,800
there to redirect your view from the eyepiece downward and flip the image horizontally.

145
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,440
This creates the distinctive hump you see above the lens on all SLRs to this day,

146
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,200
though I must say I much prefer these sharp lines, which don't hide the nature of the thing,

147
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,440
to the blobular designs of today. Anyway, this is the focusing screen and it too is removable.

148
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,040
Before I even remove it though, something about it seems weird. That darker region appears to be

149
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,440
floating. Now, this is obvious in person thanks to stereoscopic vision, but it might not come

150
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,480
across well on camera. I'll try my best though. At the very least, you can see that the circular

151
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,160
focusing aids in the center are actually separate from that darker region. If I pop the focusing

152
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,440
screen out, you'll get a clue as to why. See that little window there? Look through it. Weird.

153
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,640
That dark region is actually a semi-transparent mirror that is floating in the middle of the

154
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,800
glass somehow. I really want to see how these were manufactured. But anyway, it redirects

155
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,200
some of the light coming up through the focusing screen out this little window,

156
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,320
and if we look from the front, you'll see what lies behind it.

157
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,480
The light sensor. From the looks of it, it seems to be a simple light-dependent resistor, or LDR,

158
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,160
though it's obviously a little fancier than the one in your garden variety, nightlight.

159
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,360
The amount of light that falls on this will, thanks to the battery and the simple electronics it

160
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,560
powers, determine where the needle in the meter lands. So, in the end, that rectangle is simply

161
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,640
the dark region left by a semi-transparent mirror embedded in the glass of the focusing screen at

162
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:56,400
a 45 degree angle so it can redirect a portion of the light onto the sensor. That's what I call

163
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,480
neat. Now that we know where the meter measures, how it works, and what it does,

164
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,880
how does one use it? You may very well have figured it out by now. This variety of meter is

165
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:14,320
called a match needle meter, and that ring, well, it's your target. To use this camera's light meter,

166
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,720
you first point the camera so that something in the scene that's not too bright or too dark is

167
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,840
within that metering region. Light meters and cameras are generally calibrated to a middle

168
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,160
gray value, and this is no exception. Now, simply turn the aperture ring on the lens until the ring

169
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,680
surrounds the needle. You are now set to the correct exposure setting, so you can recompose your shot,

170
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,880
however you like, hit the shutter release, and you're done. One exposure down, 23, maybe 35 more to go.

171
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,520
But what if that combination isn't what I want? Maybe I have to stop the lens way, way down in

172
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,960
order to match the needle's position and expose correctly. I'll lose my sweet, sweet bokeh.

173
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,080
Well, nothing a little after the fact AI-powered image processing can't fit. I mean,

174
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
that's no problem at all. Simply adjust the shutter speed so that it's faster.

175
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,880
Bah, the needle moved. Here's where the other part of this genius system comes in.

176
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,200
The actual sensitivity of the light meter itself is affected by both the selected shutter speed

177
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,320
and also the film speed. Perhaps you noticed this little insert in the shutter speed dial.

178
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,560
Rotate the dial while pulling up on it, and you can change the film speed setting,

179
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,160
which will make the meter more or less sensitive. And the shutter speed alone has the same effect.

180
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,560
Increasing shutter speed causes the needle to fall down, which means you need to open the lens up to

181
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,480
match. Now, you could have worked this out in your head by just counting the stops to, say, f2,

182
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,200
and then increasing the shutter speed by the same number of stops. But having the meter work

183
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,000
differently depending on the shutter speed offers a sort of sanity check. It also demonstrates the

184
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,680
relationship between shutter speed and aperture beautifully. Each stop you move in shutter speed

185
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,880
requires two clicks of the aperture ring to compensate. Two clicks because this lens has

186
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,000
detents at half stops. Most elegantly, though, the matching nature allows for shutter priority or

187
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,320
aperture priority exposure. Rather than just point the camera at the scene and find a combo that works,

188
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,720
you can fix one of those variables ahead of time and adjust the other as needed.

189
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,960
Say you want a stopped down aperture of f16 for a deep depth of field. Well, set the lens to f16

190
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
and keep changing the shutter speed until the needle gets in that ring. Or perhaps you need a

191
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,920
fast shutter speed to freeze motion in action shots. Simply set the shutter speed to a thousand

192
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,160
and move the aperture ring until the ring surrounds the needle. Easy! This metering arrangement

193
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,520
is not only intuitive, but it's flexible and also just a great teaching aid to those learning

194
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,600
photography. You see hints of it in modern interfaces, and then of course there's even

195
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,720
more powerful stuff these days like histograms and whatnot, but there's just something about

196
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,880
the way this works that is beautifully elegant to me. Should we talk about the weirdness, though?

197
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,160
Let's talk about the weirdness. First, there's a limit to its range of operation. Watch what

198
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
happens as I approach a shutter speed of one second. At a quarter of a second, the meter

199
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:26,080
turns red. It doesn't exactly stop working, but it behaves erratically. If I increase the film speed

200
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,120
to 1600, the meter goes red at a 30th of a second. And here, at really slow shutter speeds, the needle

201
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,040
just stops changing at all, even when it should. Now the meter is definitely not working right.

202
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,120
What's going on here is that the meter is a lot simpler than you may imagine.

203
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,760
Changing the shutter speed setting simply changes how sensitive the meter becomes.

204
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,000
As you slow the shutter, you need to close the aperture down and equivalent stops for the same

205
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,600
exposure. The meter needs to move the needle higher to indicate that, which means the needle

206
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,360
becomes more sensitive to given amounts of light. But the same thing needs to happen when you increase

207
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,200
the film speed. If you doubled the film speed, you'd need half as much light for the same exposure,

208
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,480
so the needle needs to move one stop higher. Doubling the film speed demands that the sensitivity

209
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,320
of the meter change exactly as if the shutter speed were cut in half. And the simplest way to do this?

210
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,720
Just shift everything over. The needle will indicate the same apertures for a doubled film

211
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,280
speed as it would for a halved shutter speed. So, if you can shift those sensitivities around,

212
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,960
you can adjust the meter for different film speeds. That's exactly what changing the film speed

213
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,600
setting does. In fact, that's literally what it does because we're dealing with a mechanical

214
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,200
contraption. Adjusting the film speed essentially relocates the different sensitivities of the

215
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,280
light meter independently of the camera's shutter mechanism. There are more meter sensitivities

216
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,880
than there are shutter speeds on the high end, but there aren't on the low end. The meter just

217
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,000
isn't sensitive enough to tell you how to expose a low light shot. So, as the film speed increases,

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,760
the lowest speed settings become locked out because that sensitivity is now assigned to a

219
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,760
higher shutter speed. Each doubling of film speed locks out the next lowest shutter speed.

220
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,360
In the end, the meter is just an analog device that's been finely calibrated to move the needle

221
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,720
logarithmically. Each doubling of light landing on the sensor makes it move the same distance

222
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,360
upward. I imagine each sensitivity level is just adding a different resistor to the mix.

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Which brings us to the next bit of weirdness, batteries. When this camera was made, we were

224
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,640
still manufacturing mercury batteries because, you know, we hadn't yet come to grips with the fact

225
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,680
that the garbage can isn't a magic receptacle that just makes things harmlessly disappear forever.

226
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,800
The trouble is, mercury batteries produced 1.35 volts. That's a weird voltage these days.

227
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,600
While you can buy a replacement battery that fits perfectly in the battery compartment,

228
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,120
it will likely be a 1.5 volt alkaline battery. You might not think that's enough to matter,

229
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,000
but remember this is an all analog system which is calibrated to behave logarithmically.

230
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,320
The voltage matters a lot and those batteries simply do not work. They push the needle way too

231
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,800
high and it will never give you an accurate reading. If you do a battery check with one of

232
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,960
these alkaline batteries, the needle will end up all the way up here. Trust me, I know. That same

233
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,520
sort of error makes its way into every metering scenario. However, there is a solution. Zinc

234
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,600
air batteries, which produce electricity through reacting with oxygen in the air,

235
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,800
are commonly available. They're pretty neat, all on their own, featuring a surprisingly large energy

236
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,080
density due to the nature of the reaction, but they have a time-limited life because you can't

237
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,520
stop the reaction once you remove the adhesive pull tab. However, for some applications like

238
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,280
hearing aids, this drawback is more than made up for by their energy density. And most importantly,

239
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,200
the voltage they produce is close enough to 1.35 that they can be used in cameras like these.

240
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,320
Now you can buy a zinc air drop-in replacement online for about five bucks,

241
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,000
but you'll be quickly annoyed with that option since, as I said, they have a built-in time limit.

242
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,320
So, pro tip, get yourself some 675 hearing aid batteries. They're about the same thickness as

243
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,840
the PX625 battery this camera is designed to take, and although they're not the right diameter,

244
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,040
a simple loop of wire insulation will center it well enough. You may need to bend the camera's

245
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,520
negative tab up slightly, but this simple modification allows you to use batteries you

246
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,800
can buy at Walmart for about a buck a piece. And as a happy accident, the battery compartment

247
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,240
cover has a couple of holes allowing air in, but they're small enough that in my experience,

248
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,520
a battery will last a good couple of months before it's dead. You might also have asked,

249
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,520
where is the meter's display, and how is it lit? You can see it in the viewfinder quite clearly,

250
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,320
but when you remove the viewfinder, you find just a blank hole where it was. Well, the meter is actually

251
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,880
right here. It's tiny, and this piece of translucent plastic up here is what illuminates it.

252
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,680
Old cameras are filled with all these clever intricate mechanisms. I mean,

253
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,640
think about the linkage connecting the shutter speed dial to the tiny little indicator in the meter.

254
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,480
It's amazing. Oh, and you could purchase a different viewfinder, which had its own battery and

255
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,720
light source for the meter, but this was never really super useful since the meter doesn't

256
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,520
work in low light anyway. For outdoor photography, that little window works surprisingly well.

257
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,640
Speaking of, did you notice the off position of the meter is also marked flash? How does that work?

258
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,200
Well, it doesn't. Remember, there's no automatic anything, and when this camera was made,

259
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,320
you'd use a chart on your flash itself to set exposure correctly based on film speed and

260
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,560
distance to the subject. Oh, and that's why the shutter speed 60 is marked in orange. That's the

261
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,400
flash synchronization speed of this camera or the fastest shutter speed where the entire shutter is

262
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,760
open at once and thus suitable for use with the flash. Since this camera's shutter curtain moves

263
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,280
horizontally, its shutter is pretty slow, and you can see even with the smartphone's slow-mo

264
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,280
that any speed above 60 doesn't expose the film all at once. This can actually create distortion

265
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,600
in certain scenarios. So in a funny way, this old camera has a rolling shutter. Go figure.

266
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,240
The shutter mechanism alone is just incredibly intricate and also fascinating. I mean, the

267
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,000
curtains themselves are made of titanium, and they're flexible. They roll up into these little

268
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,520
compartments here and move as one unit when you cock the shutter and advance the film. You can

269
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,600
see the seam right here. But with the press of just one button, they move apart and come back

270
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,480
together with precise control in a fraction of a second. All done entirely mechanically. Amazing.

271
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,600
This little thing here is the old style flash hookup, though up here in the film rewinder is

272
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,360
an older style of hot shoe. These little contacts here, along with those inside the plug, are bridged

273
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,520
right when the shutter is entirely open, signaling an electronic flash to flash. But anyway, now

274
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
we're getting well into the nitty gritty, which we'll save for later. I hope you enjoyed this

275
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,360
look into the old fashioned light metering systems of yesteryear. While it's fundamentally very

276
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,840
simple, a lot of ingenuity was built in to make it usable, intuitive, and flexible. But we've just

277
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,200
scratched the surface on how this camera takes pictures. What about the film itself? How does

278
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,360
that store an image? And what about film development? How do film negatives become printed photographs?

279
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,080
Oh, don't worry. There's a lot more to explore with analog photography. And before long,

280
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
we'll get there. See you in the dark room.

281
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Single lens reflex also so- I'll race, screw it up. And it's great because I have to retake the

282
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,520
other line too. I don't like how I said fundamental. I forgot I need to open that. The more constricted

283
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,880
that opening becomes, thus the less light, less light. That means that more of the image is in

284
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,720
focus at once, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans. But a higher F, oh, dang it. Yeah, I forgot.

285
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:38,400
Forgot the delivery. So, so, we'll move it over there. How about that? But nobody ever did,
