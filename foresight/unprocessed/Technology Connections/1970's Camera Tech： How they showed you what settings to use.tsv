0	6320	Today, we are going to be talking about one of the many items behind me in this set, a set which,
6320	12320	for some reason, some of you think isn't real. Even as I reach for the item in question, a physical
12320	18000	item in the physical set that I physically sit in front of, a few of you will convince yourselves
18000	24240	that this is all an elaborate compositing effort because, well, frankly, I don't know why. I mean,
24240	28720	it should be obvious from my videos that After Effects is a program that I open accidentally,
28720	33680	stare at in terror, and then feel guilty about never bothering to learn despite multiple
33680	39680	New Year's resolutions. And yet, some of you think me and Captain Disillusion are the same person?
40320	45040	How? We sound nothing— Anyway, I will now reach for the thing.
48480	56640	That is a real dust spot, by the way. This is a Canon F1, a 35mm single-lens reflex camera
56640	63280	introduced in 1971. Single-lens reflex, often shortened to SLR, means that the view
63280	68240	through the viewfinder is through the same lens that exposes the film. This is done with the aid
68240	73520	of a mirror, which redirects light from the lens onto a ground-glass focusing screen to allow the
73520	78880	shot to be composed exactly as it will be captured on film, eliminating the parallax error from a
78880	83840	separate viewfinder and allowing you to preview the depth of field with a stopped-down lens.
83840	88400	When the shutter is released, the mirror is swung up and out of the way, allowing the light from
88400	95200	the lens to land on the film itself, after the shutter has opened, of course. I love this camera,
95200	100880	though I haven't used it in quite some time, and we're going to talk a lot about analog photography
100880	106560	as time goes on, but this particular video is about one fundamental aspect of how you use it.
106560	112480	It's light meter. Now, quick side note, there were plenty of cameras with automatic exposure
112480	118960	available to the consumer when this was released, like this Olympus Pen EES2, which you better believe
118960	124880	we'll be talking about someday because it's got all sorts of weirdness, but the Canon F1 is entirely
124880	131120	manual and, in fact, entirely mechanical. That's a large part of why I love it. It's built like a
131120	138720	tank weighing in at just shy of 850 grams or nearly two pounds. That's without a lens or film,
138720	145440	mind you. Lightness was never a priority. By the way, despite its uncanny resemblance to some sort
145440	152000	of LCD screen, this thing is in fact nothing but a holder for the torn-off end of a box of film
152000	158400	to serve as a reminder of what you put in it. Interacting with this camera is so delightful.
158400	164400	Everything is where it is because that's where it needed to be. All the controls are physically
164400	170240	connected to the mechanisms they activate, which makes them delightfully chunky. You can see how
170240	174400	turning the film in advance lever cocks the shutter by moving the two halves of the shutter curtain
174400	179360	in unison, and you can even hear the little clockwork mechanism that controls the shutter's
179360	187200	timing at long exposures. Take a listen. Still, even with the constraints in place,
187200	193520	Canon managed to make this brick of a camera decently ergonomic for righties, anyway. Your
193520	198880	thumb, index finger, and middle fingers rest naturally on the film advance shutter release
198880	205680	and front control, respectively. My personal favorite thing is that front control. Push the lever
205680	210960	towards the lens and it closes the aperture so you can get a depth of field preview in the viewfinder.
210960	218080	But turn it the other way, and you can feel that you're winding something up. Well,
229520	235440	I just love that. That's itself timer. Oh, and that little lever on the bottom? That is used to
235440	241680	lock the aperture preview in place and lift the mirror for vibration-free long exposures.
241680	246560	This camera requires no batteries to function, and yet it can do pretty much anything you can
246560	253680	reasonably expect a 35mm camera to do. Well, aside from autofocus and motorized film winding,
253680	260400	I did say this was entirely manual. The F1 was designed to be incredibly modular, though,
260400	264880	and you could accessorize it with all sorts of things from motor drives to different viewfinders
264960	270880	to bulk film backings. This one, though, is in its stock form. It has the standard everything.
270880	277360	And while it does not need any batteries whatsoever to function, it does have a battery compartment
277360	283680	on the bottom. In here lies a small coin battery which powers the light meter. What's a light meter?
283680	288080	Well, it's not a questionable astronomical unit, it's instead an information display.
288720	295040	All right, quick crash course in basic photography. Almost every camera ever can control the amount
295040	301520	of light that hits the film or image sensor in two ways, the lens aperture and the shutter speed.
302080	307360	Inside the lens is a multi-bladed diaphragm that can, to put it in rather basic terms,
307360	312720	reduce the size of the lens's opening through constriction. Those are what the f-numbers on a
312720	318160	lens are, and the higher the number, the more constricted that opening becomes. Thus, the less
318160	323840	light makes it through to the film or sensor. A side effect of this is that the depth of field,
323840	328480	that's the range of depths that are in focus, becomes deeper the more constricted the lens
328480	333440	becomes. That means that more of the image is in focus, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans,
333440	340080	when a higher f-number, and thus smaller aperture, is used. Note that for landscape photography
340160	345360	and other scenarios where nothing is close to the camera, the depth of field becomes more or less
345360	351600	irrelevant. The shutter speed, meanwhile, is, in still photography, the amount of time the shutter
351600	357680	remains open. Leave it open for longer and you can collect more light. Hardly open it at all
357680	363760	and you collect less of it. The trade-off here is that long exposures require very still scenery
363760	369280	and probably a tripod, as any motion will be blurred. Shorter exposures, on the other hand,
369280	374160	will freeze motion, but they require more light through a wider open aperture.
374720	379760	Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second and this camera is capable of speeds from one
379760	385520	second to one two thousandth of a second. B, short for bulb, will leave the shutter open
385520	390880	as long as the shutter release is pressed. There's an inverse relationship between shutter speed
390880	396160	and aperture. Higher f-numbers allow less light through the lens, which means the shutter has
396160	403040	to stay open longer to collect the same amount of light. And, if a shorter shutter speed is desired,
403040	408880	the aperture has to open wider to allow more light through the lens. In order for the exposure to be
408880	414640	correct, the aperture and shutter speed must be an appropriate combination for the amount of light
414640	420800	available in the scene and the sensitivity of the film or sensor. However, once you know one
420800	426000	combination that works, you can adjust the shutter or aperture up or down so long as you
426000	431200	adjust the other setting appropriately in the opposite direction. The f-numbers, by the way,
431200	436960	are as weird as they seem to be because the number itself is a geometric ratio. But,
436960	442080	we want to have stops at each value that halves or doubles the amount of total light going through
442080	448000	the lens in order to correspond to the available shutter speeds. We call those stops. Stops.
448960	454720	So, now we've come to the metering bit. Every film stock has a certain sensitivity to light,
454720	459760	known as its film speed. The term speed comes from the fact that exposure time will vary
459760	465920	based upon sensitivity, all else being equal. We now call that the ISO, though back when this
465920	471280	camera was made, it was called the ASA, the Initialism for the American Standards Association,
471280	476960	now known as ANSI. See, back then, Germany was doing its own thing with a logarithmic system
477040	483360	they called DIN, the acronym for their standards organization, incidentally. But, in 1974,
483360	488480	the International Standards Organization said, you know, we're just going to mash the ASA and
488480	494560	the DIN together, and now that's the ISO. But, nobody ever remembers the DIN half of it. The
494560	502320	ISO 100 should really be 100 slash 21 degrees. So, in a weird way, we're still using ASA,
502320	510400	but calling it ISO, at least outside of Germany. Anyway, nope, one more tangent, ISO. I say the
510400	516320	three letters. Why? Because ISO and ISO are so close to each other that I don't think it makes
516320	522560	sense to force the acronym. Does it matter? Of course not. It's just, like, my opinion, but
522560	527920	I will at least grant that it's less atrocious than calling this NHTSA, which they're trying real
527920	533840	hard to make a thing in case you hadn't noticed, and I regret to inform you that it's working.
535040	540880	Anyway, modern digital cameras have an ISO setting because you can change the sensitivity of the
540880	546400	image sensor. But, back when we were using good ol' emulsions of silver halides on a clear plastic
546400	552160	backing, you'd be stuck with whatever the sensitivity was of the film you bought. Of course,
552160	556960	there are many kinds of films from many manufacturers, and the film speed is itself
556960	562000	something of a trade-off. More sensitive films are usually grainier, so you'd want to pick the
562000	568480	appropriate film for your situation. But now, well, how are you supposed to know what shutter
568480	573280	speed and aperture setting you should use? You have to get the exposure correct if you want the
573280	579280	resulting image to have decent dynamic range. Otherwise, it will be blown out from overexposure,
579280	585280	or a dark mess without any detail. Well, there are some general rules of thumb you can use in
585280	591200	certain situations. For example, on a clear sunny day, you can use the sunny 16 rule. Set
591200	596400	the aperture to 16 and the shutter speed to the value that most closely matches the film speed.
596960	603360	So, if your ISO is 100, 1 1⁄100 of a second, or the closest available setting, on this camera
603360	610720	it would be 125. This works because a doubling in film speed equals one stop in exposure. It requires
610720	616640	half as much light. And at f16, the correct shutter speeds happen to match the film speed
616640	622320	numerically. If you need a faster shutter speed for a given shot, just open up the aperture in
622320	627920	equal number of stops that you increase the shutter speed to compensate. But news flash,
627920	633360	not every photograph is taken outdoors on a sunny day. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that
633360	639680	can tell you the correct exposure for any given scenario? Enter the light meter. These devices
639760	644560	are able to, with the aid of some sort of light sensor, provide the user with an appropriate
644560	650080	exposure value. These devices were originally handheld and were fairly crude. Generally,
650080	654080	they just have a needle type readout which would point to the appropriate aperture value for a
654080	659280	given film and shutter speed. To use them, you'd bring them to your subject and point them at
659280	663920	something which was close to a middle gray in terms of brightness. Then you'd set your camera up
663920	669440	appropriately. You can still buy handheld light meters today, though they've been digitified
669440	674640	of course, but before long they were integrated into camera bodies themselves. And that's why
674640	680800	this otherwise mechanical camera has a battery compartment. Now, keep in mind that this camera
680800	686640	was originally released in 1971, though this example is a later revision. Its light meter
686640	691600	will be limited to the same sort of analog tech that was found in the handheld meters of the time.
692160	698000	But, and this is why I wanted to make this video, it was done in an extremely clever way that not
698080	703360	only simplified its operation to the user, but allowed for more flexible use of the camera.
703920	707840	The meter appears as a small display to the right of the image in the viewfinder.
708400	713200	Right now, the camera doesn't have a lens on it, but watch what happens when I put one on.
716000	722160	The small circle moved upwards. That circle is mechanically linked to this little piece here.
722160	727040	You can see that as I move it with my finger, the ring moves up and down. This engages with
727040	733200	a small peg on the lens itself. Once installed on the camera, moving the aperture ring on the lens
733200	739280	causes that ring to move. Now, in addition to the ring, there's a small horizontal line.
739280	744960	Right now, it's sitting in the bottom red area. This is actually a needle that will move depending
744960	749920	on how much light the camera sees. And this is where the battery comes into play. You may have
749920	755200	noticed this power switch. All that does is turn on the light meter. That little blue mark in the
755200	760400	meter's display is used as a battery level check. You can see there's a little sticker here reminding
760400	766240	you that to check the battery level, the shutter speed should be set to 2000 and the ASA to 100.
766240	769920	Then, when you move the switch to the check position, the needle should jump up to the
769920	775200	blue mark, and so long as it does, the battery's okay. If it doesn't make it to the blue mark,
775840	781200	well, it's flat, and if it overshoots it, we'll get to that. When the meter is turned on,
781200	786000	you can see the needle move with the amount of light that hits the camera. The brighter the image,
786000	792720	the higher it goes. But where exactly is it measuring? You probably noticed the darker
792720	797920	portion of the viewfinder towards the center. That is the sensitive area of the light meter.
797920	802800	With a lens on, you can see that it's only what's in this area that affects the needle's behavior.
804000	809840	But how is that possible? Where is the actual sensor? Surely we didn't have
809840	816080	transparent light sensors in 1971. Well, maybe we did, but that's not what's going on here.
816080	821440	Again, it's extremely clever. One of the many things you could customize on this camera is the
821440	826560	focusing screen. To remove it, you simply remove the viewfinder by pressing in these little lock
826560	834080	buttons and sliding it towards the rear. And there's the focusing screen. Kind of trippy, huh?
834080	837760	That's what we were looking at in the viewfinder, but now we're looking
838640	845600	down at it. In fact, all the viewfinder is is a prism, a roof pentaprism to be precise,
845600	850800	there to redirect your view from the eyepiece downward and flip the image horizontally.
850800	855440	This creates the distinctive hump you see above the lens on all SLRs to this day,
855440	861200	though I must say I much prefer these sharp lines, which don't hide the nature of the thing,
861200	867440	to the blobular designs of today. Anyway, this is the focusing screen and it too is removable.
868000	875040	Before I even remove it though, something about it seems weird. That darker region appears to be
875840	881440	floating. Now, this is obvious in person thanks to stereoscopic vision, but it might not come
881440	886480	across well on camera. I'll try my best though. At the very least, you can see that the circular
886480	892160	focusing aids in the center are actually separate from that darker region. If I pop the focusing
892160	899440	screen out, you'll get a clue as to why. See that little window there? Look through it. Weird.
900640	906640	That dark region is actually a semi-transparent mirror that is floating in the middle of the
906640	912800	glass somehow. I really want to see how these were manufactured. But anyway, it redirects
912800	917200	some of the light coming up through the focusing screen out this little window,
917200	920320	and if we look from the front, you'll see what lies behind it.
921040	926480	The light sensor. From the looks of it, it seems to be a simple light-dependent resistor, or LDR,
926480	930160	though it's obviously a little fancier than the one in your garden variety, nightlight.
930720	935360	The amount of light that falls on this will, thanks to the battery and the simple electronics it
935360	942560	powers, determine where the needle in the meter lands. So, in the end, that rectangle is simply
942560	948640	the dark region left by a semi-transparent mirror embedded in the glass of the focusing screen at
948640	956400	a 45 degree angle so it can redirect a portion of the light onto the sensor. That's what I call
956400	960480	neat. Now that we know where the meter measures, how it works, and what it does,
961440	966880	how does one use it? You may very well have figured it out by now. This variety of meter is
966880	974320	called a match needle meter, and that ring, well, it's your target. To use this camera's light meter,
974320	978720	you first point the camera so that something in the scene that's not too bright or too dark is
978720	983840	within that metering region. Light meters and cameras are generally calibrated to a middle
983840	990160	gray value, and this is no exception. Now, simply turn the aperture ring on the lens until the ring
990240	995680	surrounds the needle. You are now set to the correct exposure setting, so you can recompose your shot,
995680	1002880	however you like, hit the shutter release, and you're done. One exposure down, 23, maybe 35 more to go.
1003680	1009520	But what if that combination isn't what I want? Maybe I have to stop the lens way, way down in
1009520	1014960	order to match the needle's position and expose correctly. I'll lose my sweet, sweet bokeh.
1015920	1020080	Well, nothing a little after the fact AI-powered image processing can't fit. I mean,
1020720	1024880	that's no problem at all. Simply adjust the shutter speed so that it's faster.
1025600	1030880	Bah, the needle moved. Here's where the other part of this genius system comes in.
1031440	1037200	The actual sensitivity of the light meter itself is affected by both the selected shutter speed
1037200	1042320	and also the film speed. Perhaps you noticed this little insert in the shutter speed dial.
1042320	1046560	Rotate the dial while pulling up on it, and you can change the film speed setting,
1046560	1052160	which will make the meter more or less sensitive. And the shutter speed alone has the same effect.
1052800	1058560	Increasing shutter speed causes the needle to fall down, which means you need to open the lens up to
1058560	1064480	match. Now, you could have worked this out in your head by just counting the stops to, say, f2,
1064480	1069200	and then increasing the shutter speed by the same number of stops. But having the meter work
1069200	1074000	differently depending on the shutter speed offers a sort of sanity check. It also demonstrates the
1074000	1079680	relationship between shutter speed and aperture beautifully. Each stop you move in shutter speed
1079680	1084880	requires two clicks of the aperture ring to compensate. Two clicks because this lens has
1084880	1092000	detents at half stops. Most elegantly, though, the matching nature allows for shutter priority or
1092000	1098320	aperture priority exposure. Rather than just point the camera at the scene and find a combo that works,
1098320	1102720	you can fix one of those variables ahead of time and adjust the other as needed.
1103360	1110960	Say you want a stopped down aperture of f16 for a deep depth of field. Well, set the lens to f16
1110960	1116240	and keep changing the shutter speed until the needle gets in that ring. Or perhaps you need a
1116240	1121920	fast shutter speed to freeze motion in action shots. Simply set the shutter speed to a thousand
1121920	1128160	and move the aperture ring until the ring surrounds the needle. Easy! This metering arrangement
1128160	1133520	is not only intuitive, but it's flexible and also just a great teaching aid to those learning
1133520	1137600	photography. You see hints of it in modern interfaces, and then of course there's even
1137600	1142720	more powerful stuff these days like histograms and whatnot, but there's just something about
1142720	1148880	the way this works that is beautifully elegant to me. Should we talk about the weirdness, though?
1148880	1154160	Let's talk about the weirdness. First, there's a limit to its range of operation. Watch what
1154240	1159120	happens as I approach a shutter speed of one second. At a quarter of a second, the meter
1159120	1166080	turns red. It doesn't exactly stop working, but it behaves erratically. If I increase the film speed
1166080	1173120	to 1600, the meter goes red at a 30th of a second. And here, at really slow shutter speeds, the needle
1173120	1179040	just stops changing at all, even when it should. Now the meter is definitely not working right.
1179600	1183120	What's going on here is that the meter is a lot simpler than you may imagine.
1183680	1187760	Changing the shutter speed setting simply changes how sensitive the meter becomes.
1187760	1192000	As you slow the shutter, you need to close the aperture down and equivalent stops for the same
1192000	1197600	exposure. The meter needs to move the needle higher to indicate that, which means the needle
1197600	1203360	becomes more sensitive to given amounts of light. But the same thing needs to happen when you increase
1203360	1209200	the film speed. If you doubled the film speed, you'd need half as much light for the same exposure,
1209200	1214480	so the needle needs to move one stop higher. Doubling the film speed demands that the sensitivity
1214480	1220320	of the meter change exactly as if the shutter speed were cut in half. And the simplest way to do this?
1221200	1226720	Just shift everything over. The needle will indicate the same apertures for a doubled film
1226720	1233280	speed as it would for a halved shutter speed. So, if you can shift those sensitivities around,
1233280	1238960	you can adjust the meter for different film speeds. That's exactly what changing the film speed
1239040	1243600	setting does. In fact, that's literally what it does because we're dealing with a mechanical
1243600	1249200	contraption. Adjusting the film speed essentially relocates the different sensitivities of the
1249200	1255280	light meter independently of the camera's shutter mechanism. There are more meter sensitivities
1255280	1260880	than there are shutter speeds on the high end, but there aren't on the low end. The meter just
1260880	1268000	isn't sensitive enough to tell you how to expose a low light shot. So, as the film speed increases,
1268000	1273760	the lowest speed settings become locked out because that sensitivity is now assigned to a
1273760	1279760	higher shutter speed. Each doubling of film speed locks out the next lowest shutter speed.
1280400	1285360	In the end, the meter is just an analog device that's been finely calibrated to move the needle
1285360	1290720	logarithmically. Each doubling of light landing on the sensor makes it move the same distance
1290720	1295360	upward. I imagine each sensitivity level is just adding a different resistor to the mix.
1296000	1302000	Which brings us to the next bit of weirdness, batteries. When this camera was made, we were
1302000	1306640	still manufacturing mercury batteries because, you know, we hadn't yet come to grips with the fact
1306640	1311680	that the garbage can isn't a magic receptacle that just makes things harmlessly disappear forever.
1311680	1318800	The trouble is, mercury batteries produced 1.35 volts. That's a weird voltage these days.
1318800	1323600	While you can buy a replacement battery that fits perfectly in the battery compartment,
1323680	1329120	it will likely be a 1.5 volt alkaline battery. You might not think that's enough to matter,
1329120	1334000	but remember this is an all analog system which is calibrated to behave logarithmically.
1334560	1340320	The voltage matters a lot and those batteries simply do not work. They push the needle way too
1340320	1344800	high and it will never give you an accurate reading. If you do a battery check with one of
1344800	1350960	these alkaline batteries, the needle will end up all the way up here. Trust me, I know. That same
1350960	1357520	sort of error makes its way into every metering scenario. However, there is a solution. Zinc
1357520	1361600	air batteries, which produce electricity through reacting with oxygen in the air,
1361600	1366800	are commonly available. They're pretty neat, all on their own, featuring a surprisingly large energy
1366800	1372080	density due to the nature of the reaction, but they have a time-limited life because you can't
1372080	1377520	stop the reaction once you remove the adhesive pull tab. However, for some applications like
1377520	1383280	hearing aids, this drawback is more than made up for by their energy density. And most importantly,
1383280	1389200	the voltage they produce is close enough to 1.35 that they can be used in cameras like these.
1389840	1394320	Now you can buy a zinc air drop-in replacement online for about five bucks,
1394320	1400000	but you'll be quickly annoyed with that option since, as I said, they have a built-in time limit.
1400000	1406320	So, pro tip, get yourself some 675 hearing aid batteries. They're about the same thickness as
1406320	1411840	the PX625 battery this camera is designed to take, and although they're not the right diameter,
1411840	1417040	a simple loop of wire insulation will center it well enough. You may need to bend the camera's
1417040	1421520	negative tab up slightly, but this simple modification allows you to use batteries you
1421520	1426800	can buy at Walmart for about a buck a piece. And as a happy accident, the battery compartment
1426800	1432240	cover has a couple of holes allowing air in, but they're small enough that in my experience,
1432320	1437520	a battery will last a good couple of months before it's dead. You might also have asked,
1437520	1443520	where is the meter's display, and how is it lit? You can see it in the viewfinder quite clearly,
1443520	1450320	but when you remove the viewfinder, you find just a blank hole where it was. Well, the meter is actually
1450320	1456880	right here. It's tiny, and this piece of translucent plastic up here is what illuminates it.
1457440	1461680	Old cameras are filled with all these clever intricate mechanisms. I mean,
1461680	1466640	think about the linkage connecting the shutter speed dial to the tiny little indicator in the meter.
1467680	1472480	It's amazing. Oh, and you could purchase a different viewfinder, which had its own battery and
1472480	1476720	light source for the meter, but this was never really super useful since the meter doesn't
1476720	1481520	work in low light anyway. For outdoor photography, that little window works surprisingly well.
1482240	1488640	Speaking of, did you notice the off position of the meter is also marked flash? How does that work?
1489360	1495200	Well, it doesn't. Remember, there's no automatic anything, and when this camera was made,
1495200	1500320	you'd use a chart on your flash itself to set exposure correctly based on film speed and
1500320	1506560	distance to the subject. Oh, and that's why the shutter speed 60 is marked in orange. That's the
1506560	1512400	flash synchronization speed of this camera or the fastest shutter speed where the entire shutter is
1512400	1517760	open at once and thus suitable for use with the flash. Since this camera's shutter curtain moves
1517760	1523280	horizontally, its shutter is pretty slow, and you can see even with the smartphone's slow-mo
1523280	1529280	that any speed above 60 doesn't expose the film all at once. This can actually create distortion
1529280	1535600	in certain scenarios. So in a funny way, this old camera has a rolling shutter. Go figure.
1536240	1542240	The shutter mechanism alone is just incredibly intricate and also fascinating. I mean, the
1542240	1548000	curtains themselves are made of titanium, and they're flexible. They roll up into these little
1548000	1553520	compartments here and move as one unit when you cock the shutter and advance the film. You can
1553520	1559600	see the seam right here. But with the press of just one button, they move apart and come back
1559600	1566480	together with precise control in a fraction of a second. All done entirely mechanically. Amazing.
1567280	1571600	This little thing here is the old style flash hookup, though up here in the film rewinder is
1571600	1577360	an older style of hot shoe. These little contacts here, along with those inside the plug, are bridged
1577360	1583520	right when the shutter is entirely open, signaling an electronic flash to flash. But anyway, now
1583520	1587840	we're getting well into the nitty gritty, which we'll save for later. I hope you enjoyed this
1587840	1593360	look into the old fashioned light metering systems of yesteryear. While it's fundamentally very
1593360	1599840	simple, a lot of ingenuity was built in to make it usable, intuitive, and flexible. But we've just
1599840	1605200	scratched the surface on how this camera takes pictures. What about the film itself? How does
1605200	1611360	that store an image? And what about film development? How do film negatives become printed photographs?
1612000	1618080	Oh, don't worry. There's a lot more to explore with analog photography. And before long,
1618080	1620240	we'll get there. See you in the dark room.
1624160	1630160	Single lens reflex also so- I'll race, screw it up. And it's great because I have to retake the
1630160	1637520	other line too. I don't like how I said fundamental. I forgot I need to open that. The more constricted
1637520	1642880	that opening becomes, thus the less light, less light. That means that more of the image is in
1642880	1648720	focus at once, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans. But a higher F, oh, dang it. Yeah, I forgot.
1649440	1658400	Forgot the delivery. So, so, we'll move it over there. How about that? But nobody ever did,
1659600	1666640	nobody ever did believe. It's going so well. But in 1974, the International Standards Association
1666640	1670640	said, organization. Dang it.
