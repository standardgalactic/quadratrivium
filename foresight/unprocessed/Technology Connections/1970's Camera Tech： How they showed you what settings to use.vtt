00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Today, we are going to be talking about one of the many items behind me in this set, a set which,

00:06.320 --> 00:12.320
for some reason, some of you think isn't real. Even as I reach for the item in question, a physical

00:12.320 --> 00:18.000
item in the physical set that I physically sit in front of, a few of you will convince yourselves

00:18.000 --> 00:24.240
that this is all an elaborate compositing effort because, well, frankly, I don't know why. I mean,

00:24.240 --> 00:28.720
it should be obvious from my videos that After Effects is a program that I open accidentally,

00:28.720 --> 00:33.680
stare at in terror, and then feel guilty about never bothering to learn despite multiple

00:33.680 --> 00:39.680
New Year's resolutions. And yet, some of you think me and Captain Disillusion are the same person?

00:40.320 --> 00:45.040
How? We sound nothing— Anyway, I will now reach for the thing.

00:48.480 --> 00:56.640
That is a real dust spot, by the way. This is a Canon F1, a 35mm single-lens reflex camera

00:56.640 --> 01:03.280
introduced in 1971. Single-lens reflex, often shortened to SLR, means that the view

01:03.280 --> 01:08.240
through the viewfinder is through the same lens that exposes the film. This is done with the aid

01:08.240 --> 01:13.520
of a mirror, which redirects light from the lens onto a ground-glass focusing screen to allow the

01:13.520 --> 01:18.880
shot to be composed exactly as it will be captured on film, eliminating the parallax error from a

01:18.880 --> 01:23.840
separate viewfinder and allowing you to preview the depth of field with a stopped-down lens.

01:23.840 --> 01:28.400
When the shutter is released, the mirror is swung up and out of the way, allowing the light from

01:28.400 --> 01:35.200
the lens to land on the film itself, after the shutter has opened, of course. I love this camera,

01:35.200 --> 01:40.880
though I haven't used it in quite some time, and we're going to talk a lot about analog photography

01:40.880 --> 01:46.560
as time goes on, but this particular video is about one fundamental aspect of how you use it.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.480
It's light meter. Now, quick side note, there were plenty of cameras with automatic exposure

01:52.480 --> 01:58.960
available to the consumer when this was released, like this Olympus Pen EES2, which you better believe

01:58.960 --> 02:04.880
we'll be talking about someday because it's got all sorts of weirdness, but the Canon F1 is entirely

02:04.880 --> 02:11.120
manual and, in fact, entirely mechanical. That's a large part of why I love it. It's built like a

02:11.120 --> 02:18.720
tank weighing in at just shy of 850 grams or nearly two pounds. That's without a lens or film,

02:18.720 --> 02:25.440
mind you. Lightness was never a priority. By the way, despite its uncanny resemblance to some sort

02:25.440 --> 02:32.000
of LCD screen, this thing is in fact nothing but a holder for the torn-off end of a box of film

02:32.000 --> 02:38.400
to serve as a reminder of what you put in it. Interacting with this camera is so delightful.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.400
Everything is where it is because that's where it needed to be. All the controls are physically

02:44.400 --> 02:50.240
connected to the mechanisms they activate, which makes them delightfully chunky. You can see how

02:50.240 --> 02:54.400
turning the film in advance lever cocks the shutter by moving the two halves of the shutter curtain

02:54.400 --> 02:59.360
in unison, and you can even hear the little clockwork mechanism that controls the shutter's

02:59.360 --> 03:07.200
timing at long exposures. Take a listen. Still, even with the constraints in place,

03:07.200 --> 03:13.520
Canon managed to make this brick of a camera decently ergonomic for righties, anyway. Your

03:13.520 --> 03:18.880
thumb, index finger, and middle fingers rest naturally on the film advance shutter release

03:18.880 --> 03:25.680
and front control, respectively. My personal favorite thing is that front control. Push the lever

03:25.680 --> 03:30.960
towards the lens and it closes the aperture so you can get a depth of field preview in the viewfinder.

03:30.960 --> 03:38.080
But turn it the other way, and you can feel that you're winding something up. Well,

03:49.520 --> 03:55.440
I just love that. That's itself timer. Oh, and that little lever on the bottom? That is used to

03:55.440 --> 04:01.680
lock the aperture preview in place and lift the mirror for vibration-free long exposures.

04:01.680 --> 04:06.560
This camera requires no batteries to function, and yet it can do pretty much anything you can

04:06.560 --> 04:13.680
reasonably expect a 35mm camera to do. Well, aside from autofocus and motorized film winding,

04:13.680 --> 04:20.400
I did say this was entirely manual. The F1 was designed to be incredibly modular, though,

04:20.400 --> 04:24.880
and you could accessorize it with all sorts of things from motor drives to different viewfinders

04:24.960 --> 04:30.880
to bulk film backings. This one, though, is in its stock form. It has the standard everything.

04:30.880 --> 04:37.360
And while it does not need any batteries whatsoever to function, it does have a battery compartment

04:37.360 --> 04:43.680
on the bottom. In here lies a small coin battery which powers the light meter. What's a light meter?

04:43.680 --> 04:48.080
Well, it's not a questionable astronomical unit, it's instead an information display.

04:48.720 --> 04:55.040
All right, quick crash course in basic photography. Almost every camera ever can control the amount

04:55.040 --> 05:01.520
of light that hits the film or image sensor in two ways, the lens aperture and the shutter speed.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.360
Inside the lens is a multi-bladed diaphragm that can, to put it in rather basic terms,

05:07.360 --> 05:12.720
reduce the size of the lens's opening through constriction. Those are what the f-numbers on a

05:12.720 --> 05:18.160
lens are, and the higher the number, the more constricted that opening becomes. Thus, the less

05:18.160 --> 05:23.840
light makes it through to the film or sensor. A side effect of this is that the depth of field,

05:23.840 --> 05:28.480
that's the range of depths that are in focus, becomes deeper the more constricted the lens

05:28.480 --> 05:33.440
becomes. That means that more of the image is in focus, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans,

05:33.440 --> 05:40.080
when a higher f-number, and thus smaller aperture, is used. Note that for landscape photography

05:40.160 --> 05:45.360
and other scenarios where nothing is close to the camera, the depth of field becomes more or less

05:45.360 --> 05:51.600
irrelevant. The shutter speed, meanwhile, is, in still photography, the amount of time the shutter

05:51.600 --> 05:57.680
remains open. Leave it open for longer and you can collect more light. Hardly open it at all

05:57.680 --> 06:03.760
and you collect less of it. The trade-off here is that long exposures require very still scenery

06:03.760 --> 06:09.280
and probably a tripod, as any motion will be blurred. Shorter exposures, on the other hand,

06:09.280 --> 06:14.160
will freeze motion, but they require more light through a wider open aperture.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.760
Shutter speed is measured in fractions of a second and this camera is capable of speeds from one

06:19.760 --> 06:25.520
second to one two thousandth of a second. B, short for bulb, will leave the shutter open

06:25.520 --> 06:30.880
as long as the shutter release is pressed. There's an inverse relationship between shutter speed

06:30.880 --> 06:36.160
and aperture. Higher f-numbers allow less light through the lens, which means the shutter has

06:36.160 --> 06:43.040
to stay open longer to collect the same amount of light. And, if a shorter shutter speed is desired,

06:43.040 --> 06:48.880
the aperture has to open wider to allow more light through the lens. In order for the exposure to be

06:48.880 --> 06:54.640
correct, the aperture and shutter speed must be an appropriate combination for the amount of light

06:54.640 --> 07:00.800
available in the scene and the sensitivity of the film or sensor. However, once you know one

07:00.800 --> 07:06.000
combination that works, you can adjust the shutter or aperture up or down so long as you

07:06.000 --> 07:11.200
adjust the other setting appropriately in the opposite direction. The f-numbers, by the way,

07:11.200 --> 07:16.960
are as weird as they seem to be because the number itself is a geometric ratio. But,

07:16.960 --> 07:22.080
we want to have stops at each value that halves or doubles the amount of total light going through

07:22.080 --> 07:28.000
the lens in order to correspond to the available shutter speeds. We call those stops. Stops.

07:28.960 --> 07:34.720
So, now we've come to the metering bit. Every film stock has a certain sensitivity to light,

07:34.720 --> 07:39.760
known as its film speed. The term speed comes from the fact that exposure time will vary

07:39.760 --> 07:45.920
based upon sensitivity, all else being equal. We now call that the ISO, though back when this

07:45.920 --> 07:51.280
camera was made, it was called the ASA, the Initialism for the American Standards Association,

07:51.280 --> 07:56.960
now known as ANSI. See, back then, Germany was doing its own thing with a logarithmic system

07:57.040 --> 08:03.360
they called DIN, the acronym for their standards organization, incidentally. But, in 1974,

08:03.360 --> 08:08.480
the International Standards Organization said, you know, we're just going to mash the ASA and

08:08.480 --> 08:14.560
the DIN together, and now that's the ISO. But, nobody ever remembers the DIN half of it. The

08:14.560 --> 08:22.320
ISO 100 should really be 100 slash 21 degrees. So, in a weird way, we're still using ASA,

08:22.320 --> 08:30.400
but calling it ISO, at least outside of Germany. Anyway, nope, one more tangent, ISO. I say the

08:30.400 --> 08:36.320
three letters. Why? Because ISO and ISO are so close to each other that I don't think it makes

08:36.320 --> 08:42.560
sense to force the acronym. Does it matter? Of course not. It's just, like, my opinion, but

08:42.560 --> 08:47.920
I will at least grant that it's less atrocious than calling this NHTSA, which they're trying real

08:47.920 --> 08:53.840
hard to make a thing in case you hadn't noticed, and I regret to inform you that it's working.

08:55.040 --> 09:00.880
Anyway, modern digital cameras have an ISO setting because you can change the sensitivity of the

09:00.880 --> 09:06.400
image sensor. But, back when we were using good ol' emulsions of silver halides on a clear plastic

09:06.400 --> 09:12.160
backing, you'd be stuck with whatever the sensitivity was of the film you bought. Of course,

09:12.160 --> 09:16.960
there are many kinds of films from many manufacturers, and the film speed is itself

09:16.960 --> 09:22.000
something of a trade-off. More sensitive films are usually grainier, so you'd want to pick the

09:22.000 --> 09:28.480
appropriate film for your situation. But now, well, how are you supposed to know what shutter

09:28.480 --> 09:33.280
speed and aperture setting you should use? You have to get the exposure correct if you want the

09:33.280 --> 09:39.280
resulting image to have decent dynamic range. Otherwise, it will be blown out from overexposure,

09:39.280 --> 09:45.280
or a dark mess without any detail. Well, there are some general rules of thumb you can use in

09:45.280 --> 09:51.200
certain situations. For example, on a clear sunny day, you can use the sunny 16 rule. Set

09:51.200 --> 09:56.400
the aperture to 16 and the shutter speed to the value that most closely matches the film speed.

09:56.960 --> 10:03.360
So, if your ISO is 100, 1 1⁄100 of a second, or the closest available setting, on this camera

10:03.360 --> 10:10.720
it would be 125. This works because a doubling in film speed equals one stop in exposure. It requires

10:10.720 --> 10:16.640
half as much light. And at f16, the correct shutter speeds happen to match the film speed

10:16.640 --> 10:22.320
numerically. If you need a faster shutter speed for a given shot, just open up the aperture in

10:22.320 --> 10:27.920
equal number of stops that you increase the shutter speed to compensate. But news flash,

10:27.920 --> 10:33.360
not every photograph is taken outdoors on a sunny day. Wouldn't it be nice to have something that

10:33.360 --> 10:39.680
can tell you the correct exposure for any given scenario? Enter the light meter. These devices

10:39.760 --> 10:44.560
are able to, with the aid of some sort of light sensor, provide the user with an appropriate

10:44.560 --> 10:50.080
exposure value. These devices were originally handheld and were fairly crude. Generally,

10:50.080 --> 10:54.080
they just have a needle type readout which would point to the appropriate aperture value for a

10:54.080 --> 10:59.280
given film and shutter speed. To use them, you'd bring them to your subject and point them at

10:59.280 --> 11:03.920
something which was close to a middle gray in terms of brightness. Then you'd set your camera up

11:03.920 --> 11:09.440
appropriately. You can still buy handheld light meters today, though they've been digitified

11:09.440 --> 11:14.640
of course, but before long they were integrated into camera bodies themselves. And that's why

11:14.640 --> 11:20.800
this otherwise mechanical camera has a battery compartment. Now, keep in mind that this camera

11:20.800 --> 11:26.640
was originally released in 1971, though this example is a later revision. Its light meter

11:26.640 --> 11:31.600
will be limited to the same sort of analog tech that was found in the handheld meters of the time.

11:32.160 --> 11:38.000
But, and this is why I wanted to make this video, it was done in an extremely clever way that not

11:38.080 --> 11:43.360
only simplified its operation to the user, but allowed for more flexible use of the camera.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.840
The meter appears as a small display to the right of the image in the viewfinder.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.200
Right now, the camera doesn't have a lens on it, but watch what happens when I put one on.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.160
The small circle moved upwards. That circle is mechanically linked to this little piece here.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.040
You can see that as I move it with my finger, the ring moves up and down. This engages with

12:07.040 --> 12:13.200
a small peg on the lens itself. Once installed on the camera, moving the aperture ring on the lens

12:13.200 --> 12:19.280
causes that ring to move. Now, in addition to the ring, there's a small horizontal line.

12:19.280 --> 12:24.960
Right now, it's sitting in the bottom red area. This is actually a needle that will move depending

12:24.960 --> 12:29.920
on how much light the camera sees. And this is where the battery comes into play. You may have

12:29.920 --> 12:35.200
noticed this power switch. All that does is turn on the light meter. That little blue mark in the

12:35.200 --> 12:40.400
meter's display is used as a battery level check. You can see there's a little sticker here reminding

12:40.400 --> 12:46.240
you that to check the battery level, the shutter speed should be set to 2000 and the ASA to 100.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.920
Then, when you move the switch to the check position, the needle should jump up to the

12:49.920 --> 12:55.200
blue mark, and so long as it does, the battery's okay. If it doesn't make it to the blue mark,

12:55.840 --> 13:01.200
well, it's flat, and if it overshoots it, we'll get to that. When the meter is turned on,

13:01.200 --> 13:06.000
you can see the needle move with the amount of light that hits the camera. The brighter the image,

13:06.000 --> 13:12.720
the higher it goes. But where exactly is it measuring? You probably noticed the darker

13:12.720 --> 13:17.920
portion of the viewfinder towards the center. That is the sensitive area of the light meter.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.800
With a lens on, you can see that it's only what's in this area that affects the needle's behavior.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.840
But how is that possible? Where is the actual sensor? Surely we didn't have

13:29.840 --> 13:36.080
transparent light sensors in 1971. Well, maybe we did, but that's not what's going on here.

13:36.080 --> 13:41.440
Again, it's extremely clever. One of the many things you could customize on this camera is the

13:41.440 --> 13:46.560
focusing screen. To remove it, you simply remove the viewfinder by pressing in these little lock

13:46.560 --> 13:54.080
buttons and sliding it towards the rear. And there's the focusing screen. Kind of trippy, huh?

13:54.080 --> 13:57.760
That's what we were looking at in the viewfinder, but now we're looking

13:58.640 --> 14:05.600
down at it. In fact, all the viewfinder is is a prism, a roof pentaprism to be precise,

14:05.600 --> 14:10.800
there to redirect your view from the eyepiece downward and flip the image horizontally.

14:10.800 --> 14:15.440
This creates the distinctive hump you see above the lens on all SLRs to this day,

14:15.440 --> 14:21.200
though I must say I much prefer these sharp lines, which don't hide the nature of the thing,

14:21.200 --> 14:27.440
to the blobular designs of today. Anyway, this is the focusing screen and it too is removable.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.040
Before I even remove it though, something about it seems weird. That darker region appears to be

14:35.840 --> 14:41.440
floating. Now, this is obvious in person thanks to stereoscopic vision, but it might not come

14:41.440 --> 14:46.480
across well on camera. I'll try my best though. At the very least, you can see that the circular

14:46.480 --> 14:52.160
focusing aids in the center are actually separate from that darker region. If I pop the focusing

14:52.160 --> 14:59.440
screen out, you'll get a clue as to why. See that little window there? Look through it. Weird.

15:00.640 --> 15:06.640
That dark region is actually a semi-transparent mirror that is floating in the middle of the

15:06.640 --> 15:12.800
glass somehow. I really want to see how these were manufactured. But anyway, it redirects

15:12.800 --> 15:17.200
some of the light coming up through the focusing screen out this little window,

15:17.200 --> 15:20.320
and if we look from the front, you'll see what lies behind it.

15:21.040 --> 15:26.480
The light sensor. From the looks of it, it seems to be a simple light-dependent resistor, or LDR,

15:26.480 --> 15:30.160
though it's obviously a little fancier than the one in your garden variety, nightlight.

15:30.720 --> 15:35.360
The amount of light that falls on this will, thanks to the battery and the simple electronics it

15:35.360 --> 15:42.560
powers, determine where the needle in the meter lands. So, in the end, that rectangle is simply

15:42.560 --> 15:48.640
the dark region left by a semi-transparent mirror embedded in the glass of the focusing screen at

15:48.640 --> 15:56.400
a 45 degree angle so it can redirect a portion of the light onto the sensor. That's what I call

15:56.400 --> 16:00.480
neat. Now that we know where the meter measures, how it works, and what it does,

16:01.440 --> 16:06.880
how does one use it? You may very well have figured it out by now. This variety of meter is

16:06.880 --> 16:14.320
called a match needle meter, and that ring, well, it's your target. To use this camera's light meter,

16:14.320 --> 16:18.720
you first point the camera so that something in the scene that's not too bright or too dark is

16:18.720 --> 16:23.840
within that metering region. Light meters and cameras are generally calibrated to a middle

16:23.840 --> 16:30.160
gray value, and this is no exception. Now, simply turn the aperture ring on the lens until the ring

16:30.240 --> 16:35.680
surrounds the needle. You are now set to the correct exposure setting, so you can recompose your shot,

16:35.680 --> 16:42.880
however you like, hit the shutter release, and you're done. One exposure down, 23, maybe 35 more to go.

16:43.680 --> 16:49.520
But what if that combination isn't what I want? Maybe I have to stop the lens way, way down in

16:49.520 --> 16:54.960
order to match the needle's position and expose correctly. I'll lose my sweet, sweet bokeh.

16:55.920 --> 17:00.080
Well, nothing a little after the fact AI-powered image processing can't fit. I mean,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.880
that's no problem at all. Simply adjust the shutter speed so that it's faster.

17:05.600 --> 17:10.880
Bah, the needle moved. Here's where the other part of this genius system comes in.

17:11.440 --> 17:17.200
The actual sensitivity of the light meter itself is affected by both the selected shutter speed

17:17.200 --> 17:22.320
and also the film speed. Perhaps you noticed this little insert in the shutter speed dial.

17:22.320 --> 17:26.560
Rotate the dial while pulling up on it, and you can change the film speed setting,

17:26.560 --> 17:32.160
which will make the meter more or less sensitive. And the shutter speed alone has the same effect.

17:32.800 --> 17:38.560
Increasing shutter speed causes the needle to fall down, which means you need to open the lens up to

17:38.560 --> 17:44.480
match. Now, you could have worked this out in your head by just counting the stops to, say, f2,

17:44.480 --> 17:49.200
and then increasing the shutter speed by the same number of stops. But having the meter work

17:49.200 --> 17:54.000
differently depending on the shutter speed offers a sort of sanity check. It also demonstrates the

17:54.000 --> 17:59.680
relationship between shutter speed and aperture beautifully. Each stop you move in shutter speed

17:59.680 --> 18:04.880
requires two clicks of the aperture ring to compensate. Two clicks because this lens has

18:04.880 --> 18:12.000
detents at half stops. Most elegantly, though, the matching nature allows for shutter priority or

18:12.000 --> 18:18.320
aperture priority exposure. Rather than just point the camera at the scene and find a combo that works,

18:18.320 --> 18:22.720
you can fix one of those variables ahead of time and adjust the other as needed.

18:23.360 --> 18:30.960
Say you want a stopped down aperture of f16 for a deep depth of field. Well, set the lens to f16

18:30.960 --> 18:36.240
and keep changing the shutter speed until the needle gets in that ring. Or perhaps you need a

18:36.240 --> 18:41.920
fast shutter speed to freeze motion in action shots. Simply set the shutter speed to a thousand

18:41.920 --> 18:48.160
and move the aperture ring until the ring surrounds the needle. Easy! This metering arrangement

18:48.160 --> 18:53.520
is not only intuitive, but it's flexible and also just a great teaching aid to those learning

18:53.520 --> 18:57.600
photography. You see hints of it in modern interfaces, and then of course there's even

18:57.600 --> 19:02.720
more powerful stuff these days like histograms and whatnot, but there's just something about

19:02.720 --> 19:08.880
the way this works that is beautifully elegant to me. Should we talk about the weirdness, though?

19:08.880 --> 19:14.160
Let's talk about the weirdness. First, there's a limit to its range of operation. Watch what

19:14.240 --> 19:19.120
happens as I approach a shutter speed of one second. At a quarter of a second, the meter

19:19.120 --> 19:26.080
turns red. It doesn't exactly stop working, but it behaves erratically. If I increase the film speed

19:26.080 --> 19:33.120
to 1600, the meter goes red at a 30th of a second. And here, at really slow shutter speeds, the needle

19:33.120 --> 19:39.040
just stops changing at all, even when it should. Now the meter is definitely not working right.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.120
What's going on here is that the meter is a lot simpler than you may imagine.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.760
Changing the shutter speed setting simply changes how sensitive the meter becomes.

19:47.760 --> 19:52.000
As you slow the shutter, you need to close the aperture down and equivalent stops for the same

19:52.000 --> 19:57.600
exposure. The meter needs to move the needle higher to indicate that, which means the needle

19:57.600 --> 20:03.360
becomes more sensitive to given amounts of light. But the same thing needs to happen when you increase

20:03.360 --> 20:09.200
the film speed. If you doubled the film speed, you'd need half as much light for the same exposure,

20:09.200 --> 20:14.480
so the needle needs to move one stop higher. Doubling the film speed demands that the sensitivity

20:14.480 --> 20:20.320
of the meter change exactly as if the shutter speed were cut in half. And the simplest way to do this?

20:21.200 --> 20:26.720
Just shift everything over. The needle will indicate the same apertures for a doubled film

20:26.720 --> 20:33.280
speed as it would for a halved shutter speed. So, if you can shift those sensitivities around,

20:33.280 --> 20:38.960
you can adjust the meter for different film speeds. That's exactly what changing the film speed

20:39.040 --> 20:43.600
setting does. In fact, that's literally what it does because we're dealing with a mechanical

20:43.600 --> 20:49.200
contraption. Adjusting the film speed essentially relocates the different sensitivities of the

20:49.200 --> 20:55.280
light meter independently of the camera's shutter mechanism. There are more meter sensitivities

20:55.280 --> 21:00.880
than there are shutter speeds on the high end, but there aren't on the low end. The meter just

21:00.880 --> 21:08.000
isn't sensitive enough to tell you how to expose a low light shot. So, as the film speed increases,

21:08.000 --> 21:13.760
the lowest speed settings become locked out because that sensitivity is now assigned to a

21:13.760 --> 21:19.760
higher shutter speed. Each doubling of film speed locks out the next lowest shutter speed.

21:20.400 --> 21:25.360
In the end, the meter is just an analog device that's been finely calibrated to move the needle

21:25.360 --> 21:30.720
logarithmically. Each doubling of light landing on the sensor makes it move the same distance

21:30.720 --> 21:35.360
upward. I imagine each sensitivity level is just adding a different resistor to the mix.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
Which brings us to the next bit of weirdness, batteries. When this camera was made, we were

21:42.000 --> 21:46.640
still manufacturing mercury batteries because, you know, we hadn't yet come to grips with the fact

21:46.640 --> 21:51.680
that the garbage can isn't a magic receptacle that just makes things harmlessly disappear forever.

21:51.680 --> 21:58.800
The trouble is, mercury batteries produced 1.35 volts. That's a weird voltage these days.

21:58.800 --> 22:03.600
While you can buy a replacement battery that fits perfectly in the battery compartment,

22:03.680 --> 22:09.120
it will likely be a 1.5 volt alkaline battery. You might not think that's enough to matter,

22:09.120 --> 22:14.000
but remember this is an all analog system which is calibrated to behave logarithmically.

22:14.560 --> 22:20.320
The voltage matters a lot and those batteries simply do not work. They push the needle way too

22:20.320 --> 22:24.800
high and it will never give you an accurate reading. If you do a battery check with one of

22:24.800 --> 22:30.960
these alkaline batteries, the needle will end up all the way up here. Trust me, I know. That same

22:30.960 --> 22:37.520
sort of error makes its way into every metering scenario. However, there is a solution. Zinc

22:37.520 --> 22:41.600
air batteries, which produce electricity through reacting with oxygen in the air,

22:41.600 --> 22:46.800
are commonly available. They're pretty neat, all on their own, featuring a surprisingly large energy

22:46.800 --> 22:52.080
density due to the nature of the reaction, but they have a time-limited life because you can't

22:52.080 --> 22:57.520
stop the reaction once you remove the adhesive pull tab. However, for some applications like

22:57.520 --> 23:03.280
hearing aids, this drawback is more than made up for by their energy density. And most importantly,

23:03.280 --> 23:09.200
the voltage they produce is close enough to 1.35 that they can be used in cameras like these.

23:09.840 --> 23:14.320
Now you can buy a zinc air drop-in replacement online for about five bucks,

23:14.320 --> 23:20.000
but you'll be quickly annoyed with that option since, as I said, they have a built-in time limit.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.320
So, pro tip, get yourself some 675 hearing aid batteries. They're about the same thickness as

23:26.320 --> 23:31.840
the PX625 battery this camera is designed to take, and although they're not the right diameter,

23:31.840 --> 23:37.040
a simple loop of wire insulation will center it well enough. You may need to bend the camera's

23:37.040 --> 23:41.520
negative tab up slightly, but this simple modification allows you to use batteries you

23:41.520 --> 23:46.800
can buy at Walmart for about a buck a piece. And as a happy accident, the battery compartment

23:46.800 --> 23:52.240
cover has a couple of holes allowing air in, but they're small enough that in my experience,

23:52.320 --> 23:57.520
a battery will last a good couple of months before it's dead. You might also have asked,

23:57.520 --> 24:03.520
where is the meter's display, and how is it lit? You can see it in the viewfinder quite clearly,

24:03.520 --> 24:10.320
but when you remove the viewfinder, you find just a blank hole where it was. Well, the meter is actually

24:10.320 --> 24:16.880
right here. It's tiny, and this piece of translucent plastic up here is what illuminates it.

24:17.440 --> 24:21.680
Old cameras are filled with all these clever intricate mechanisms. I mean,

24:21.680 --> 24:26.640
think about the linkage connecting the shutter speed dial to the tiny little indicator in the meter.

24:27.680 --> 24:32.480
It's amazing. Oh, and you could purchase a different viewfinder, which had its own battery and

24:32.480 --> 24:36.720
light source for the meter, but this was never really super useful since the meter doesn't

24:36.720 --> 24:41.520
work in low light anyway. For outdoor photography, that little window works surprisingly well.

24:42.240 --> 24:48.640
Speaking of, did you notice the off position of the meter is also marked flash? How does that work?

24:49.360 --> 24:55.200
Well, it doesn't. Remember, there's no automatic anything, and when this camera was made,

24:55.200 --> 25:00.320
you'd use a chart on your flash itself to set exposure correctly based on film speed and

25:00.320 --> 25:06.560
distance to the subject. Oh, and that's why the shutter speed 60 is marked in orange. That's the

25:06.560 --> 25:12.400
flash synchronization speed of this camera or the fastest shutter speed where the entire shutter is

25:12.400 --> 25:17.760
open at once and thus suitable for use with the flash. Since this camera's shutter curtain moves

25:17.760 --> 25:23.280
horizontally, its shutter is pretty slow, and you can see even with the smartphone's slow-mo

25:23.280 --> 25:29.280
that any speed above 60 doesn't expose the film all at once. This can actually create distortion

25:29.280 --> 25:35.600
in certain scenarios. So in a funny way, this old camera has a rolling shutter. Go figure.

25:36.240 --> 25:42.240
The shutter mechanism alone is just incredibly intricate and also fascinating. I mean, the

25:42.240 --> 25:48.000
curtains themselves are made of titanium, and they're flexible. They roll up into these little

25:48.000 --> 25:53.520
compartments here and move as one unit when you cock the shutter and advance the film. You can

25:53.520 --> 25:59.600
see the seam right here. But with the press of just one button, they move apart and come back

25:59.600 --> 26:06.480
together with precise control in a fraction of a second. All done entirely mechanically. Amazing.

26:07.280 --> 26:11.600
This little thing here is the old style flash hookup, though up here in the film rewinder is

26:11.600 --> 26:17.360
an older style of hot shoe. These little contacts here, along with those inside the plug, are bridged

26:17.360 --> 26:23.520
right when the shutter is entirely open, signaling an electronic flash to flash. But anyway, now

26:23.520 --> 26:27.840
we're getting well into the nitty gritty, which we'll save for later. I hope you enjoyed this

26:27.840 --> 26:33.360
look into the old fashioned light metering systems of yesteryear. While it's fundamentally very

26:33.360 --> 26:39.840
simple, a lot of ingenuity was built in to make it usable, intuitive, and flexible. But we've just

26:39.840 --> 26:45.200
scratched the surface on how this camera takes pictures. What about the film itself? How does

26:45.200 --> 26:51.360
that store an image? And what about film development? How do film negatives become printed photographs?

26:52.000 --> 26:58.080
Oh, don't worry. There's a lot more to explore with analog photography. And before long,

26:58.080 --> 27:00.240
we'll get there. See you in the dark room.

27:04.160 --> 27:10.160
Single lens reflex also so- I'll race, screw it up. And it's great because I have to retake the

27:10.160 --> 27:17.520
other line too. I don't like how I said fundamental. I forgot I need to open that. The more constricted

27:17.520 --> 27:22.880
that opening becomes, thus the less light, less light. That means that more of the image is in

27:22.880 --> 27:28.720
focus at once, much to the chagrin of bokeh fans. But a higher F, oh, dang it. Yeah, I forgot.

27:29.440 --> 27:38.400
Forgot the delivery. So, so, we'll move it over there. How about that? But nobody ever did,

27:39.600 --> 27:46.640
nobody ever did believe. It's going so well. But in 1974, the International Standards Association

27:46.640 --> 27:50.640
said, organization. Dang it.
