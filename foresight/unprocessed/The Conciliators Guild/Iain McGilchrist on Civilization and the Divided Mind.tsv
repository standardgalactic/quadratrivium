0	11000	I think that there is something in us that is that we can recognize which is a drive towards power. It's what the Greeks call hubris.
11000	18000	It's the desire to be like the gods to be able to say we can do anything we can make anything.
18000	30000	And this was always, of course, in Greek tragedy, this is the theme of Greek tragedy, is that the hero becomes hubristic, and as a result, there is a catastrophe, literally a downfall.
30000	40000	And this is how civilizations work, they overreach themselves, they do, they get, they get to believe they can do anything and everything.
41000	50000	And as a result, they become unwieldy, they become less creative, they become more stultified by bureaucracy, and eventually they lose morale.
50000	63000	I think that's a very important point, because one of the effects of over bureaucracy, or too great bureaucracy, is that those who are subject to its control lose their morale.
63000	78000	And this is the reason it's not very hard to reason why is it so hard to recruit doctors and nurses and police and military people, because they no longer feel they've got any autonomy or that respectful them as experts.
78000	82000	Instead, they have to follow procedures set down by a sporadic bureaucracy.
82000	97000	And this, of course, is the death of everything except mediocrity and eventually collapse of a civilization.
97000	106000	Welcome Ian. Ian McGillchrist, scientist, scholar, practicing, or formerly practicing clinical psychiatrist.
106000	117000	And if I dare say also philosopher, welcome Ian to this podcast, we're very happy to have you at the conciliators podcast.
117000	125000	Ian, you're very well known for having to written two books that have had a huge impact on a lot of people.
125000	143000	The first is the master and his emissary, which I have right here, or that when I read, I must say, hit me a bit like a lightning bolt, because what it did, as I think it does to many people is to reflect back to us.
143000	148000	There are ways that we think that had not been quite crystallized in our minds.
148000	161000	And I think by doing that, you really helped us see who we are. Number one, and in that sense that book is a is a strong and powerful reflection of ourselves.
161000	180000	And the second book is the matter with things, the two volume sets also here will show a fantastic trip from physiology up to the sacred and everything in between.
180000	195000	In both books, your paradigm of looking at the two hemispheres the left and the right hemisphere of our brains, and, and therefore the outlooks that we have from each of them out onto the world penetrates both books.
195000	206000	And especially in the matter with things, it's tremendous how you show through that, how our minds connect culture to our values to the very perception of the world.
206000	212000	And then back again, the how those affect our mind in a kind of circle.
212000	225000	So, these are, these are great books and we're very happy to have you here for this. What, what brings us together in a way is that we're both fans, I think of Patrick O'Fields who wrote the moderate grip.
225000	231000	A short cornflakes really not a book a pithy book.
231000	235000	It has all the virtues that my work doesn't have.
235000	243000	Well, they're certainly different, but they both, they both have a tremendous and powerful impact both.
243000	259000	And on Patrick's, the reason we want to speak to today is is that Patrick's book really makes a point about that civilizations decline and what they do so they do so quickly, and they very much do so due to overshoot.
259000	264000	They very much like to hear from you about your perception of where we are.
264000	267000	Where is our society at.
267000	272000	Why is it like that due to your perception of things.
272000	284000	But first, before we even get into that, maybe just to give everybody a baseline. Could you just give us a bit of a description of the left and right hemisphere how they work.
284000	289000	And that people know what the base of paradigm that you have put forward is.
289000	300000	And also, also importantly, why is it that we have these two modes of, of working evolution that for a reason.
300000	302000	Yes, yes.
302000	310000	I like the way you described the matter with things as starting in physiology and ending with the sacred.
310000	322000	And as I think that I don't see the realm of matter and consciousness as rigidly separate.
322000	334000	As a result, I see them as facets of one another. And what I might need to battle away from slightly is the idea that what I'm doing is exactly explaining things.
334000	342000	I think there's a sense in which I explain things, but it's by showing likenesses, rather than saying this causes that.
342000	349000	So I'm not talking about the brain as a cause. I'm talking about the brain as something that we need to take into account.
349000	355000	It can talk to us about our own thought processes. And that's its importance for me.
355000	375000	So here we have two distinct hemispheres and quite how distinct they are can be pointed up by the fact that only 2% of neurons actually cross from one hemisphere to the other through a structure at the base of the brain called the corpus callosum.
375000	386000	It's also worth pointing out that the corpus callosum is a mammalian invention and that up until mammals, there wasn't even that rather exiguous connection between the two hemispheres.
386000	392000	There were very, very tiny connections called commissures, but that was it.
392000	406000	So this structure of the being two and of there being asymmetrical goes back as far as we can trace it in terms of all creatures where we can look at a neuronal system of any kind, never mind a brain.
406000	409000	There seems to be a distinction and an asymmetry.
409000	419000	Why is that I hold and nobody has come up as far as I'm aware with a better explanation and nobody has told me I'm wrong.
419000	429000	My explanation is that the two hemispheres pay two kinds of attention to the world that may not sound riveting, but attention is in fact incredibly important.
429000	445000	When I first discovered this distinction, the whole import of it didn't entirely hit me and until shortly afterwards, because I had been trained in a sort of paradigm whereby attention was just another so called cognitive function.
445000	452000	That is to see the brain as a machine that somehow mediates whatever it is that we are.
452000	474000	But in fact, attention is something a machine cannot pay attention is the way in which consciousness is disposed towards the world is the manner in which and the direction in which consciousness is disposed towards whatever the rest of the world is outside of ourselves.
474000	498000	The distinction here is that one of the hemispheres, the one that enables us to feed principally, but also to get stuff of all kinds to use to build shelter to, to make tools and so forth, requires a very sharply focused, detailed, narrow beam attention to something that's already prioritized.
498000	504000	We know that it's what we want, we focus it, we fix it, and we get it.
504000	515000	The trouble with that is that being very narrowly targeted and locked on to one tiny thing in the entire expanse of potential experience.
515000	528000	This excludes knowledge of other things that may at the same time be extremely important. I mean above all the presence of a predator, but also the presence of one's kin ones mate ones offspring.
528000	553000	The brain needs to be on the lookout for to protect and to provide for. So the brain needs to be able to give us two kinds of attention at the same time one broad, open, importantly uncommitted as to what it may find vigilant and sustained and the other piecemeal and locked on to something that is already known and familiar and desired.
553000	562000	Now the thing that's important here is that that leads to two different experiential worlds.
562000	576000	The kind of locked narrow targeted very precise attention to something that you're grabbing gives rise to a world that appears to be composed of fragments that are detached from one another.
576000	587000	For the moment static, decontextualized representatives of a category it's a seed it's a bird it's a worm it's a whatever a stick.
588000	594000	In this sense, they are mental constructs.
594000	609000	Whereas the right hemisphere sees the full complexity of the physical reality. So it sees something that is never entirely isolated from everything else that is never completely fixed or static that is not certainly known.
609000	617000	It can be recognized but it always has opened the possibility that it might be something else very important.
617000	636000	It sees things that the left hemisphere ignores it sees the stuff that is necessarily implicit. It sees things that are individual unique and personal, and it sees everything as embodied in a context, not just the context of things surrounding it but also the context of an embodied
636000	648000	being that is approaching it. And this is a world to which we are connected whereas the other one is a world from which we are sort of clinically detached so that we can operate a strike in it.
648000	656000	Now you can see that these seem philosophically highly distinct and I believe they are.
656000	668000	The interesting point I think about this way of thinking is that it is absolutely incontrovertible and not controversial amongst neurologists that there is this attentional difference.
668000	680000	And it's equally not controversial amongst philosophers that attention changes what it is that comes to attention. And all I was really doing was putting these two things together.
680000	699000	So that is, that is it in a nutshell. Why this is important is that we take in different aspects of the world using both our hemispheres, and we alternate between the visions of these hemispheres very rapidly.
699000	715000	And it's not a clear clean cut one that only one hemisphere is attending both hemispheres are attending in their way, they're contributing to an overall picture, but the emphasis changes, depending on what we're up to if we're hungry and in aggressive mode and the left
715000	731000	hemispheres attention dominates. If, if we're not, and we are actually interested in taking in and trying to understand the complexity of the world that we live in then the other one comes before that at the right hemisphere.
731000	734000	So that's it in a nutshell.
734000	748000	I'm a gradian. So, given that, if we look at, if we look at today's world of limited maintenance and characteristics, and then see how you would see those in terms of the hemispheres.
748000	754000	So for example, if I look out on our world in 2024.
754000	772000	I see, I see a lot of polarization, a lot of black and white thinking, fragmentation, even if it's not necessarily physical violence is a lot of sort of virtual violence is a lot of sort of anger, emotional anger and people getting upset over, sometimes over small things
772000	783000	sometimes over larger things but, and then heated and and extreme evaluation of whoever does not hold your position that's one state of affairs.
783000	800000	So that is something radically different, which is, let me just describe it as a kind of bureaucratic world, a world where regulations rule, tiny little regulations but if you have you know a million tiny regulations you're basically can
800000	808000	sunk, because you're spending your whole life dealing with those regulations and almost every aspect of your life.
808000	816000	And of course, the regulations require codification, they require abstracting things, etc, etc.
816000	823000	Those are two aspects of our life that I see, maybe not the more pleasant aspects.
823000	832000	There are others we can look into as well. But for those two, how do those relate then to your to your to have hemispheres.
832000	838000	I think we end up with these qualities.
838000	848000	Well, of course, how we end up with anything is is I don't want people to think that I'm simplistically saying everything is controlled by our brain.
848000	872000	I'd rather say that forces which can be economic and political as well as environmental and emotional and so on conspire to make us adopt a stance towards the world, which is that of the, the left hemisphere I say at the moment.
872000	882000	There are several things to say just at the outset. The first is that the left hemisphere tends to be exclusive, whereas the right hemisphere tends to be inclusive.
882000	894000	The image in the title, the master and his emissary is based on the story of a master who appoints as it were his righteous and best to go about a functionary to go and do a lot of business on his behalf.
894000	906000	He not only knows that he can't afford to deal with all this stuff but that he must actually not be involved in it if he's going to keep an oversight of the picture.
906000	916000	This functionary although he's, he's bright is not very bright and doesn't really understand very much. And because he doesn't understand very much he thinks he understands everything.
916000	935000	This is what's known in psychology as the Dunning Kruger effect the less you know the more you think you know and vice versa. So this figure is adamant and inflexible and an administrator which is a relevant point to what you were mentioning just before this.
935000	945000	So the, what I see happening is that this functionary with its very narrow vision of things that must be regulated.
945000	955000	After all remember that the resonance depth of the left hemisphere is to get power to control things to grab to get to manipulate.
955000	972000	I sometimes say the left hemisphere enables us to apprehend the world in the sense of literally grasping onto it at prehendery and the right hemisphere to understand it to comprehend it in other words to take it all together.
972000	987000	So in this vision of the left hemisphere, it things are black and white. Remember that if you're trying to grab something very quickly, because it's your food, you can't afford to have second thoughts about what it is you have to go for it.
987000	990000	Otherwise, you'll miss the opportunity.
990000	1007000	The right hemisphere is very quick and dirty. And it thinks it's impatient with ambivalence or ambiguity. It wants things to be clarified in a straightforward way, either it's this or it's that the right hemisphere is what Ramachandran.
1007000	1015000	Yes Ramachandran well known neuroscientist calls the devil's advocate in that it's always saying yes but it might be something else.
1015000	1024000	It's even more considered the right hemisphere says well it's not as simple as that, but the left hemisphere tends to be cut and dried black and white.
1024000	1033000	Also, it is wrong. I mean all the things that we used to say almost all the things we used to say about hemisphere difference turn out to be wrong.
1033000	1049000	What I heard I have to get over with people is that they've heard that all that stuff about hemispheres was shown to be completely wrong ages ago. And what that really means is that the first take on it, which, you know, science works by having a rough take on
1049000	1069000	it having to be knocked into shape and things have to be let go of and replaced. But the idea that the left hemisphere was somehow dependable and rational and the right hemisphere was kind of airy fairy needed the left hemisphere to tether it to reality is in fact the inverse of the truth.
1069000	1083000	The left hemisphere on its own, and this is not just me saying this but I can cite a couple of other neurologists who come to the same independent expression that the left hemisphere on its own is delusional.
1083000	1103000	And that's important because I don't use that word in a kind of conversational way. I mean it literally is delusional, in the sense that delusional syndromes, very many interesting ones in neuropsychiatry are almost always because the right hemisphere is not functioning properly and we're
1103000	1119000	reliant on the left. When we're reliant on the left we go astray. It is also by no means unemotional. So one of the most strongly in fact the most strongly lateralized emotion is anger, and it lateralizes to the left hemisphere.
1119000	1132000	So the fact that people become adamant angry is very much what you'd expect. The left hemisphere is also about me. The right hemisphere is more social.
1132000	1147000	The right hemisphere is the one in which there is. It is what makes us what Aristotle called the so on politic on which doesn't mean the political animal. It means the social animal because policy is the is the society, the city.
1147000	1161000	So the right hemisphere is the root of empathy of the ability to feel your way into what other people understand to see the gradations of meaning to make connections, whereas the left hemisphere is about me me me.
1161000	1166000	I need that I'm grabbing that and it's highly competitive.
1166000	1181000	The story I just want to add this in here, which we've been told that we are basically competitive beings and that evolution is all about competition. This is half of a story and actually the lesser half.
1181000	1191000	More important, it's quite true that there is competition and competition is helpful. And it's part of the reasons that we do evolve.
1191000	1204000	But the beings that have been successful in the story of evolution have learned to cooperate. And there is what I call collaboration where you marry cooperation with competition.
1204000	1216000	And these two hemispheres have different attitudes to the other. And the left tends to be in that sense, a narcissist. It's an egotist. And so you get when people are in this mindset.
1216000	1227000	First of all, they're adamant that they're right. They think that reality is clear cut. They think that there is no other point of view but theirs. They are angry when challenged.
1227000	1243000	They believe that they have the moral high ground and they are right and they can see it and all you stupid people can't. So, if that's the way the world looks, then I think that is very much in keeping with the left hemisphere view.
1243000	1261000	Another thing you mentioned is about administration and I think it's incredibly important. I think that what is happening and has happened in previous civilizations is that as they become more complex, many things happen and Patrick offers in his books.
1261000	1275000	And perhaps we should point out that his publishing name is William Orphils. In a kind way, I'd like to say to him, Patrick, it wasn't the Patrick that gave you away. It was the unusual name Orphils. You should have changed that bit.
1275000	1294000	Not the old crutch, did they? But anyway, anyway, Patrick Orphils in his book points out, in modern greatness, I think he points through about half a dozen things, four of them, as it were, bio systemic and two of them being interior to do with mentality really.
1294000	1312000	But I believe administration is the expression of this simple algorithmic way of controlling things. It sees procedures as more important than the actualities of the situation involved.
1312000	1319000	In fact, the situation is itself already replaced by a schematic idea.
1319000	1330000	So one of the differences between the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere is the left hemisphere is the hemisphere of theory, the hemisphere of abstraction of a diagram of a map.
1330000	1342000	And there's nothing wrong with having theories, diagrams and maps. They're important and valuable. But the thing is that they radically simplified compared with the complexity of reality. That's the virtue.
1342000	1359000	They didn't get better by being more and more complex. But the trouble is that it's mistaken in the system for reality. So all the nuances, all the stuff to do with quality rather than quantity, all the things to do with the uniqueness of a case rather than the generality of it.
1359000	1376000	So what it is to do with the embodiment, the meaning of it emotionally, morally and so on is replaced by statistical norms that can be run as it were in the computer or by people who image this way of thinking in the way that they administrate.
1376000	1395000	I see that two of the great attacks on the living world now are AI and bureaucracy that the two of them are in fact a massive push by the left hemisphere to dominate the world.
1395000	1410000	You know, that sounds perhaps a little extreme, but when you come to look at it, it is remarkably consistent throughout the picture that I'm, I'm looking at all the world and the one that you're describing.
1410000	1423000	It's interesting, you've put the focus on AI and bureaucracy and Ophuls, Mr. Ophuls, uses, as I mentioned earlier, also puts a lot of emphasis on overshoot.
1423000	1437000	The reason that this collapse actually is because we do one thing well and they keep doing it too much until the whole system gets too complex and basically collapses of its own weight.
1437000	1447000	I think one could make the case that both in both technology, ie AI now, and bureaucracy over regulation.
1447000	1466000	We will, are we risking that in both. And is that is that also a characteristic of the left hemisphere this tendency to not stop doing what it's doing and just keep adding to what it's doing rather than this you need the right hemisphere to go back into larger context and balance is that right.
1467000	1478000	Very much so yes, the right hemisphere gets fixated it gets stuck it has a stickiness if you like compared with the right hemisphere which has a great degree of flexibility.
1478000	1491000	So you've got a relatively sclerotic rigid way of thinking and and living compared with a much more adaptive and flexible way of thinking and being.
1491000	1504000	You, you're absolutely right and one of the things that some dining dining in Kruger less well known for is a piece of research that resonates very much with me and I imagine with you.
1504000	1512000	I think that when people have a need a fix that certain thing is how this thing must work.
1512000	1522000	They are so reluctant to let go of it that even when they're presented with manifest evidence that it's not working in the way that they have projected in theory at well.
1522000	1536000	I believe that the problem is not that they may have either gone in the wrong direction or have gone in what was originally a very good direction that but that now has become excessive, but that they have not gone far enough.
1536000	1553000	There are redoubled efforts to recruit more management to insist on enforcing the rule and no moment again. Oh goodness perhaps we need to rethink that's something the left hemisphere doesn't say, whereas the right hemisphere even when it's on to something is willing to listen to
1553000	1556000	an alternative point of view.
1556000	1564000	So those, I think that's relevant. I think the other thing that's worth saying is.
1564000	1570000	The left hemisphere seems to have a war on life.
1570000	1578000	One way of thinking about this slightly more sophisticated is that the left hemisphere is rather like a self contained system.
1578000	1595000	What complexity of reality is out there if you like and then there's a room with computers and things like I'm talking of course metaphorically in which things are worked out but this is a relatively hermetic system and what it what it refers to is the products of its own thinking,
1595000	1605000	there's a right hemisphere is always saying but hang on, there's a world out there let's connect back to experience and experience should be able to correct us on this.
1605000	1621000	Now the difficulty is that the left hemisphere really only recognizes what it itself has made and in its desire to have control and it becomes quite paranoid when it doesn't have control.
1622000	1646000	Nature and the body and life are huge rebuffs to this idea of control, because you have to recognize that the body is mortal that we're going to die, you have to recognize that the body has certain, I think enormously important.
1647000	1658000	If you care to look at them from that point of view restrictions on what we can be but very often when you look at a restriction it's also a window on an opportunity.
1658000	1672000	So things come into being through being defined and defining means having borders and borders are what makes anything come into being if they're too rigid then of course it will become sclerotic but as long as they're flexible.
1672000	1689000	You see something through the opportunity is given to you by being molded. So the fact that we have nature imposes if you like if you want to look at it that way certain limits on the way we are also liberations.
1689000	1695000	I mean, I make this point very often that freedom is not just being allowed to do whatever you want.
1695000	1709000	Being allowed to do whatever you want leads to people being fractious unhappy distracted distraught despondent despairing. And if you do this with children, they quickly become completely delinquent and distressed.
1709000	1721000	So having containment having boundaries is actually the secret of true freedom. Freedom comes as the outcome of self discipline.
1721000	1738000	So if you don't have that discipline, you have not freedom but chaos. Freedom is something that is shaped. So I just wanted to say that. So I think that the attack on life is something that helps to explain the obsession with more and more bureaucracy and the the obsession with
1738000	1750000	other things. It's almost as though a secondary point to to amassing power is to defeating life.
1750000	1757000	And as as you were speaking, I was thinking of another horseman of the apocalypse.
1757000	1771000	Otherwise, I don't think we need to get into this too heavily but and that is actually there's a similar effect with ideology, since I work a lot in political arena, ideologies also a closed system, a re presentation of the world.
1771000	1778000	And once one adheres to it. That's it. You're going to expand the world through it.
1778000	1792000	And of course, we also get extremists and ideology because they think the most left brain wish that all I have to do is more and better of this ideology, and the world will be fixed.
1792000	1804000	And that reverse happens, which is that they become destructive forces actually but anyway that's an additional component but Ian I wanted to ask you about something else.
1804000	1811000	I think we're both fans of Matt's Desmond Matias Desmond, and his book. Yeah, we have totalitarianism.
1812000	1824000	And he makes the case that we're in a very vulnerable world where where people are very anxious because their emotional states are completely awry.
1824000	1836000	Therefore they're very vulnerable to manipulation and vulnerable to be taken over almost by mass systems such as a totalitarian system.
1836000	1851000	So, two questions related to that first, do you buy that that we're at risk of a kind of almost global totalitarianism number one, a techno totalitarianism I think is the term that's being used.
1851000	1873000	And secondly, the other question is, some people view this as a kind of cabal a conspiracy of people who are setting this up, whereas I'm more of the school that it's not necessarily kind of almost cartoonish cabal, as much as it's more related to the ideas you're
1873000	1887000	going forward, which is that there is a kind of mode of thought out there, that if fed, if fed sufficiently becomes overpowering and penetrates almost everything that we do.
1887000	1899000	I don't know what's named to give that is it a force is it a way of thought that has force, but I see it more as it's not disembodied it's part of our being.
1899000	1914000	And our marriage to that is what's actually going to create this totalitarianism, should it happen, but what are your thoughts about that, which is kind of the most frightening scenario if you wish of the world we're in.
1914000	1934000	At first point, do you think that that the, the growth of AI will lead to ever tighter control, approaching totalitarianism or becoming frankly totalitarian.
1934000	1953000	I think yes, I think it's very hard to see how we can actually avoid this unless, unless there's some sort of a breakdown which means that the growth of AI itself becomes limited I can't imagine by what that might be it might be by a societal collapse.
1953000	1965000	It might be running out of resources that can fuel the enormously energy, expensive growth of these colossal AI structures.
1965000	1973000	I do think that yes it's a very real threat and hard to see how to avoid it.
1973000	1992000	What I don't think, and here I would agree with you, I don't think that this is so much, I mean there may be individuals who are psychopathically interested in personal power control and amassing of wealth.
1992000	2005000	There may be such people, but I don't think that this is really the, the, either the full explanation or the main explanation. I think that it's something that is bigger than the people who think they're controlling this.
2005000	2018000	I think the big wigs in Silicon Valley who feel like they're bringing about something are themselves the puppets of something that they don't fully understand.
2018000	2027000	They are being controlled as much as anyone else. And it's interesting that bureaucracy is also like this.
2027000	2045000	I don't want to waste time but I can tell you a very short story about Oxford. I gave a lecture a couple of years ago over the internet and afterwards the University of Oxford promised to pay me and I was delighted it was a reasonably decent sum.
2045000	2052000	And in the old days somebody would have put a check in the post job done and I'd have received it three days later.
2052000	2065000	No, now I had to go online onto a platform and do various things and I found that it didn't operate in the way it should do. And never mind there was somebody who was going to hold my hand through this process.
2065000	2079000	This went on for three months. At the end of the three months the person left and said but don't worry there's someone else coming along who will guide you through the next step. And when I got to the next step I had to go on another platform.
2079000	2095000	And at the end of this I was just totally frustrated because I was offered a checklist of things. I had to tick something in the checklist and there were options for all sorts of things like catering, window cleaning and so on.
2095000	2103000	But there wasn't one for delivering a lecture or anything like it. Even teaching, which I had thought was one of the purposes of university.
2103000	2116000	So in the end I rang the university chest which as you know is the finance department of Oxford University. And amazingly enough and this won't happen in the future I got to speak to a real living human being.
2116000	2126000	And I said there's a bit of a nightmare this thing and she said, Oh, tell us about it. It makes our lives so much more difficult. It's so complicated.
2127000	2139000	I don't know what to say I said but I've got to tick some box. What do I do. And she said, Oh, take any box and we'll pay you so I tick window cleaning and assume the money turned up in my account.
2139000	2150000	Now my reason for telling that is that it's just a very vivid example of what I come across all the time that people in bureaucracies are driven mad by the bureaucracy itself.
2150000	2164000	And yet we think that the answer to this is to have a bit more to remedy the problem with the bureaucracy. And this becomes very expensive. One of the things that's now happened of course is that nobody can say we don't need a DEI department.
2164000	2182000	There are people at really very handsome salaries above those of the people that there as it were managing like the actual researchers, the professors, the consultant doctors and so on, are appointed and a lot of money goes into this.
2182000	2197000	And then of course the costs of running this thing become greater. And so the costs of fees go up and people can't afford the fees so universities have to recruit rich people from abroad who don't necessarily clear the normal barriers.
2197000	2200000	The whole thing begins to fragment and fall apart.
2200000	2211000	Again it has been have no longer enough money to do basic things because everything's become so complicated. There's so much admin around it if you could cut through that, you know, and it's just everywhere.
2211000	2227000	So, I see that as part of the problem and it's a bigger problem than the people who are running it. And so what is it. Well, I think that there is something in us that is that we can recognize which is a drive towards power.
2227000	2244000	And that's what the Greeks call hubris. It's the desire to be like the gods to be able to say, we can do anything, we can make anything. And this was always, of course, in Greek tragedy, this is the theme of Greek tragedy, is that the hero becomes
2244000	2259000	a mystic. And as a result, there is a catastrophe literally a downfall. And this is how civilizations work they overreach themselves they do, they get, they get to believe they can do anything and everything.
2259000	2280000	But as a result, they become unwieldy, they become less creative, they become more stultified by bureaucracy, and eventually they lose morale. I think that's a very important point, because one of the effects of over bureaucracy, or too great bureaucracy, is that those who are subject to its control
2280000	2297000	lose their morale. And this is the reason it's not very hard to reason why is it so hard to recruit doctors and nurses and police and militia people, because they no longer feel they've got any autonomy or that respectful them as experts.
2297000	2308000	Instead, they have to follow procedures set down by a sclerotic bureaucracy. And this of course is the death of everything except mediocrity and eventually collapse of a civilization.
2309000	2330000	Is there needs aren't met, and they become miserable, and the cycle spirals down and down. But you mentioned Greek tragedy and it's a useful I think segue, if I can take us with slightly different direction, and, and get your view.
2330000	2340000	In the master in his emissary, you have quite a few chapters about civilizations that for a long while got it right.
2340000	2345000	Ancient Greece, the Renaissance, and others.
2345000	2356000	Could we talk about that a bit and have a better understanding of what does a more balanced civilization, presumably the one we're in is not balanced.
2356000	2376000	What does that look like. You mentioned great tragedy. I remember reading in your book that that the fact that the Greeks invented this possibility of being able to see themselves on the stage through character in a story was a tremendous.
2376000	2388000	If you wish, balance brain exercise right and left working together. The same could possibly be said about Shakespearean theater in Elizabethan England.
2388000	2396000	Tragedy and comedy which I think are more right brain like emotes than anger say.
2397000	2408000	Our hallmarks of Shakespeare. Good story. Tremendous characters that we can all identify with the ambition of jealousy and the fellow, etc.
2408000	2420000	Again, again theater. What else can look for what else are the characteristics of a more balanced civilization hopefully one day we'll get back to more balance.
2420000	2436000	I should forget to mention the Renaissance and the Renaissance man or or human which is something which I think you described as someone who seeks endlessly broader contexts to learn with and to learn and be with.
2436000	2450000	So what can we learn from these civilizations what are their hallmarks in on the kind of more positive side of things rather than than dwelling on our own.
2450000	2471000	Of course it's quite another question how we couldn't bring them about I think that in a moderate greatness Patrick awful says written at the start I think he's creating Wendell Berry I think but saying that the cultures are like organisms they can't be engineered in a certain
2471000	2481000	direction they evolve in their own time to where they can so usually what happens is that things fall apart and there's a long period before they regenerate.
2481000	2493000	I'm sorry to be realistic but the right hemisphere is realistic, whereas the left hemisphere always wants to live in some fantasy in which by its perfect control of things that will bring us through.
2493000	2496000	Having said that.
2496000	2507000	What I think you're looking at there is ways of understanding ourselves which are not those of reduction.
2507000	2520000	Instead of going to smaller parts, fragmenting analyzing and breaking up, you're seeing where something is situated in a much bigger context.
2520000	2534000	As you know the Greeks had two ideas of truth, one was Muthos, which gives us the word myth, and the other was logos, which gives us the word logic.
2534000	2544000	Initially mythos or Muthos was thought to be the greater. It was the one that could actually help us understand the really big things.
2544000	2554000	Whereas logic was a kind of slightly petty fogging business that would go on in a court of law in order to decide whether somebody owed somebody money or not.
2554000	2569000	It was never going to get you to the deep realities. And in some sense, this is a very important insight that our big truths are not incompressible in simple everyday language.
2569000	2582000	It's too explicit. It's too much brings us back to the everyday that we already know. And the secret of understanding is to get beyond what we think we already know to be aware of what it is we don't know.
2582000	2592000	It's a very dangerous situation when you don't know what it is you don't know, and that is the left hemisphere's typical status.
2592000	2616000	So, when we think of the things that make life worth living, they are things like love, sex, religion, nature, poetry, art, music, ritual, myth, narrative.
2616000	2625000	None of these, none of these is well understood by the left hemisphere, because it's always trying to make everything simple and explicit.
2625000	2640000	Whereas the whole point of these other things is not to be collapsed immediately into a banal certainty, but to try and bring us into the presence, the living presence of something that is beyond that and help us to see it.
2640000	2653000	And what I think is important about drama is that it at its very best and in the Greek tragedies and in Shakespeare you see it as its very best.
2653000	2668000	What we are seeing is, as has been said, you know, Shakespeare holds a mirror up to nature that we see ourselves in a way that we can't see if we're locked into ourselves, but we can see ourselves in a rounded way,
2668000	2682000	in a mechanistic way, according to certain principles. And my brother, I might mention Nigel McGilchrist is principally an art historian, but he's written a fabulous book about Pythagoras and the Greek world.
2682000	2693000	And the point that he made was to me a great irony that the Greeks were a civilization that started without, as it were, a state religion.
2693000	2704000	This is not true of Egypt, it wasn't true of Rome, it wasn't true of, but Greece actually started without a body of sacred beliefs that it was going to follow.
2704000	2715000	And it instead, instead of developing either a religion or a specific philosophical structure, it went on to produce philosophers, of course, was drama.
2715000	2723000	And as it were, knowledge was played out in drama, and it was this that gave us an understanding of what humans are.
2723000	2737000	Now, the problem I feel is that we're so much in love with the idea of things that will make us powerful and make us money, that we have prioritized what are known as the STEM subjects over the humanities.
2737000	2752000	And to me, that is a huge problem. Not that there is something wrong with the STEM subjects, and I myself, particularly fond of they're not very good at mathematics, because I think it's extremely beautiful realm.
2752000	2764000	But these things are not an education. They are mainly the learning of procedures and techniques, math is its best isn't that the STEM subjects broadly technology and all these things are engineering.
2764000	2774000	They're learning procedures and techniques and so on, but they don't tell you about humanity, and they don't tell you about how to think and how to feed your way into an understanding of something.
2774000	2782000	And so they reduce us to this very, very much more limited left hemisphere world. And I should just throw in here.
2782000	2792000	And in the first part of the matter of things as you know, it is devoted to neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology.
2792000	2800000	So is, I'm looking at the portals whereby we would get any kind of information really that can help us build knowledge of the world.
2800000	2817000	And I suggest that these are attention, perception, judgment formed on the basis of what we attend to and what we perceive emotional and social intelligence, how to interpret this cognitive intelligence IQ, and a degree of creativity which enables us to shift our perspectives
2817000	2834000	and we can see I see what I'm looking at now. And all of these are better done by the right hemisphere. So the left hemisphere is less imaginative, less intuitive, less insightful and less intelligent.
2834000	2853000	So the trouble is that by doing this we're rendering ourselves less intelligent, less imaginative, less creative. And I think the evidence is around us that we are certainly not getting more intelligent, more insightful, certainly not more wise, and not more creative.
2853000	2862000	I couldn't agree more about the importance of the humanities and deep study.
2862000	2877000	As necessary background knowledge to dealing with the world, including, I would even add to dealing with practical problems in the world because the humanities help us understand context better.
2877000	2885000	Understanding context can never hurt in dealing with even the most practical of problems, including epidemics, including wars, etc.
2885000	2887000	Context is everything.
2887000	2889000	Exactly.
2889000	2890000	Exactly.
2890000	2895000	It changes fundamentally the nature of what things are when you see them in their context.
2895000	2912000	Well, you have this wonderful description in, I think the master and his emissary of a mountain and you say well what is the mountain. Is it the geology of the mountain is it the perception I have of it is it in the mountain of the painting is it how it's used.
2912000	2916000	It all depends on the context.
2916000	2928000	It's an attention the kind of attention that you pay to it. If you pay attention to it as a resource you see one thing. If you pay attention to it as a landmark you see another thing and so on.
2928000	2941000	It all depends on the on the attention you pay and it changes the world which is why I say attention is a moral act it brings the world into being and therefore has effects on the world and on us.
2941000	2959000	And there's just a few more ideas I've looked more with you before we end, but they're important. These ideas, which I think in the end are ways out and when I say ways out I don't mean that tomorrow we can exit the world that we've created at all.
2959000	2967000	But I think we can expand the number of people who think in new ways and hope for the best in that sense.
2967000	2969000	Absolutely.
2969000	2979000	Two, two ideas that that you present in your books that I think are important is one is this an idea of circularity.
2979000	2984000	The idea that that that the world is not is not linear.
2984000	2990000	And it's partly linear I should say it's not not linear it's only partly linear.
2990000	3004000	And it has a particular or even possibly a spiral dimension to it where things return and they evolve in a fashion that's much more circular than than a simple simple sequential line.
3004000	3011000	And that applies to the rise and fall of civilizations and of societies and it's something that you can mine that's one notion.
3011000	3022000	The second is one that is intrigued me since I was a youth but you have a whole chapter in it and no matter with things. And that is the coincidence of opposites.
3022000	3024000	Oh yes.
3024000	3032000	And the reason I'm raising this is because I think you say that opposites with the world is full of opposites is not almost nothing but opposites.
3032000	3035000	They define each other.
3035000	3040000	They need other to come about.
3040000	3046000	They exist without each other. And yet, as we when we're discussing polarization.
3046000	3053000	We're living in a world where increasingly one side wants to annihilate the opposite.
3053000	3063000	Which is, in some ways, if one buys into what you're saying one of the most destructive acts possible because you're destroying yourself in the process.
3063000	3065000	Yes.
3065000	3070000	Yes. How important are those notions as way.
3070000	3081000	These are difficult notions to just, you know, one really needs to read your books frankly to understand them well but what are how important are they in your view in moving.
3081000	3085000	I think they're very very important ideas.
3085000	3089000	I'll say a little about them.
3089000	3098000	I think it was Alan Watts said that trying to have a thing without its opposites is like saying I only want mountains but no valleys.
3098000	3102000	If you think about that you end up with a very dull flat world.
3102000	3116000	You need these both they define one another and they, they also interestingly, if you're not aware of the fact that they, they share far more than we imagine.
3116000	3122000	We're not aware of the dark side of the things that we pursue that we think are good.
3122000	3135000	It's not positive because we've decontextualized it and we've done it for a while and it seemed good, but we therefore make two completely irrational conclusions one is that more will be better which is not necessarily the case and in fact because
3135000	3147000	of the way in which things circle doing more may indeed cause collapse indeed that is awful so serious about civilizations so there we are.
3147000	3160000	But also, we may not see necessarily the good things that we are demonizing that these are things that we demonize may have an element of something rather important in them.
3160000	3164000	And so it's very important to see more than one side of a question.
3164000	3178000	In fact, that is to my mind what objectivity is objectivity isn't seeing things in an unreally detached mechanistic sort of way with all that's human about them.
3178000	3193000	Shaved off that's just a very distorted and very narrow way of looking at the world that won't lead you closer to truth. But what will lead you closer to truth is seeing as many possible aspects of what one's looking at it as possible.
3193000	3211000	In that sense, I think, and I think that, you know, the coincidence of opposites is a profoundly important principle which has been present in in Eastern philosophy and is present in many other philosophies around the world and was present in early Greek philosophy,
3211000	3222000	but was unfortunately ruled out of philosophy until the mid 19th century for about 2000 years following Aristotle so there we are.
3222000	3236000	But the other question the spiral motion and I'm glad you pointed out that it's not just circular, because it's an interesting point here if you look down the shaft of a spiral you see a circle, which seems enclosed and repetitive.
3236000	3249000	If you look along the line of a spiral you see something like a waveform that is moving in a certain direction. And when you put them together you have the spiral which is both moving around and moving onwards.
3249000	3262000	It's interesting if you image them physically, they do look like the waveform and the particle and the particle is what you see when you just looked like that the waveform is what you see when you see the bigger picture.
3262000	3277000	So, and what that means is that things do not tend to work in straight lines I say that not only is space known to be curved but mental space is curved.
3277000	3288000	And the difficulty is that seeing this requires already taking a bigger picture because when you're stuck wherever you are it only seems that you move onwards in line.
3288000	3296000	I mean a good image is that if I look outside the window here, the world seems to me to be flat I happen to know it's not.
3296000	3308000	And if I followed it far enough I come around the other side of the world and eventually come back to where I am. But for local purposes, it just seems to be a straight line leading on and on to America.
3308000	3319000	And so that's that's the difficulty is that people conceive of it as like this because where they are locally it has this look.
3319000	3327000	And that is important because we don't understand that almost everything well I would say everything that exists.
3327000	3341000	And certainly living organisms are massively complex examples of this that what exists is not complication but complexity and the difference is that complication is where you add modules to modules.
3341000	3362000	There's an increasingly linear hierarchy where there's still a logical linear structure and a jet engine is a complicated system, but a complex system is something like a single cell, which has thousands of things going on which we can't even map every second.
3362000	3374000	There are changes, processes that all interlink with one another feed back into one another so it has recursive loops and is intrinsically unpredictable. That is the important point.
3374000	3390000	So a complicated system could be in an ideal world predictable, but complex systems, which is what we're dealing with in this world are not in that sense predictable, which doesn't mean to say they're random.
3390000	3401000	There are very good ideas about where they're likely to go, but that's not the same as being able to predict them. So I think those points are probably worth making about those those shapes.
3401000	3418000	If you don't mind me asking about this. The other element about the civilizations that I did want to explore with you but I thought we didn't have time is, you know, it was fascinating what you said about how the reformation and the enlightenment.
3418000	3423000	There are fairly left hemisphere driven.
3423000	3431000	And I was happy to hear that by the way because even in my youth, even though the term enlightenment is so wonderful.
3431000	3437000	I always found that era a bit sterile, if I can put that term.
3437000	3445000	And then, of course, after we have the industrial revolution in the mid to late 19th century etc.
3445000	3453000	But there's a kind of let me call it a blip in between which I'd like to explore with you which is the romantics.
3453000	3460000	Which was not a long period, but a very, very productive period in terms of.
3460000	3462000	Indeed, indeed.
3462000	3465000	And philosophy both actually both.
3465000	3468000	Oh, very much so. Yes.
3468000	3471000	In Germany in England, etc.
3471000	3473000	Exactly.
3473000	3490000	What is it about that romantic period that struck you as something so interesting and so and that seemed more like a balanced master and his ms like scenario about the romantic period I'm curious because and maybe we
3490000	3497000	enlightenment as well as to why it is unlike its name in a way, rather left.
3497000	3506000	Well, the physicist David Bohm called it the endowment, which is rather nice.
3506000	3514000	I mean, I, I certainly don't wish to appear to be an enemy of the enlightenment.
3514000	3520000	I think if I've been alive at the time might have been a great exponent of its its values.
3520000	3528000	But of course, given time and a greater and broader perspective, we can see more than you could have done living then.
3528000	3544000	And what unfortunately has happened is that something started as being how often do I have to say this started out as being a very useful corrective ended up being taken to hubristic lengths overreaching itself.
3544000	3563000	I think it has been an agent for our destruction and I think the romantics were people who saw where this was going, and they were still able to access ways of seeing the world.
3563000	3585000	And it became more and more detached explicit rationalistic disembedded from our history from our culture. As that process was beginning there was still enough in contact with it and in contact with the natural world to see that here there was something that spoke of something far deeper and more complex
3585000	3592000	than anything that could be rationalized as the right and the good and so on.
3592000	3610000	So I see them as people who tapped into a great source of energy, which led to a real flowering of the best of what the right hemisphere can offer in conjunction with the left hemisphere.
3610000	3622000	So of course one of the many myths one has to dispel is the idea that the right hemisphere is kind of a bit sort of let it all hang out.
3622000	3640000	And it isn't it's far more aware actually of the need for counterbalance for for being to seeing harmonies between things than the left hemisphere is just one good and followed it.
3640000	3664000	And so what they produced there was, I think some of the most highly sophisticated philosophy that the West has ever seen, in particular figures like Shelling and parts of Hegel and parts of Slyamacher and some of the slagal brothers, and so forth.
3664000	3677000	So I think it was a very, very rich point and in England, very importantly both Wordsworth and particularly Coleridge wrote really enormously importantly about these these topics.
3677000	3688000	I think Coleridge's notebooks and his biography a little area are more important than his poems.
3689000	3712000	Probably it was a joint effort but the the preface to the lyrical ballad is another, you know, absolutely seminal work on the nature of imagination and its difference from a sort of loose fantasy that takes you away from reality but in fact only chance of getting into reality and understanding it for the first time.
3712000	3723000	So this was a very, very rich period and it did also produce a great poetry it's interesting that poetry and philosophy went hand in hand they did with Goethe you see.
3723000	3735000	He was both a great philosopher and a scientist and a poet and playwright, and then people like Coleridge who was a poet and a philosopher.
3735000	3750000	He was like Sam Johnson who is an interesting and complicated and almost self contradictory but for that reason really really interesting figure who was a philosopher of a kind who was a poet who was a playwright.
3750000	3768000	So at this period there was this coming together of the arts and philosophy in a way that I think was very rich and fruitful, but then by the middle of the 19th century things started to become more divided, again, and you know there was a division
3768000	3784000	of the direction philosophy was going in, at least in some parts of it, and the arts, but there were still, and who carried on and become the seeds really of the best part of 20th century philosophy the phenomenological philosophers.
3784000	3792000	So people like Nietzsche was mad as a hatter but at times a genius his insight was incredible.
3792000	3808000	And people like pass and CS pass and William James and so forth, running through to Heidegger Merleau-Ponteschela and the rest in Hussle and so forth in the 20th century.
3808000	3817000	So there is a tradition there that is there for the tapping, but we need to rejig the way in which these things are thought of.
3817000	3832000	There is a kind of chauvinism of the left hemisphere as I say in the book, which means that really people only take seriously the less intelligent and less insightful and certainly less wise productions of the left hemisphere.
3832000	3843000	What also I think is really important is that the left hemisphere with its narrow focus naturally tends to bore deeper and deeper into where it is.
3843000	3853000	There are two things about that. One is that it reminds me of the story of the man who'd lost his keys and was looking under the spotlight and somebody asked him where had he lost the keys.
3853000	3865000	He said over there, why are you not looking over there because the light is over here. I think that is an image of how things work in science and philosophy a lot of the time now.
3865000	3877000	And I think the other thing is that we really only can understand highly specialized work, which is important and honorable and good and necessary.
3877000	3898000	If we are also able to see a broad picture. And for some reason, people who are and they're rare able to draw together the strands of these these things are somehow at a disadvantage compared with people who've narrowly researched one very small area,
3898000	3910000	because they can say I'm the world expert on whatever it is. Whereas the price of seeing things broadly is that you can never be the person who has spent his whole life studying one particular thing.
3910000	3921000	So we need to get back to a world that honors what you mentioned is the Renaissance man, you know, this is a very important idea.
3921000	3933000	Well, and and this linkage to ever larger context is ultimately even takes us to the sacred.
3933000	3944000	In fact, one could make the case that the sacred is almost nothing but an ever expanding engagement with an ever expanding context.
3944000	3970000	And if an item, maybe there's no end to it, yes, and I think I've also heard you say correct me if I'm wrong that in fact, we almost absolutely need to return to the sacred as an essential shift in rebalancing ourselves.
3971000	3979000	We are in fact doing the opposite we are seeking material answers to spiritual problems.
3979000	3993000	Is that is that about right is that is that the way you see it and on the sacred and a fabulous last few chapters by the way on on the sacred and
3993000	3997000	yes, so thank you.
3997000	4006000	The chapter on the sacred, which for those who haven't read it I should warn them is a short book in itself, it saves you 100 pages.
4006000	4021000	But writing it costs me more than anything else I've ever written because it's a very difficult subject to talk about it's almost archetypally the thing you cannot directly speak about because language immediately collapses into something else and something familiar which you're trying to get beyond and
4021000	4022000	away from.
4022000	4026000	So, but I do think it's absolutely central.
4026000	4042000	And you know, when you started saying that about how in a way the sacred is where expanding context lead, I was, I was thinking very much of a brilliant passage in Shelling, which I do quote, probably in the epilogue.
4042000	4046000	I can't remember now to the matter of things.
4046000	4065000	But in it he says that when, when people have seen whatever it is they see in the light of the all, and he capitalizes the, what it in the English translation it has been capitalized as the all in order to get, get through to see that it is a deep
4065000	4067000	concept.
4067000	4083000	And that all is something which he sees as the sacred whole that when people have seen that, then they have had real insights into the nature of being and I think this would be true of this is something courage talks about that at times he can only see
4083000	4093000	in fragments, but at other times he can see the all and when he can, he has insights that are otherwise denied him, Wordsworth said the same, all these thinkers thought the same.
4093000	4110000	And Shelling has this image that when we lose the all, we are like people who are treading through a waste of sand, and we're trying to build life by putting together painstakingly grain of sand by grain of sand, but we will never achieve the all this way.
4110000	4126000	I just thought I'd put that in, but I do think that what is missing is the context of something that tells us a few things that we're missing.
4126000	4132000	One is that there is something bigger than us.
4132000	4134000	There is something wiser than us.
4134000	4137000	There is something that knows more than we do.
4137000	4145000	Why should we imagine that with our limited brains, we have reached the summit of understanding.
4145000	4159000	We're evolutionary creatures and those that came before us might have said they had an understanding of everything a mouse might say that if it could speak, but why should we at this stage have that understanding.
4159000	4165000	There may be much more in this imaginative creative world than we are privy to.
4165000	4181000	One thing is that we would regain wonder, and I don't think this is a small thing. I think that the loss of wonder goes with hubris goes with arrogance, and goes with the diminishment of our sense of the human sense of the world.
4181000	4195000	I don't think that all means that you are small in relation to some tyrannical being, but of course it doesn't always the sense of actually being part of something that is much greater than what it is one knows.
4195000	4216000	The third thing is that it would bring us to an understanding that we are all, as it were, only partial beings, only limited beings, and that we are part of one another and that we owe a degree of compassion to one another.
4216000	4227000	And one could say that what is missing from our world is the sense of something that is greater than ourselves, something that is awe-inspiring, and something that is based in love.
4227000	4242000	So I think we won't recover unless we're able to adapt ourselves to that. I was reminded by the fact that Dan Dennett died a week or so ago, and one shouldn't speak ill of the dead, so I won't.
4243000	4264000	But amongst his under follies he wrote a book called Breaking the Spell, by which he meant of course breaking the sense of the being a wonderful and sacred cosmos, and I can hardly think of a more profound missing of the right target.
4264000	4277000	The spell that is being cast over us every minute of our lives is the spell of the machine, and it's that that we need to break.
4277000	4282000	The spell of the machine, interesting. Yes, it could well be.
4283000	4301000	The machine is simply a physical expression of the left hemisphere's will for power, and AI is a very much more advanced expression of the same thing. It's a mechanical expression of the same mentality.
4302000	4321000	You know what I wonder about that is why we are so irrevocably attracted to it. We almost, I mean, a simple question, why can't we get off that path? We are determined to commit a kind of suicide, actually.
4322000	4324000	Yes.
4324000	4339000	Not all of it. Yes, I mean, no, no, well, here I somewhat disagree from Mattias Desmetsch on something he said recently, which is that we seem to have a sort of suicide wish.
4339000	4351000	I'm not sure this is right. I think that, and I have said that we are committing suicide. We're committing intellectual moral and actual physical suicide, I think, as a species.
4351000	4370000	I think that it's a desire for death, because really, everyone is desperate to live longer to find ways of going into ever greater age and perhaps freezing their body and, you know, there's a denial of death, which is I think a very unhealthy thing.
4370000	4382000	And not the opposite of life death is the, is part of the cycle as you were saying of the cycle that is the nature of things, and the opposite of life is not death but mechanicity.
4382000	4390000	And that is what is the danger that life will be eaten up by mechanical thinking.
4390000	4402000	So, where he says that I think what's happening is that we are in love with power and we don't notice, because we're so seduced by it that where it is leading.
4402000	4422000	There are many myths in the history of the East and West, in which people are deceived by an alluring idea. They were seduced by Cersei, they were seduced by the sirens, they were seduced by the Pied Piper.
4422000	4437000	You know, there was something that led them and they didn't like a flock of gathering swine or like a cloud of insects, they were drawn towards something that they couldn't see what it was, and it was their destruction.
4437000	4455000	So, I've recently been thinking and I can't help thinking like this of the phenomenon the really extraordinary phenomenon of sophisticated parasites, the parasites themselves are not actually for sophisticated at all they're usually very simple things, or at least apparently
4455000	4476000	but they have the power to take over and commandeer the nervous system of a higher animal. And so there are these ones that will infect insects to make them behave in ways that are useful for the life cycle of the parasite but completely not in the interest of the host.
4476000	4501000	And the most extraordinary one is toxoplasma which to complete its life cycle, it must get from a rat into a cat. And when a rat is infected with toxoplasma, it changes its behavior completely so it's no longer afraid of rats, it approaches cats, it approaches cats, and therefore aids the work of the parasite.
4501000	4517000	Now this is extraordinary and I don't know quite what to make of it. And I'm not suggesting that physically we have a parasite but there may be a kind of mental parasite, a force, a drive, I don't know what, which is taking us over and governing us.
4518000	4537000	You know, Freud thought that we had drives, Jung thought we had drives, Milton thought that we had drives, in Christianity in general people have thought there were drives that led us to certain places and some we should follow, some we should be wary of and resist.
4537000	4542000	And I think that is a kind of ancient wisdom that we've forgotten.
4542000	4566000	We have and I would even, I would add to it interesting, the terminology actually fits is that in an old Sufi lore, something called the commanding self, which is necessary for life because it is the life force, if you wish to some degree, and thus these drives that you're describing.
4566000	4583000	On the other hand, if it grows too large, it commands your whole life, and command I suppose is similar to the left hemisphere, it's command mode, and it does the following which is I think a wonderful expression.
4583000	4591000	The commanding self prevents you from doing what you want to do.
4591000	4604000	No prevents you from doing what you need to do and makes you do what you don't want to do. In other words, the slide tracks you off. Let's call it a healthier state of being.
4604000	4607000	So, and that's it's like an addiction.
4607000	4618000	Yes, and, and it is a bit like a parasite exactly as you say, except the parasite already in us. Yes.
4618000	4631000	Well, you know, I was staggered to find these, these myths from around the world that approximate to, well, a much more sophisticated versions of the idea of the master and his emissary.
4631000	4636000	You know, in the each thing.
4636000	4654000	There's this, you know, this image of the emperor, who is betrayed by a headstrong general who decides that he knows best. And in this sense, what should be done, and it would be good for all is sacrificed to the will of this headstrong general.
4654000	4668000	And the best of these, of course, is the, the myth with which I begin part three of the matter of things the Onondaga legend of the two brothers which is just the most amazingly accurate.
4668000	4678000	It just staggered me when I just thought these people have perfect insight into how the two hemispheres work together. Anyway,
4678000	4699000	thank you. We've covered a lot of ground. I think you've once again shed a lot of light on why we are where we are. And, and a deeper sense of our more comprehensive self and how we can go beyond where we are.
4699000	4715000	You know, I think at the end of the day, I think you've used these words at some point, what we really need is a kind of the bottom line is a change of heart and a change of mind, not just the change of system.
4715000	4733000	Right. I'm fully on board with that as I know many, many other people are, or we can get your ideas among many others out about these kinds of sensible and necessary changes of mind and heart.
4733000	4744000	Hopefully, we may be able to, in centuries to come, rekindle our better side so thank you for this wonderful.
4744000	4749000	Thank you very much. I hope so. Thank you for emphasizing that. I think it's very important. Yes.
4749000	4762000	There we go. I mean, people want me to give answers, but the answers preclude the thing that the first thing is to change what goes on in here. Otherwise, all the rest of it will be just amount to nothing.
4762000	4767000	And I think your paradigm helps us in that direction.
4767000	4770000	Good. Good. Thank you very much.
