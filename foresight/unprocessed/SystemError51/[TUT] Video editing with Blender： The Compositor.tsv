0	8520	Alright, so this is System Error 51 here again today and interestingly enough on the previous
8520	18080	videos I did about Blender and video editing, I got a lot of people that asked me to do
18080	25160	more with Blender and I finally have some time today because I'm off today of work
25160	32600	and also I was a little bit sick in the last few days, primarily in the last week I had
32600	38600	a little something going on in my throat which wasn't very nice but now I'm back in full
38600	48520	swing and today I'm going to show you a little bit about the compositor of Blender because
48520	54560	as you've seen in my previous videos Blender is quite capable of doing video editing
54560	62440	as such you know with all sorts of wipes, effects, picture-in-picture and all the kind
62440	67000	of crazy nonsense that you might want for your videos, sorry I'm going to drink a little
67000	78400	bit here but today we're going to have another look, oh well we're going to have a look at
78400	85560	another component of Blender that you may or may not know and that component is called
85560	94640	the compositor and with the compositor you may be able to achieve effects such as green
94640	101880	screening because I don't know if some of you have seen the videos I'm doing because
101880	109520	on some of them I'm now using a green screen effect which is, I'm also doing this in German
109520	118080	so this is a little green screen effect that I'm trying to achieve in my disclosure laboratories
118080	127480	videos, it's not entirely perfect but you know the camera also, I mean the camera is
127480	135120	good but the green screen I'm using sometimes has issues with the shadows and all this crazy
135120	141760	nonsense so it's not entirely perfect but I'm trying to do what I can and today we're
141760	146840	going to have a look at how this is achieved in Blender because you can obviously achieve
146840	157440	this in Premiere, if you have this you know on your machine you can use, you can obviously
157440	166560	use Premiere for that or if you use a Mac you can do this with Final Cut Pro and Motion
166560	174600	I think it's called, these are the two tools that would be doing this stuff on your PC
174600	181120	or Mac respectively, I think on the PC if you have Premiere you can also get something,
181120	187440	it's called After Effects which does a lot more than Premiere's build-in effects but
187440	195320	now let's get to the beef of today and we are going to use a different view than this
195320	200520	one but we're going to have to use the timeline, I'll show you why later and today we're not
200520	206000	going to use any 3D crazy nonsense so we can also delete the cube, in fact we can delete
206000	214560	everything in the scene because we don't need any of that for 2D compositing which is why
214560	225560	we are now going to switch to another view and this view is called something and it's
225560	235400	called Node Editor, in the Node Editor right now you see nothing, you can drag this view
235400	246960	around but it will not do very much, in Blender it works with nodes and we can also move all
246960	251800	this view out of the screen because we don't particularly need that, I think we can also
251840	258760	try to eliminate this view for the moment if that's possible at all but I don't think it is
258760	269280	because you would have to merge the views, I kind of did something that looks really weird
269280	277520	right now because I didn't want to split the views so I'm not sure how you can split that
277520	284440	back so let's just move it out of the view for the moment, that was I do apologize sorry,
284440	291040	anyways we are in the Node Editor here and the first thing you want to do is on this lower
291040	300320	part here you want to say node tree type which is what you really want right so here you can
300320	305920	enable the backdrop if you want to use that which might be quite interesting and I'll show you why
305920	313280	later use nodes obviously we want to use nodes there we go we have two default nodes free unused
313280	321280	obviously very important if you delete nodes like so the memory that was occupied by these nodes is
321280	327560	being released which is obviously something that you want to do if you don't necessarily have a
327560	333760	machine like like I do because this is start 8 by the way I'm using Windows 8 and this is called
333760	342040	start 8 buy it five bucks it's you know if you like your start menu from Windows 7 you may want
342040	351040	to and you want to have this back then five bucks isn't a very huge investment to make I also heard
351040	357720	that Microsoft is going to reintroduce the start menu where you on the left have this normal stuff
357720	362600	and on the right side you have crazy nonsense like live tiles you know and there's crazy bullshit but
363560	368360	I was going to say if you don't have a machine like me eight gigabyte of RAM if you just have
368360	374520	four or even sometimes two then it's always good practice to enable free unused because this will
374520	380440	free up a lot of memory backdrop is something that you want to consider using because backdrop
380440	391080	what what this all does is that when you use nodes it will automatically render the rendered image
391400	405240	as a backdrop as like a live wallpaper on on on this you know grid based view yeah so I mean this
405800	412360	all looks all looks very boring right now and it doesn't really do much so we should actually add
412440	422920	some nodes right and to do this we say a node no we say add and we want to have an input because
422920	429240	that might be good maybe go to start with and I prepared a little demo clip so we say movie clip
429960	434360	yeah you in the beginning you can move this around in any way you like so place it somewhere
435000	441960	here and you can also zoom in if you can necessarily read it perfectly so it's like perfectly scalable
442520	448520	you know blender is good for this dynamic rendering and this kind of kind of stuff
449240	455720	so we have a movie clip input node here all these things don't care too much about them
455720	463480	you say open and we say desktop and I blend the tutorial and we say I converted it to Moff to
463480	472120	make things easier so you say open clip boom there's me on a fairly cheap green screen and
473000	479640	in order to see your composited view which is what you may want to do you say add
480680	486360	output in the moment you say viewer and there's another output that you want that you want to add
486360	493240	later viewer okay and in the viewer you want to enable use alpha because you know if you
493880	501080	do multiple compositing or compositing of multiple things that are layering on top of each other
502280	508440	use alpha is very important and it works like if you if you worked with reason you know the
508440	513480	music composition tool then this will look familiar to you because you you go for this
514280	520360	like these are the outputs of your device if you want in like if this is this
520360	524120	were a reason device these would be the outputs and you want to drag a cable
525720	533320	into another input which is this one here see and now there's me right you can also say
534360	538360	you can also define the zoom somewhere if you select your viewer node
539080	545720	um if you you know the options on the right will will change according to the node you're
545720	553720	selecting yeah which is which is very nice um there there was an option to zoom in and out
554760	563480	which i think it's this one here uh no uh zoom here there we go zoom see um there you can adjust
563480	570840	the uh finished view in any way you like right and uh we want to achieve um
571960	580760	the removal of um the the the the green screen obviously yeah which isn't very hard to do in
580760	591000	blender so what you what you then want is to add another node which would be a hang on color
591960	600440	mat no it was mats and uh there you can select a number of um options to to achieve that you
600440	607000	know we we can play around to see what's best and uh i personally achieved the best results
607000	615080	with the color key yeah so if you say uh color key and you drag it in between the the the the
615160	623400	cable you just uh created and put your new node here your device if you want um then it will
623400	631480	you know it it always starts in the in with the inputs and goes through the steps to reach its
631480	636760	destination so here's the input the next thing it would it would be doing is color keying yeah
637640	643800	i i hope that makes sense in in some way um the next thing you want to do is then obviously
643800	649880	choose your color key color yeah and it's always good to practice uh to select uh one of the darker
649880	658920	shades of the color you want to remove um like so for example boom and you can already begin to see
658920	667400	that it starts to recognize um the green parts and and then you can begin to you know play around
667400	675800	with these sort of settings to achieve your green screen desired effect like so uh you can see it's
675800	682120	not entirely perfect but it's already a good start from from from from the beginning so you know
682120	687880	yeah you really have to be careful with the settings here um because sometimes it's not
687880	696600	necessarily perfect you can already see that i'm starting to disintegrate here um you know maybe
696600	705240	if you sort of uh change the color but which is not going to work now obviously um if you don't
705240	712200	want to use this uh note or reset you just do this and it will begin begin again you know key color
713560	720440	if you want to choose another color say here for example and then you can drag this cable
721000	729320	from the output here uh image and then you say you you drag the output image into this image
729880	736040	and you can see there are some better results uh you really have to uh play around with this
736760	745640	to achieve whoa uh eyes without a face um to achieve the desired effect you know it's not it's not
745640	752920	always easy to do with this color key um so let's see oops yeah that's right so if we add another
752920	760040	sort of matte thing let's say um channel key which oftentimes works better than the color key so
760760	772760	image drag this here and drag this here see uh and now you can begin to to try to you know
773320	781640	low and you see it's a lot smoother and a lot better than the other effect so you know like
781640	788840	this i i think i'm pretty happy with this for this demo um usually it it ends up around being
788840	799800	at the 0.98 or 0.97 range at which you achieve a lot of interesting effects and um if you zoom in
799800	807560	you will see that um it's not transparent see i'm not transparent it's just trying to um
808440	815240	make the best out of the situation right uh and since this is filmed in a room you also want to
815240	821800	remove all the other bullcrap right so you say add um uh and it's the stored
821800	832040	uh crop yeah so you put a crop here and it will automatically remove everything so first you have
832040	841720	to you know pump these up a lot and then um you know see left we can now start to
842280	858120	uh do this up would be probably hang on oh no uh down see uh like like so we also want to remove
858120	871720	the couch like this and right would be uh yeah like so see here we go so we now have myself
872600	878120	pretty perfectly cropped i'd say um there's another feature that you might want to use
878840	887880	um which is called color spill yeah so if you go add a color uh no i think it was a matte um
889080	896040	color spill which you would put at the end of the line most probably um and you can say
896920	903640	you know if you if you pump this ratio up or down you can achieve more realistic coloring
903640	910840	effects like so see uh unspill doesn't do very much so unspill actually makes it worse so you
910840	920280	it sometimes depends on what you want to achieve yeah so if you do this you will you see um you get
920280	928120	a lot nicer color effects um if you then want to go and make it a bit better you can say add um
928120	937000	um color and maybe uh add other things to your liking say uh brightness contrast you could put
937000	943000	that here and you know uh play around with the contrast if you know if that's what you like to
943000	949080	do see um it's it's really up to do i'm just going to leave that here for for for you know
949080	958360	demo purposes and the next step that you that you may want to do um before uh you do any of the
958360	967320	color spilling stuff um because i want myself to be more moved to the right and we will do that in
967320	975480	in a moment and um i also want to have a another input let's say movie clip
976120	987400	and we say open i'm going into my um uh folder for disclosure labor laboratories um documents
988200	994920	disclosure laboratories uh media and it's called um i think it's called backdrop animation idle tv
996120	1002360	let me check that real quick yes it is and you say open clip and there you can see it's um
1003000	1008360	um it's a little uh anime a little studio backdrop animation here which doesn't really
1008360	1014840	look good right now but okay um the next thing uh oops you saw for of course uh the next thing you
1014840	1022520	want to do is that um you know if i were you right now you can only use one layer which is really
1022520	1035240	bad so you say um where it was there is something which is called hang on a second uh output um
1035240	1045320	there is alpha over exactly yes you need this color alpha over okay uh and you will this allows
1045320	1053800	you to effectively uh combine two layers yeah so if you now take this one here um the the the last
1053800	1061960	output okay let's move this here uh let's move this here alpha over um if you take the last
1061960	1070040	output the last step of your process and connect it to here yes and then you take your secondary image
1070760	1078520	uh image here okay and another thing you want to enable in the alpha over nodes is convert
1078520	1087800	premium premium pre multiply i never knew what that word means convert premium pre multiply yes
1088520	1094600	you enable this because without this you will get some very interesting alpha mixing effects that
1094600	1102440	will mess up your your image so if you do this uh image here uh now you can see the backdrop uh
1103160	1108600	so you will probably have to switch these around and there we go so now you can see that there's
1108600	1116600	something quite wrong with the uh uh with this one here so if you you know reduce this a little bit
1117320	1128280	like so uh it comes back into the picture but sometimes you know you have to experiment around
1128280	1136440	on on these values to to make this uh to make this better and uh sometimes it also helps to you
1136440	1146600	know uh play around with these algorithm slots because it may you know increase your um
1151080	1155480	your results sometimes it's also good to you know switch around between these
1156280	1163400	and see what's gonna happen you know um it's sometimes it's like that you really have to
1164120	1171400	um play around with the values uh in such a way that uh you remove all the green parts
1172040	1178600	it's it's not always easy as you can see here but you you know you get the idea if you play around
1178600	1189160	with these settings let's try to see if we can make this perfect here oh uh no not this one
1189480	1195960	not this one oh that looks good that's that's lander man you know whoa i'm ghost um
1198040	1205080	you know it's uh sometimes it helps to to do this channel keying thing and to you know
1205800	1212680	play around with these settings uh and sometimes it doesn't it's it's like very fine tuning effect
1212680	1219320	at some point um that you want to play around with sometimes you have to select g and limiting
1219320	1228920	channel is red uh for some weird hilarious reason but this seems to be a good um good setting here
1228920	1237720	almost almost it's it's not always perfect you know let's let's see if we can let's see if we can
1238440	1244520	make this a bit better here but it doesn't really look like um maybe it's also maybe we should
1245720	1253720	it's a shadow see there's a shadow here um let's see if we if we remove the channel key and um
1254760	1265560	say add mat and say um chroma key because sometimes this is also a good way to achieve that
1265560	1273480	yes so we want to have a key color let's say uh like a green but a darker green um
1278360	1286600	it would be good to be able to select a color now because let's just connect these two and then
1287400	1294680	um it already takes into into account these kind of things so if you want to let's say
1296520	1302040	let's say let's remove the color spill and the brightness and contrast for now and just
1302840	1310840	connect that here so we can get the original color here um key color uh this is good because now you
1310840	1317720	can play around with these settings and see uh this in a live environment you know like so um
1318680	1325080	fall off uh fall off should be like this acceptance maybe a bit lower
1328120	1340760	uh not what no cut off no so this is not okay so chroma key is not necessarily something you
1340760	1350760	want in this scenario mat let's say um i never tried i never i never tried king because it's
1350760	1359800	very complicated this kind of node so uh i i didn't really use that um color uh no mat um
1360600	1368840	color key always seems to be the best choice uh in in these scenarios um so i i think for the
1368840	1382280	moment crop um left maybe a little bit less you know like this and up uh no down yeah let's remove
1382280	1390360	that a little bit like the like this okay um then key color let's say something along the lines of
1390360	1395560	this and um let's try to fiddle around with the settings here
1398600	1405720	like so oh yeah this is good this is good this is this is this is necessarily bad but also it
1405720	1413720	isn't good uh but you can try to you know not remove everything but just apart because that
1414680	1422680	may help you if you want let's say this this looks really messy so let's say add um mat
1426200	1433640	channel key put that here um let's see and this is going to be a lot better it seems
1435960	1441960	but also it will make me a lot more transparent which is not necessarily something we want so
1442040	1450760	but if you have a more perfect green screen um red green blue no if you have a better green
1450760	1458040	screen than i do then this may actually be of use to you sometimes it also helps not to remove
1458600	1466040	not to have high to 1.0 see you get a lot of better results with this a lot better results
1466040	1473720	let's just say this this is perfect i'd say um i i i think i'm pretty happy with that yeah and if you
1473720	1489560	say add um um where's mat color spill you put that here uh and you reduce the color here then you
1489560	1496840	can see it's it's looking quite nice at this point and you don't have as a rough of edges as before
1497800	1506200	um so these are tricks you can utilize in in in the uh compositor yeah uh another thing that you
1506200	1513800	may want to do uh right away before you do any color processing is add distort translate
1514120	1525160	uh like this and then you can move myself like so but it will also see it it it it has an effect
1525160	1531160	on on the cropping so but this is this is not a problem because you can you know adjust these
1531160	1543320	to your liking see like this and then also what i want is to have a oops uh hang on right should be
1544520	1553240	like this see and then you can go and uh maybe because my legs are not entirely visible which
1553240	1560520	is really bad so input uh image and this is where it gets complicated because now you want you have
1560520	1569160	three layers yeah and the image is going to be open uh disclosure laboratories and it's going
1569240	1576920	to be the desk that i use that's ray traced it's just a png file and uh you want to um
1578440	1587000	you want you want to have another alpha over node which is add uh color alpha over and you want to
1588920	1592280	uh at this point you will you really want to think what you're going to do
1592920	1601240	yeah so uh the desk should be coming next um you know over the existing
1603000	1610680	layering yeah so you want to have alpha over in this here okay and you want to have the image
1610680	1619080	going in here and that's it see this is pretty much a good replication of what i'm doing
1619880	1624040	normally with my video editing and in the timeline here you can obviously
1624920	1632280	already preview your material which looks really really nice if i may say so myself
1632920	1641320	and then obviously if you're happy with everything that you're doing then you can go back into your
1641320	1650440	or maybe you can also go and um pull up a properties panel like so here yeah uh say
1651320	1659960	properties which is here where you select your rendering preferences say 1280
1660920	1672920	uh by 720 you increase that to 100 percent frame rate is 25 uh untilizing you don't need
1673960	1681880	you select all the bullshit that you would normally select uh say h264 or xvid you select
1681880	1691240	your output folder which is desktop and uh this one here um except and uh that's pretty much it and
1691240	1699240	if you if your display say keep your eye and if you're happy with with that um with all your work
1700280	1707880	then you can you can say uh no render oh yes no render output node in scene obviously um very
1707880	1715160	important because i almost forgot that um right now we only have a viewer here so with this uh
1715160	1723480	lets us view the output uh in our compositor yes but you also want to add output
1727240	1733880	composites yeah which is exactly the same as the viewer except that this one is going to be your
1733880	1740760	render destination this is going to be um what you're going actually going to render into a file
1740760	1746600	yeah this is exactly the same so if i switch somewhere like here um you see it will change the
1746600	1753560	image uh like it does in the viewer and if you say animation it will start to render your images
1753560	1761960	as you can see in the timeline and um that's that's pretty much it yes uh there's not much else
1762760	1770120	to to say about this this is another thing that you can do with video editing um and
