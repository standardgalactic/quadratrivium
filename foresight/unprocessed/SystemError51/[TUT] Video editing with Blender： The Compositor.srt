00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
Alright, so this is System Error 51 here again today and interestingly enough on the previous

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:18,080
videos I did about Blender and video editing, I got a lot of people that asked me to do

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,160
more with Blender and I finally have some time today because I'm off today of work

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:32,600
and also I was a little bit sick in the last few days, primarily in the last week I had

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,600
a little something going on in my throat which wasn't very nice but now I'm back in full

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:48,520
swing and today I'm going to show you a little bit about the compositor of Blender because

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,560
as you've seen in my previous videos Blender is quite capable of doing video editing

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:02,440
as such you know with all sorts of wipes, effects, picture-in-picture and all the kind

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,000
of crazy nonsense that you might want for your videos, sorry I'm going to drink a little

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,400
bit here but today we're going to have another look, oh well we're going to have a look at

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,560
another component of Blender that you may or may not know and that component is called

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:34,640
the compositor and with the compositor you may be able to achieve effects such as green

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,880
screening because I don't know if some of you have seen the videos I'm doing because

14
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,520
on some of them I'm now using a green screen effect which is, I'm also doing this in German

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:58,080
so this is a little green screen effect that I'm trying to achieve in my disclosure laboratories

16
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:07,480
videos, it's not entirely perfect but you know the camera also, I mean the camera is

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:15,120
good but the green screen I'm using sometimes has issues with the shadows and all this crazy

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,760
nonsense so it's not entirely perfect but I'm trying to do what I can and today we're

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,840
going to have a look at how this is achieved in Blender because you can obviously achieve

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:37,440
this in Premiere, if you have this you know on your machine you can use, you can obviously

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,560
use Premiere for that or if you use a Mac you can do this with Final Cut Pro and Motion

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,600
I think it's called, these are the two tools that would be doing this stuff on your PC

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,120
or Mac respectively, I think on the PC if you have Premiere you can also get something,

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,440
it's called After Effects which does a lot more than Premiere's build-in effects but

25
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,320
now let's get to the beef of today and we are going to use a different view than this

26
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,520
one but we're going to have to use the timeline, I'll show you why later and today we're not

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,000
going to use any 3D crazy nonsense so we can also delete the cube, in fact we can delete

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,560
everything in the scene because we don't need any of that for 2D compositing which is why

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:45,560
we are now going to switch to another view and this view is called something and it's

30
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:55,400
called Node Editor, in the Node Editor right now you see nothing, you can drag this view

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:06,960
around but it will not do very much, in Blender it works with nodes and we can also move all

32
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,800
this view out of the screen because we don't particularly need that, I think we can also

33
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,760
try to eliminate this view for the moment if that's possible at all but I don't think it is

34
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:29,280
because you would have to merge the views, I kind of did something that looks really weird

35
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,520
right now because I didn't want to split the views so I'm not sure how you can split that

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,440
back so let's just move it out of the view for the moment, that was I do apologize sorry,

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,040
anyways we are in the Node Editor here and the first thing you want to do is on this lower

38
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:00,320
part here you want to say node tree type which is what you really want right so here you can

39
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,920
enable the backdrop if you want to use that which might be quite interesting and I'll show you why

40
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,280
later use nodes obviously we want to use nodes there we go we have two default nodes free unused

41
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,280
obviously very important if you delete nodes like so the memory that was occupied by these nodes is

42
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,560
being released which is obviously something that you want to do if you don't necessarily have a

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,760
machine like like I do because this is start 8 by the way I'm using Windows 8 and this is called

44
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,040
start 8 buy it five bucks it's you know if you like your start menu from Windows 7 you may want

45
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:51,040
to and you want to have this back then five bucks isn't a very huge investment to make I also heard

46
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,720
that Microsoft is going to reintroduce the start menu where you on the left have this normal stuff

47
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,600
and on the right side you have crazy nonsense like live tiles you know and there's crazy bullshit but

48
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,360
I was going to say if you don't have a machine like me eight gigabyte of RAM if you just have

49
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,520
four or even sometimes two then it's always good practice to enable free unused because this will

50
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,440
free up a lot of memory backdrop is something that you want to consider using because backdrop

51
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:31,080
what what this all does is that when you use nodes it will automatically render the rendered image

52
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:45,240
as a backdrop as like a live wallpaper on on on this you know grid based view yeah so I mean this

53
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,360
all looks all looks very boring right now and it doesn't really do much so we should actually add

54
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:02,920
some nodes right and to do this we say a node no we say add and we want to have an input because

55
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,240
that might be good maybe go to start with and I prepared a little demo clip so we say movie clip

56
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,360
yeah you in the beginning you can move this around in any way you like so place it somewhere

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,960
here and you can also zoom in if you can necessarily read it perfectly so it's like perfectly scalable

58
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,520
you know blender is good for this dynamic rendering and this kind of kind of stuff

59
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,720
so we have a movie clip input node here all these things don't care too much about them

60
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,480
you say open and we say desktop and I blend the tutorial and we say I converted it to Moff to

61
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:52,120
make things easier so you say open clip boom there's me on a fairly cheap green screen and

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,640
in order to see your composited view which is what you may want to do you say add

63
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,360
output in the moment you say viewer and there's another output that you want that you want to add

64
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,240
later viewer okay and in the viewer you want to enable use alpha because you know if you

65
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:21,080
do multiple compositing or compositing of multiple things that are layering on top of each other

66
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,440
use alpha is very important and it works like if you if you worked with reason you know the

67
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,480
music composition tool then this will look familiar to you because you you go for this

68
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,360
like these are the outputs of your device if you want in like if this is this

69
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,120
were a reason device these would be the outputs and you want to drag a cable

70
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,320
into another input which is this one here see and now there's me right you can also say

71
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,360
you can also define the zoom somewhere if you select your viewer node

72
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,720
um if you you know the options on the right will will change according to the node you're

73
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,720
selecting yeah which is which is very nice um there there was an option to zoom in and out

74
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:23,480
which i think it's this one here uh no uh zoom here there we go zoom see um there you can adjust

75
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,840
the uh finished view in any way you like right and uh we want to achieve um

76
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:40,760
the removal of um the the the the green screen obviously yeah which isn't very hard to do in

77
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:51,000
blender so what you what you then want is to add another node which would be a hang on color

78
00:09:51,960 --> 00:10:00,440
mat no it was mats and uh there you can select a number of um options to to achieve that you

79
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,000
know we we can play around to see what's best and uh i personally achieved the best results

80
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,080
with the color key yeah so if you say uh color key and you drag it in between the the the the

81
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:23,400
cable you just uh created and put your new node here your device if you want um then it will

82
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:31,480
you know it it always starts in the in with the inputs and goes through the steps to reach its

83
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,760
destination so here's the input the next thing it would it would be doing is color keying yeah

84
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,800
i i hope that makes sense in in some way um the next thing you want to do is then obviously

85
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,880
choose your color key color yeah and it's always good to practice uh to select uh one of the darker

86
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,920
shades of the color you want to remove um like so for example boom and you can already begin to see

87
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:07,400
that it starts to recognize um the green parts and and then you can begin to you know play around

88
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:15,800
with these sort of settings to achieve your green screen desired effect like so uh you can see it's

89
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,120
not entirely perfect but it's already a good start from from from from the beginning so you know

90
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,880
yeah you really have to be careful with the settings here um because sometimes it's not

91
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,600
necessarily perfect you can already see that i'm starting to disintegrate here um you know maybe

92
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:45,240
if you sort of uh change the color but which is not going to work now obviously um if you don't

93
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,200
want to use this uh note or reset you just do this and it will begin begin again you know key color

94
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,440
if you want to choose another color say here for example and then you can drag this cable

95
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,320
from the output here uh image and then you say you you drag the output image into this image

96
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,040
and you can see there are some better results uh you really have to uh play around with this

97
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:25,640
to achieve whoa uh eyes without a face um to achieve the desired effect you know it's not it's not

98
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,920
always easy to do with this color key um so let's see oops yeah that's right so if we add another

99
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,040
sort of matte thing let's say um channel key which oftentimes works better than the color key so

100
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:52,760
image drag this here and drag this here see uh and now you can begin to to try to you know

101
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:01,640
low and you see it's a lot smoother and a lot better than the other effect so you know like

102
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,840
this i i think i'm pretty happy with this for this demo um usually it it ends up around being

103
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:19,800
at the 0.98 or 0.97 range at which you achieve a lot of interesting effects and um if you zoom in

104
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,560
you will see that um it's not transparent see i'm not transparent it's just trying to um

105
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,240
make the best out of the situation right uh and since this is filmed in a room you also want to

106
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,800
remove all the other bullcrap right so you say add um uh and it's the stored

107
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:52,040
uh crop yeah so you put a crop here and it will automatically remove everything so first you have

108
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:01,720
to you know pump these up a lot and then um you know see left we can now start to

109
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:18,120
uh do this up would be probably hang on oh no uh down see uh like like so we also want to remove

110
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:31,720
the couch like this and right would be uh yeah like so see here we go so we now have myself

111
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,120
pretty perfectly cropped i'd say um there's another feature that you might want to use

112
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:47,880
um which is called color spill yeah so if you go add a color uh no i think it was a matte um

113
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:56,040
color spill which you would put at the end of the line most probably um and you can say

114
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,640
you know if you if you pump this ratio up or down you can achieve more realistic coloring

115
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:10,840
effects like so see uh unspill doesn't do very much so unspill actually makes it worse so you

116
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:20,280
it sometimes depends on what you want to achieve yeah so if you do this you will you see um you get

117
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:28,120
a lot nicer color effects um if you then want to go and make it a bit better you can say add um

118
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,000
um color and maybe uh add other things to your liking say uh brightness contrast you could put

119
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that here and you know uh play around with the contrast if you know if that's what you like to

120
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,080
do see um it's it's really up to do i'm just going to leave that here for for for you know

121
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:58,360
demo purposes and the next step that you that you may want to do um before uh you do any of the

122
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:07,320
color spilling stuff um because i want myself to be more moved to the right and we will do that in

123
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:15,480
in a moment and um i also want to have a another input let's say movie clip

124
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:27,400
and we say open i'm going into my um uh folder for disclosure labor laboratories um documents

125
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,920
disclosure laboratories uh media and it's called um i think it's called backdrop animation idle tv

126
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,360
let me check that real quick yes it is and you say open clip and there you can see it's um

127
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,360
um it's a little uh anime a little studio backdrop animation here which doesn't really

128
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,840
look good right now but okay um the next thing uh oops you saw for of course uh the next thing you

129
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:02,520
want to do is that um you know if i were you right now you can only use one layer which is really

130
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:15,240
bad so you say um where it was there is something which is called hang on a second uh output um

131
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:25,320
there is alpha over exactly yes you need this color alpha over okay uh and you will this allows

132
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:33,800
you to effectively uh combine two layers yeah so if you now take this one here um the the the last

133
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:41,960
output okay let's move this here uh let's move this here alpha over um if you take the last

134
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:50,040
output the last step of your process and connect it to here yes and then you take your secondary image

135
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,520
uh image here okay and another thing you want to enable in the alpha over nodes is convert

136
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:07,800
premium premium pre multiply i never knew what that word means convert premium pre multiply yes

137
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,600
you enable this because without this you will get some very interesting alpha mixing effects that

138
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:22,440
will mess up your your image so if you do this uh image here uh now you can see the backdrop uh

139
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,600
so you will probably have to switch these around and there we go so now you can see that there's

140
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:36,600
something quite wrong with the uh uh with this one here so if you you know reduce this a little bit

141
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:48,280
like so uh it comes back into the picture but sometimes you know you have to experiment around

142
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:56,440
on on these values to to make this uh to make this better and uh sometimes it also helps to you

143
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:06,600
know uh play around with these algorithm slots because it may you know increase your um

144
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,480
your results sometimes it's also good to you know switch around between these

145
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,400
and see what's gonna happen you know um it's sometimes it's like that you really have to

146
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:31,400
um play around with the values uh in such a way that uh you remove all the green parts

147
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,600
it's it's not always easy as you can see here but you you know you get the idea if you play around

148
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:49,160
with these settings let's try to see if we can make this perfect here oh uh no not this one

149
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,960
not this one oh that looks good that's that's lander man you know whoa i'm ghost um

150
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,080
you know it's uh sometimes it helps to to do this channel keying thing and to you know

151
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:12,680
play around with these settings uh and sometimes it doesn't it's it's like very fine tuning effect

152
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,320
at some point um that you want to play around with sometimes you have to select g and limiting

153
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:28,920
channel is red uh for some weird hilarious reason but this seems to be a good um good setting here

154
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:37,720
almost almost it's it's not always perfect you know let's let's see if we can let's see if we can

155
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,520
make this a bit better here but it doesn't really look like um maybe it's also maybe we should

156
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,720
it's a shadow see there's a shadow here um let's see if we if we remove the channel key and um

157
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:05,560
say add mat and say um chroma key because sometimes this is also a good way to achieve that

158
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:13,480
yes so we want to have a key color let's say uh like a green but a darker green um

159
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,600
it would be good to be able to select a color now because let's just connect these two and then

160
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,680
um it already takes into into account these kind of things so if you want to let's say

161
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,040
let's say let's remove the color spill and the brightness and contrast for now and just

162
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:50,840
connect that here so we can get the original color here um key color uh this is good because now you

163
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,720
can play around with these settings and see uh this in a live environment you know like so um

164
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,080
fall off uh fall off should be like this acceptance maybe a bit lower

165
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:20,760
uh not what no cut off no so this is not okay so chroma key is not necessarily something you

166
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:30,760
want in this scenario mat let's say um i never tried i never i never tried king because it's

167
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:39,800
very complicated this kind of node so uh i i didn't really use that um color uh no mat um

168
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:48,840
color key always seems to be the best choice uh in in these scenarios um so i i think for the

169
00:22:48,840 --> 00:23:02,280
moment crop um left maybe a little bit less you know like this and up uh no down yeah let's remove

170
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:10,360
that a little bit like the like this okay um then key color let's say something along the lines of

171
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,560
this and um let's try to fiddle around with the settings here

172
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,720
like so oh yeah this is good this is good this is this is this is necessarily bad but also it

173
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:33,720
isn't good uh but you can try to you know not remove everything but just apart because that

174
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:42,680
may help you if you want let's say this this looks really messy so let's say add um mat

175
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,640
channel key put that here um let's see and this is going to be a lot better it seems

176
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,960
but also it will make me a lot more transparent which is not necessarily something we want so

177
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:10,760
but if you have a more perfect green screen um red green blue no if you have a better green

178
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,040
screen than i do then this may actually be of use to you sometimes it also helps not to remove

179
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:26,040
not to have high to 1.0 see you get a lot of better results with this a lot better results

180
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:33,720
let's just say this this is perfect i'd say um i i i think i'm pretty happy with that yeah and if you

181
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:49,560
say add um um where's mat color spill you put that here uh and you reduce the color here then you

182
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,840
can see it's it's looking quite nice at this point and you don't have as a rough of edges as before

183
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:06,200
um so these are tricks you can utilize in in in the uh compositor yeah uh another thing that you

184
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,800
may want to do uh right away before you do any color processing is add distort translate

185
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:25,160
uh like this and then you can move myself like so but it will also see it it it it has an effect

186
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,160
on on the cropping so but this is this is not a problem because you can you know adjust these

187
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:43,320
to your liking see like this and then also what i want is to have a oops uh hang on right should be

188
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:53,240
like this see and then you can go and uh maybe because my legs are not entirely visible which

189
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,520
is really bad so input uh image and this is where it gets complicated because now you want you have

190
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:09,160
three layers yeah and the image is going to be open uh disclosure laboratories and it's going

191
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,920
to be the desk that i use that's ray traced it's just a png file and uh you want to um

192
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:27,000
you want you want to have another alpha over node which is add uh color alpha over and you want to

193
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,280
uh at this point you will you really want to think what you're going to do

194
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:41,240
yeah so uh the desk should be coming next um you know over the existing

195
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,680
layering yeah so you want to have alpha over in this here okay and you want to have the image

196
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:59,080
going in here and that's it see this is pretty much a good replication of what i'm doing

197
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,040
normally with my video editing and in the timeline here you can obviously

198
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:12,280
already preview your material which looks really really nice if i may say so myself

199
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:21,320
and then obviously if you're happy with everything that you're doing then you can go back into your

200
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:30,440
or maybe you can also go and um pull up a properties panel like so here yeah uh say

201
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:39,960
properties which is here where you select your rendering preferences say 1280

202
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:52,920
uh by 720 you increase that to 100 percent frame rate is 25 uh untilizing you don't need

203
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:01,880
you select all the bullshit that you would normally select uh say h264 or xvid you select

204
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:11,240
your output folder which is desktop and uh this one here um except and uh that's pretty much it and

205
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,240
if you if your display say keep your eye and if you're happy with with that um with all your work

206
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,880
then you can you can say uh no render oh yes no render output node in scene obviously um very

207
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,160
important because i almost forgot that um right now we only have a viewer here so with this uh

208
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:43,480
lets us view the output uh in our compositor yes but you also want to add output

209
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,880
composites yeah which is exactly the same as the viewer except that this one is going to be your

210
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,760
render destination this is going to be um what you're going actually going to render into a file

211
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,600
yeah this is exactly the same so if i switch somewhere like here um you see it will change the

212
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,560
image uh like it does in the viewer and if you say animation it will start to render your images

213
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:21,960
as you can see in the timeline and um that's that's pretty much it yes uh there's not much else

214
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:30,120
to to say about this this is another thing that you can do with video editing um and

215
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,280
and blender okay so we now have a little bit of material here which is about two seconds it's

216
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,520
now being uh it's now it's now rendering and um i hope this was helping you a little bit with

217
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:54,280
um another component in blender that you can use for to your liking um and obviously then

218
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,960
with the finished file you can go and do your normal uh video editing yeah which is i'm not

219
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,880
going to go into that but you know if you want to know how that works with video editing you can

220
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,840
view the other video that i did which amazingly has over 20 000 views and i don't know how that

221
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,880
happened uh but i'm very grateful for your support and and interest into the subject and this little

222
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:27,160
stupid video i did um yeah so uh that's it for the moment i hope you like this and i'll see you again

223
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,520
next time all right thanks see ya
