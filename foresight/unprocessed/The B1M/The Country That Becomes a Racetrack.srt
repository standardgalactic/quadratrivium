1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
It's a sight and a sound that never gets old.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,760
The world's fastest cars twisting and turning through the streets of one of its most picturesque

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,960
cities.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,080
Each year, a country that's smaller than New York's Central Park builds a world-class

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,840
street circuit that spans a third of its length and sees its population grow by more than

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,760
500% overnight.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,600
It's an incredible feat of logistics, engineering and temporary construction that requires some

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,400
serious planning and patience.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:42,840
This is how the world's second smallest nation becomes a racetrack.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,360
The Monaco Grand Prix is an event that turns an entire country on its head, from the resurfacing

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,160
of roads to the construction of stands, barriers, entire media centres and the small matter

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,120
of some 200,000 people arriving in a city that's normally home to 38,000, it's one

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,880
of the most impactful sporting events there is.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,840
First held in 1929, the event made its Formula One debut in 1950 and has since become a

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,040
staple of the world championships, appearing on every season's calendar since 1955, apart

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,280
from in 2020 of course, when almost everything fun was cancelled.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,160
The overall layout of Monaco's track has changed very little over the years, it's

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,680
a small country and there's not much else you could do.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
Outside of the Grand Prix, the routes used as a public road and keeping that up to FIA

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,200
regulations is a serious job.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,080
Prior to each year's racing, about a third of the 3.3km circuit is planed and resurfaced,

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,880
removing any deformations that could impact drivers on what's already considered to be

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,480
one of F1's most challenging routes.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,520
It runs along some of the country's main thoroughfares, so these works and the line

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,720
repainting are carried out largely at night, in sections and over a three week period.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,760
With the track established, things start to move up a gear with the construction of the

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,520
temporary facilities, about six weeks out from the racing.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,760
Much of this is prepabricated away from sight, reducing the setup time in Monaco itself.

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,400
Relying on a team of highly skilled full-time engineers to keep on track, some 600 trucks

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,600
carry grandstands, pit garages, barriers, footbridges and more into the country, completely

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
transforming it.

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
While the pit facilities in Monaco are only temporary structures, they're no less high

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,520
tech than those at permanent circuits.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Arriving in 120 different sections, these modules are lifted into place by crane and

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,040
assembled over just 14 days, creating 450 square metres of space for each of the 12 teams

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,680
across three floors, divided into mechanical, technical and hospitality sections.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,920
With limited open space along the circuit, the majority of the seating is located along

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,760
the waterfront of Porto Cule, with smaller stands located at key positions like the Monte

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,120
Carlo Casino and the entrance of the tunnel section near Portier Cove.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Of course, boats, rooftops and the terraces of surrounding hotels and restaurants all

41
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,760
act as VIP sections for fans.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,160
The circuit's official capacity is 37,000, making it the smallest of any in Formula One,

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,680
but Monaco's unique landscape gives thousands of people views of the track and it has a

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,120
much larger, non-ticketed audience than the other Grand Prix events.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,960
In a normal year, around 200,000 people come into the country for the Grand Prix and 100,000

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
attend the final Sunday.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,440
With so many spectators near the track, over 20,000 square metres of safety mesh and more

48
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,320
than 21km of safety railing are installed to protect the public, buildings and the drivers.

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,720
While the pandemics forced some countries to hold their Grand Prix without spectators,

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,880
Monaco is allowing 40-50% of ticketed seats to be sold, marking the biggest return to

51
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,600
capacity since the disrupted 2020 season.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,760
To keep the country connected while the race is on, a maze of footbridges and gangways

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
is installed.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,560
Then, 670 event marshals are brought in to help coordinate the nearly 3,000 strong team

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,840
that it takes to pull off the event.

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,080
The organisers work hard to minimise disruption as far as possible and access to the circuit

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,200
is largely unrestricted.

58
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,280
It's only completely closed to pedestrians and traffic between 5.30am and 7.30pm on race

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
days.

60
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,800
That's a major break with other circuits like Singapore and Melbourne which remain closed

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
for the duration of the event.

62
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,480
After the racing, everything's cleared away again and the country returns to its more

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
peaceful self.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,800
With its global reach, a place on Formula One's calendar is a highly sought after prize and

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,320
some emerging markets have managed to edge out smaller ones over the years.

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,400
Despite its size, Monaco's unique blend of history, prestige and atmosphere has seen

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,120
it attain a near untouchable status in the world of racing.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,720
All enabled by an incredible team of construction workers and engineers who pull off this amazing

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,360
transformation.

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Most years.
