0	5280	It's a sight and a sound that never gets old.
5280	10760	The world's fastest cars twisting and turning through the streets of one of its most picturesque
10760	11960	cities.
11960	16080	Each year, a country that's smaller than New York's Central Park builds a world-class
16080	20840	street circuit that spans a third of its length and sees its population grow by more than
20840	24760	500% overnight.
24760	29600	It's an incredible feat of logistics, engineering and temporary construction that requires some
29600	32400	serious planning and patience.
32400	42840	This is how the world's second smallest nation becomes a racetrack.
42840	48360	The Monaco Grand Prix is an event that turns an entire country on its head, from the resurfacing
48360	54160	of roads to the construction of stands, barriers, entire media centres and the small matter
54160	60120	of some 200,000 people arriving in a city that's normally home to 38,000, it's one
60120	63880	of the most impactful sporting events there is.
63880	68840	First held in 1929, the event made its Formula One debut in 1950 and has since become a
68840	75040	staple of the world championships, appearing on every season's calendar since 1955, apart
75040	80280	from in 2020 of course, when almost everything fun was cancelled.
80280	85160	The overall layout of Monaco's track has changed very little over the years, it's
85160	88680	a small country and there's not much else you could do.
88680	93360	Outside of the Grand Prix, the routes used as a public road and keeping that up to FIA
93360	96200	regulations is a serious job.
96200	102080	Prior to each year's racing, about a third of the 3.3km circuit is planed and resurfaced,
102080	105880	removing any deformations that could impact drivers on what's already considered to be
105880	108480	one of F1's most challenging routes.
108760	112520	It runs along some of the country's main thoroughfares, so these works and the line
112520	118720	repainting are carried out largely at night, in sections and over a three week period.
118720	122760	With the track established, things start to move up a gear with the construction of the
122760	126520	temporary facilities, about six weeks out from the racing.
126520	132760	Much of this is prepabricated away from sight, reducing the setup time in Monaco itself.
132760	138400	Relying on a team of highly skilled full-time engineers to keep on track, some 600 trucks
138400	143600	carry grandstands, pit garages, barriers, footbridges and more into the country, completely
143600	145600	transforming it.
145600	149600	While the pit facilities in Monaco are only temporary structures, they're no less high
149600	152520	tech than those at permanent circuits.
152520	157000	Arriving in 120 different sections, these modules are lifted into place by crane and
157000	164040	assembled over just 14 days, creating 450 square metres of space for each of the 12 teams
164040	170680	across three floors, divided into mechanical, technical and hospitality sections.
170680	174920	With limited open space along the circuit, the majority of the seating is located along
174920	179760	the waterfront of Porto Cule, with smaller stands located at key positions like the Monte
179760	184120	Carlo Casino and the entrance of the tunnel section near Portier Cove.
184120	188560	Of course, boats, rooftops and the terraces of surrounding hotels and restaurants all
188560	191760	act as VIP sections for fans.
191760	198160	The circuit's official capacity is 37,000, making it the smallest of any in Formula One,
198160	202680	but Monaco's unique landscape gives thousands of people views of the track and it has a
202680	207120	much larger, non-ticketed audience than the other Grand Prix events.
207120	212960	In a normal year, around 200,000 people come into the country for the Grand Prix and 100,000
212960	214960	attend the final Sunday.
214960	220440	With so many spectators near the track, over 20,000 square metres of safety mesh and more
220440	228320	than 21km of safety railing are installed to protect the public, buildings and the drivers.
228320	232720	While the pandemics forced some countries to hold their Grand Prix without spectators,
232720	237880	Monaco is allowing 40-50% of ticketed seats to be sold, marking the biggest return to
237880	242600	capacity since the disrupted 2020 season.
242600	246760	To keep the country connected while the race is on, a maze of footbridges and gangways
246760	247760	is installed.
247760	253560	Then, 670 event marshals are brought in to help coordinate the nearly 3,000 strong team
253560	255840	that it takes to pull off the event.
255840	261080	The organisers work hard to minimise disruption as far as possible and access to the circuit
261080	263200	is largely unrestricted.
263200	269280	It's only completely closed to pedestrians and traffic between 5.30am and 7.30pm on race
269280	270280	days.
270280	274800	That's a major break with other circuits like Singapore and Melbourne which remain closed
274800	277520	for the duration of the event.
277520	281480	After the racing, everything's cleared away again and the country returns to its more
281480	283360	peaceful self.
283360	288800	With its global reach, a place on Formula One's calendar is a highly sought after prize and
288800	293320	some emerging markets have managed to edge out smaller ones over the years.
293320	298400	Despite its size, Monaco's unique blend of history, prestige and atmosphere has seen
298400	302120	it attain a near untouchable status in the world of racing.
302120	307720	All enabled by an incredible team of construction workers and engineers who pull off this amazing
307720	309360	transformation.
309360	317360	Most years.
