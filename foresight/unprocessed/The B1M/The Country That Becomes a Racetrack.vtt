00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
It's a sight and a sound that never gets old.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.760
The world's fastest cars twisting and turning through the streets of one of its most picturesque

00:10.760 --> 00:11.960
cities.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.080
Each year, a country that's smaller than New York's Central Park builds a world-class

00:16.080 --> 00:20.840
street circuit that spans a third of its length and sees its population grow by more than

00:20.840 --> 00:24.760
500% overnight.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.600
It's an incredible feat of logistics, engineering and temporary construction that requires some

00:29.600 --> 00:32.400
serious planning and patience.

00:32.400 --> 00:42.840
This is how the world's second smallest nation becomes a racetrack.

00:42.840 --> 00:48.360
The Monaco Grand Prix is an event that turns an entire country on its head, from the resurfacing

00:48.360 --> 00:54.160
of roads to the construction of stands, barriers, entire media centres and the small matter

00:54.160 --> 01:00.120
of some 200,000 people arriving in a city that's normally home to 38,000, it's one

01:00.120 --> 01:03.880
of the most impactful sporting events there is.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.840
First held in 1929, the event made its Formula One debut in 1950 and has since become a

01:08.840 --> 01:15.040
staple of the world championships, appearing on every season's calendar since 1955, apart

01:15.040 --> 01:20.280
from in 2020 of course, when almost everything fun was cancelled.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.160
The overall layout of Monaco's track has changed very little over the years, it's

01:25.160 --> 01:28.680
a small country and there's not much else you could do.

01:28.680 --> 01:33.360
Outside of the Grand Prix, the routes used as a public road and keeping that up to FIA

01:33.360 --> 01:36.200
regulations is a serious job.

01:36.200 --> 01:42.080
Prior to each year's racing, about a third of the 3.3km circuit is planed and resurfaced,

01:42.080 --> 01:45.880
removing any deformations that could impact drivers on what's already considered to be

01:45.880 --> 01:48.480
one of F1's most challenging routes.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.520
It runs along some of the country's main thoroughfares, so these works and the line

01:52.520 --> 01:58.720
repainting are carried out largely at night, in sections and over a three week period.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.760
With the track established, things start to move up a gear with the construction of the

02:02.760 --> 02:06.520
temporary facilities, about six weeks out from the racing.

02:06.520 --> 02:12.760
Much of this is prepabricated away from sight, reducing the setup time in Monaco itself.

02:12.760 --> 02:18.400
Relying on a team of highly skilled full-time engineers to keep on track, some 600 trucks

02:18.400 --> 02:23.600
carry grandstands, pit garages, barriers, footbridges and more into the country, completely

02:23.600 --> 02:25.600
transforming it.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.600
While the pit facilities in Monaco are only temporary structures, they're no less high

02:29.600 --> 02:32.520
tech than those at permanent circuits.

02:32.520 --> 02:37.000
Arriving in 120 different sections, these modules are lifted into place by crane and

02:37.000 --> 02:44.040
assembled over just 14 days, creating 450 square metres of space for each of the 12 teams

02:44.040 --> 02:50.680
across three floors, divided into mechanical, technical and hospitality sections.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.920
With limited open space along the circuit, the majority of the seating is located along

02:54.920 --> 02:59.760
the waterfront of Porto Cule, with smaller stands located at key positions like the Monte

02:59.760 --> 03:04.120
Carlo Casino and the entrance of the tunnel section near Portier Cove.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.560
Of course, boats, rooftops and the terraces of surrounding hotels and restaurants all

03:08.560 --> 03:11.760
act as VIP sections for fans.

03:11.760 --> 03:18.160
The circuit's official capacity is 37,000, making it the smallest of any in Formula One,

03:18.160 --> 03:22.680
but Monaco's unique landscape gives thousands of people views of the track and it has a

03:22.680 --> 03:27.120
much larger, non-ticketed audience than the other Grand Prix events.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.960
In a normal year, around 200,000 people come into the country for the Grand Prix and 100,000

03:32.960 --> 03:34.960
attend the final Sunday.

03:34.960 --> 03:40.440
With so many spectators near the track, over 20,000 square metres of safety mesh and more

03:40.440 --> 03:48.320
than 21km of safety railing are installed to protect the public, buildings and the drivers.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.720
While the pandemics forced some countries to hold their Grand Prix without spectators,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.880
Monaco is allowing 40-50% of ticketed seats to be sold, marking the biggest return to

03:57.880 --> 04:02.600
capacity since the disrupted 2020 season.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.760
To keep the country connected while the race is on, a maze of footbridges and gangways

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
is installed.

04:07.760 --> 04:13.560
Then, 670 event marshals are brought in to help coordinate the nearly 3,000 strong team

04:13.560 --> 04:15.840
that it takes to pull off the event.

04:15.840 --> 04:21.080
The organisers work hard to minimise disruption as far as possible and access to the circuit

04:21.080 --> 04:23.200
is largely unrestricted.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.280
It's only completely closed to pedestrians and traffic between 5.30am and 7.30pm on race

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
days.

04:30.280 --> 04:34.800
That's a major break with other circuits like Singapore and Melbourne which remain closed

04:34.800 --> 04:37.520
for the duration of the event.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.480
After the racing, everything's cleared away again and the country returns to its more

04:41.480 --> 04:43.360
peaceful self.

04:43.360 --> 04:48.800
With its global reach, a place on Formula One's calendar is a highly sought after prize and

04:48.800 --> 04:53.320
some emerging markets have managed to edge out smaller ones over the years.

04:53.320 --> 04:58.400
Despite its size, Monaco's unique blend of history, prestige and atmosphere has seen

04:58.400 --> 05:02.120
it attain a near untouchable status in the world of racing.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.720
All enabled by an incredible team of construction workers and engineers who pull off this amazing

05:07.720 --> 05:09.360
transformation.

05:09.360 --> 05:17.360
Most years.
