0	11840	Self-organization is one of the most fascinating and pervasive phenomena in our world.
11840	17920	From sand grains assembling into rippled dunes, to cells combining to create highly structured
17920	24280	tissues, to individual insects working to create sophisticated societies, to the coordinated
24280	26800	movement of a school of fish.
26800	32560	What these diverse systems hold in common is their emergent global patterns being derived
32560	38280	solely from the local interactions among relatively simple components.
38280	43840	Researchers are finding in such patterns a new approach to understanding ecosystems through
43840	49440	the process of self-organization.
49440	54760	Understanding biological systems challenges us because they consume energy and are therefore
54760	56600	far from equilibrium.
56600	62200	Thus classical thermodynamics, which has been so successful in developing an atomic
62200	67520	understanding of physical and chemical properties such as temperature and pressure, does not
67520	69600	apply to these systems.
69600	75640	Instead of self-assembling into lower energy states such as the crystal, these energy dissipating
75640	81440	components self-organize into highly dynamic structures through which there is a constant
81440	83480	flux of energy and materials.
85680	92520	Self-organization is a process in which patterns at the global level of a system emerge solely
92520	97520	from numerous interactions among the lower level components of the system.
97520	103600	The rules specifying interactions among the systems components are executed using only
103600	109880	local information without reference to the global pattern.
109880	114880	What is also intriguing about this pattern formation in biological systems and lends
114880	120480	excitement to the study of self-organization in animal groups is the recent realization
120480	126280	that interactions among systems components can be surprisingly simple, even when extremely
126280	131920	sophisticated patterns are built, such as the complex nests of termites, the coordinated
131920	136360	movement of birds in a flock or even human consciousness.
136360	141880	Out of a network of non-linear interactions between simple components, self-organization
141880	147200	can give rise to complex phenomena on the macro level, which then in turn feeds back
147200	153640	to both enable and constrain the components on the local level.
153640	159040	The theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions within biology
159040	162480	and ecology, that of organization and order.
162480	168640	How and why do we get this extraordinary level of organization we see within ecosystems?
168640	174040	As we've previously discussed, the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the disorder
174040	181080	or entropy of a physical or chemical system and its surroundings must increase over time.
181080	186480	In other words, systems left to themselves must become increasingly random.
186480	191840	The ordered energy of a system must degrade eventually to this randomness.
191840	197600	But there are many instances in which physical systems spontaneously create emergent patterns
197600	198600	of order.
198600	204680	For example, despite the destruction that they cause, hurricanes have a very orderly vortex
204680	210800	motion when compared to the random motion of the air molecules in a closed environment.
210800	216240	Even more spectacular is the order created by chemical systems, the most dramatic being
216240	221800	the order associated with life of all kind.
221800	226640	But of course the second law only really tells us about closed systems.
226640	230680	What we're dealing with in ecology though are in fact open systems.
230680	236480	If the system has a high enough exchange with its environment, order can be created in the
236480	242000	system by an even greater decrease in order of the system's surroundings.
242000	248240	In the hurricane example, hurricanes are formed from unequal heating within the atmosphere.
248240	252520	The Earth's atmosphere is then far from thermal equilibrium.
252520	258600	The order of the Earth's atmosphere increases but at the expense of the order of the Sun.
258600	264520	The Sun is becoming more disorderly as it ages and throws off light and material to the
264520	266200	rest of the universe.
266200	272720	The total disorder of the Sun and Earth increases despite the fact that orderly hurricanes are
272720	277160	generated on Earth.
277160	282800	These examples help to illustrate the nature of dissipative systems.
282800	288520	Disappative systems such as the Bernard cells created by boiling water can exhibit dynamic
288520	290560	self-organization.
290560	294560	Such structures are necessarily open systems.
294560	297800	Energy and all matter are flowing through them.
297800	304400	The system is continuously generating entropy but this entropy is actively dissipated or
304400	306760	exported out of the system.
306760	313960	Thus, it manages to increase its own organization at the expense of the order in the environment.
313960	321840	The system circumvents the second law of thermodynamics simply by getting rid of excess entropy.
321840	327800	Plants and animals take in energy and matter in a low energy form as light or food.
327800	332400	They export it back in a high entropy form as waste product.
332400	338280	This allows them to reduce their internal entropy thus counteracting the degradation
338280	340520	implied by the second law.
340520	347640	It is this dissipative catabolic process within ecosystems that constantly produces disorder
347640	353600	in the form of exported low-grade heat that paradoxically makes possible the maintenance
353600	359520	of order in the system through self-organization.
359520	364840	It is this feature to dissipative systems like ecologies that creates the conditions
364840	366840	for self-organization.
366840	372520	Where we can think of a dissipative system as a context where energy is imported and
372520	374360	entropy is exported.
374360	380920	Given that context elements within the system will then self-organize to process whatever
380920	383920	resource is flowing through the system.
383920	387560	This is part of the essence of biological creatures.
387600	394520	Not only are biological systems dissipative but also they perform some internal function.
394520	400280	All biological creatures process energy and matter in some form and elements internal
400280	404040	to the system have to self-organize to do that.
404040	410360	That is to say biological creatures somehow have evolved orderly internal structures that
410360	416320	enable their functionality and this internal functionality to biological entities has no
416320	422080	equivalent within inert physical systems.
422080	427560	This can be understood with reference to the maximum power principle and constructural
427560	430040	law previously talked about.
430040	436640	Where during self-organization the system designs develop and prevail the maximized power intake
436640	443160	energy transformation and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency or according
443200	449520	to the constructal law for a flow system to persist in time it must evolve freely such
449520	452760	that it provides greater access to its currents.
452760	459520	Thus where the second law commands that things should flow from higher to lower energy potential.
459520	465720	The constructal law posits that they evolve in configurations that flow more and more
465720	472400	easily over time and elements in the system will self-organize to achieve this in so doing
472440	476440	producing some macro level pattern of organization.
476440	481800	We can ask then why do all the different parts of an ecosystem appear to fit together so
481800	482800	well?
482800	487920	What is responsible for organizing all the parts, their functional connections and resulting
487920	492560	feedback loops in a way that allows everything to function together?
492560	498680	The amazing answer is that ecosystems organize themselves because the ecosystem is a dissipative
498680	502760	system inside of which is available free energy.
502760	508640	This exergy can be used to create some form of order and functionality through the process
508640	513040	of self-organization.
513040	517480	We've been talking about self-organization on a generalized level but we'll use the
517480	521840	rest of this video to discuss in more detail its basic workings.
521840	526920	Today this process of self-organization is understood to take place through a number
526920	528480	of key stages.
528480	534280	The dynamics of a self-organizing system is typically non-linear because of circular or
534280	537400	feedback relations between the components.
537400	543240	This involves some form of initial randomness or fluctuation, positive feedback loops that
543240	545960	can then amplify these small events.
545960	551360	When this positive feedback reaches its limits it dies out creating negative feedback with
551360	556680	closed detractors forming and finally out of all of this we get the emergence of some
556680	558440	global pattern.
558440	564280	Non-linear systems have in general several stable states and this number tends to increase
564280	570920	or bifurcate as an increasing input of energy pushes the system further from its thermodynamic
570920	572360	equilibrium.
572360	578960	The basic dynamics underlining self-organization is one of variation which explores different
578960	583480	regions in the system's state space until it enters an attractor.
583480	589240	This precludes further variation outside the attractor and thus restricts the freedom
589240	591480	of the system's components.
591480	597600	This is equivalent to the increase of order or decrease of statistical entropy that defines
597600	598600	self-organization.
598600	606440	We'll go over each of these stages in the process separately in more detail.
606440	612560	Many theories surrounding self-organization involve an initial state of randomness within
612560	615840	which fluctuations or noise can take hold.
615840	620800	For example, Prigashin proposes the principle of order from fluctuations.
620800	625520	This may be understood with reference to a simple observation that if the components
625520	630920	in the system are already held within some global form of organization this will likely
630920	632840	resist alteration.
632840	638880	When an ecosystem, organism or some other system is held in an orderly, strong basin
638880	645400	of attraction it is difficult for small events to take hold through self-organization.
645400	653800	We need some initial state of entropy and randomness for this process to take hold.
653800	659000	Some small fluctuation can only really gain traction given positive feedback.
659000	664720	Positive feedback can take hold around some small event and by compounding on its presence
664720	670720	with every iteration work to amplify it into a large systemic effect.
670720	677000	One example of this would be the process whereby bees form swarm attacks against enemies.
677000	684760	When a potential enemy is identified a bee may attack but the bee also releases a pheromone
684760	687360	communicating to others to do likewise.
687360	693280	Thus, for every new bee that attacks we get a stronger accumulation of pheromones placing
693280	696880	an ever greater attraction on other bees to join.
696880	702000	This is an example of a positive feedback process synchronizing the states of the bees
702000	705200	as they come to form a swarm around the enemy.
705200	711080	Similarly, positive feedback through pheromone excretion is present in the formation of patterns
711080	713360	within ant colonies.
713360	717960	Another example would be any form of autocatalytic chemical process.
717960	723640	A single chemical reaction is said to have undergone autocatalysis if one of the reaction
723640	730120	products is also a reactant and therefore a catalyst in the same or coupled reaction.
730120	734760	The more reactions we get the more catalysts we will have which will then generate more
734760	736920	reactions and so on.
736920	742760	These are examples of runaway positive feedback that works to cascade through the system aligning
742760	748480	all the elements into some coordinated regime.
748480	754920	As self-organization is an inherently nonlinear process the transition to order as the distance
754920	758920	from equilibrium increases is not usually continuous.
758920	763920	Order typically appears abruptly as characteristic of nonlinear systems.
763920	771120	The threshold between the disorder of chemical equilibrium and order is known as a phase transition.
771120	776440	The conditions for phase transitions can be determined with the mathematics of non-equilibrium
776440	780080	thermodynamics.
780080	785760	Once the process of positive feedback has run its course and met some boundary or formed
785760	790980	a number of different local attractors, their negative feedback starts to take hold once
790980	793560	again creating a stable state.
793560	800560	The British cybernotician W. Ross Ashby proposed what he called the principle of self-organization
800560	806940	noting that a dynamical system independently of its type of components always tends to
806940	812400	evolve towards a state of equilibrium or what we would now call an attractor.
812400	817880	This reduces the uncertainty that we have about the system state and therefore reduces
817880	820240	the system's statistical entropy.
820240	823080	This is equivalent to self-organization.
823080	828200	The resulting equilibrium can be interpreted as a state where the different parts of the
828200	835200	system are mutually adapted and balanced as they form local attractors closing in on themselves
835200	840600	creating what we call closure.
840600	847080	For the outside observer closure determines a clear distinction between inside and outside
847080	851280	and therefore a boundary separating system from environment.
851280	856400	This boundary can encompass all components of the original system.
856400	862520	If the system settles into a negative feedback regime it will be relatively impervious to
862520	864480	external perturbations.
864480	870560	The system has now become responsible for its own maintenance and thus become largely independent
870560	872320	from its environment.
872320	877120	It is thus also closed against influences from the outside.
877120	881800	Although in general there will still be exchanges of matter and energy between the system and
881800	887240	environment, the organization is determined largely by its initial dynamics.
887240	894080	Thus we may say that the system is at this stage thermodynamically open but organizationally
894080	897800	closed.
897800	903920	More generally a self-organizing system may settle into a number of relatively autonomous
903920	910120	organizationally closed subsystems but these subsystems will continue to interact.
910120	915920	These interactions too will tend to settle into self-sufficient closed configurations
915920	922520	defining subsystems at a higher hierarchical level which contain the organizational subsystems
922520	924560	as components.
924560	929680	These higher level systems themselves may interact until they hit on a closed pattern
929680	934480	of interactions thus defining a system of yet higher order.
934480	940320	This goes some way to explaining why complex systems tend to have the hierarchical architecture
940320	946280	we previously discussed, where at each level we can distinguish a number of relatively
946280	949520	autonomous closed organizations.
949520	955720	For example a cell is an organizationally closed system encompassing a complex metabolic
955720	961680	network of interacting chemical cycles within a membrane that protects it from external
961680	962680	disturbances.
963040	969120	However cells are themselves organized into networks and tissues that together form multicellular
969120	970440	organisms.
970440	975920	These organisms themselves are connected by a multitude of food webs collectively forming
975920	983080	the ecosystem.
983080	988840	In this video we've been covering the topic of self-organization within biological systems.
988840	994240	We talked about how the theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions
994240	998520	in biology and ecology that of organization or order.
998520	1004280	In particular how biological systems can evolve to exhibit greater structure and complexity
1004280	1011560	over time by harnessing a dissipative process to enable the self-organization of their constituent
1011560	1014520	elements into a functioning organism.
1014520	1021000	We then discussed the basic workings to this process of self-organization as one that requires
1021000	1026960	some initial state of entropy or randomness where small fluctuations can gain hold and
1026960	1032720	become amplified through positive feedback into new patterns as they come to form stable
1032720	1038560	basins of attraction that close in on themselves producing an emergent global pattern.
