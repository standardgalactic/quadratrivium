1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,840
Self-organization is one of the most fascinating and pervasive phenomena in our world.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,920
From sand grains assembling into rippled dunes, to cells combining to create highly structured

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,280
tissues, to individual insects working to create sophisticated societies, to the coordinated

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,800
movement of a school of fish.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,560
What these diverse systems hold in common is their emergent global patterns being derived

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,280
solely from the local interactions among relatively simple components.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,840
Researchers are finding in such patterns a new approach to understanding ecosystems through

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
the process of self-organization.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,760
Understanding biological systems challenges us because they consume energy and are therefore

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
far from equilibrium.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,200
Thus classical thermodynamics, which has been so successful in developing an atomic

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,520
understanding of physical and chemical properties such as temperature and pressure, does not

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
apply to these systems.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,640
Instead of self-assembling into lower energy states such as the crystal, these energy dissipating

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,440
components self-organize into highly dynamic structures through which there is a constant

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,480
flux of energy and materials.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,520
Self-organization is a process in which patterns at the global level of a system emerge solely

18
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,520
from numerous interactions among the lower level components of the system.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,600
The rules specifying interactions among the systems components are executed using only

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,880
local information without reference to the global pattern.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,880
What is also intriguing about this pattern formation in biological systems and lends

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,480
excitement to the study of self-organization in animal groups is the recent realization

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,280
that interactions among systems components can be surprisingly simple, even when extremely

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,920
sophisticated patterns are built, such as the complex nests of termites, the coordinated

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,360
movement of birds in a flock or even human consciousness.

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,880
Out of a network of non-linear interactions between simple components, self-organization

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,200
can give rise to complex phenomena on the macro level, which then in turn feeds back

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,640
to both enable and constrain the components on the local level.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,040
The theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions within biology

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
and ecology, that of organization and order.

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,640
How and why do we get this extraordinary level of organization we see within ecosystems?

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,040
As we've previously discussed, the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the disorder

33
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,080
or entropy of a physical or chemical system and its surroundings must increase over time.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,480
In other words, systems left to themselves must become increasingly random.

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,840
The ordered energy of a system must degrade eventually to this randomness.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,600
But there are many instances in which physical systems spontaneously create emergent patterns

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
of order.

38
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,680
For example, despite the destruction that they cause, hurricanes have a very orderly vortex

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,800
motion when compared to the random motion of the air molecules in a closed environment.

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,240
Even more spectacular is the order created by chemical systems, the most dramatic being

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,800
the order associated with life of all kind.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,640
But of course the second law only really tells us about closed systems.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,680
What we're dealing with in ecology though are in fact open systems.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,480
If the system has a high enough exchange with its environment, order can be created in the

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,000
system by an even greater decrease in order of the system's surroundings.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,240
In the hurricane example, hurricanes are formed from unequal heating within the atmosphere.

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,520
The Earth's atmosphere is then far from thermal equilibrium.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,600
The order of the Earth's atmosphere increases but at the expense of the order of the Sun.

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,520
The Sun is becoming more disorderly as it ages and throws off light and material to the

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,200
rest of the universe.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,720
The total disorder of the Sun and Earth increases despite the fact that orderly hurricanes are

52
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,160
generated on Earth.

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,800
These examples help to illustrate the nature of dissipative systems.

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,520
Disappative systems such as the Bernard cells created by boiling water can exhibit dynamic

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
self-organization.

56
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Such structures are necessarily open systems.

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Energy and all matter are flowing through them.

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,400
The system is continuously generating entropy but this entropy is actively dissipated or

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,760
exported out of the system.

60
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,960
Thus, it manages to increase its own organization at the expense of the order in the environment.

61
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,840
The system circumvents the second law of thermodynamics simply by getting rid of excess entropy.

62
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,800
Plants and animals take in energy and matter in a low energy form as light or food.

63
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,400
They export it back in a high entropy form as waste product.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,280
This allows them to reduce their internal entropy thus counteracting the degradation

65
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,520
implied by the second law.

66
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,640
It is this dissipative catabolic process within ecosystems that constantly produces disorder

67
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,600
in the form of exported low-grade heat that paradoxically makes possible the maintenance

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,520
of order in the system through self-organization.

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,840
It is this feature to dissipative systems like ecologies that creates the conditions

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
for self-organization.

71
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Where we can think of a dissipative system as a context where energy is imported and

72
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,360
entropy is exported.

73
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Given that context elements within the system will then self-organize to process whatever

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
resource is flowing through the system.

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,560
This is part of the essence of biological creatures.

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Not only are biological systems dissipative but also they perform some internal function.

77
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,280
All biological creatures process energy and matter in some form and elements internal

78
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,040
to the system have to self-organize to do that.

79
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,360
That is to say biological creatures somehow have evolved orderly internal structures that

80
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,320
enable their functionality and this internal functionality to biological entities has no

81
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,080
equivalent within inert physical systems.

82
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,560
This can be understood with reference to the maximum power principle and constructural

83
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,040
law previously talked about.

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Where during self-organization the system designs develop and prevail the maximized power intake

85
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,160
energy transformation and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency or according

86
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,520
to the constructal law for a flow system to persist in time it must evolve freely such

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,760
that it provides greater access to its currents.

88
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,520
Thus where the second law commands that things should flow from higher to lower energy potential.

89
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,720
The constructal law posits that they evolve in configurations that flow more and more

90
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,400
easily over time and elements in the system will self-organize to achieve this in so doing

91
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,440
producing some macro level pattern of organization.

92
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,800
We can ask then why do all the different parts of an ecosystem appear to fit together so

93
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
well?

94
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,920
What is responsible for organizing all the parts, their functional connections and resulting

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,560
feedback loops in a way that allows everything to function together?

96
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,680
The amazing answer is that ecosystems organize themselves because the ecosystem is a dissipative

97
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,760
system inside of which is available free energy.

98
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,640
This exergy can be used to create some form of order and functionality through the process

99
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,040
of self-organization.

100
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,480
We've been talking about self-organization on a generalized level but we'll use the

101
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,840
rest of this video to discuss in more detail its basic workings.

102
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,920
Today this process of self-organization is understood to take place through a number

103
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
of key stages.

104
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,280
The dynamics of a self-organizing system is typically non-linear because of circular or

105
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,400
feedback relations between the components.

106
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,240
This involves some form of initial randomness or fluctuation, positive feedback loops that

107
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,960
can then amplify these small events.

108
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,360
When this positive feedback reaches its limits it dies out creating negative feedback with

109
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,680
closed detractors forming and finally out of all of this we get the emergence of some

110
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,440
global pattern.

111
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,280
Non-linear systems have in general several stable states and this number tends to increase

112
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,920
or bifurcate as an increasing input of energy pushes the system further from its thermodynamic

113
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,360
equilibrium.

114
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,960
The basic dynamics underlining self-organization is one of variation which explores different

115
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,480
regions in the system's state space until it enters an attractor.

116
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,240
This precludes further variation outside the attractor and thus restricts the freedom

117
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,480
of the system's components.

118
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,600
This is equivalent to the increase of order or decrease of statistical entropy that defines

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
self-organization.

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,440
We'll go over each of these stages in the process separately in more detail.

121
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,560
Many theories surrounding self-organization involve an initial state of randomness within

122
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,840
which fluctuations or noise can take hold.

123
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,800
For example, Prigashin proposes the principle of order from fluctuations.

124
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,520
This may be understood with reference to a simple observation that if the components

125
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,920
in the system are already held within some global form of organization this will likely

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
resist alteration.

127
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,880
When an ecosystem, organism or some other system is held in an orderly, strong basin

128
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,400
of attraction it is difficult for small events to take hold through self-organization.

129
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:53,800
We need some initial state of entropy and randomness for this process to take hold.

130
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Some small fluctuation can only really gain traction given positive feedback.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Positive feedback can take hold around some small event and by compounding on its presence

132
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,720
with every iteration work to amplify it into a large systemic effect.

133
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,000
One example of this would be the process whereby bees form swarm attacks against enemies.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,760
When a potential enemy is identified a bee may attack but the bee also releases a pheromone

135
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,360
communicating to others to do likewise.

136
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,280
Thus, for every new bee that attacks we get a stronger accumulation of pheromones placing

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,880
an ever greater attraction on other bees to join.

138
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,000
This is an example of a positive feedback process synchronizing the states of the bees

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
as they come to form a swarm around the enemy.

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,080
Similarly, positive feedback through pheromone excretion is present in the formation of patterns

141
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,360
within ant colonies.

142
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,960
Another example would be any form of autocatalytic chemical process.

143
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,640
A single chemical reaction is said to have undergone autocatalysis if one of the reaction

144
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,120
products is also a reactant and therefore a catalyst in the same or coupled reaction.

145
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,760
The more reactions we get the more catalysts we will have which will then generate more

146
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,920
reactions and so on.

147
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,760
These are examples of runaway positive feedback that works to cascade through the system aligning

148
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,480
all the elements into some coordinated regime.

149
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,920
As self-organization is an inherently nonlinear process the transition to order as the distance

150
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,920
from equilibrium increases is not usually continuous.

151
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Order typically appears abruptly as characteristic of nonlinear systems.

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,120
The threshold between the disorder of chemical equilibrium and order is known as a phase transition.

153
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,440
The conditions for phase transitions can be determined with the mathematics of non-equilibrium

154
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,080
thermodynamics.

155
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,760
Once the process of positive feedback has run its course and met some boundary or formed

156
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,980
a number of different local attractors, their negative feedback starts to take hold once

157
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,560
again creating a stable state.

158
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:20,560
The British cybernotician W. Ross Ashby proposed what he called the principle of self-organization

159
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,940
noting that a dynamical system independently of its type of components always tends to

160
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,400
evolve towards a state of equilibrium or what we would now call an attractor.

161
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,880
This reduces the uncertainty that we have about the system state and therefore reduces

162
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,240
the system's statistical entropy.

163
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,080
This is equivalent to self-organization.

164
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,200
The resulting equilibrium can be interpreted as a state where the different parts of the

165
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,200
system are mutually adapted and balanced as they form local attractors closing in on themselves

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,600
creating what we call closure.

167
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,080
For the outside observer closure determines a clear distinction between inside and outside

168
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,280
and therefore a boundary separating system from environment.

169
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,400
This boundary can encompass all components of the original system.

170
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,520
If the system settles into a negative feedback regime it will be relatively impervious to

171
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,480
external perturbations.

172
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,560
The system has now become responsible for its own maintenance and thus become largely independent

173
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
from its environment.

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,120
It is thus also closed against influences from the outside.

175
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,800
Although in general there will still be exchanges of matter and energy between the system and

176
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,240
environment, the organization is determined largely by its initial dynamics.

177
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Thus we may say that the system is at this stage thermodynamically open but organizationally

178
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,800
closed.

179
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,920
More generally a self-organizing system may settle into a number of relatively autonomous

180
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,120
organizationally closed subsystems but these subsystems will continue to interact.

181
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,920
These interactions too will tend to settle into self-sufficient closed configurations

182
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,520
defining subsystems at a higher hierarchical level which contain the organizational subsystems

183
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,560
as components.

184
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,680
These higher level systems themselves may interact until they hit on a closed pattern

185
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,480
of interactions thus defining a system of yet higher order.

186
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,320
This goes some way to explaining why complex systems tend to have the hierarchical architecture

187
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,280
we previously discussed, where at each level we can distinguish a number of relatively

188
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,520
autonomous closed organizations.

189
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,720
For example a cell is an organizationally closed system encompassing a complex metabolic

190
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,680
network of interacting chemical cycles within a membrane that protects it from external

191
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
disturbances.

192
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,120
However cells are themselves organized into networks and tissues that together form multicellular

193
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,440
organisms.

194
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,920
These organisms themselves are connected by a multitude of food webs collectively forming

195
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,080
the ecosystem.

196
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,840
In this video we've been covering the topic of self-organization within biological systems.

197
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,240
We talked about how the theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions

198
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,520
in biology and ecology that of organization or order.

199
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,280
In particular how biological systems can evolve to exhibit greater structure and complexity

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:51,560
over time by harnessing a dissipative process to enable the self-organization of their constituent

201
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,520
elements into a functioning organism.

202
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:01,000
We then discussed the basic workings to this process of self-organization as one that requires

203
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,960
some initial state of entropy or randomness where small fluctuations can gain hold and

204
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,720
become amplified through positive feedback into new patterns as they come to form stable

205
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,560
basins of attraction that close in on themselves producing an emergent global pattern.
