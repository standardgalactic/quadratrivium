00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
Self-organization is one of the most fascinating and pervasive phenomena in our world.

00:11.840 --> 00:17.920
From sand grains assembling into rippled dunes, to cells combining to create highly structured

00:17.920 --> 00:24.280
tissues, to individual insects working to create sophisticated societies, to the coordinated

00:24.280 --> 00:26.800
movement of a school of fish.

00:26.800 --> 00:32.560
What these diverse systems hold in common is their emergent global patterns being derived

00:32.560 --> 00:38.280
solely from the local interactions among relatively simple components.

00:38.280 --> 00:43.840
Researchers are finding in such patterns a new approach to understanding ecosystems through

00:43.840 --> 00:49.440
the process of self-organization.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.760
Understanding biological systems challenges us because they consume energy and are therefore

00:54.760 --> 00:56.600
far from equilibrium.

00:56.600 --> 01:02.200
Thus classical thermodynamics, which has been so successful in developing an atomic

01:02.200 --> 01:07.520
understanding of physical and chemical properties such as temperature and pressure, does not

01:07.520 --> 01:09.600
apply to these systems.

01:09.600 --> 01:15.640
Instead of self-assembling into lower energy states such as the crystal, these energy dissipating

01:15.640 --> 01:21.440
components self-organize into highly dynamic structures through which there is a constant

01:21.440 --> 01:23.480
flux of energy and materials.

01:25.680 --> 01:32.520
Self-organization is a process in which patterns at the global level of a system emerge solely

01:32.520 --> 01:37.520
from numerous interactions among the lower level components of the system.

01:37.520 --> 01:43.600
The rules specifying interactions among the systems components are executed using only

01:43.600 --> 01:49.880
local information without reference to the global pattern.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.880
What is also intriguing about this pattern formation in biological systems and lends

01:54.880 --> 02:00.480
excitement to the study of self-organization in animal groups is the recent realization

02:00.480 --> 02:06.280
that interactions among systems components can be surprisingly simple, even when extremely

02:06.280 --> 02:11.920
sophisticated patterns are built, such as the complex nests of termites, the coordinated

02:11.920 --> 02:16.360
movement of birds in a flock or even human consciousness.

02:16.360 --> 02:21.880
Out of a network of non-linear interactions between simple components, self-organization

02:21.880 --> 02:27.200
can give rise to complex phenomena on the macro level, which then in turn feeds back

02:27.200 --> 02:33.640
to both enable and constrain the components on the local level.

02:33.640 --> 02:39.040
The theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions within biology

02:39.040 --> 02:42.480
and ecology, that of organization and order.

02:42.480 --> 02:48.640
How and why do we get this extraordinary level of organization we see within ecosystems?

02:48.640 --> 02:54.040
As we've previously discussed, the second law of thermodynamics tells us that the disorder

02:54.040 --> 03:01.080
or entropy of a physical or chemical system and its surroundings must increase over time.

03:01.080 --> 03:06.480
In other words, systems left to themselves must become increasingly random.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.840
The ordered energy of a system must degrade eventually to this randomness.

03:11.840 --> 03:17.600
But there are many instances in which physical systems spontaneously create emergent patterns

03:17.600 --> 03:18.600
of order.

03:18.600 --> 03:24.680
For example, despite the destruction that they cause, hurricanes have a very orderly vortex

03:24.680 --> 03:30.800
motion when compared to the random motion of the air molecules in a closed environment.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.240
Even more spectacular is the order created by chemical systems, the most dramatic being

03:36.240 --> 03:41.800
the order associated with life of all kind.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.640
But of course the second law only really tells us about closed systems.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.680
What we're dealing with in ecology though are in fact open systems.

03:50.680 --> 03:56.480
If the system has a high enough exchange with its environment, order can be created in the

03:56.480 --> 04:02.000
system by an even greater decrease in order of the system's surroundings.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.240
In the hurricane example, hurricanes are formed from unequal heating within the atmosphere.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.520
The Earth's atmosphere is then far from thermal equilibrium.

04:12.520 --> 04:18.600
The order of the Earth's atmosphere increases but at the expense of the order of the Sun.

04:18.600 --> 04:24.520
The Sun is becoming more disorderly as it ages and throws off light and material to the

04:24.520 --> 04:26.200
rest of the universe.

04:26.200 --> 04:32.720
The total disorder of the Sun and Earth increases despite the fact that orderly hurricanes are

04:32.720 --> 04:37.160
generated on Earth.

04:37.160 --> 04:42.800
These examples help to illustrate the nature of dissipative systems.

04:42.800 --> 04:48.520
Disappative systems such as the Bernard cells created by boiling water can exhibit dynamic

04:48.520 --> 04:50.560
self-organization.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.560
Such structures are necessarily open systems.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.800
Energy and all matter are flowing through them.

04:57.800 --> 05:04.400
The system is continuously generating entropy but this entropy is actively dissipated or

05:04.400 --> 05:06.760
exported out of the system.

05:06.760 --> 05:13.960
Thus, it manages to increase its own organization at the expense of the order in the environment.

05:13.960 --> 05:21.840
The system circumvents the second law of thermodynamics simply by getting rid of excess entropy.

05:21.840 --> 05:27.800
Plants and animals take in energy and matter in a low energy form as light or food.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.400
They export it back in a high entropy form as waste product.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.280
This allows them to reduce their internal entropy thus counteracting the degradation

05:38.280 --> 05:40.520
implied by the second law.

05:40.520 --> 05:47.640
It is this dissipative catabolic process within ecosystems that constantly produces disorder

05:47.640 --> 05:53.600
in the form of exported low-grade heat that paradoxically makes possible the maintenance

05:53.600 --> 05:59.520
of order in the system through self-organization.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.840
It is this feature to dissipative systems like ecologies that creates the conditions

06:04.840 --> 06:06.840
for self-organization.

06:06.840 --> 06:12.520
Where we can think of a dissipative system as a context where energy is imported and

06:12.520 --> 06:14.360
entropy is exported.

06:14.360 --> 06:20.920
Given that context elements within the system will then self-organize to process whatever

06:20.920 --> 06:23.920
resource is flowing through the system.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.560
This is part of the essence of biological creatures.

06:27.600 --> 06:34.520
Not only are biological systems dissipative but also they perform some internal function.

06:34.520 --> 06:40.280
All biological creatures process energy and matter in some form and elements internal

06:40.280 --> 06:44.040
to the system have to self-organize to do that.

06:44.040 --> 06:50.360
That is to say biological creatures somehow have evolved orderly internal structures that

06:50.360 --> 06:56.320
enable their functionality and this internal functionality to biological entities has no

06:56.320 --> 07:02.080
equivalent within inert physical systems.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.560
This can be understood with reference to the maximum power principle and constructural

07:07.560 --> 07:10.040
law previously talked about.

07:10.040 --> 07:16.640
Where during self-organization the system designs develop and prevail the maximized power intake

07:16.640 --> 07:23.160
energy transformation and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency or according

07:23.200 --> 07:29.520
to the constructal law for a flow system to persist in time it must evolve freely such

07:29.520 --> 07:32.760
that it provides greater access to its currents.

07:32.760 --> 07:39.520
Thus where the second law commands that things should flow from higher to lower energy potential.

07:39.520 --> 07:45.720
The constructal law posits that they evolve in configurations that flow more and more

07:45.720 --> 07:52.400
easily over time and elements in the system will self-organize to achieve this in so doing

07:52.440 --> 07:56.440
producing some macro level pattern of organization.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.800
We can ask then why do all the different parts of an ecosystem appear to fit together so

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
well?

08:02.800 --> 08:07.920
What is responsible for organizing all the parts, their functional connections and resulting

08:07.920 --> 08:12.560
feedback loops in a way that allows everything to function together?

08:12.560 --> 08:18.680
The amazing answer is that ecosystems organize themselves because the ecosystem is a dissipative

08:18.680 --> 08:22.760
system inside of which is available free energy.

08:22.760 --> 08:28.640
This exergy can be used to create some form of order and functionality through the process

08:28.640 --> 08:33.040
of self-organization.

08:33.040 --> 08:37.480
We've been talking about self-organization on a generalized level but we'll use the

08:37.480 --> 08:41.840
rest of this video to discuss in more detail its basic workings.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.920
Today this process of self-organization is understood to take place through a number

08:46.920 --> 08:48.480
of key stages.

08:48.480 --> 08:54.280
The dynamics of a self-organizing system is typically non-linear because of circular or

08:54.280 --> 08:57.400
feedback relations between the components.

08:57.400 --> 09:03.240
This involves some form of initial randomness or fluctuation, positive feedback loops that

09:03.240 --> 09:05.960
can then amplify these small events.

09:05.960 --> 09:11.360
When this positive feedback reaches its limits it dies out creating negative feedback with

09:11.360 --> 09:16.680
closed detractors forming and finally out of all of this we get the emergence of some

09:16.680 --> 09:18.440
global pattern.

09:18.440 --> 09:24.280
Non-linear systems have in general several stable states and this number tends to increase

09:24.280 --> 09:30.920
or bifurcate as an increasing input of energy pushes the system further from its thermodynamic

09:30.920 --> 09:32.360
equilibrium.

09:32.360 --> 09:38.960
The basic dynamics underlining self-organization is one of variation which explores different

09:38.960 --> 09:43.480
regions in the system's state space until it enters an attractor.

09:43.480 --> 09:49.240
This precludes further variation outside the attractor and thus restricts the freedom

09:49.240 --> 09:51.480
of the system's components.

09:51.480 --> 09:57.600
This is equivalent to the increase of order or decrease of statistical entropy that defines

09:57.600 --> 09:58.600
self-organization.

09:58.600 --> 10:06.440
We'll go over each of these stages in the process separately in more detail.

10:06.440 --> 10:12.560
Many theories surrounding self-organization involve an initial state of randomness within

10:12.560 --> 10:15.840
which fluctuations or noise can take hold.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.800
For example, Prigashin proposes the principle of order from fluctuations.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.520
This may be understood with reference to a simple observation that if the components

10:25.520 --> 10:30.920
in the system are already held within some global form of organization this will likely

10:30.920 --> 10:32.840
resist alteration.

10:32.840 --> 10:38.880
When an ecosystem, organism or some other system is held in an orderly, strong basin

10:38.880 --> 10:45.400
of attraction it is difficult for small events to take hold through self-organization.

10:45.400 --> 10:53.800
We need some initial state of entropy and randomness for this process to take hold.

10:53.800 --> 10:59.000
Some small fluctuation can only really gain traction given positive feedback.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.720
Positive feedback can take hold around some small event and by compounding on its presence

11:04.720 --> 11:10.720
with every iteration work to amplify it into a large systemic effect.

11:10.720 --> 11:17.000
One example of this would be the process whereby bees form swarm attacks against enemies.

11:17.000 --> 11:24.760
When a potential enemy is identified a bee may attack but the bee also releases a pheromone

11:24.760 --> 11:27.360
communicating to others to do likewise.

11:27.360 --> 11:33.280
Thus, for every new bee that attacks we get a stronger accumulation of pheromones placing

11:33.280 --> 11:36.880
an ever greater attraction on other bees to join.

11:36.880 --> 11:42.000
This is an example of a positive feedback process synchronizing the states of the bees

11:42.000 --> 11:45.200
as they come to form a swarm around the enemy.

11:45.200 --> 11:51.080
Similarly, positive feedback through pheromone excretion is present in the formation of patterns

11:51.080 --> 11:53.360
within ant colonies.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.960
Another example would be any form of autocatalytic chemical process.

11:57.960 --> 12:03.640
A single chemical reaction is said to have undergone autocatalysis if one of the reaction

12:03.640 --> 12:10.120
products is also a reactant and therefore a catalyst in the same or coupled reaction.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.760
The more reactions we get the more catalysts we will have which will then generate more

12:14.760 --> 12:16.920
reactions and so on.

12:16.920 --> 12:22.760
These are examples of runaway positive feedback that works to cascade through the system aligning

12:22.760 --> 12:28.480
all the elements into some coordinated regime.

12:28.480 --> 12:34.920
As self-organization is an inherently nonlinear process the transition to order as the distance

12:34.920 --> 12:38.920
from equilibrium increases is not usually continuous.

12:38.920 --> 12:43.920
Order typically appears abruptly as characteristic of nonlinear systems.

12:43.920 --> 12:51.120
The threshold between the disorder of chemical equilibrium and order is known as a phase transition.

12:51.120 --> 12:56.440
The conditions for phase transitions can be determined with the mathematics of non-equilibrium

12:56.440 --> 13:00.080
thermodynamics.

13:00.080 --> 13:05.760
Once the process of positive feedback has run its course and met some boundary or formed

13:05.760 --> 13:10.980
a number of different local attractors, their negative feedback starts to take hold once

13:10.980 --> 13:13.560
again creating a stable state.

13:13.560 --> 13:20.560
The British cybernotician W. Ross Ashby proposed what he called the principle of self-organization

13:20.560 --> 13:26.940
noting that a dynamical system independently of its type of components always tends to

13:26.940 --> 13:32.400
evolve towards a state of equilibrium or what we would now call an attractor.

13:32.400 --> 13:37.880
This reduces the uncertainty that we have about the system state and therefore reduces

13:37.880 --> 13:40.240
the system's statistical entropy.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.080
This is equivalent to self-organization.

13:43.080 --> 13:48.200
The resulting equilibrium can be interpreted as a state where the different parts of the

13:48.200 --> 13:55.200
system are mutually adapted and balanced as they form local attractors closing in on themselves

13:55.200 --> 14:00.600
creating what we call closure.

14:00.600 --> 14:07.080
For the outside observer closure determines a clear distinction between inside and outside

14:07.080 --> 14:11.280
and therefore a boundary separating system from environment.

14:11.280 --> 14:16.400
This boundary can encompass all components of the original system.

14:16.400 --> 14:22.520
If the system settles into a negative feedback regime it will be relatively impervious to

14:22.520 --> 14:24.480
external perturbations.

14:24.480 --> 14:30.560
The system has now become responsible for its own maintenance and thus become largely independent

14:30.560 --> 14:32.320
from its environment.

14:32.320 --> 14:37.120
It is thus also closed against influences from the outside.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.800
Although in general there will still be exchanges of matter and energy between the system and

14:41.800 --> 14:47.240
environment, the organization is determined largely by its initial dynamics.

14:47.240 --> 14:54.080
Thus we may say that the system is at this stage thermodynamically open but organizationally

14:54.080 --> 14:57.800
closed.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.920
More generally a self-organizing system may settle into a number of relatively autonomous

15:03.920 --> 15:10.120
organizationally closed subsystems but these subsystems will continue to interact.

15:10.120 --> 15:15.920
These interactions too will tend to settle into self-sufficient closed configurations

15:15.920 --> 15:22.520
defining subsystems at a higher hierarchical level which contain the organizational subsystems

15:22.520 --> 15:24.560
as components.

15:24.560 --> 15:29.680
These higher level systems themselves may interact until they hit on a closed pattern

15:29.680 --> 15:34.480
of interactions thus defining a system of yet higher order.

15:34.480 --> 15:40.320
This goes some way to explaining why complex systems tend to have the hierarchical architecture

15:40.320 --> 15:46.280
we previously discussed, where at each level we can distinguish a number of relatively

15:46.280 --> 15:49.520
autonomous closed organizations.

15:49.520 --> 15:55.720
For example a cell is an organizationally closed system encompassing a complex metabolic

15:55.720 --> 16:01.680
network of interacting chemical cycles within a membrane that protects it from external

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
disturbances.

16:03.040 --> 16:09.120
However cells are themselves organized into networks and tissues that together form multicellular

16:09.120 --> 16:10.440
organisms.

16:10.440 --> 16:15.920
These organisms themselves are connected by a multitude of food webs collectively forming

16:15.920 --> 16:23.080
the ecosystem.

16:23.080 --> 16:28.840
In this video we've been covering the topic of self-organization within biological systems.

16:28.840 --> 16:34.240
We talked about how the theory of self-organization helps us to approach one of the big questions

16:34.240 --> 16:38.520
in biology and ecology that of organization or order.

16:38.520 --> 16:44.280
In particular how biological systems can evolve to exhibit greater structure and complexity

16:44.280 --> 16:51.560
over time by harnessing a dissipative process to enable the self-organization of their constituent

16:51.560 --> 16:54.520
elements into a functioning organism.

16:54.520 --> 17:01.000
We then discussed the basic workings to this process of self-organization as one that requires

17:01.000 --> 17:06.960
some initial state of entropy or randomness where small fluctuations can gain hold and

17:06.960 --> 17:12.720
become amplified through positive feedback into new patterns as they come to form stable

17:12.720 --> 17:18.560
basins of attraction that close in on themselves producing an emergent global pattern.
