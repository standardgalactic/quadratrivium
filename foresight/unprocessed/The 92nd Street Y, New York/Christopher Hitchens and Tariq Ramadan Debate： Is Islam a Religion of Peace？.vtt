00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
Six days after the September 11th terrorist attacks, it was President Bush who went to

00:10.400 --> 00:17.000
the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. and proclaimed that Islam is a religion of peace.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
At the time, the remark was barely a cause for controversy.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.440
Instead, it was greeted by most as a call to civility, a note of sanity, a warning to

00:27.440 --> 00:33.040
fanatics who might consider taking revenge on some innocent Muslim women shopping for

00:33.040 --> 00:35.840
groceries and a headscarf.

00:35.840 --> 00:41.400
But now, nine years later, President Bush is widely accused, in retrospect, of having

00:41.400 --> 00:46.780
succumbed to a momentary case of political correctness.

00:46.780 --> 00:51.960
Many people now believe that his Islamist peace remark was born either of ignorance

00:51.960 --> 00:53.560
or of expediency.

00:54.560 --> 00:59.720
It did not even take another successful act of terrorism to set off the season we

00:59.720 --> 01:05.260
just lived through, the endless summer of holy war.

01:05.260 --> 01:11.680
The instigation was a proposal to build the mosque at ground zero, or if you prefer, the

01:11.680 --> 01:16.680
mosque of the old Burlington Coat Factory in the financial district.

01:16.680 --> 01:21.560
What ensued was nothing less than a referendum on Islam.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.440
My work means that I travel around the United States asking total strangers a lot of nosy

01:26.440 --> 01:29.560
questions about religion.

01:29.560 --> 01:36.680
I've found that this question is Islam a religion of peace more than any other is now the one

01:36.680 --> 01:39.080
on people's minds.

01:39.080 --> 01:46.600
But let's acknowledge that, to many, the question before us tonight is either absurd or offensive.

01:46.600 --> 01:52.440
To one camp, the question is absurd because the answer is patently obvious.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.600
Just look at the headlines, they say.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.880
If 9-11 is not convincing enough, what about the suicide bombers in Iraq, Afghanistan,

01:59.880 --> 02:05.440
Israel, Spain, Pakistan, for God's sake, even a tourist retreat like Bali?

02:05.440 --> 02:11.480
They say, what about Major Nidal Hassan, a psychiatrist in the US Army, who shot his

02:11.480 --> 02:16.560
own colleagues at point blank after he spent years studying and reflecting on his Muslim

02:16.560 --> 02:18.520
faith?

02:18.520 --> 02:22.880
Was he under the influence of psychosis or of Islam?

02:22.880 --> 02:28.160
They ask, why do honor killings seem to be a Muslim phenomenon?

02:28.160 --> 02:33.080
How could a religion of peace permit a father to order the death of his own daughter?

02:33.080 --> 02:37.960
This camp says not only is Islam not a religion of peace, it is intrinsically a religion of

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
violence.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.280
The question is absurd, the case is closed.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.560
Yet there are others who consider the Islam and peace question not so much absurdly obvious

02:46.560 --> 02:49.160
as utterly offensive.

02:49.160 --> 02:55.480
This camp asks, how can you condemn an entire faith, a religion followed by nearly two billion

02:55.480 --> 03:00.960
people, because of the atrocities committed by its fringe extremists?

03:00.960 --> 03:05.960
They ask, why blame the faith when the terrorists are clearly driven more by political ideology

03:05.960 --> 03:09.080
than by theology?

03:09.080 --> 03:14.640
They ask, why do we not apply the same judgment reserved for Islam to other religions?

03:14.640 --> 03:20.520
Widened the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia Herzegovina, prompt widespread rumination on whether

03:20.520 --> 03:24.700
Serbian Orthodox Christianity is a religion of peace.

03:24.700 --> 03:29.600
When Roman Catholic priests and bishops were complicit in the genocide in Rwanda, the world

03:29.600 --> 03:43.560
did not blame Roman Catholicism, but the blame fell.

03:43.560 --> 03:57.200
God is not great, but for most, except for your wide readership, the blame fell on a

03:57.280 --> 04:00.840
few rogue clerics.

04:00.840 --> 04:06.800
Why do we make such fine distinctions when it comes to religions, other religions, but

04:06.800 --> 04:12.480
not with Islam?

04:12.480 --> 04:17.240
This camp asks, isn't the Old Testament laced with calls to violence as explicit as those

04:17.240 --> 04:19.520
in the Quran?

04:19.520 --> 04:23.400
Why do we explain away the warlike verses in Deuteronomy and Leviticus as a product of

04:23.400 --> 04:29.840
their time and culture when we do not excuse the sword verses in the Quran?

04:29.840 --> 04:34.600
Whether you think the question before us tonight is absurd or offensive, no matter which camp

04:34.600 --> 04:38.840
you're in or neither, or whether you think it's appropriate, I'm hoping that what we

04:38.840 --> 04:43.960
accomplished tonight is to cause every one of you at least one disconcerting moment in

04:43.960 --> 04:47.560
which the preconception you arrived with is shattered.

04:47.560 --> 04:52.520
So our format tonight will allow Mr. Hitchens and Mr. Ramadan each 10 minute opening statements

04:52.640 --> 04:57.520
followed by a brief rebuttal, and we'll have a longer period for discussion and then open

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
it up for questions.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.520
I hope you'll have some good ones.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.480
I have no tolerance for any interruptions, though I don't expect that, but if we do,

05:04.480 --> 05:07.240
we have ways to handle them.

05:07.240 --> 05:12.840
And also a reminder to turn off your cell phones so we're not serenaded unnecessarily.

05:12.840 --> 05:18.840
So we agreed very congenially before we began that Mr. Hitchens would begin.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
Thank you.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.840
Salamu alaikum.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.840
Shalom.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.840
Welcome back to the United States.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.840
Thank you, Laurie, for your introduction.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.840
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for coming.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.840
I have to be brief, so I'll be terse.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.840
Like a number of people who are students of religion, I've spent a lot of time lately,

05:53.840 --> 05:56.840
as you should if you have the opportunity.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.840
I recommend it very highly.

05:58.840 --> 06:05.840
With Professor Derman McCulloch's History of Christianity, marvelous work of scholarship

06:05.840 --> 06:14.840
and literature written by a mainstream believer, extraordinarily broad and deep, in which he

06:14.840 --> 06:19.840
ponders one very important question, the only one I've got time for now.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.840
What happened to the word Christendom?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.840
Remember, there used to be such a term.

06:23.840 --> 06:29.840
It used to extend across the world, and the hope is that it would extend even further.

06:29.840 --> 06:39.840
And it was unironically used to mean those areas of human civilization and areas yet to be civilized, of course,

06:39.840 --> 06:44.840
where the word of Jesus Christ reigned or would reign.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.840
And it's all gone.

06:46.840 --> 06:51.840
The word is never used except historically or sarcastically now.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.840
And McCulloch doesn't say it ended because of the crusades, though he could.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
He didn't.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
Crusades didn't kill it.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.840
Knockers of slavery, mandated by Christianity, that didn't kill it either.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.840
Nor the mass murder of colonial subjects in the yet to be Christianized world.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
That wasn't sufficient.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.840
See, it didn't really end, he said, until 1914, when all the Christian empires of the world,

07:15.840 --> 07:23.840
Austria, Hungary, Germany, France, Britain, France is a slight exception to this, but only a slight one, and Russia,

07:23.840 --> 07:29.840
all of them commanded by Christian emperors and calling upon their subjects as Christians,

07:29.840 --> 07:34.840
went to war with each other and very nearly destroyed the whole human civilization

07:34.840 --> 07:39.840
and certainly reduced it to a point where we can't guess where we might be

07:39.840 --> 07:42.840
if it hadn't been for this extraordinary outbreak of barbarism.

07:42.840 --> 07:50.840
And out of that came the terrors of fascism and of Stalinism, of which it was the seedbed as well.

07:50.840 --> 07:58.840
I mention this partly because I want to maintain that there's no such thing as a religion of peace by definition.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.840
And second to point out, and that its best historian has to admit something,

08:04.840 --> 08:10.840
that if I was a Christian would make me humiliated.

08:10.840 --> 08:17.840
But because there was another empire involved in that war, the Ottoman Empire, which also came to an end,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.840
its other name was the Caliphate, the Muslim Caliphate.

08:20.840 --> 08:26.840
It went to war on the side of German and Austrian imperialism and Hungarian imperialism,

08:26.840 --> 08:32.840
and it lost not just the war, having proclaimed a worldwide jihad against Christianity,

08:32.840 --> 08:36.840
except for German and Austrian and Hungarian Christianity, which were its allies.

08:36.840 --> 08:41.840
And it didn't just lose the war, but by 1924 had been dissolved by the Turkish leadership, by Ataturk.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.840
It lost the Caliphate.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.840
And that's the only one that still has supporters.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.840
The other Christian and religious empires have all gone.

08:51.840 --> 08:59.840
But the Caliphate still has fans, not just in the Muslim world, sometimes referred to by Muslims as the Dar al-Islam,

08:59.840 --> 09:03.840
the House of Islam, but also in what some Muslims call the Dar al-Hab, the House of War,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.840
the part of the world that isn't yet Muslim.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.840
There are Caliphate clubs in London now and Berlin and elsewhere, quite important ones.

09:10.840 --> 09:17.840
And what I want to know is why that is and what we should think about it.

09:17.840 --> 09:23.840
The believers in this fantasy have, lorries spared me the need to say much of this,

09:23.840 --> 09:31.840
have committed extraordinary atrocities in Istanbul, in Madrid, in India, in the Philippines, in Indonesia,

09:31.840 --> 09:36.840
and of course in our own fair city.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.840
And the pretexts for it vary.

09:40.840 --> 09:48.840
The excuse for the mass murder can be that Australia has helped East Timor become independent from Indonesia.

09:48.840 --> 09:53.840
It can be that Newsweek has printed a full story about the desecration of a supposedly holy book.

09:53.840 --> 09:59.840
You never know what it's going to be next, but everyone knows to be careful about it,

09:59.840 --> 10:05.840
and everyone understands that the threat of violence that backs it is believable.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.840
And that's my opening position.

10:09.840 --> 10:13.840
Now you will say, I can hear it already being said, you may be saying it already to yourselves

10:13.840 --> 10:16.840
because the defence mechanisms kick in.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.840
And in any case, Laurie already said it for you.

10:19.840 --> 10:24.840
And I hope Professor Ramadan won't feel the need to say it again, but if he does, fair enough.

10:24.840 --> 10:29.840
You may say, ah, that's not the real Islam.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.840
Those aren't real Muslims.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.840
Now isn't that a fascinating objection?

10:34.840 --> 10:36.840
Is there anyone in this room?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.840
I exempt Professor Ramadan because it's his turn to speak next.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.840
Is there anyone in this room who would care to arbitrate that question?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.840
Who is to say?

10:44.840 --> 10:51.840
Where is the authority that defines who is the true son of the prophet or true interpreter of his work?

10:51.840 --> 10:56.840
Part of the problem to begin with, and it's part of the problem because it is a religion,

10:56.840 --> 11:01.840
is that it's perfectly true to say we don't know who the true Muslims are.

11:01.840 --> 11:07.840
And how right that is, who does speak for it.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.840
Only the second problem with defining Islam is peaceful.

11:11.840 --> 11:18.840
Only the second problem with defining it as peaceful has to do with the fact that it's highly fissile

11:18.840 --> 11:24.840
and highly schismatic, that there is a civil war going on within it, the religion of peace.

11:24.840 --> 11:30.840
As we speak, at least one civil war between the votaries of this religion of peace is already taking place.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.840
And some of it is exported outside that world into ours, very salient fact.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.840
The first reason, though, is this.

11:38.840 --> 11:45.840
Islam makes very large claims for itself, very large claims indeed.

11:45.840 --> 11:52.840
It claims to be the last and final religion, the last and final revelation.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.840
When you see bumper stickers, everyone says you can't reduce major things to a bumper sticker.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.840
It's not my idea to have bumper stickers saying Islam is the solution.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.840
It's a well-known slogan actually of parties associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.840
They say Islam is the solution for everything.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.840
It takes care of all your life and the one to come.

12:11.840 --> 12:19.840
Sexuality, political economy, banking, diet, relations with other religions, everything.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.840
It's a total solution.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.840
What is creepy about the word total?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.840
I hope I don't have to tell an audience like this.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.840
It's the first five letters of the word totalitarian.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.840
It's absolute. It's all inclusive.

12:33.840 --> 12:39.840
It's unanswerable and oddly for a religion that makes such large claims.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.840
Notice another thing about Islam.

12:41.840 --> 12:47.840
It doesn't particularly like having these claims questioned or scrutinized.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.840
In other words, as there are just as there is with all religions an inverse relationship

12:51.840 --> 12:55.840
between the claims they make and the evidence they can produce for them.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.840
You must have noticed that.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.840
With Islam, a younger religion and perhaps therefore more on its first flush,

13:01.840 --> 13:08.840
there's an extraordinarily strong willingness to say that any challenge to its absolutist claims

13:08.840 --> 13:10.840
is by definition profane.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.840
And profanity and blasphemy can be the antecedent to very severe punishment

13:15.840 --> 13:19.840
and often are for Muslims and for non-Muslims.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.840
And this is not a road of peace in my submission.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.840
That's my first point completed.

13:28.840 --> 13:34.840
The claim to govern everything from hygiene to sex and the afterlife,

13:34.840 --> 13:38.840
which contains detailed prescriptions for the good and bad versions of itself,

13:38.840 --> 13:42.840
again strikes me as somewhat totalitarian.

13:42.840 --> 13:48.840
And they're both based upon two very, very questionable and not very peaceful concepts.

13:48.840 --> 13:53.840
One is the idea of a perfect human being, the Prophet Muhammad.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.840
And the other is the idea of a perfect book, the Qur'an, the recitation.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.840
Now the category perfect human primate or mammal

14:02.840 --> 14:09.840
and the category flawless book that could possibly not use any kind of change, revision or editing

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
are categories that do not exist.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.840
There are no members of these categories.

14:15.840 --> 14:25.840
Therefore, any challenge to this faith is bound to lead to heresy and to schism and does.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.840
And just as all forms of absolutism and totalitarianism,

14:29.840 --> 14:34.840
leader worship and revealed truth, unalterable text always do

14:34.840 --> 14:39.840
because they can break, perhaps, but they cannot bend.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.840
And thus the latent potential of violence between them, among them,

14:44.840 --> 14:47.840
as well as within them is very great.

14:47.840 --> 14:54.840
And at any moment someone is in danger of being accused of being an apostate or an unbeliever.

14:54.840 --> 15:02.840
This week, the Coptic Pope of Egypt, Pope Shenouda, who represents 10 million Egyptians,

15:02.840 --> 15:04.840
was hustled onto Egyptian TV.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.840
He's not asked on all that often.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.840
I don't think he was even asked on this time.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.840
I think he was told he'd better come on.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.840
Why is the leader of Egyptians, Egypt's huge Christian minority,

15:15.840 --> 15:17.840
suddenly compelled to make a TV appearance?

15:17.840 --> 15:21.840
Because one of his bishops had said in an interview

15:21.840 --> 15:28.840
that he thought that some of the verses of the Quran showed signs of having been added later on

15:28.840 --> 15:30.840
and to have been later accretion.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.840
And Pope Shenouda was forced onto the television to say,

15:33.840 --> 15:35.840
it's not that that didn't happen.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.840
He said it couldn't have happened.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.840
It shouldn't even be discussed.

15:38.840 --> 15:45.840
So that it has to be claimed even by non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim state

15:45.840 --> 15:50.840
that there is, after all, because no Christian claims this about the Bible anymore

15:50.840 --> 15:52.840
and no Jew claims it about the Pentateuch.

15:52.840 --> 15:57.840
After all, yes, there is just one book that's completely word and letter perfect

15:57.840 --> 16:02.840
from the first time it was not even written down but recited.

16:02.840 --> 16:08.840
Now, demands that you believe the impossible do not lead to peaceful outcomes.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.840
Nor do they lead to peaceful or tolerant regimes.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.840
And I'm not going to ask you which Muslim country you would like to live in.

16:17.840 --> 16:24.840
I don't know whether Professor Ramallah will tell us which one he would pick if he had to

16:24.840 --> 16:28.840
because I don't have to ask you a question like that because it's already in your mind.

16:28.840 --> 16:29.840
Can you wind up now?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.840
Yes, I can.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.840
I can, yes, and will.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
Shall, shall in fact.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.840
Sexual repression doesn't lead to peace.

16:42.840 --> 16:50.840
The idea that women are inferior to men is a profound cause of unease, let's say, the least of it.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.840
All religions make some form of this claim.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.840
Islam seems to make it less apologetically than most.

16:56.840 --> 17:01.840
Claims that the world will come to an end in an apocalyptic form

17:01.840 --> 17:06.840
which will lead to the victory of one religion or another are not peaceful either.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.840
It's possible, perhaps, I haven't exhausted all my remarks,

17:10.840 --> 17:13.840
that the endless teaching of battle stories to children

17:13.840 --> 17:18.840
and the stories of lethal feuds from 7th century Arabia don't lead to peace

17:18.840 --> 17:24.840
or the forcing of children to memorize and retell such stories by rote doesn't lead to peace either.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.840
It's arguable that peace isn't attainable at all.

17:27.840 --> 17:34.840
It may be arguable in some forms, sometimes in places that religion isn't even desirable.

17:34.840 --> 17:43.840
But it will not come by the fanatical adoption of a man-made text and a man-made supreme leader.

17:43.840 --> 17:49.840
Nothing but war and tyranny has ever come from the adoption of formulae like these.

17:49.840 --> 17:55.840
The only way to moral and intellectual satisfaction, even temporary,

17:55.840 --> 17:58.840
perhaps only temporary, but of any kind at all,

17:58.840 --> 18:04.840
comes to those who are willing to take the great risk of thinking for themselves at all hazards

18:04.840 --> 18:10.840
and trying to share the benefits of that tolerance and that open-mindedness with others.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.840
And with that, for now, I'll rest my case. Thank you very much.

18:29.840 --> 18:34.840
Thank you.

18:34.840 --> 18:40.840
First, thank you for this invitation here this evening.

18:40.840 --> 18:48.840
And I really also want to thank, once again, Oxford University Press for organizing my visit here in the States.

18:48.840 --> 18:58.840
And I won't forget ACLU and others who helped me to struggle for my rights for being here in the States

18:58.840 --> 19:07.840
and being able to speak, to listen and to contribute to the American debate or the Western debate.

19:07.840 --> 19:13.840
And I know that among us, Jamil Jaffer is here, so I want to thank you again for this support.

19:13.840 --> 19:22.840
Let me go straight to some of the points, and I'm not going to respond straight away to some of the claims on all the claims,

19:22.840 --> 19:31.840
but during my talk, as it is the introductory speech, let me highlight some of the points.

19:31.840 --> 19:37.840
When I got the question, of course, as a Muslim and as a believer,

19:37.840 --> 19:47.840
but as someone who is coming from within the realm of religions, it was quite clear that to put it that way was not the right question to ask.

19:47.840 --> 19:55.840
Is Islam a religion of peace, or is Christianity, or is Judaism, or is Buddhism a religion or a spirituality of peace?

19:55.840 --> 20:00.840
Doesn't mean anything for me. It's not the right question. It's not the accurate question.

20:00.840 --> 20:04.840
It's not because I think that there is a good Islam and the right Islam,

20:04.840 --> 20:10.840
and there are people who are acting in the name of Islam who are not representing what Islam is.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.840
This is not my point. I never said that, by the way.

20:13.840 --> 20:20.840
But the point for me is really to try to deal with a phenomenon with religion from within

20:20.840 --> 20:25.840
and to try to understand the dynamics and to understand the trends and to understand the diversity.

20:25.840 --> 20:31.840
So just to essentialize one religion by saying it's all about war. It's all about peace.

20:31.840 --> 20:39.840
And even, you know, said by George W. Bush, doesn't mean anything for me.

20:39.840 --> 20:46.840
So this is one point which is important, but religions and old religions and Islam,

20:46.840 --> 20:49.840
among all the other religions, are dealing with human beings.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.840
And if you deal with human beings, you deal with violence and you deal with peace.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.840
You deal with violence because human beings, by definition, have to deal with violence.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.840
They have to deal with aggressivity, wars.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.840
And to expect from a religion not to tackle the issue,

21:05.840 --> 21:09.840
is just to dream of something which is not going to happen, all the spirituality.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.840
Go for Buddhism or go for the Bhagavad Gita. You deal with violence.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
So this is it.

21:14.840 --> 21:22.840
Now, what is the answer coming from religions and from trends when it comes to violence and to peace?

21:22.840 --> 21:29.840
The right question for me. Do we have something which is coming and helping us to go towards peace?

21:29.840 --> 21:32.840
This is for me the right question.

21:32.840 --> 21:39.840
So now, once again, when I have people speaking from outside,

21:39.840 --> 21:44.840
and it's especially the case these days when it comes to Islam,

21:44.840 --> 21:50.840
is we speak about Islam and we speak about, you know, something which is a religion

21:50.840 --> 21:55.840
that is perceived through one window or through one interpretation

21:55.840 --> 22:00.840
and we very often take what is visible through the media.

22:00.840 --> 22:06.840
But Islam is as complex as Christianity and Judaism and Buddhism and Hinduism.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.840
It's a diversity of interpretations.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.840
Yes, you are right.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.840
The Quran is for the Muslims the very word of God.

22:14.840 --> 22:18.840
But many interpretations and many ways of dealing with the books.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.840
The problem is that the book, the problem is the reader.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.840
It's the way, no, no, we have only 10 minutes.

22:26.840 --> 22:31.840
So this is why when, for example, you take a text,

22:31.840 --> 22:40.840
and you can do this with the Bible, with the Torah, the Gospels, it's always the same.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.840
Tell me the way you read.

22:42.840 --> 22:47.840
I will know what is in your mind, but not for sure what is in the text.

22:47.840 --> 22:52.840
And this is something which is the starting point of a serious discussion in theology.

22:52.840 --> 22:59.840
Because I don't like all these intellectuals and philosophers and even journalists.

22:59.840 --> 23:07.840
They are very keen on understanding the complexity of philosophies and the simplicity of religions.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.840
That's not right.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.840
And the one to blame sometimes are the religious people themselves.

23:13.840 --> 23:18.840
Because the way to present their religion is something which is all of dream and hopes

23:18.840 --> 23:21.840
and not dealing with the reality, which is a complex reality.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.840
And this is where I think we have to come to a better understanding.

23:26.840 --> 23:31.840
So very often when I deal with such topics, I just have to start with the very beginning.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.840
We want to deal with the religion.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.840
Let us speak about religious issues and religious understanding.

23:36.840 --> 23:42.840
Not to avoid the starting to just to come to newspapers and headlines.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.840
Not to help us to understand religion, just to go for what is happening in the world.

23:46.840 --> 23:52.840
Let us also understand the fundamentals and then come to some of the translation, the historical experiences.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.840
Because as much as you can speak about September 11, you can speak about the 16th century

23:57.840 --> 24:03.840
under the Ottoman Empire, which was a great civilization with the diversity of Christians and Jews

24:03.840 --> 24:06.840
and even non-believers working and living together.

24:06.840 --> 24:11.840
We are always speaking about Indonesia, but we can prove everything with history.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.840
If we don't get a sense of what are the principles we are talking about.

24:15.840 --> 24:21.840
So for example, coming from a religious viewpoint, I wouldn't say Islam is a religion of peace.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
I say Islam is a religion for human beings.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.840
It deals with peace and it deals with violence.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.840
And it helps the people to go from violence towards peace.

24:30.840 --> 24:36.840
It's a way towards peace, but it's not a peaceful reality because we are not peaceful beings.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.840
We are all in tension.

24:38.840 --> 24:44.840
Just to get that inner peace in us, and this is the starting point of the Islamic philosophy of human being

24:44.840 --> 24:46.840
is really to start with your own self.

24:46.840 --> 24:51.840
Look at your heart and tell me if you are at peace or you were at peace.

24:51.840 --> 24:57.840
Peace is a process through which you have, it's a process that you get at the end of a self-education.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.840
Educate yourself to get this inner peace.

25:00.840 --> 25:04.840
This is coming from the universal message of all the religions.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.840
You get this in Buddhism before even speaking or not even speaking about one God,

25:09.840 --> 25:13.840
but you get it in Judaism, you get it in Christianity.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
Educate yourself to get that peace.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.840
So you have to deal with your inner wars and tensions.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.840
So this is the way we have to deal with the issue about peace.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.840
And the starting point is spirituality, why?

25:24.840 --> 25:27.840
Because at the end of the day, it's really something which is important.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.840
And this is the difference that you can find between Islam and the Greek tradition.

25:32.840 --> 25:37.840
If you come back to Socrates, Socrates was saying your body in itself is bad.

25:37.840 --> 25:45.840
And this is why you have the soul helping you to educate your body and to master your body.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.840
In Islam, there is nothing like that.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.840
Your body is not bad, is not good, and your soul is not bad, is not good.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
It depends on what you are going to make out of it.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.840
It's your responsibility because you are free.

25:56.840 --> 26:01.840
Your dignity is in your freedom, and you have to use your freedom to make it bad to make it good.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.840
Take the good decision for your body, that's good.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.840
Make the bad decision, that's bad.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.840
So it's all a question of educating yourself with your own body.

26:10.840 --> 26:15.840
And it's exactly the same when it comes to the understanding of the world.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.840
So this way towards peace, it's based on education.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.840
It's based on a spiritual way of dealing with yourself.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.840
And you know what is the meaning of that?

26:25.840 --> 26:30.840
The very essence of what I'm trying to translate now is jihad.

26:30.840 --> 26:35.840
So this is something which is coming from the classical tradition.

26:35.840 --> 26:42.840
And once again, the classical tradition is helping us understand jihad is resist the bad to promote the good.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.840
And the bad is in yourself first.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.840
And then you will try to get the good.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
And to get the good is this inner peace.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.840
So jihad is not the way towards war, it's the way towards peace.

26:53.840 --> 26:59.840
Because you have as a human being intrinsically to deal with your inner wars and inner tensions.

26:59.840 --> 27:06.840
It's exactly the same in the world that what we have to do, you will find something which is the wheel of God.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.840
What is the wheel of God? Diversity.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.840
He made you tribes and nations in order for you to know each other.

27:13.840 --> 27:19.840
But you know the risk of diversity, it could be lots of knowledge and protection wars.

27:19.840 --> 27:26.840
So you have to educate yourself to live with other and with this diversity to know each other.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.840
So you can look at Islam saying you know what Islam claims?

27:30.840 --> 27:32.840
It's the last and final religion.

27:32.840 --> 27:35.840
It's not enough to end with this sentence.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.840
The most important thing is what Islam is saying about the other religions.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.840
That you have to remove them from the earth?

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
No.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.840
He made you tribes and nations in order for you to know each other.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.840
So respect the Christians, respect the Jews, respect the people who were before you.

27:52.840 --> 27:56.840
So it's a call towards respect that you find also in the texts.

27:56.840 --> 28:03.840
So yes, you will have Muslims, they will take one dimension and interpret this as it is the final religion.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.840
We are not going to deal with all the others.

28:06.840 --> 28:12.840
But you cannot deny the fact that through history, Muslims in many situations, in many historical situations,

28:12.840 --> 28:18.840
were dealing with this diversity and we learned from the Middle Ages and we learned from the Ottoman Empire

28:18.840 --> 28:23.840
that Muslims are able to deal with diversity and take from the Jewish tradition.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.840
My monitess was speaking Arabic better than me.

28:27.840 --> 28:35.840
He was a Jew and he was an intellectual and he was a theologian and he was dealing with respectful people.

28:35.840 --> 28:44.840
So all these Muslims were wrong Muslims because they did not understand that the final religion should not listen to the first monotheistic tradition.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.840
That's not true.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.840
You can't reduce this in such a way.

28:48.840 --> 28:55.840
It's too simplistic to represent what a religion is and what a history and a historical experience is.

28:56.840 --> 29:05.840
So this is for me something which has to do with the diversity that we have that it's rooted in the Islamic tradition as well,

29:05.840 --> 29:08.840
in the classical tradition that we find it.

29:08.840 --> 29:15.840
So when you deal with diversity, know that you need to promote and it's out of your personal education,

29:15.840 --> 29:18.840
mutual knowledge to get respect.

29:18.840 --> 29:24.840
But you also have to deal sometimes with oppressors and people who are going to try to take over

29:24.840 --> 29:26.840
and you have to resist.

29:26.840 --> 29:32.840
And this resistance in order to reform the world for the better is the very meaning of jihad.

29:32.840 --> 29:44.840
Now, once again, I will never deny the fact that some Muslims, some theologians in history and now are using some of the verses in a way which is for me unacceptable.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.840
And you know, I go even further than that.

29:48.840 --> 29:53.840
Just after September 11 when I was invited by time, I came here and I was asked about this.

29:53.840 --> 29:59.840
I said, you know what, it's not only not good and not Islamic.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.840
It's anti-Islamic what they are doing.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.840
It's against my religion.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.840
It's against the principles.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.840
So I'm not saying this is the good religion and this is bad.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.840
I acknowledge the fact that they are interpreting the text in a way.

30:11.840 --> 30:16.840
But what I'm saying from where I am from within my tradition is this is anti-Islamic.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.840
This is not the right way to deal with the text.

30:19.840 --> 30:32.840
So you can introduce this into something which is, oh, the only right Muslims are the Muslims who are acting the way I believe Islam is, meaning bad.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
I think it's not fair.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.840
It's not a discussion that we can have.

30:36.840 --> 30:40.840
So let me come to my conclusion here.

30:40.840 --> 30:53.840
At the end of the day, if you go through the text and you understand the philosophy of this way towards peace, dealing with your own wars and inner tensions and the tensions within the society,

30:53.840 --> 31:05.840
you will find interpretations within Islam that are promoting something which has to do with peace without avoiding violence because we all have to deal with our violence.

31:06.840 --> 31:11.840
This is something which is important and in history you will find the examples for this and for that.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
So don't rely on history.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
History you prove whatever you want.

31:15.840 --> 31:21.840
But at the end of the day, this is exactly the case for all the philosophies.

31:21.840 --> 31:31.840
All the people who are promoting human rights, we all have to do something which is out of humility to check our people.

31:31.840 --> 31:38.840
Because with the best means, you can promote the bad or the worst attitude.

31:38.840 --> 31:42.840
In the name of human rights, we want to kill people.

31:42.840 --> 31:50.840
In the name of human rights, we can promote and support the war in Iraq and Afghanistan where so many innocent people have been killed.

31:50.840 --> 32:02.840
And I said it from the beginning, never forget that the blood of an Avrani or Iraqi innocent man or woman is as valuable as the blood of an American innocent man or woman.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.840
No discussion about this.

32:04.840 --> 32:12.840
So the best ideology in the name of human rights, in the name of democracy could be used by people to promote the worst.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.840
So let us be humble.

32:14.840 --> 32:26.840
Instead of criticizing one religion and one ideology to know that in our universe of reference, you will find people using our texts, our values.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.840
Sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.840
Sometimes for peace and sometimes for war.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.840
Sometimes for dignity and sometimes for money.

32:35.840 --> 32:41.840
Sometimes for protecting freedom and sometimes for geo-strategic interests.

32:41.840 --> 32:47.840
It's not right to essentialize by saying all the wars on human rights, for human rights.

32:47.840 --> 32:55.840
All these philosophies are right or wrong or promoting a philosophy or a religion of violence.

32:55.840 --> 33:08.840
I think that these kind of conclusions are very dangerous because they don't give us the opportunity to find in any single religion, in any single philosophy, people of good will.

33:08.840 --> 33:16.840
These are the people who can talk to each other, understand each other and make it possible to live in diversity and in mutual respect.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.840
Thank you.

33:39.840 --> 33:50.840
Well, I also don't think that the motion, if that's what it is, chosen for this evening, is a particularly good one.

33:50.840 --> 34:02.840
But I knew about it as long as Professor Ramadan did and I did at least agree to speak to it in spite of that reservation.

34:02.840 --> 34:16.840
And I make this not just as a point of self-pity, but because, for example, someone in this great city who's become used to making nice these days, Imam Rauf,

34:16.840 --> 34:25.840
who describes himself as both founder and visionary of whatever the downtown establishment is now to be called,

34:25.840 --> 34:31.840
wrote an article, I'm pretty sure it was on the eve of Yom Kippur for the New York Times, in which he said,

34:31.840 --> 34:37.840
when you think about it, this is one of the most hand-washing statements I've yet heard him make in the Make Nice department,

34:37.840 --> 34:43.840
when you think about it, our word Islam is almost exact translation of your word shalom.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.840
I didn't say it.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.840
I've never heard anyone else say it.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.840
It isn't true, among other things.

34:51.840 --> 34:58.840
Islam may have some relationship to the word shalom, which can have some relationship to the word prostration or religious observance.

34:58.840 --> 35:04.840
It may, but we know what Islam means, is intended to mean and does mean, is surrender to God.

35:04.840 --> 35:12.840
Acceptance of God's surrender sometimes translated as submission, but in any case, the resignation to the Divine will.

35:12.840 --> 35:18.840
Again, not in my opinion, a prescription for peace, but that isn't my only objection to it.

35:18.840 --> 35:25.840
I don't think that abjection or fatalism or the prostration before a divine or, let alone before,

35:25.840 --> 35:32.840
holy men who are interpreting the book is a recipe for good health of any kind, mental or physical,

35:32.840 --> 35:39.840
since we're talking about the Greek concept of the body and of the spirit and of virtue.

35:39.840 --> 35:43.840
Just to get that out of the way, now you're right.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.840
I was surprised to find myself saying,

35:46.840 --> 35:51.840
Professor, when you say that the problem is not the book, but the reader.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.840
In the case of the Quran, that is certainly true of me.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.840
It's true probably of every book I've ever read, that there are difficulties I have with it,

35:57.840 --> 36:01.840
or capacities I don't have with which to approach it, to understand it.

36:01.840 --> 36:10.840
But if I'm reading the Quran, I certainly say, well, I can't tell whether this book is the Word of God or not.

36:10.840 --> 36:20.840
I don't really doubt that there is such a thing, but I can hope that this was a bad day for God.

36:20.840 --> 36:31.840
Can't I? And I can hope to live in a country where I can say that and get applause.

36:31.840 --> 36:36.840
Yes, and even mirth. And don't think that it isn't a precious thing and don't think it's being compromised.

36:36.840 --> 36:43.840
I'm coming to that. I don't like the idea of a paradise reward for martyrs.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.840
Don't like it. It's not me somehow.

36:45.840 --> 36:52.840
Don't like the account. Don't like the early accounts of village squabbles with the local Jews

36:52.840 --> 37:00.840
who've taken a look at the new claimant to be the Messiah and decided about him what they decided about, the previous claimant.

37:00.840 --> 37:08.840
He's no good. He's not up to snuff. Do you think the Jews are ever going to be forgiven for that, by the way?

37:08.840 --> 37:15.840
For rejecting two in a row. I don't think so. And I don't see why they should. Hope for.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
I don't see why they should hope for forgiveness either.

37:19.840 --> 37:24.840
And still I'm allowed to stand here and say this, and there are many parts of Europe. I couldn't do that anymore.

37:24.840 --> 37:30.840
Or I'd have to be very careful in who I'd invited for the audience. I couldn't do it easily on the air.

37:30.840 --> 37:34.840
Couldn't do it easily in print. Couldn't do it easily in public. Couldn't do it on certain campuses.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.840
Couldn't do it with certain publishing houses.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.840
Now, all of this has been done to us by the wrong Muslims.

37:40.840 --> 37:49.840
Well, let's get together then, isolate who these wrong Muslims are, who've imposed a culture of violence-backed censorship upon us,

37:49.840 --> 37:54.840
and let's get rid of them and have an honest discussion about the text and the reader.

37:58.840 --> 38:05.840
And I think the ball is in your court, Professor, on that. Just to stay with my own profession, the thing I know best.

38:05.840 --> 38:16.840
Not one major media outlet, print or broadcast, has yet shown you what the Danish cartoons actually look like.

38:17.840 --> 38:24.840
Yale University Press, which commissioned a book on them, which was to include the cartoons, as how could it not, eventually panicked.

38:24.840 --> 38:31.840
Yale University Press panicked and published the book without the cartoons over the objections of its author.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
Everybody knows what I'm talking about.

38:33.840 --> 38:39.840
The President of the United States and the head of the Joint Chiefs a few days ago were so pulverized with fear

38:39.840 --> 38:45.840
that they had to address personally in pleading tones a Christian nutbag in Florida

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
who might have been or might not have been about to commit a minor act of blasphemy.

38:49.840 --> 38:55.840
Is this the culture that Islam wants us to have in relation to it?

38:55.840 --> 39:03.840
One of, if you like, pre-emptive submission, pre-emptive cowering backed by the fear of force.

39:03.840 --> 39:09.840
Because that is not multiculturalism. That's nothing like the gorgeous mosaic.

39:09.840 --> 39:15.840
That's actually the absolute negation of what a multicultural system would be like.

39:15.840 --> 39:23.840
And a multicultural system has to look rather ascense, I think, on a religion whose preachers and websites openly, openly make threats

39:23.840 --> 39:32.840
against people like myself, against the Jewish people, against the Hindus who, to heaven's sake, aren't even monotheists.

39:32.840 --> 39:35.840
It can be killed on almost any pretext.

39:35.840 --> 39:42.840
And a very important point, and I have to make it, and against the wrong kind of Muslim.

39:42.840 --> 39:53.840
Now, Professor, don't, I'll say this as mildly as I can, don't, you may not be aware that you were,

39:53.840 --> 39:58.840
and I don't want to increase the area of unexpected offence taking

39:58.840 --> 40:04.840
that's been so hugely broadened by the sensitivities of a religion that has the answer to everything.

40:04.840 --> 40:13.840
But I'll just say I don't greatly care to be told, as if I didn't know, that an Iraqi life is as precious as an American one.

40:19.840 --> 40:24.840
And as someone who's visited Iraq quite a lot, had the occasion to think about it a good deal,

40:24.840 --> 40:28.840
I wonder if you could mention anything the United States has done in Iraq,

40:28.840 --> 40:36.840
that is remotely as criminal, as sadistic and as violent as the blowing up of the mosque of the Golden Dome in Samara.

40:40.840 --> 40:47.840
One of the holiest sites in the Muslim world, callously blown up by Sunni forces in alliance with

40:48.840 --> 40:54.840
forces who, perhaps I'd agree with them for once on this, were fascistic barthists.

40:54.840 --> 40:59.840
Probably they got the weapons and the high explosive from them, that makes it worse, surely.

40:59.840 --> 41:06.840
Intending to start and successfully in fact initiating a civil war, in which countless thousands of people have been killed,

41:06.840 --> 41:10.840
religious processions have been fired upon, funerals have been fired upon,

41:10.840 --> 41:17.840
Iran's without number of course been incinerated, much more importantly children, old people and civilians.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.840
Now where is, I just wonder, you must be able to quote it to me.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.840
Where is the Sunni fatwa against this conduct?

41:25.840 --> 41:27.840
Where is it?

41:27.840 --> 41:33.840
Where is the authoritative statement of moral outrage in the Sunni world saying,

41:33.840 --> 41:37.840
this is not acceptable behavior for followers of the Prophet?

41:37.840 --> 41:40.840
I missed it.

41:40.840 --> 41:46.840
And so apparently did the followers of the Prophet miss it because they keep on doing this all the time.

41:46.840 --> 41:50.840
They were doing it before the United States got to Iraq and they'll be doing it after we've gone.

41:50.840 --> 41:57.840
So I'm sorry I won't be talked to in that tone of voice.

41:57.840 --> 42:03.840
And I want to know, I repeat my question, who has the authority to issue fatwas?

42:03.840 --> 42:07.840
Is it Sheikh Haridawi who sometimes very much expressed respectful,

42:07.840 --> 42:11.840
who on Al Jazeera gives advice on all kinds of things?

42:11.840 --> 42:15.840
Some of the minoculars, sexual matters and so forth, doctrinal rulings,

42:15.840 --> 42:21.840
sometimes upon the legitimacy or otherwise of suicide bombing, if directed at Israelis,

42:21.840 --> 42:25.840
not just Jews of course, but I know we draw the distinction.

42:25.840 --> 42:30.840
On the other hand Hamas, which does the suicide bombing, doesn't draw the distinction.

42:30.840 --> 42:36.840
If I can't issue a fatwa against Hamas, if I'm a Muslim, if there's no one who will and they won't,

42:36.840 --> 42:42.840
surely someone could say, we don't think Hamas should have on its website and manifesto

42:42.840 --> 42:47.840
the reproduction of the protocols of the elders of Zion.

42:47.840 --> 42:56.840
A Christian fascist fabrication that is one of the warrants for the Nazi exterminationist solution.

42:56.840 --> 43:03.840
I mean, surely that's a question for the UN anti-racism committee on a spare day.

43:03.840 --> 43:10.840
Or, since that spare day never seems to come, for some Muslim authority to say,

43:10.840 --> 43:15.840
no brothers, don't do that. It doesn't come. It doesn't happen.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.840
Look on the website, it's still there.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.840
Now, you would do better, I think, Professor, if you identified yourself as a member of a very small

43:23.840 --> 43:30.840
and critical and endangered minority, someone who really is against all this

43:30.840 --> 43:37.840
and will also decry the fact that the religion itself can't seem to throw it off.

43:37.840 --> 43:42.840
But you seem to have that a little bit both ways.

43:42.840 --> 43:48.840
Now, yes, so then my closing statement is this.

43:48.840 --> 43:53.840
If you want diversity, as much as the professor does, as much as I'm sure many people here do,

43:53.840 --> 43:58.840
religious diversity, cultural diversity, what you need for it is this.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.840
You need a secular state with a godless constitution like this one.

44:02.840 --> 44:22.840
To speak as you did of the Ottoman Empire is a place where there were not just Muslims,

44:22.840 --> 44:27.840
but Christians and Jews, is either not to know yourself or to expect others to have forgotten

44:27.840 --> 44:32.840
or not to know what it meant to be a non-Muslim under the caliphate

44:32.840 --> 44:38.840
or under any similar theocratic Muslim authority to this day.

44:38.840 --> 44:42.840
No, what we need, secularism is the only guarantee of religious freedom,

44:42.840 --> 44:46.840
and yours and that of every other Muslim, we will defend.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.840
But you won't be surprised that we have some questions for you in the meanwhile.

44:49.840 --> 45:02.840
Thank you.

45:02.840 --> 45:12.840
Okay.

45:12.840 --> 45:16.840
You laugh a lot and make love to people.

45:16.840 --> 45:20.840
And I have a problem with, we are talking about people who are being killed,

45:20.840 --> 45:25.840
we're talking about people about wars, that's fine.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.840
I have a problem with the way you are putting things here.

45:28.840 --> 45:32.840
First, you know, when you said the first from Mark, say, okay, you know what,

45:32.840 --> 45:37.840
total, these are the first letters of totalitarianism,

45:37.840 --> 45:42.840
because Islam is a comprehensive religion, by the way, exactly like Judaism and Christianity.

45:42.840 --> 45:48.840
I never met a rabbi, a Christian, telling me you are with God on Saturday

45:48.840 --> 45:52.840
and with the devil on Monday, or what's that?

45:52.840 --> 45:55.840
But in Islam, it's as if it's all together.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.840
It's a very simplistic way of dealing with Islam.

45:58.840 --> 46:02.840
It's a comprehensive religion, but there are rights of God and rights of people,

46:02.840 --> 46:05.840
and you have to differentiate, and it's very old.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.840
Come back to Alain de Libera, the French philosopher, telling you,

46:08.840 --> 46:12.840
you know what's separating authority between what is to God and what is to human being,

46:12.840 --> 46:14.840
it's coming from Islam.

46:14.840 --> 46:18.840
And this was taught and translated into Christianity in the Middle Ages,

46:18.840 --> 46:20.840
exactly opposite to what we think.

46:20.840 --> 46:25.840
You may disagree, but at least acknowledge the fact that there are many interpretations in history

46:25.840 --> 46:28.840
that say Islam is this total, main, totalitarian.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.840
What's that?

46:29.840 --> 46:33.840
Otto, these are the first letters of autocratic.

46:34.840 --> 46:38.840
It's not an argument.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.840
It's not serious.

46:40.840 --> 46:45.840
And as I said, yes, we are talking about reading,

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
and by the way, it's for all the texts.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
It's the same for the Marxist.

46:49.840 --> 46:53.840
You know quite well about the Marxist tradition.

46:53.840 --> 46:58.840
And you know what some Marxists did with the text?

46:59.840 --> 47:04.840
It means that everything that Marx wrote was bad?

47:04.840 --> 47:05.840
No.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
Once again, it's a serious matter here.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.840
When we are talking about interpretations, I mean it.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.840
I mean that yes, there are people using the text in a way which is not,

47:14.840 --> 47:21.840
and you have historically to acknowledge the fact that you yourself might have read some of the text,

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
not in the good way.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.840
So this is the second point.

47:25.840 --> 47:31.840
About now, the cartoons and some of the things that you were referring to.

47:31.840 --> 47:39.840
You know, look at the Muslim majority countries,

47:39.840 --> 47:42.840
and look at the Muslims and the Western Muslims.

47:42.840 --> 47:47.840
And if you look at the reaction of the Muslims living in the States or living in Europe,

47:47.840 --> 47:52.840
you cannot just say Islam was one, all the Muslims were reacting the same way.

47:52.840 --> 47:57.840
By the way, the very month of October when the whole story started,

47:57.840 --> 47:59.840
I was in Copenhagen and I said to the Muslims,

47:59.840 --> 48:02.840
take a critical distance and don't be involved in this.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.840
You don't like it, but let it be because this is freedom.

48:06.840 --> 48:10.840
The point is that you are not making because you are reducing something which is,

48:10.840 --> 48:12.840
or the cartoon was all about freedom of expression.

48:12.840 --> 48:17.840
You don't speak about the instrumentalization by politicians and governments in Muslim majority countries

48:17.840 --> 48:21.840
and even in the West about the whole story.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.840
Because this is too complex to be put in.

48:24.840 --> 48:27.840
So many authorities, many scholars,

48:27.840 --> 48:33.840
and then you come with the Muslims who are able to speak.

48:33.840 --> 48:37.840
If you read some of the things that I'm doing or writing, you would say that,

48:37.840 --> 48:42.840
yes, I acknowledge the fact that there is a crisis of authority in Islam,

48:42.840 --> 48:50.840
but please don't tell me today that you didn't hear the Muslim voices around the world

48:50.840 --> 48:56.840
deciding and saying this is unacceptable to kill the people in the streets in New York

48:56.840 --> 49:01.840
and the condemnation was widespread by the scholars.

49:01.840 --> 49:09.840
If you don't hear, of course, there's not less than 12 councils of Muslim scholars around the world

49:09.840 --> 49:14.840
from Amman to Istanbul to Paris Dublin were condemning this.

49:14.840 --> 49:17.840
It's as if they don't speak because at the end,

49:17.840 --> 49:21.840
when the people are calling to kill for killing, they are heard.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.840
But when people are condemning what is done in the name of the religion,

49:25.840 --> 49:28.840
it's as if they don't speak, it doesn't make the headlines.

49:28.840 --> 49:34.840
But I'm telling you that some scholars did it and said it, and I was one of them.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.840
And you know what is very interesting in the whole discussion?

49:37.840 --> 49:40.840
When the people like what I'm saying, say, you know what?

49:40.840 --> 49:43.840
What he's saying is good, but he's alone.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.840
Minority, it's open, but he's alone.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.840
But when the people don't like what I say, say, you know what?

49:49.840 --> 49:52.840
He has huge followers.

49:52.840 --> 49:57.840
So depending on if you like or not what is said, you have followers or not.

49:57.840 --> 50:01.840
So I can tell you something that the mainstream Muslim presence in the West,

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
in many Muslim majority countries as well,

50:03.840 --> 50:08.840
acknowledged the fact that they are critical towards the use of the religion.

50:08.840 --> 50:12.840
Now, many Muslims, yes, would support, and I did this.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.840
And by the way, I was banned from this country, mainly for that.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.840
I was saying, for example, that the Palestinian resistance is legitimate.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.840
And I said that and I repeat this here.

50:22.840 --> 50:27.840
But I also said that the means used to kill innocent civilians

50:27.840 --> 50:33.840
and innocent Jews in an Israeli, in Israel, I cannot accept that.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
Have you heard that? I said it.

50:35.840 --> 50:42.840
So, and I'm not alone.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
I'm not alone.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.840
So once again, it's many interpretations.

50:45.840 --> 50:50.840
Listen to this and also be respectful of this diversity

50:50.840 --> 50:53.840
and the way the Muslims are dealing with this.

50:53.840 --> 50:57.840
So the fatawa, the legal opinions are coming from everywhere

50:57.840 --> 51:00.840
when you speak about some of the issues because you know it's sensitive.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.840
So you put it in a very simplistic way.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.840
Women, violence, Hamas and all these together, it gives the impression,

51:06.840 --> 51:08.840
oh yes, yes, this is right.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.840
But you don't give the people all the interpretation,

51:11.840 --> 51:15.840
everything which is done in every one of these fields

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
coming from the Islamic tradition and scholars of today

51:17.840 --> 51:20.840
trying to improve the status of women,

51:20.840 --> 51:25.840
trying to condemn violence and to promote justice and peace.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
You also have to deal with this.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.840
At the end, you may have a problem with religion much more than with Islam.

51:32.840 --> 51:40.840
And to tell me at the end of your speech,

51:40.840 --> 51:46.840
the only right solution is a secular, godless constitution.

51:46.840 --> 51:51.840
In the United States of America, I think it's problematic

51:51.840 --> 51:54.840
because I don't think it's a godless nation here.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.840
There is a reference.

51:56.840 --> 51:57.840
So, no, no.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.840
Only the constitution.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.840
No, only the constitution.

52:01.840 --> 52:04.840
But I don't think that even the politician

52:04.840 --> 52:07.840
and even the president of the United States of America

52:07.840 --> 52:11.840
is referring to something which is a godless secular system.

52:11.840 --> 52:17.840
Or I don't understand all the speeches I listen to.

52:17.840 --> 52:26.840
But the point is that my way of dealing with the secular or separating authority,

52:26.840 --> 52:29.840
I don't have a problem with separating authorities.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.840
I don't have a problem with this.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.840
And it's even my solution in Israel and with Palestinians.

52:35.840 --> 52:39.840
I want one state where the people can live together under the same rule of law.

52:39.840 --> 52:45.840
But it's as if we agree on this in France but not really in Israel

52:45.840 --> 52:47.840
because it wouldn't be Israel.

52:47.840 --> 52:52.840
So it's a selective, not consistent approach.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.840
I want you to say this everywhere in that way.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.840
And then you are saying it,

52:57.840 --> 53:03.840
but I would say that the people who are uploading sometimes they want this for some and not for all.

53:03.840 --> 53:06.840
So, let me tell you something.

53:06.840 --> 53:10.840
I'm critical from within.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.840
And I think that I'm far from being the only one.

53:14.840 --> 53:19.840
And from within the Islamic tradition, listen to also, for example,

53:19.840 --> 53:25.840
the Western Muslims who, the way they were dealing with September 11th,

53:25.840 --> 53:30.840
the way they were dealing with the cartoon crisis, the way they were dealing with fitna,

53:30.840 --> 53:35.840
many of them were saying, no, don't be involved in the United States of America.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.840
How the Muslims reacted to all this controversy on the mosque here in New York

53:40.840 --> 53:43.840
or in burning the Koran Day.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.840
Listen, were they all violent?

53:47.840 --> 53:51.840
Or have you heard some voices of reason and peace in this country?

53:51.840 --> 53:55.840
I think if you are honest, you heard these voices of peace,

53:55.840 --> 53:59.840
of people referring to their religion and saying we are Americans

53:59.840 --> 54:05.840
and what we want for this country is a peaceful, proactive existence and coexistence.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.840
I think that this is also coming from the ethics, their values,

54:08.840 --> 54:11.840
and you have to value this as being the future.

54:11.840 --> 54:16.840
So to dream of something which is a godless future, I think it's a wrong dream.

54:16.840 --> 54:21.840
But to be able to deal with all this diversity and to listen to the voices,

54:21.840 --> 54:26.840
instead of rejecting an entity as something which is bad per se,

54:26.840 --> 54:30.840
let us look at the people who from within are trying to do good with what they are

54:30.840 --> 54:32.840
and what they believe in.

54:32.840 --> 54:36.840
I think that this is the way forward for all of us

54:36.840 --> 54:41.840
which is the way I would put it for the future.

54:41.840 --> 54:45.840
And I'm not talking about wrong Muslims.

54:45.840 --> 54:48.840
I'm talking about a critical debate among Muslims

54:48.840 --> 54:54.840
and I hope that you yourself, with the people who are supporting some of the views,

54:54.840 --> 55:00.840
you are also critical about the way you sometimes reduce the ardor to an alien presence,

55:00.840 --> 55:06.840
not helping us to get to a better understanding, a critical debate.

55:06.840 --> 55:09.840
Sometimes I'm just lost with the way you put things

55:09.840 --> 55:13.840
because the debate is closed before it started.

55:13.840 --> 55:15.840
Thank you.

55:15.840 --> 55:28.840
Thank you.

55:28.840 --> 55:33.840
We're going to try to get to the core of some of what you raised

55:33.840 --> 55:35.840
and then get to some questions.

55:35.840 --> 55:39.840
That ran long but I think it was very fruitful.

55:39.840 --> 55:43.840
I want to distill something that came up here, two important things.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.840
One is the question of authority in Islam.

55:47.840 --> 55:51.840
A scholar once told me that he thinks the problem with Islam

55:51.840 --> 55:55.840
is that every Tom, Dick, and Harry can give fatwa

55:55.840 --> 55:59.840
and that there's no pope, there's no magisterium

55:59.840 --> 56:07.840
and so in some ways what you have is leadership by whoever has the biggest audience.

56:07.840 --> 56:15.840
Right now one of the most revered scholars is Yusuf al-Karadawi

56:15.840 --> 56:20.840
and he takes an opposite position from Professor Ramadan

56:20.840 --> 56:25.840
on the question of suicide attacks in Israel.

56:25.840 --> 56:31.840
He has a program with 40 million listeners and he has a website

56:31.840 --> 56:34.840
and he says that suicide attacks on Israeli citizens,

56:34.840 --> 56:39.840
even women and children are acceptable because all of Israel is a militarized society

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
and all citizens are combatants.

56:41.840 --> 56:48.840
The question here is he's got this very large, very large audience

56:48.840 --> 56:53.840
and since there is no arbitrating authority, there's no single authority,

56:53.840 --> 56:59.840
it's not what Islam becomes, whoever has the biggest audience

56:59.840 --> 57:03.840
has the sway in what the faith is.

57:03.840 --> 57:11.840
I think that it's true if we look at what is happening now

57:11.840 --> 57:14.840
in the Muslim majority countries as well as in the West

57:14.840 --> 57:17.840
that there is something that we can call a crisis of authority.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.840
In the book Radical Reform I'm tackling this from many viewpoints

57:20.840 --> 57:24.840
and not only from political discussion,

57:24.840 --> 57:29.840
it's really even in our way to deal with sciences, human sciences, ethics,

57:29.840 --> 57:32.840
we have this problem.

57:32.840 --> 57:35.840
You know when you don't know how to manage diversity,

57:35.840 --> 57:39.840
it ends up with division and not knowing who is leading

57:39.840 --> 57:43.840
and this is the way, we don't have a church so we have diversity in Islam

57:43.840 --> 57:47.840
so we have to know how to manage this and it's problematic.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.840
And I would say that if you look today at what is happening

57:50.840 --> 57:52.840
even though we have this crisis,

57:52.840 --> 57:55.840
if you look today at what is happening around the world,

57:55.840 --> 57:58.840
you will see that we have many councils,

57:58.840 --> 58:04.840
still the mainstream is not promoting violence and extremist views.

58:04.840 --> 58:09.840
The mainstream is promoting what is said for example about

58:09.840 --> 58:13.840
Western Muslims or Muslims living in Muslim majority countries

58:13.840 --> 58:16.840
is about transparency, no corruption, democratization.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
This is the mainstream that is coming.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.840
Now we have voices and you speak about Yusuf al-Qardawi

58:21.840 --> 58:27.840
and you were saying that I was one of the supporters of him.

58:27.840 --> 58:33.840
You know I have one position in everyone and everybody I am dealing with

58:33.840 --> 58:36.840
in history in the past and as is even the present.

58:36.840 --> 58:41.840
I read what is said and I try to be selective.

58:41.840 --> 58:46.840
So for example on that point, killing, I said no, I disagree.

58:46.840 --> 58:50.840
On identity and when he once was very harsh with me saying

58:50.840 --> 58:53.840
no we have one identity and in Islamic I said no,

58:53.840 --> 58:56.840
we have multiple identity, I am Swiss by nationality,

58:56.840 --> 59:00.840
Egyptian by memory, Muslim by religion, European by culture,

59:00.840 --> 59:02.840
these are my identities, he didn't agree.

59:02.840 --> 59:09.840
So I talk to people but I know that on this for example in Israel

59:09.840 --> 59:15.840
I disagree with him but you can't reduce Yusuf al-Qardawi in the world today

59:15.840 --> 59:19.840
to this position because he had many other positions on women,

59:19.840 --> 59:22.840
on the society, on democracy.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.840
He is promoting something which he called democracy in the Muslim majority country

59:26.840 --> 59:31.840
that you have to consider by saying okay on this we disagree and on that

59:31.840 --> 59:33.840
we need to have a critical debate.

59:33.840 --> 59:36.840
You can adjust because one position, we don't like one position,

59:36.840 --> 59:39.840
we remove the people from the landscape.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.840
They are part of the landscape and they are heard in the Muslim majority countries.

59:42.840 --> 59:47.840
So this is my position on that.

59:47.840 --> 59:54.840
Well I am certainly not going to criticise Islam for not having a Pope.

59:54.840 --> 01:00:00.840
And in fact it would be your vis-à-vis in this discussion was horribly an error

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.840
in any case in that Christianity never had only one Pope and still doesn't.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.840
I mean there were several Catholic claimants to the papacy at different times

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.840
just among Roman Catholics but today I mentioned one of them,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.840
the Pope of the Coptic Christians based in Cairo.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.840
The Eastern Orthodox don't call their leader the Pope, they call him the Patriarch

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.840
but the Christian world is full of Pope types.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Usually anathematising one another.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:33.840
The Pope is just the word that innocent Americans use for the man who claims

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.840
to be the leader of the Roman Catholic.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.840
So I don't think it's possible in fact to have a moral authority within religion

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.840
because I think the two things are so sharply divorced

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.840
but this doesn't lead to just chaos

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.840
and it certainly doesn't lead to the dictatorship of minorities or extremists.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.840
I'll give you two examples quickly.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.840
In the case of the moral blackmail of Denmark that was backed up

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.840
by a physical threat to destroy its economy and burn out its embassies across the world.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.840
A well coordinated attack of sabotage against the small European democracy.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.840
The organising group was I think the OIC, the organisation of the Islamic Congress.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.840
Groups all the Muslim countries in the world have increasingly powerful lobby at the United Nations.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.840
Hopes to pass an international resolution forbidding all criticism of religion

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840
all forms of blasphemy and profanity.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.840
Every ambassador of those countries in Copenhagen

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.840
went to Mr. Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark,

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.840
and told him under the threat of violence he should change his law

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.840
so as to allow him to determine what went into the Danish newspapers.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.840
And when he said he couldn't do that things got a lot worse.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.840
Now that's the ambassador of Egypt and the ambassador of Turkey

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.840
and the ambassador of important countries in the case of Egypt

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.840
containing an enormous Christian population

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.840
coming to you as if they spoke for a religion.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.840
Either this claim is true or it is not.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.840
It's self-evidently not true, but it is certainly made.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840
Don't let's be in any doubt about it.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.840
And don't let's have any doubt that it means to extend its influence

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840
over the people who are sitting in this hall.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.840
Second, very quick, the fat war against Salman Rushdie.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.840
In other words, the offer of money to suborn murder

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.840
the crime of writing a work of fiction in his own name

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.840
by the spiritual leader of Shia Islam.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.840
That's what the fat war meant then, means now.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.840
Wars after the murder of many people associated or not with the publication of the book

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.840
repudiated ostensibly by the Iranian government after long pressure

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.840
in lobbying at the United Nations about ten years ago.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840
I think that was.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.840
But I've been since then, I've had the pleasure of going to Friday prayers

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.840
around university twice to hear the sermon.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.840
And on both occasions there were banners and slogans saying that the imams

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.840
holy sentence against Salman Rushdie will never die.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.840
It hasn't died with the Imam for many's death warrant will always be carried out.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.840
Not, I think, a very good use of the premises of the university.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.840
I can't speak for whether it's a good occasion for Friday prayers or not.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.840
Well, it brings me to a second point.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.840
You see, there's something shady involved here.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.840
Some people say that Islam and Islamists give themselves permission to lie to non-believers.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:38.840
It sounds like the sort of vulgar, paranoid thing that an Islamophobe would go around saying, doesn't it,

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.840
but very easy to disprove, except that it hasn't been, as that example we'll just illustrate.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.840
And these are not minor threats.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.840
These are threats to the very core of what we believe is the essential thing for society,

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.840
which is the ability to ask questions, to read the books we choose, to pursue unfettered investigations.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.840
And these are flatly negated by the claims of a religion that says it is the answer to everything.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
Can I respond to this?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840
Because really, I think that's...

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
Is this the Takia question?

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.840
No, no, no, the Takia question is...

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.840
No, the point is, on the cartoon issue, the way you are translating things is problematic.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.840
Let me just come to some of the facts here very quickly.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.840
The first thing is that it happened in October that the cartoon were published.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.840
Between October till January, nothing happened.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:40.840
And I met the Muslim organizations in Denmark and I told them, and many of the opinions don't react.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:48.840
The ambassadors of Muslim majority countries and Arab countries mainly asked the Prime Minister to meet with them.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.840
He refused.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:56.840
And my position that he made a mistake here, because he should have met them, telling them,

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.840
I have no say in this, it has to do with freedom of media, this is not of my business.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.840
He didn't do this.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.840
They took it as humiliation.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.840
They went back, they bought the tickets.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840
No, no, but look.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840
Easily.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.840
No, no, no, no, let me finish, because we will come to the point here.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:21.840
They went back and they bought the ticket of a group of Muslims, among the Muslim leaders in Denmark,

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.840
to go to Muslim majority countries to just present what was done.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:35.840
Tell me, Egypt is ruled by Islam.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.840
Is it Islam which is used there?

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.840
Mubarak is a secular president, isn't it?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.840
Syria is a Muslim leader or is a secular state?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:55.840
All the main societies where the government used this, because you know what happened,

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.840
is it's easier to use the people to tell them against the West you can demonstrate,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.840
but not against the government, which is an autocratic government.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
So it's not religion.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:14.840
It's political instrumentalization of popular emotions against the West just to make it a religious issue.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:21.840
You cannot just avoid talking about political instrumentalization of countries where there is no democracy,

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.840
and these countries are not Islamist countries.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:28.840
They are secular, autocratic countries.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.840
On your third point, I can't possibly disagree with you.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.840
The West is a great deal of opportunism and demagogy, and I'm certain hypocrisy as well.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:43.840
And in fact, I will say that I've heard you and seen you saying that before, and I agree.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:50.840
I don't think I would classify a country that hauls the Christian leader of its minority onto the TV

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.840
to say, no, it's not possible that it could have been any...

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
Exactly the same, political instrumentalization.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
No, to give you a trivial example.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840
No, I would not.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.840
Nor would I describe the Alawite regime.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.840
It's an Alawite sectarian regime, not a secular one, that is funded by Tehran

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.840
and is the funder of the murder gang Hezbollah as secular either.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.840
No, don't insult me.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840
Not that it really hurts me that much.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840
I don't feel humiliated or anything.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.840
All right, we're going to take some questions.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:26.840
Whereas apparently the leader of a proud country like Egypt, when a demand to interfere in the internal affairs of Denmark

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840
is not met, feels...

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.840
I'm sorry.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:37.840
Just to end this discussion for me on my side is the only fact that you acknowledge that there is a political instrumentalization of religion

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840
and you say I'm right, that's enough for me.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.840
This is exactly what I meant.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.840
I think I actually think that...

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Earlier you were trying to tell me what Karl Marx said on the subject.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.840
That's your job.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840
Is that a valuable exchange?

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.840
I think that was worth hearing.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:08:03.840
But I know that there are people in the room and also listening in from the satellite sites who want to have some of their questions asked.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:16.840
And a few of them are along these lines and they actually are aimed at you Mr. Hitchens because of your ringing endorsement really of a secular society and atheism.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.840
A question from Vale Colorado.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:25.840
Do Jewish Christian or other religions have a greater claim on being religions of peace than Islam?

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.840
Is your beef really with Islam or is it with all religion?

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.840
Well, I'm sorry that the comrade from Yale tuned in so late.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.840
I mean, late enough to miss the first four or five minutes of my 10 minute introduction.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:48.840
Devoted to a close exegesis of Professor McCulloch's realization that Christianity had out genocided and out warred and out crusaded itself.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.840
Finally by 1914.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:57.840
If you care to pick up, I think you might be able to and I'll sign it if you will.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Pick it up.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:07.840
My book, God is Not Great, you will find a discussion of the warrants for slavery, murder, genocide and land theft that occur in the books of murder.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:17.840
That are an ineffasible offense to any civilized person and the reason why so many Jews are secular.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840
At least one of the reasons.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.840
So again, I could go on but I really feel I don't need to.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.840
A corollary question.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.840
Maybe it's just something funny.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.840
Would atheism be a non-religion of peace?

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.840
No.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.840
No, there's something probably very slightly intolerant about atheism, at least so I hope.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.840
I should, I might just say though, because I really think Professor Namadam misunderstood me.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:52.840
When I say the American Constitution is godless, I mean, I was quoting the title of a famous study of it by Professor Israel Kramnik.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:10:02.840
What I mean by that is to say, the US Constitution only mentions religion and God in its preambles when it means to say the ways in which they must be kept out of the public square.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.840
That happens to reflect about our Constitution and the reason why we still have it.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:09.840
Otherwise the Republic would have been destroyed long before.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.840
And that its first amendment says that religion can be no business of the government.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.840
A statement no Muslim society could begin to make.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.840
Thank you.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:36.840
But once again, once again, you can just refer to the Constitution and you will have Muslims just referring to texts and avoiding the practical consequences and sometimes the policies that are promoted in one country.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:55.840
And remember that the previous president, George W. Bush, was talking when going not for the same reasons as you, or not from the same source because you were supporting the war in Iraq, but he was doing it in the name of God.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:05.840
So the Constitution here is not preventing someone from within to speak in the name of God, even if he's voting exactly the same thing that in the name of the peace that you are promoting.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.840
You have for the war in Iraq.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.840
I can't imagine you're going to defend President Bush.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:25.840
Well, from that charge I can. No one was ever summoned to vote for the war in Iraq in the name of God and the president's own church as well as every other Christian church that I know of was opposed to the war.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.840
For whatever little difference that might make, none to me.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:43.840
This, I think this one is for Professor Ramadan. Why are there no progressive Muslim majority countries with rights for women and homosexuals, etc.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Go ahead.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:58.840
No, I think that once again, if you look at the Muslim majority countries, we cannot just have something which is a monolithic vision of what is happening.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:11.840
What is happening now in Muslim majority countries is really before just looking at some dimensions of the rights of women within or the rights of homosexuals, for example,

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.840
is really to look at the situation in the whole society and the way it's progressing.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:22.840
Now we have the great majority of the Arab countries. They are under dictatorships. There is no freedom.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.840
Religious or secular society, this is the same for all.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.840
So if you look at this and you are expecting from within an evolution in this society, forget about it.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.840
Look now at what is happening in Turkey.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.840
Turkey is changing, moving towards something which is a more democratic system.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.840
And you see within that are rights and discussion and critical discussion that are possible.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.840
So I would say that you cannot essentialize history and say the Muslims cannot do this.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.840
It's evolving and it's changing and it depends where you can have this kind of discussion.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:05.840
And the first, because they are priorities, the first is really to go towards democratization and transparency in the Muslim majority countries.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:15.840
And if you go to Indonesia, even though we are far from a perfect system, you have much more discussion in Indonesia today about the principles,

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
the critical reading of the text than you have in Arab countries.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:25.840
So I would say it's evolving. There is no state to school.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:33.840
And now what is also interesting is look at what the Western Muslims living in the democratic system,

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.840
when they can express themselves, when they are enjoying freedom and they are not under the political pressure,

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.840
what they are producing as the Islamic contemporary thought.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.840
We are talking about citizenship. We are promoting women's rights.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.840
We are promoting the rights of the people to live and to be respected without discrimination.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.840
So look at the different historical setting and you can see that it's moving and it's changing.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.840
And there are new answers for new challenges coming from Muslims.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:08.840
Are you saying Turkey is moving in a progressive direction as it becomes more Islamist?

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.840
Is that what you're saying?

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.840
That's quite interesting the way you translate what I said.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.840
It says much more about what you think. That's what I said.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.840
But let me finish.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840
You said it was moving in a more progressive direction.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:32.840
No. What I said is that even the people who are now leading the country that are referring to Islam and they were perceived as Islamists,

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:38.840
now we don't know how to call them. Are they Islamists or are they moderate Muslims or are they ex-Islamists?

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.840
The point is that no one here can deny the fact that not only the government,

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.840
because we can be and we should be critical towards the government,

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.840
but the people around and the intellectuals in Turkey and within even the party,

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:59.840
you have new thoughts and they are coming with something that we didn't see even in the Muslim majority countries, in the Arab countries.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.840
So speaking about the rule of flow and democracy and transparency,

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:11.840
separating and promoting what they are trying to promote and to be in tune today with the European principles.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.840
And I would say this is the only thing for me which is important.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:22.840
If, for example, Turkey is abiding by the European rules, they should be able to integrate the European Union.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.840
And not what we have now, because it's a Muslim majority country.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.840
We don't care about what they are trying to do.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.840
So don't reduce Turkey to labels.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.840
There are dynamics, there are people who are promoting things that are quite interesting.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.840
I went there many times and I can tell you the women in Turkey, the Turkish women,

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.840
for all the trends, not only, you know, from the secular for the Islamists everywhere,

01:15:49.840 --> 01:16:00.840
they are promoting a better understanding of Islam, a better acknowledging and resisting discriminations and trying to work for more autonomy.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.840
And I would say this is what I said and this is what I promote.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:15.840
Well, actually I agree with you that there was a very ossified, out-of-Turkish bureaucratic intolerance system

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.840
that to some extent has been opened by the challenge from Mr. Erdogan's party.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:29.840
But the reason why Turkey continues to be looked on as scans by so much of Europe is not because it's a Muslim majority country.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.840
It was a Muslim majority country long before the European Union was formed.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.840
And no one's just discovered that, the faith of most of its people as Muslim.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.840
It's because of legal and political reasons.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.840
One of them is continually legal occupation of the Republic of Cyprus, which is already a member of the European Union,

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.840
and the expulsion of a large proportion of its population, the reduction of them to refugee status.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.840
Erdogan's been worse on that than his predecessors.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:01.840
The second is the refusal of Turks to admit that they're not the only people living in Anatolia,

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:09.840
that there's another nation called the Kurds that lives there, which has language and national rights, which have been negated.

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.840
On that, actually the Erdogan party's been slightly better than some of the other Turks.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:23.840
And the third is the continuing campaign of falsification and lying about the genocide of the Armenian population.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
A continuing disgrace, which Erdogan...

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.840
Which Erdogan has spoken of in the most thuggish possible term.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840
A question from Pittsburgh here.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:45.840
Is there an acceptable literature of interpretation of the Koran, similar to the Jewish oral Torah?

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.840
Does that make sense?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840
Yes, of course.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:18:00.840
If you come back to the classical Islamic tradition, in what we call firqh, law and jurisprudence, and ethics,

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.840
and we have a huge classical tradition.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.840
The problem very often is that the Muslims themselves, they neglect and ignore their own tradition,

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.840
but also the people who are coming to Islam, they are just driven by headlines,

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:27.840
and they are simplifying the reality of, you know, you can get a PhD in the States or anywhere in the West

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.840
without having one notion of what is called Islamic philosophy.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:41.840
While the Islamic philosophers, the philosophers referring to Islam as much as Maimonides and so many,

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.840
we only know Averaes, because he is very close to us.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.840
But the fact that we refer only to him is just showing us how much we ignore about the others.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:19:00.840
Do you know that Descartes, who came with the rationality and doubt, read, himself read,

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:09.840
the thesis of Abou-Hamed El-Razali, who was talking about doubt and doubt as a sense of getting certitude and knowledge,

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.840
neglected, not known, and I think that the Islamic tradition is full of that.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:20.840
We have to reconcile ourselves with our past in order to come with a diversity of new visions for the future,

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.840
and I think that this is missing for all of us.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:33.840
I would say that this neglectfulness towards history and tradition is a problem within the Muslim universe of reference

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:40.840
as much as it is for Christianity and Judaism and all the other great philosophies and religions.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.840
We have a few questions here. I don't think we can avoid this tonight about Sharia.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:57.840
It's become an assumption among many Americans now that what Muslims are really after is the imposition of Sharia

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.840
in every society in which they live, even Muslim minority countries.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:10.840
It's not a lot understood about Sharia, but what is known is that crimes such as adultery, blasphemy,

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.840
apostasy, and homosexuality are punishable by the death penalty.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:22.840
To Westernize, it seems like a whole legal system that's a violation of human rights.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:26.840
What is the intention with Sharia, especially for Muslims living in the West?

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.840
Is the idea that eventually we get there and we all live under Sharia law?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:38.840
This is a legitimate question and it's an important question because many Muslims living not only in the West,

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.840
by the way, throughout the world, you have Muslims, they deny this, they say no, no, they don't understand Sharia,

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.840
or they reduce Sharia to the penal code and sometimes it happens.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:52.840
But Sharia is not the penal code and still with this, that it's not only the penal code,

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:59.840
we really have a problem with the understanding of Sharia by Muslims and the way it has to be understood in our time.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.840
Again, many interpretations here. You have some Muslims and you cannot deny this.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:11.840
The perception of Sharia, it starts with the punishment and then it goes towards social justice

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:18.840
because you punish, you go to, and this is for me, once again, problematic and I'm critical of this,

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.840
but I cannot deny the fact that you have a tiny minority of Muslim scholars, they think like that,

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.840
in Nigeria, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, everywhere.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:35.840
You have another understanding of Sharia, which is we start with social justice and then the punishment is part of the whole process.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.840
In my position, I wrote many times on that, for example, in Western Muslims and the future of Islam,

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:46.840
the understanding of Sharia is the way towards faithfulness, in which we are faithful to some of our principles.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.840
So it's not a closed system.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:56.840
Muhammad Abdul in the 19th century, when he was studying, he was under the British colonization

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.840
and he was, we don't want this colonization, we want them out of our country,

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.840
but the parliamentarian system is the best for us as Muslims, it doesn't contradict our system

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.840
and he was of the opinion that the democratic system is not opposed to Islam.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.840
So you have trends saying this.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:20.840
My position on this is that Sharia is the way towards faithfulness, it's the way towards justice,

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:24.840
it's the way towards mutual respect and living together.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:30.840
So this is why, for example, when I read the American constitution or any European constitution today,

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:37.840
and it is said all the citizens, men and women, black or white, should be treated equally by law,

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.840
this is my Sharia, not going to change this.

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:46.840
So the point for me is when the principles are respected and the principles of justice

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:52.840
is something which are not too system that are opposed, they are principles that are common,

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.840
that we can live together.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.840
So this is where, from an Islamic viewpoint, from within the Muslim communities in the West,

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:05.840
you will see that the mainstream position coming from all the Muslim organizations in the West

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.840
is we abide by the law of the country, we are loyal to our country,

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.840
and we act as active and responsible citizens within the country.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:23.840
And the only thing that we can say today is look at the facts and the figures and not only the perceptions

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.840
because I was shocked at what I got as an image.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.840
I didn't think that this could happen in the States.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.840
And in the States, what we had was the community center in New York by people saying

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:41.840
Islamization of America, I saw this in Europe, I thought it was impossible to have it here.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:48.840
And then it came here, meaning that the people are scared, there is a great deal of mistrust,

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.840
these people are silently colonizing us.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.840
So this is where the Muslims, and this is why your question is important, should come and say,

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.840
look, we are American citizens, we abide by the law, we respect the Constitution,

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:08.840
we want to be treated equally, mutual respect and equal rights, no discrimination for any religion

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.840
or no religion at all, this is the way it should be.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:18.840
And if you look at facts and figures, millions of Western Muslims today are just abiding by the law

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.840
and they got the three L's that I'm talking about in the book, is the first, they abide by the law,

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.840
the second, they speak the language of the country, English as you speak English,

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.840
or German or British, they speak the language and they are loyal to the country,

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840
they want the best for their country.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:41.840
This is what it means to be a Western Muslim or Muslim European or Muslim American.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.840
And I think that the Muslims should also speak out about what they want,

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.840
but they also need to be heard when they say things like this.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:56.840
Because I have been repeating this for 25 years, and after 25 years what I get is,

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:02.840
huh, smart guy, he has a double talk, he says this but he means something else.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.840
So if someone is telling you always when you say something that you have something else in mind,

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840
there is no discussion.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.840
This is once again the end of the discussion because the point is that there is no trust,

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.840
there is no potential discussion and critical discussion.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.840
And by doing this, let me tell you something which is also important, it's very counterproductive.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.840
Because at the end there is no dialogue, it's not possible to talk because if you talk and say,

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.840
oh, you are, if you talk in a good way, it means that you have bad intentions.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.840
And if you speak in a bad way, oh, now we know your intentions.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840
So what do you do?

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840
What are you going to do?

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.840
Could we accept that as a closing statement from you and let Mr. Hitchman make it?

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840
Oh, good.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:46.840
Because we've gone over?

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.840
That's fine.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840
I think that's a fine closing statement.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840
Thank you.

01:25:50.840 --> 01:26:03.840
Do I get the same question?

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.840
I don't mind.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.840
Would you like to close with that?

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840
On Sharia.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840
It really is.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.840
Okay, I like surprises.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.840
Well, Sharia just means law.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.840
I mean, all people say Sharia law making an elementary mistake.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:29.840
And of course it's not the case that every thief has their hand locked off in Muslim society

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.840
or every adulterer gets stoned.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:40.840
And I'm perfectly sure that's not just because it would diminish the labor force so radically.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.840
Or so to speak, disable it.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.840
I think it's more because of something I've claimed to notice elsewhere, which is the religion is man made.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:58.840
And so there are enormous discrepancies in how these things are promulgated and also how they are enforced.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:08.840
And the most countries and societies come quite early and easily to the conclusion that their own religions are in one form or another

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.840
are not really practicable.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:19.840
I mean, after all, in Saudi Arabia, women can't even drive a car.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:27.840
Whereas in Iran, she can vote, not for much, but she can, as much as a man can, let's say.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.840
Her vote can be stolen and degraded as much as her husband's or her brother's.

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840
There's an infinite variation.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.840
I don't know, I can't shake what I heard saw once on the BBC.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.840
From someone whose career in London I follow, I don't know if you know him, you wouldn't like him.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:57.840
Anjum Chaudhary, a very well-known noisemaker around London complaining about secularism, Judaism, all this kind of thing.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.840
And he's been in trouble with the law a few times.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:13.840
And was interviewed on BBC, went on about how nothing would change until the green flag of Islam was flying over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace and so forth.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.840
And was asked, I felt quite mildly by the BBC interviewer, said, well, if this is the way you feel about Sharia and about the total Islamic rule,

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.840
wouldn't you feel happier moving to a country where they already had it?

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.840
And which is, I mean, a polite question, but a rather cheap one, I mean, but still.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.840
What didn't prepare me for the answer?

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:39.840
Chaudhary looked straight at the guy and straight into the camera and said, what makes you think this is your country?

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.840
I thought it was a very good question.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.840
Now, why do you feel, I think I know, partly why I feel, why do you feel it's necessary to affirm that?

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:56.840
And of course, a Muslim should learn the language, should obey the laws, should observe the customs and so forth.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.840
I mean, most immigrants don't feel they absolutely have to say that.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:11.840
The answer I suspect is that it's embarrassing to notice that in places like as far apart as Sweden and as Spain,

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.840
there are groups of people who say their countries should be part of the caliphate and that that's why they've come here.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.840
And if it wasn't for those people, you wouldn't be in this position.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:31.840
So it seems to me that in order to be consistent, you should fear them and dislike them,

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:38.840
find them morally and intellectually repulsive, at least as much as if not more than I do.

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:45.840
And I don't say that you don't, but I do think that that is the urgent priority.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:54.840
On the lady's question about where would be the best country to live if you were a Muslim

01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:03.840
and wanting to be a member of a sexual or gender minority, I think she said a female or a homosexual.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:09.840
So hard to confuse.

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.840
Actually, the easiest place for you to live in that case would probably be,

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.840
I was thinking about it, well, Professor, this will be my closing statement,

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.840
would almost certainly be either Bosnia-Herzegovina or Kosovo.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:34.840
Culturally Muslim, democratic, open societies in southern and Balkan Europe

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.840
were saved from obliteration by the power of the United States,

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.840
which has never had a word of thanks for what it did.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:58.840
And which remains a secular country with a godless constitution.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.840
That's a note on which we can end.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:06.840
Which is the last best hope of humanity. Thank you.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:15.840
Thank you both. I hope it's been an enlightening evening.
