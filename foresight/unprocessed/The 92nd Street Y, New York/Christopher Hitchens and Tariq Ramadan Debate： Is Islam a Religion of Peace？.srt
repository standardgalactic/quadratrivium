1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Six days after the September 11th terrorist attacks, it was President Bush who went to

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,000
the Islamic Center of Washington, D.C. and proclaimed that Islam is a religion of peace.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
At the time, the remark was barely a cause for controversy.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Instead, it was greeted by most as a call to civility, a note of sanity, a warning to

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,040
fanatics who might consider taking revenge on some innocent Muslim women shopping for

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
groceries and a headscarf.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,400
But now, nine years later, President Bush is widely accused, in retrospect, of having

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,780
succumbed to a momentary case of political correctness.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,960
Many people now believe that his Islamist peace remark was born either of ignorance

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,560
or of expediency.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,720
It did not even take another successful act of terrorism to set off the season we

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,260
just lived through, the endless summer of holy war.

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,680
The instigation was a proposal to build the mosque at ground zero, or if you prefer, the

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,680
mosque of the old Burlington Coat Factory in the financial district.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,560
What ensued was nothing less than a referendum on Islam.

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,440
My work means that I travel around the United States asking total strangers a lot of nosy

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,560
questions about religion.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,680
I've found that this question is Islam a religion of peace more than any other is now the one

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,080
on people's minds.

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:46,600
But let's acknowledge that, to many, the question before us tonight is either absurd or offensive.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,440
To one camp, the question is absurd because the answer is patently obvious.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,600
Just look at the headlines, they say.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,880
If 9-11 is not convincing enough, what about the suicide bombers in Iraq, Afghanistan,

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,440
Israel, Spain, Pakistan, for God's sake, even a tourist retreat like Bali?

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,480
They say, what about Major Nidal Hassan, a psychiatrist in the US Army, who shot his

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,560
own colleagues at point blank after he spent years studying and reflecting on his Muslim

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,520
faith?

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Was he under the influence of psychosis or of Islam?

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,160
They ask, why do honor killings seem to be a Muslim phenomenon?

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,080
How could a religion of peace permit a father to order the death of his own daughter?

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,960
This camp says not only is Islam not a religion of peace, it is intrinsically a religion of

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
violence.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,280
The question is absurd, the case is closed.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,560
Yet there are others who consider the Islam and peace question not so much absurdly obvious

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,160
as utterly offensive.

36
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,480
This camp asks, how can you condemn an entire faith, a religion followed by nearly two billion

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,960
people, because of the atrocities committed by its fringe extremists?

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,960
They ask, why blame the faith when the terrorists are clearly driven more by political ideology

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,080
than by theology?

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,640
They ask, why do we not apply the same judgment reserved for Islam to other religions?

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,520
Widened the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia Herzegovina, prompt widespread rumination on whether

42
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,700
Serbian Orthodox Christianity is a religion of peace.

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,600
When Roman Catholic priests and bishops were complicit in the genocide in Rwanda, the world

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:43,560
did not blame Roman Catholicism, but the blame fell.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:57,200
God is not great, but for most, except for your wide readership, the blame fell on a

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,840
few rogue clerics.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Why do we make such fine distinctions when it comes to religions, other religions, but

48
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,480
not with Islam?

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,240
This camp asks, isn't the Old Testament laced with calls to violence as explicit as those

50
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,520
in the Quran?

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,400
Why do we explain away the warlike verses in Deuteronomy and Leviticus as a product of

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,840
their time and culture when we do not excuse the sword verses in the Quran?

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,600
Whether you think the question before us tonight is absurd or offensive, no matter which camp

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,840
you're in or neither, or whether you think it's appropriate, I'm hoping that what we

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,960
accomplished tonight is to cause every one of you at least one disconcerting moment in

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,560
which the preconception you arrived with is shattered.

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,520
So our format tonight will allow Mr. Hitchens and Mr. Ramadan each 10 minute opening statements

58
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,520
followed by a brief rebuttal, and we'll have a longer period for discussion and then open

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
it up for questions.

60
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I hope you'll have some good ones.

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
I have no tolerance for any interruptions, though I don't expect that, but if we do,

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,240
we have ways to handle them.

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,840
And also a reminder to turn off your cell phones so we're not serenaded unnecessarily.

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,840
So we agreed very congenially before we began that Mr. Hitchens would begin.

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Thank you.

66
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Salamu alaikum.

67
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Shalom.

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Welcome back to the United States.

69
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Thank you, Laurie, for your introduction.

70
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for coming.

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
I have to be brief, so I'll be terse.

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Like a number of people who are students of religion, I've spent a lot of time lately,

73
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
as you should if you have the opportunity.

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
I recommend it very highly.

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,840
With Professor Derman McCulloch's History of Christianity, marvelous work of scholarship

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,840
and literature written by a mainstream believer, extraordinarily broad and deep, in which he

77
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
ponders one very important question, the only one I've got time for now.

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
What happened to the word Christendom?

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Remember, there used to be such a term.

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,840
It used to extend across the world, and the hope is that it would extend even further.

81
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:39,840
And it was unironically used to mean those areas of human civilization and areas yet to be civilized, of course,

82
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,840
where the word of Jesus Christ reigned or would reign.

83
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
And it's all gone.

84
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,840
The word is never used except historically or sarcastically now.

85
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,840
And McCulloch doesn't say it ended because of the crusades, though he could.

86
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
He didn't.

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Crusades didn't kill it.

88
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Knockers of slavery, mandated by Christianity, that didn't kill it either.

89
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Nor the mass murder of colonial subjects in the yet to be Christianized world.

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
That wasn't sufficient.

91
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,840
See, it didn't really end, he said, until 1914, when all the Christian empires of the world,

92
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Austria, Hungary, Germany, France, Britain, France is a slight exception to this, but only a slight one, and Russia,

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,840
all of them commanded by Christian emperors and calling upon their subjects as Christians,

94
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,840
went to war with each other and very nearly destroyed the whole human civilization

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,840
and certainly reduced it to a point where we can't guess where we might be

96
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
if it hadn't been for this extraordinary outbreak of barbarism.

97
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,840
And out of that came the terrors of fascism and of Stalinism, of which it was the seedbed as well.

98
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I mention this partly because I want to maintain that there's no such thing as a religion of peace by definition.

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,840
And second to point out, and that its best historian has to admit something,

100
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,840
that if I was a Christian would make me humiliated.

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,840
But because there was another empire involved in that war, the Ottoman Empire, which also came to an end,

102
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
its other name was the Caliphate, the Muslim Caliphate.

103
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,840
It went to war on the side of German and Austrian imperialism and Hungarian imperialism,

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,840
and it lost not just the war, having proclaimed a worldwide jihad against Christianity,

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,840
except for German and Austrian and Hungarian Christianity, which were its allies.

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,840
And it didn't just lose the war, but by 1924 had been dissolved by the Turkish leadership, by Ataturk.

107
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
It lost the Caliphate.

108
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,840
And that's the only one that still has supporters.

109
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
The other Christian and religious empires have all gone.

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,840
But the Caliphate still has fans, not just in the Muslim world, sometimes referred to by Muslims as the Dar al-Islam,

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,840
the House of Islam, but also in what some Muslims call the Dar al-Hab, the House of War,

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,840
the part of the world that isn't yet Muslim.

113
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,840
There are Caliphate clubs in London now and Berlin and elsewhere, quite important ones.

114
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,840
And what I want to know is why that is and what we should think about it.

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,840
The believers in this fantasy have, lorries spared me the need to say much of this,

116
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:31,840
have committed extraordinary atrocities in Istanbul, in Madrid, in India, in the Philippines, in Indonesia,

117
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,840
and of course in our own fair city.

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,840
And the pretexts for it vary.

119
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:48,840
The excuse for the mass murder can be that Australia has helped East Timor become independent from Indonesia.

120
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,840
It can be that Newsweek has printed a full story about the desecration of a supposedly holy book.

121
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,840
You never know what it's going to be next, but everyone knows to be careful about it,

122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,840
and everyone understands that the threat of violence that backs it is believable.

123
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
And that's my opening position.

124
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Now you will say, I can hear it already being said, you may be saying it already to yourselves

125
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
because the defence mechanisms kick in.

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
And in any case, Laurie already said it for you.

127
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,840
And I hope Professor Ramadan won't feel the need to say it again, but if he does, fair enough.

128
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,840
You may say, ah, that's not the real Islam.

129
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Those aren't real Muslims.

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Now isn't that a fascinating objection?

131
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Is there anyone in this room?

132
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,840
I exempt Professor Ramadan because it's his turn to speak next.

133
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Is there anyone in this room who would care to arbitrate that question?

134
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Who is to say?

135
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Where is the authority that defines who is the true son of the prophet or true interpreter of his work?

136
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Part of the problem to begin with, and it's part of the problem because it is a religion,

137
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,840
is that it's perfectly true to say we don't know who the true Muslims are.

138
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,840
And how right that is, who does speak for it.

139
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Only the second problem with defining Islam is peaceful.

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Only the second problem with defining it as peaceful has to do with the fact that it's highly fissile

141
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,840
and highly schismatic, that there is a civil war going on within it, the religion of peace.

142
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,840
As we speak, at least one civil war between the votaries of this religion of peace is already taking place.

143
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,840
And some of it is exported outside that world into ours, very salient fact.

144
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
The first reason, though, is this.

145
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Islam makes very large claims for itself, very large claims indeed.

146
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,840
It claims to be the last and final religion, the last and final revelation.

147
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,840
When you see bumper stickers, everyone says you can't reduce major things to a bumper sticker.

148
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,840
It's not my idea to have bumper stickers saying Islam is the solution.

149
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,840
It's a well-known slogan actually of parties associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.

150
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,840
They say Islam is the solution for everything.

151
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,840
It takes care of all your life and the one to come.

152
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Sexuality, political economy, banking, diet, relations with other religions, everything.

153
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
It's a total solution.

154
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
What is creepy about the word total?

155
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I hope I don't have to tell an audience like this.

156
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,840
It's the first five letters of the word totalitarian.

157
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,840
It's absolute. It's all inclusive.

158
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,840
It's unanswerable and oddly for a religion that makes such large claims.

159
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Notice another thing about Islam.

160
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,840
It doesn't particularly like having these claims questioned or scrutinized.

161
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,840
In other words, as there are just as there is with all religions an inverse relationship

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,840
between the claims they make and the evidence they can produce for them.

163
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
You must have noticed that.

164
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,840
With Islam, a younger religion and perhaps therefore more on its first flush,

165
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,840
there's an extraordinarily strong willingness to say that any challenge to its absolutist claims

166
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
is by definition profane.

167
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,840
And profanity and blasphemy can be the antecedent to very severe punishment

168
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,840
and often are for Muslims and for non-Muslims.

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
And this is not a road of peace in my submission.

170
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,840
That's my first point completed.

171
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,840
The claim to govern everything from hygiene to sex and the afterlife,

172
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,840
which contains detailed prescriptions for the good and bad versions of itself,

173
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,840
again strikes me as somewhat totalitarian.

174
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,840
And they're both based upon two very, very questionable and not very peaceful concepts.

175
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,840
One is the idea of a perfect human being, the Prophet Muhammad.

176
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
And the other is the idea of a perfect book, the Qur'an, the recitation.

177
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Now the category perfect human primate or mammal

178
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,840
and the category flawless book that could possibly not use any kind of change, revision or editing

179
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
are categories that do not exist.

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
There are no members of these categories.

181
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Therefore, any challenge to this faith is bound to lead to heresy and to schism and does.

182
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
And just as all forms of absolutism and totalitarianism,

183
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,840
leader worship and revealed truth, unalterable text always do

184
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,840
because they can break, perhaps, but they cannot bend.

185
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,840
And thus the latent potential of violence between them, among them,

186
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
as well as within them is very great.

187
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,840
And at any moment someone is in danger of being accused of being an apostate or an unbeliever.

188
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:02,840
This week, the Coptic Pope of Egypt, Pope Shenouda, who represents 10 million Egyptians,

189
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
was hustled onto Egyptian TV.

190
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
He's not asked on all that often.

191
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
I don't think he was even asked on this time.

192
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I think he was told he'd better come on.

193
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Why is the leader of Egyptians, Egypt's huge Christian minority,

194
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
suddenly compelled to make a TV appearance?

195
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Because one of his bishops had said in an interview

196
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,840
that he thought that some of the verses of the Quran showed signs of having been added later on

197
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
and to have been later accretion.

198
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,840
And Pope Shenouda was forced onto the television to say,

199
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
it's not that that didn't happen.

200
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
He said it couldn't have happened.

201
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
It shouldn't even be discussed.

202
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,840
So that it has to be claimed even by non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim state

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,840
that there is, after all, because no Christian claims this about the Bible anymore

204
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
and no Jew claims it about the Pentateuch.

205
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
After all, yes, there is just one book that's completely word and letter perfect

206
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,840
from the first time it was not even written down but recited.

207
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Now, demands that you believe the impossible do not lead to peaceful outcomes.

208
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Nor do they lead to peaceful or tolerant regimes.

209
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,840
And I'm not going to ask you which Muslim country you would like to live in.

210
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I don't know whether Professor Ramallah will tell us which one he would pick if he had to

211
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
because I don't have to ask you a question like that because it's already in your mind.

212
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Can you wind up now?

213
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Yes, I can.

214
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I can, yes, and will.

215
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Shall, shall in fact.

216
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Sexual repression doesn't lead to peace.

217
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,840
The idea that women are inferior to men is a profound cause of unease, let's say, the least of it.

218
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,840
All religions make some form of this claim.

219
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Islam seems to make it less apologetically than most.

220
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Claims that the world will come to an end in an apocalyptic form

221
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,840
which will lead to the victory of one religion or another are not peaceful either.

222
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,840
It's possible, perhaps, I haven't exhausted all my remarks,

223
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,840
that the endless teaching of battle stories to children

224
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,840
and the stories of lethal feuds from 7th century Arabia don't lead to peace

225
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,840
or the forcing of children to memorize and retell such stories by rote doesn't lead to peace either.

226
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,840
It's arguable that peace isn't attainable at all.

227
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,840
It may be arguable in some forms, sometimes in places that religion isn't even desirable.

228
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:43,840
But it will not come by the fanatical adoption of a man-made text and a man-made supreme leader.

229
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Nothing but war and tyranny has ever come from the adoption of formulae like these.

230
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,840
The only way to moral and intellectual satisfaction, even temporary,

231
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,840
perhaps only temporary, but of any kind at all,

232
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,840
comes to those who are willing to take the great risk of thinking for themselves at all hazards

233
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,840
and trying to share the benefits of that tolerance and that open-mindedness with others.

234
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
And with that, for now, I'll rest my case. Thank you very much.

235
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Thank you.

236
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,840
First, thank you for this invitation here this evening.

237
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,840
And I really also want to thank, once again, Oxford University Press for organizing my visit here in the States.

238
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:58,840
And I won't forget ACLU and others who helped me to struggle for my rights for being here in the States

239
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:07,840
and being able to speak, to listen and to contribute to the American debate or the Western debate.

240
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,840
And I know that among us, Jamil Jaffer is here, so I want to thank you again for this support.

241
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Let me go straight to some of the points, and I'm not going to respond straight away to some of the claims on all the claims,

242
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:31,840
but during my talk, as it is the introductory speech, let me highlight some of the points.

243
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,840
When I got the question, of course, as a Muslim and as a believer,

244
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:47,840
but as someone who is coming from within the realm of religions, it was quite clear that to put it that way was not the right question to ask.

245
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Is Islam a religion of peace, or is Christianity, or is Judaism, or is Buddhism a religion or a spirituality of peace?

246
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Doesn't mean anything for me. It's not the right question. It's not the accurate question.

247
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,840
It's not because I think that there is a good Islam and the right Islam,

248
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,840
and there are people who are acting in the name of Islam who are not representing what Islam is.

249
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
This is not my point. I never said that, by the way.

250
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,840
But the point for me is really to try to deal with a phenomenon with religion from within

251
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,840
and to try to understand the dynamics and to understand the trends and to understand the diversity.

252
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,840
So just to essentialize one religion by saying it's all about war. It's all about peace.

253
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:39,840
And even, you know, said by George W. Bush, doesn't mean anything for me.

254
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,840
So this is one point which is important, but religions and old religions and Islam,

255
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
among all the other religions, are dealing with human beings.

256
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
And if you deal with human beings, you deal with violence and you deal with peace.

257
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,840
You deal with violence because human beings, by definition, have to deal with violence.

258
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
They have to deal with aggressivity, wars.

259
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,840
And to expect from a religion not to tackle the issue,

260
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
is just to dream of something which is not going to happen, all the spirituality.

261
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Go for Buddhism or go for the Bhagavad Gita. You deal with violence.

262
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
So this is it.

263
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Now, what is the answer coming from religions and from trends when it comes to violence and to peace?

264
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,840
The right question for me. Do we have something which is coming and helping us to go towards peace?

265
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
This is for me the right question.

266
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,840
So now, once again, when I have people speaking from outside,

267
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,840
and it's especially the case these days when it comes to Islam,

268
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,840
is we speak about Islam and we speak about, you know, something which is a religion

269
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,840
that is perceived through one window or through one interpretation

270
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,840
and we very often take what is visible through the media.

271
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,840
But Islam is as complex as Christianity and Judaism and Buddhism and Hinduism.

272
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,840
It's a diversity of interpretations.

273
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Yes, you are right.

274
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,840
The Quran is for the Muslims the very word of God.

275
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,840
But many interpretations and many ways of dealing with the books.

276
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,840
The problem is that the book, the problem is the reader.

277
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
It's the way, no, no, we have only 10 minutes.

278
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,840
So this is why when, for example, you take a text,

279
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:40,840
and you can do this with the Bible, with the Torah, the Gospels, it's always the same.

280
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Tell me the way you read.

281
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,840
I will know what is in your mind, but not for sure what is in the text.

282
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,840
And this is something which is the starting point of a serious discussion in theology.

283
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Because I don't like all these intellectuals and philosophers and even journalists.

284
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,840
They are very keen on understanding the complexity of philosophies and the simplicity of religions.

285
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
That's not right.

286
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
And the one to blame sometimes are the religious people themselves.

287
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Because the way to present their religion is something which is all of dream and hopes

288
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
and not dealing with the reality, which is a complex reality.

289
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,840
And this is where I think we have to come to a better understanding.

290
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,840
So very often when I deal with such topics, I just have to start with the very beginning.

291
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
We want to deal with the religion.

292
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Let us speak about religious issues and religious understanding.

293
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Not to avoid the starting to just to come to newspapers and headlines.

294
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Not to help us to understand religion, just to go for what is happening in the world.

295
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Let us also understand the fundamentals and then come to some of the translation, the historical experiences.

296
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Because as much as you can speak about September 11, you can speak about the 16th century

297
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,840
under the Ottoman Empire, which was a great civilization with the diversity of Christians and Jews

298
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
and even non-believers working and living together.

299
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,840
We are always speaking about Indonesia, but we can prove everything with history.

300
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,840
If we don't get a sense of what are the principles we are talking about.

301
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,840
So for example, coming from a religious viewpoint, I wouldn't say Islam is a religion of peace.

302
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I say Islam is a religion for human beings.

303
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,840
It deals with peace and it deals with violence.

304
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
And it helps the people to go from violence towards peace.

305
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,840
It's a way towards peace, but it's not a peaceful reality because we are not peaceful beings.

306
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
We are all in tension.

307
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Just to get that inner peace in us, and this is the starting point of the Islamic philosophy of human being

308
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
is really to start with your own self.

309
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,840
Look at your heart and tell me if you are at peace or you were at peace.

310
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Peace is a process through which you have, it's a process that you get at the end of a self-education.

311
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Educate yourself to get this inner peace.

312
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,840
This is coming from the universal message of all the religions.

313
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,840
You get this in Buddhism before even speaking or not even speaking about one God,

314
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,840
but you get it in Judaism, you get it in Christianity.

315
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Educate yourself to get that peace.

316
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,840
So you have to deal with your inner wars and tensions.

317
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
So this is the way we have to deal with the issue about peace.

318
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
And the starting point is spirituality, why?

319
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Because at the end of the day, it's really something which is important.

320
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
And this is the difference that you can find between Islam and the Greek tradition.

321
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
If you come back to Socrates, Socrates was saying your body in itself is bad.

322
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,840
And this is why you have the soul helping you to educate your body and to master your body.

323
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
In Islam, there is nothing like that.

324
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Your body is not bad, is not good, and your soul is not bad, is not good.

325
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
It depends on what you are going to make out of it.

326
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
It's your responsibility because you are free.

327
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Your dignity is in your freedom, and you have to use your freedom to make it bad to make it good.

328
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Take the good decision for your body, that's good.

329
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Make the bad decision, that's bad.

330
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,840
So it's all a question of educating yourself with your own body.

331
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,840
And it's exactly the same when it comes to the understanding of the world.

332
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
So this way towards peace, it's based on education.

333
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,840
It's based on a spiritual way of dealing with yourself.

334
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
And you know what is the meaning of that?

335
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,840
The very essence of what I'm trying to translate now is jihad.

336
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,840
So this is something which is coming from the classical tradition.

337
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,840
And once again, the classical tradition is helping us understand jihad is resist the bad to promote the good.

338
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
And the bad is in yourself first.

339
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
And then you will try to get the good.

340
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
And to get the good is this inner peace.

341
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
So jihad is not the way towards war, it's the way towards peace.

342
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Because you have as a human being intrinsically to deal with your inner wars and inner tensions.

343
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,840
It's exactly the same in the world that what we have to do, you will find something which is the wheel of God.

344
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
What is the wheel of God? Diversity.

345
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,840
He made you tribes and nations in order for you to know each other.

346
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,840
But you know the risk of diversity, it could be lots of knowledge and protection wars.

347
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,840
So you have to educate yourself to live with other and with this diversity to know each other.

348
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,840
So you can look at Islam saying you know what Islam claims?

349
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
It's the last and final religion.

350
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
It's not enough to end with this sentence.

351
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
The most important thing is what Islam is saying about the other religions.

352
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
That you have to remove them from the earth?

353
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
No.

354
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,840
He made you tribes and nations in order for you to know each other.

355
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,840
So respect the Christians, respect the Jews, respect the people who were before you.

356
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,840
So it's a call towards respect that you find also in the texts.

357
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,840
So yes, you will have Muslims, they will take one dimension and interpret this as it is the final religion.

358
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
We are not going to deal with all the others.

359
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,840
But you cannot deny the fact that through history, Muslims in many situations, in many historical situations,

360
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,840
were dealing with this diversity and we learned from the Middle Ages and we learned from the Ottoman Empire

361
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,840
that Muslims are able to deal with diversity and take from the Jewish tradition.

362
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,840
My monitess was speaking Arabic better than me.

363
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,840
He was a Jew and he was an intellectual and he was a theologian and he was dealing with respectful people.

364
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:44,840
So all these Muslims were wrong Muslims because they did not understand that the final religion should not listen to the first monotheistic tradition.

365
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
That's not true.

366
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
You can't reduce this in such a way.

367
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,840
It's too simplistic to represent what a religion is and what a history and a historical experience is.

368
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:05,840
So this is for me something which has to do with the diversity that we have that it's rooted in the Islamic tradition as well,

369
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,840
in the classical tradition that we find it.

370
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,840
So when you deal with diversity, know that you need to promote and it's out of your personal education,

371
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,840
mutual knowledge to get respect.

372
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,840
But you also have to deal sometimes with oppressors and people who are going to try to take over

373
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
and you have to resist.

374
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,840
And this resistance in order to reform the world for the better is the very meaning of jihad.

375
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Now, once again, I will never deny the fact that some Muslims, some theologians in history and now are using some of the verses in a way which is for me unacceptable.

376
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,840
And you know, I go even further than that.

377
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Just after September 11 when I was invited by time, I came here and I was asked about this.

378
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,840
I said, you know what, it's not only not good and not Islamic.

379
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
It's anti-Islamic what they are doing.

380
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
It's against my religion.

381
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
It's against the principles.

382
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
So I'm not saying this is the good religion and this is bad.

383
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,840
I acknowledge the fact that they are interpreting the text in a way.

384
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,840
But what I'm saying from where I am from within my tradition is this is anti-Islamic.

385
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,840
This is not the right way to deal with the text.

386
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:32,840
So you can introduce this into something which is, oh, the only right Muslims are the Muslims who are acting the way I believe Islam is, meaning bad.

387
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
I think it's not fair.

388
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
It's not a discussion that we can have.

389
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,840
So let me come to my conclusion here.

390
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:53,840
At the end of the day, if you go through the text and you understand the philosophy of this way towards peace, dealing with your own wars and inner tensions and the tensions within the society,

391
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:05,840
you will find interpretations within Islam that are promoting something which has to do with peace without avoiding violence because we all have to deal with our violence.

392
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,840
This is something which is important and in history you will find the examples for this and for that.

393
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
So don't rely on history.

394
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
History you prove whatever you want.

395
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,840
But at the end of the day, this is exactly the case for all the philosophies.

396
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:31,840
All the people who are promoting human rights, we all have to do something which is out of humility to check our people.

397
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Because with the best means, you can promote the bad or the worst attitude.

398
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,840
In the name of human rights, we want to kill people.

399
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,840
In the name of human rights, we can promote and support the war in Iraq and Afghanistan where so many innocent people have been killed.

400
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:02,840
And I said it from the beginning, never forget that the blood of an Avrani or Iraqi innocent man or woman is as valuable as the blood of an American innocent man or woman.

401
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
No discussion about this.

402
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:12,840
So the best ideology in the name of human rights, in the name of democracy could be used by people to promote the worst.

403
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
So let us be humble.

404
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Instead of criticizing one religion and one ideology to know that in our universe of reference, you will find people using our texts, our values.

405
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad.

406
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Sometimes for peace and sometimes for war.

407
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Sometimes for dignity and sometimes for money.

408
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Sometimes for protecting freedom and sometimes for geo-strategic interests.

409
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,840
It's not right to essentialize by saying all the wars on human rights, for human rights.

410
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:55,840
All these philosophies are right or wrong or promoting a philosophy or a religion of violence.

411
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:08,840
I think that these kind of conclusions are very dangerous because they don't give us the opportunity to find in any single religion, in any single philosophy, people of good will.

412
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:16,840
These are the people who can talk to each other, understand each other and make it possible to live in diversity and in mutual respect.

413
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
Thank you.

414
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Well, I also don't think that the motion, if that's what it is, chosen for this evening, is a particularly good one.

415
00:33:50,840 --> 00:34:02,840
But I knew about it as long as Professor Ramadan did and I did at least agree to speak to it in spite of that reservation.

416
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:16,840
And I make this not just as a point of self-pity, but because, for example, someone in this great city who's become used to making nice these days, Imam Rauf,

417
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:25,840
who describes himself as both founder and visionary of whatever the downtown establishment is now to be called,

418
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,840
wrote an article, I'm pretty sure it was on the eve of Yom Kippur for the New York Times, in which he said,

419
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,840
when you think about it, this is one of the most hand-washing statements I've yet heard him make in the Make Nice department,

420
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
when you think about it, our word Islam is almost exact translation of your word shalom.

421
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,840
I didn't say it.

422
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
I've never heard anyone else say it.

423
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,840
It isn't true, among other things.

424
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Islam may have some relationship to the word shalom, which can have some relationship to the word prostration or religious observance.

425
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,840
It may, but we know what Islam means, is intended to mean and does mean, is surrender to God.

426
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Acceptance of God's surrender sometimes translated as submission, but in any case, the resignation to the Divine will.

427
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Again, not in my opinion, a prescription for peace, but that isn't my only objection to it.

428
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:25,840
I don't think that abjection or fatalism or the prostration before a divine or, let alone before,

429
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:32,840
holy men who are interpreting the book is a recipe for good health of any kind, mental or physical,

430
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,840
since we're talking about the Greek concept of the body and of the spirit and of virtue.

431
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Just to get that out of the way, now you're right.

432
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I was surprised to find myself saying,

433
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Professor, when you say that the problem is not the book, but the reader.

434
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
In the case of the Quran, that is certainly true of me.

435
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,840
It's true probably of every book I've ever read, that there are difficulties I have with it,

436
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,840
or capacities I don't have with which to approach it, to understand it.

437
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:10,840
But if I'm reading the Quran, I certainly say, well, I can't tell whether this book is the Word of God or not.

438
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:20,840
I don't really doubt that there is such a thing, but I can hope that this was a bad day for God.

439
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Can't I? And I can hope to live in a country where I can say that and get applause.

440
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Yes, and even mirth. And don't think that it isn't a precious thing and don't think it's being compromised.

441
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:43,840
I'm coming to that. I don't like the idea of a paradise reward for martyrs.

442
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Don't like it. It's not me somehow.

443
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Don't like the account. Don't like the early accounts of village squabbles with the local Jews

444
00:36:52,840 --> 00:37:00,840
who've taken a look at the new claimant to be the Messiah and decided about him what they decided about, the previous claimant.

445
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:08,840
He's no good. He's not up to snuff. Do you think the Jews are ever going to be forgiven for that, by the way?

446
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:15,840
For rejecting two in a row. I don't think so. And I don't see why they should. Hope for.

447
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I don't see why they should hope for forgiveness either.

448
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,840
And still I'm allowed to stand here and say this, and there are many parts of Europe. I couldn't do that anymore.

449
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Or I'd have to be very careful in who I'd invited for the audience. I couldn't do it easily on the air.

450
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Couldn't do it easily in print. Couldn't do it easily in public. Couldn't do it on certain campuses.

451
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Couldn't do it with certain publishing houses.

452
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Now, all of this has been done to us by the wrong Muslims.

453
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Well, let's get together then, isolate who these wrong Muslims are, who've imposed a culture of violence-backed censorship upon us,

454
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,840
and let's get rid of them and have an honest discussion about the text and the reader.

455
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,840
And I think the ball is in your court, Professor, on that. Just to stay with my own profession, the thing I know best.

456
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Not one major media outlet, print or broadcast, has yet shown you what the Danish cartoons actually look like.

457
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Yale University Press, which commissioned a book on them, which was to include the cartoons, as how could it not, eventually panicked.

458
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Yale University Press panicked and published the book without the cartoons over the objections of its author.

459
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Everybody knows what I'm talking about.

460
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,840
The President of the United States and the head of the Joint Chiefs a few days ago were so pulverized with fear

461
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,840
that they had to address personally in pleading tones a Christian nutbag in Florida

462
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,840
who might have been or might not have been about to commit a minor act of blasphemy.

463
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Is this the culture that Islam wants us to have in relation to it?

464
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:03,840
One of, if you like, pre-emptive submission, pre-emptive cowering backed by the fear of force.

465
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Because that is not multiculturalism. That's nothing like the gorgeous mosaic.

466
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,840
That's actually the absolute negation of what a multicultural system would be like.

467
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:23,840
And a multicultural system has to look rather ascense, I think, on a religion whose preachers and websites openly, openly make threats

468
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:32,840
against people like myself, against the Jewish people, against the Hindus who, to heaven's sake, aren't even monotheists.

469
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,840
It can be killed on almost any pretext.

470
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,840
And a very important point, and I have to make it, and against the wrong kind of Muslim.

471
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Now, Professor, don't, I'll say this as mildly as I can, don't, you may not be aware that you were,

472
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,840
and I don't want to increase the area of unexpected offence taking

473
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,840
that's been so hugely broadened by the sensitivities of a religion that has the answer to everything.

474
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:13,840
But I'll just say I don't greatly care to be told, as if I didn't know, that an Iraqi life is as precious as an American one.

475
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,840
And as someone who's visited Iraq quite a lot, had the occasion to think about it a good deal,

476
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I wonder if you could mention anything the United States has done in Iraq,

477
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:36,840
that is remotely as criminal, as sadistic and as violent as the blowing up of the mosque of the Golden Dome in Samara.

478
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,840
One of the holiest sites in the Muslim world, callously blown up by Sunni forces in alliance with

479
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,840
forces who, perhaps I'd agree with them for once on this, were fascistic barthists.

480
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Probably they got the weapons and the high explosive from them, that makes it worse, surely.

481
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Intending to start and successfully in fact initiating a civil war, in which countless thousands of people have been killed,

482
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,840
religious processions have been fired upon, funerals have been fired upon,

483
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Iran's without number of course been incinerated, much more importantly children, old people and civilians.

484
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Now where is, I just wonder, you must be able to quote it to me.

485
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Where is the Sunni fatwa against this conduct?

486
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Where is it?

487
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Where is the authoritative statement of moral outrage in the Sunni world saying,

488
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,840
this is not acceptable behavior for followers of the Prophet?

489
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,840
I missed it.

490
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,840
And so apparently did the followers of the Prophet miss it because they keep on doing this all the time.

491
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,840
They were doing it before the United States got to Iraq and they'll be doing it after we've gone.

492
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,840
So I'm sorry I won't be talked to in that tone of voice.

493
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,840
And I want to know, I repeat my question, who has the authority to issue fatwas?

494
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Is it Sheikh Haridawi who sometimes very much expressed respectful,

495
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,840
who on Al Jazeera gives advice on all kinds of things?

496
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Some of the minoculars, sexual matters and so forth, doctrinal rulings,

497
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,840
sometimes upon the legitimacy or otherwise of suicide bombing, if directed at Israelis,

498
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,840
not just Jews of course, but I know we draw the distinction.

499
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,840
On the other hand Hamas, which does the suicide bombing, doesn't draw the distinction.

500
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,840
If I can't issue a fatwa against Hamas, if I'm a Muslim, if there's no one who will and they won't,

501
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,840
surely someone could say, we don't think Hamas should have on its website and manifesto

502
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,840
the reproduction of the protocols of the elders of Zion.

503
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:56,840
A Christian fascist fabrication that is one of the warrants for the Nazi exterminationist solution.

504
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I mean, surely that's a question for the UN anti-racism committee on a spare day.

505
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Or, since that spare day never seems to come, for some Muslim authority to say,

506
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,840
no brothers, don't do that. It doesn't come. It doesn't happen.

507
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,840
Look on the website, it's still there.

508
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Now, you would do better, I think, Professor, if you identified yourself as a member of a very small

509
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,840
and critical and endangered minority, someone who really is against all this

510
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,840
and will also decry the fact that the religion itself can't seem to throw it off.

511
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,840
But you seem to have that a little bit both ways.

512
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,840
Now, yes, so then my closing statement is this.

513
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,840
If you want diversity, as much as the professor does, as much as I'm sure many people here do,

514
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,840
religious diversity, cultural diversity, what you need for it is this.

515
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,840
You need a secular state with a godless constitution like this one.

516
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:22,840
To speak as you did of the Ottoman Empire is a place where there were not just Muslims,

517
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,840
but Christians and Jews, is either not to know yourself or to expect others to have forgotten

518
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,840
or not to know what it meant to be a non-Muslim under the caliphate

519
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,840
or under any similar theocratic Muslim authority to this day.

520
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,840
No, what we need, secularism is the only guarantee of religious freedom,

521
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,840
and yours and that of every other Muslim, we will defend.

522
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,840
But you won't be surprised that we have some questions for you in the meanwhile.

523
00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Thank you.

524
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Okay.

525
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,840
You laugh a lot and make love to people.

526
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,840
And I have a problem with, we are talking about people who are being killed,

527
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,840
we're talking about people about wars, that's fine.

528
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I have a problem with the way you are putting things here.

529
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,840
First, you know, when you said the first from Mark, say, okay, you know what,

530
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,840
total, these are the first letters of totalitarianism,

531
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,840
because Islam is a comprehensive religion, by the way, exactly like Judaism and Christianity.

532
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:48,840
I never met a rabbi, a Christian, telling me you are with God on Saturday

533
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,840
and with the devil on Monday, or what's that?

534
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,840
But in Islam, it's as if it's all together.

535
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,840
It's a very simplistic way of dealing with Islam.

536
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
It's a comprehensive religion, but there are rights of God and rights of people,

537
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,840
and you have to differentiate, and it's very old.

538
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Come back to Alain de Libera, the French philosopher, telling you,

539
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
you know what's separating authority between what is to God and what is to human being,

540
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
it's coming from Islam.

541
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,840
And this was taught and translated into Christianity in the Middle Ages,

542
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
exactly opposite to what we think.

543
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,840
You may disagree, but at least acknowledge the fact that there are many interpretations in history

544
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,840
that say Islam is this total, main, totalitarian.

545
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,840
What's that?

546
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,840
Otto, these are the first letters of autocratic.

547
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,840
It's not an argument.

548
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,840
It's not serious.

549
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,840
And as I said, yes, we are talking about reading,

550
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
and by the way, it's for all the texts.

551
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
It's the same for the Marxist.

552
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,840
You know quite well about the Marxist tradition.

553
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,840
And you know what some Marxists did with the text?

554
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,840
It means that everything that Marx wrote was bad?

555
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
No.

556
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Once again, it's a serious matter here.

557
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,840
When we are talking about interpretations, I mean it.

558
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,840
I mean that yes, there are people using the text in a way which is not,

559
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:21,840
and you have historically to acknowledge the fact that you yourself might have read some of the text,

560
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
not in the good way.

561
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,840
So this is the second point.

562
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:31,840
About now, the cartoons and some of the things that you were referring to.

563
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:39,840
You know, look at the Muslim majority countries,

564
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,840
and look at the Muslims and the Western Muslims.

565
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,840
And if you look at the reaction of the Muslims living in the States or living in Europe,

566
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,840
you cannot just say Islam was one, all the Muslims were reacting the same way.

567
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,840
By the way, the very month of October when the whole story started,

568
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,840
I was in Copenhagen and I said to the Muslims,

569
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,840
take a critical distance and don't be involved in this.

570
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,840
You don't like it, but let it be because this is freedom.

571
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,840
The point is that you are not making because you are reducing something which is,

572
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,840
or the cartoon was all about freedom of expression.

573
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,840
You don't speak about the instrumentalization by politicians and governments in Muslim majority countries

574
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,840
and even in the West about the whole story.

575
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,840
Because this is too complex to be put in.

576
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,840
So many authorities, many scholars,

577
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,840
and then you come with the Muslims who are able to speak.

578
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,840
If you read some of the things that I'm doing or writing, you would say that,

579
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,840
yes, I acknowledge the fact that there is a crisis of authority in Islam,

580
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:50,840
but please don't tell me today that you didn't hear the Muslim voices around the world

581
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,840
deciding and saying this is unacceptable to kill the people in the streets in New York

582
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,840
and the condemnation was widespread by the scholars.

583
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:09,840
If you don't hear, of course, there's not less than 12 councils of Muslim scholars around the world

584
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,840
from Amman to Istanbul to Paris Dublin were condemning this.

585
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,840
It's as if they don't speak because at the end,

586
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,840
when the people are calling to kill for killing, they are heard.

587
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,840
But when people are condemning what is done in the name of the religion,

588
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,840
it's as if they don't speak, it doesn't make the headlines.

589
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,840
But I'm telling you that some scholars did it and said it, and I was one of them.

590
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,840
And you know what is very interesting in the whole discussion?

591
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,840
When the people like what I'm saying, say, you know what?

592
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,840
What he's saying is good, but he's alone.

593
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Minority, it's open, but he's alone.

594
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,840
But when the people don't like what I say, say, you know what?

595
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,840
He has huge followers.

596
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,840
So depending on if you like or not what is said, you have followers or not.

597
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,840
So I can tell you something that the mainstream Muslim presence in the West,

598
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,840
in many Muslim majority countries as well,

599
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,840
acknowledged the fact that they are critical towards the use of the religion.

600
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Now, many Muslims, yes, would support, and I did this.

601
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,840
And by the way, I was banned from this country, mainly for that.

602
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,840
I was saying, for example, that the Palestinian resistance is legitimate.

603
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,840
And I said that and I repeat this here.

604
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,840
But I also said that the means used to kill innocent civilians

605
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,840
and innocent Jews in an Israeli, in Israel, I cannot accept that.

606
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Have you heard that? I said it.

607
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,840
So, and I'm not alone.

608
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
I'm not alone.

609
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,840
So once again, it's many interpretations.

610
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,840
Listen to this and also be respectful of this diversity

611
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,840
and the way the Muslims are dealing with this.

612
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,840
So the fatawa, the legal opinions are coming from everywhere

613
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,840
when you speak about some of the issues because you know it's sensitive.

614
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
So you put it in a very simplistic way.

615
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Women, violence, Hamas and all these together, it gives the impression,

616
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,840
oh yes, yes, this is right.

617
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,840
But you don't give the people all the interpretation,

618
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,840
everything which is done in every one of these fields

619
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
coming from the Islamic tradition and scholars of today

620
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,840
trying to improve the status of women,

621
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,840
trying to condemn violence and to promote justice and peace.

622
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
You also have to deal with this.

623
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,840
At the end, you may have a problem with religion much more than with Islam.

624
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:40,840
And to tell me at the end of your speech,

625
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,840
the only right solution is a secular, godless constitution.

626
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,840
In the United States of America, I think it's problematic

627
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,840
because I don't think it's a godless nation here.

628
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,840
There is a reference.

629
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,840
So, no, no.

630
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,840
Only the constitution.

631
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
No, only the constitution.

632
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,840
But I don't think that even the politician

633
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,840
and even the president of the United States of America

634
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,840
is referring to something which is a godless secular system.

635
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Or I don't understand all the speeches I listen to.

636
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:26,840
But the point is that my way of dealing with the secular or separating authority,

637
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,840
I don't have a problem with separating authorities.

638
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,840
I don't have a problem with this.

639
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,840
And it's even my solution in Israel and with Palestinians.

640
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,840
I want one state where the people can live together under the same rule of law.

641
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,840
But it's as if we agree on this in France but not really in Israel

642
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,840
because it wouldn't be Israel.

643
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,840
So it's a selective, not consistent approach.

644
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,840
I want you to say this everywhere in that way.

645
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
And then you are saying it,

646
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:03,840
but I would say that the people who are uploading sometimes they want this for some and not for all.

647
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,840
So, let me tell you something.

648
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,840
I'm critical from within.

649
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,840
And I think that I'm far from being the only one.

650
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,840
And from within the Islamic tradition, listen to also, for example,

651
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:25,840
the Western Muslims who, the way they were dealing with September 11th,

652
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,840
the way they were dealing with the cartoon crisis, the way they were dealing with fitna,

653
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,840
many of them were saying, no, don't be involved in the United States of America.

654
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,840
How the Muslims reacted to all this controversy on the mosque here in New York

655
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,840
or in burning the Koran Day.

656
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Listen, were they all violent?

657
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Or have you heard some voices of reason and peace in this country?

658
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,840
I think if you are honest, you heard these voices of peace,

659
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,840
of people referring to their religion and saying we are Americans

660
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,840
and what we want for this country is a peaceful, proactive existence and coexistence.

661
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,840
I think that this is also coming from the ethics, their values,

662
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,840
and you have to value this as being the future.

663
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,840
So to dream of something which is a godless future, I think it's a wrong dream.

664
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,840
But to be able to deal with all this diversity and to listen to the voices,

665
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,840
instead of rejecting an entity as something which is bad per se,

666
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,840
let us look at the people who from within are trying to do good with what they are

667
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
and what they believe in.

668
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,840
I think that this is the way forward for all of us

669
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,840
which is the way I would put it for the future.

670
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,840
And I'm not talking about wrong Muslims.

671
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,840
I'm talking about a critical debate among Muslims

672
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,840
and I hope that you yourself, with the people who are supporting some of the views,

673
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,840
you are also critical about the way you sometimes reduce the ardor to an alien presence,

674
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,840
not helping us to get to a better understanding, a critical debate.

675
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,840
Sometimes I'm just lost with the way you put things

676
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,840
because the debate is closed before it started.

677
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,840
Thank you.

678
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:28,840
Thank you.

679
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,840
We're going to try to get to the core of some of what you raised

680
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
and then get to some questions.

681
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,840
That ran long but I think it was very fruitful.

682
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,840
I want to distill something that came up here, two important things.

683
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,840
One is the question of authority in Islam.

684
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,840
A scholar once told me that he thinks the problem with Islam

685
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,840
is that every Tom, Dick, and Harry can give fatwa

686
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,840
and that there's no pope, there's no magisterium

687
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:07,840
and so in some ways what you have is leadership by whoever has the biggest audience.

688
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Right now one of the most revered scholars is Yusuf al-Karadawi

689
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,840
and he takes an opposite position from Professor Ramadan

690
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,840
on the question of suicide attacks in Israel.

691
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:31,840
He has a program with 40 million listeners and he has a website

692
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,840
and he says that suicide attacks on Israeli citizens,

693
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,840
even women and children are acceptable because all of Israel is a militarized society

694
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
and all citizens are combatants.

695
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,840
The question here is he's got this very large, very large audience

696
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,840
and since there is no arbitrating authority, there's no single authority,

697
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,840
it's not what Islam becomes, whoever has the biggest audience

698
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,840
has the sway in what the faith is.

699
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:11,840
I think that it's true if we look at what is happening now

700
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,840
in the Muslim majority countries as well as in the West

701
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
that there is something that we can call a crisis of authority.

702
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,840
In the book Radical Reform I'm tackling this from many viewpoints

703
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,840
and not only from political discussion,

704
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,840
it's really even in our way to deal with sciences, human sciences, ethics,

705
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
we have this problem.

706
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,840
You know when you don't know how to manage diversity,

707
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,840
it ends up with division and not knowing who is leading

708
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,840
and this is the way, we don't have a church so we have diversity in Islam

709
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,840
so we have to know how to manage this and it's problematic.

710
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,840
And I would say that if you look today at what is happening

711
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
even though we have this crisis,

712
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,840
if you look today at what is happening around the world,

713
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,840
you will see that we have many councils,

714
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:04,840
still the mainstream is not promoting violence and extremist views.

715
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,840
The mainstream is promoting what is said for example about

716
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,840
Western Muslims or Muslims living in Muslim majority countries

717
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,840
is about transparency, no corruption, democratization.

718
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
This is the mainstream that is coming.

719
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Now we have voices and you speak about Yusuf al-Qardawi

720
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:27,840
and you were saying that I was one of the supporters of him.

721
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,840
You know I have one position in everyone and everybody I am dealing with

722
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,840
in history in the past and as is even the present.

723
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,840
I read what is said and I try to be selective.

724
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,840
So for example on that point, killing, I said no, I disagree.

725
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,840
On identity and when he once was very harsh with me saying

726
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,840
no we have one identity and in Islamic I said no,

727
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,840
we have multiple identity, I am Swiss by nationality,

728
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,840
Egyptian by memory, Muslim by religion, European by culture,

729
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
these are my identities, he didn't agree.

730
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:09,840
So I talk to people but I know that on this for example in Israel

731
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:15,840
I disagree with him but you can't reduce Yusuf al-Qardawi in the world today

732
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,840
to this position because he had many other positions on women,

733
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,840
on the society, on democracy.

734
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:26,840
He is promoting something which he called democracy in the Muslim majority country

735
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,840
that you have to consider by saying okay on this we disagree and on that

736
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,840
we need to have a critical debate.

737
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,840
You can adjust because one position, we don't like one position,

738
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,840
we remove the people from the landscape.

739
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,840
They are part of the landscape and they are heard in the Muslim majority countries.

740
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,840
So this is my position on that.

741
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Well I am certainly not going to criticise Islam for not having a Pope.

742
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:00,840
And in fact it would be your vis-à-vis in this discussion was horribly an error

743
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,840
in any case in that Christianity never had only one Pope and still doesn't.

744
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,840
I mean there were several Catholic claimants to the papacy at different times

745
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,840
just among Roman Catholics but today I mentioned one of them,

746
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,840
the Pope of the Coptic Christians based in Cairo.

747
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,840
The Eastern Orthodox don't call their leader the Pope, they call him the Patriarch

748
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,840
but the Christian world is full of Pope types.

749
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,840
Usually anathematising one another.

750
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,840
The Pope is just the word that innocent Americans use for the man who claims

751
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,840
to be the leader of the Roman Catholic.

752
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,840
So I don't think it's possible in fact to have a moral authority within religion

753
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,840
because I think the two things are so sharply divorced

754
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,840
but this doesn't lead to just chaos

755
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,840
and it certainly doesn't lead to the dictatorship of minorities or extremists.

756
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,840
I'll give you two examples quickly.

757
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,840
In the case of the moral blackmail of Denmark that was backed up

758
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:05,840
by a physical threat to destroy its economy and burn out its embassies across the world.

759
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:11,840
A well coordinated attack of sabotage against the small European democracy.

760
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,840
The organising group was I think the OIC, the organisation of the Islamic Congress.

761
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,840
Groups all the Muslim countries in the world have increasingly powerful lobby at the United Nations.

762
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,840
Hopes to pass an international resolution forbidding all criticism of religion

763
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,840
all forms of blasphemy and profanity.

764
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,840
Every ambassador of those countries in Copenhagen

765
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,840
went to Mr. Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark,

766
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,840
and told him under the threat of violence he should change his law

767
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:46,840
so as to allow him to determine what went into the Danish newspapers.

768
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,840
And when he said he couldn't do that things got a lot worse.

769
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,840
Now that's the ambassador of Egypt and the ambassador of Turkey

770
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,840
and the ambassador of important countries in the case of Egypt

771
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,840
containing an enormous Christian population

772
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,840
coming to you as if they spoke for a religion.

773
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
Either this claim is true or it is not.

774
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,840
It's self-evidently not true, but it is certainly made.

775
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Don't let's be in any doubt about it.

776
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,840
And don't let's have any doubt that it means to extend its influence

777
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,840
over the people who are sitting in this hall.

778
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Second, very quick, the fat war against Salman Rushdie.

779
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,840
In other words, the offer of money to suborn murder

780
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,840
the crime of writing a work of fiction in his own name

781
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,840
by the spiritual leader of Shia Islam.

782
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,840
That's what the fat war meant then, means now.

783
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,840
Wars after the murder of many people associated or not with the publication of the book

784
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,840
repudiated ostensibly by the Iranian government after long pressure

785
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,840
in lobbying at the United Nations about ten years ago.

786
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,840
I think that was.

787
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,840
But I've been since then, I've had the pleasure of going to Friday prayers

788
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,840
around university twice to hear the sermon.

789
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,840
And on both occasions there were banners and slogans saying that the imams

790
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,840
holy sentence against Salman Rushdie will never die.

791
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,840
It hasn't died with the Imam for many's death warrant will always be carried out.

792
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Not, I think, a very good use of the premises of the university.

793
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:20,840
I can't speak for whether it's a good occasion for Friday prayers or not.

794
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Well, it brings me to a second point.

795
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,840
You see, there's something shady involved here.

796
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:31,840
Some people say that Islam and Islamists give themselves permission to lie to non-believers.

797
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:38,840
It sounds like the sort of vulgar, paranoid thing that an Islamophobe would go around saying, doesn't it,

798
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:45,840
but very easy to disprove, except that it hasn't been, as that example we'll just illustrate.

799
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,840
And these are not minor threats.

800
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,840
These are threats to the very core of what we believe is the essential thing for society,

801
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:00,840
which is the ability to ask questions, to read the books we choose, to pursue unfettered investigations.

802
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:06,840
And these are flatly negated by the claims of a religion that says it is the answer to everything.

803
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
Can I respond to this?

804
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Because really, I think that's...

805
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,840
Is this the Takia question?

806
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,840
No, no, no, the Takia question is...

807
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,840
No, the point is, on the cartoon issue, the way you are translating things is problematic.

808
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Let me just come to some of the facts here very quickly.

809
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,840
The first thing is that it happened in October that the cartoon were published.

810
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Between October till January, nothing happened.

811
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:40,840
And I met the Muslim organizations in Denmark and I told them, and many of the opinions don't react.

812
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:48,840
The ambassadors of Muslim majority countries and Arab countries mainly asked the Prime Minister to meet with them.

813
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,840
He refused.

814
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:56,840
And my position that he made a mistake here, because he should have met them, telling them,

815
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,840
I have no say in this, it has to do with freedom of media, this is not of my business.

816
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,840
He didn't do this.

817
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,840
They took it as humiliation.

818
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,840
They went back, they bought the tickets.

819
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
No, no, but look.

820
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
Easily.

821
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,840
No, no, no, no, let me finish, because we will come to the point here.

822
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:21,840
They went back and they bought the ticket of a group of Muslims, among the Muslim leaders in Denmark,

823
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,840
to go to Muslim majority countries to just present what was done.

824
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:35,840
Tell me, Egypt is ruled by Islam.

825
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,840
Is it Islam which is used there?

826
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,840
Mubarak is a secular president, isn't it?

827
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,840
Syria is a Muslim leader or is a secular state?

828
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:55,840
All the main societies where the government used this, because you know what happened,

829
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:01,840
is it's easier to use the people to tell them against the West you can demonstrate,

830
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,840
but not against the government, which is an autocratic government.

831
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
So it's not religion.

832
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:14,840
It's political instrumentalization of popular emotions against the West just to make it a religious issue.

833
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:21,840
You cannot just avoid talking about political instrumentalization of countries where there is no democracy,

834
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,840
and these countries are not Islamist countries.

835
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,840
They are secular, autocratic countries.

836
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,840
On your third point, I can't possibly disagree with you.

837
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,840
The West is a great deal of opportunism and demagogy, and I'm certain hypocrisy as well.

838
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:43,840
And in fact, I will say that I've heard you and seen you saying that before, and I agree.

839
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:50,840
I don't think I would classify a country that hauls the Christian leader of its minority onto the TV

840
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,840
to say, no, it's not possible that it could have been any...

841
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,840
Exactly the same, political instrumentalization.

842
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
No, to give you a trivial example.

843
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
No, I would not.

844
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,840
Nor would I describe the Alawite regime.

845
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,840
It's an Alawite sectarian regime, not a secular one, that is funded by Tehran

846
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,840
and is the funder of the murder gang Hezbollah as secular either.

847
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,840
No, don't insult me.

848
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Not that it really hurts me that much.

849
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
I don't feel humiliated or anything.

850
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,840
All right, we're going to take some questions.

851
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,840
Whereas apparently the leader of a proud country like Egypt, when a demand to interfere in the internal affairs of Denmark

852
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
is not met, feels...

853
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,840
I'm sorry.

854
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:37,840
Just to end this discussion for me on my side is the only fact that you acknowledge that there is a political instrumentalization of religion

855
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,840
and you say I'm right, that's enough for me.

856
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
This is exactly what I meant.

857
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,840
I think I actually think that...

858
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,840
Earlier you were trying to tell me what Karl Marx said on the subject.

859
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,840
That's your job.

860
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Is that a valuable exchange?

861
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,840
I think that was worth hearing.

862
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:03,840
But I know that there are people in the room and also listening in from the satellite sites who want to have some of their questions asked.

863
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:16,840
And a few of them are along these lines and they actually are aimed at you Mr. Hitchens because of your ringing endorsement really of a secular society and atheism.

864
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
A question from Vale Colorado.

865
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:25,840
Do Jewish Christian or other religions have a greater claim on being religions of peace than Islam?

866
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,840
Is your beef really with Islam or is it with all religion?

867
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Well, I'm sorry that the comrade from Yale tuned in so late.

868
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,840
I mean, late enough to miss the first four or five minutes of my 10 minute introduction.

869
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Devoted to a close exegesis of Professor McCulloch's realization that Christianity had out genocided and out warred and out crusaded itself.

870
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,840
Finally by 1914.

871
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:57,840
If you care to pick up, I think you might be able to and I'll sign it if you will.

872
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
Pick it up.

873
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:07,840
My book, God is Not Great, you will find a discussion of the warrants for slavery, murder, genocide and land theft that occur in the books of murder.

874
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:17,840
That are an ineffasible offense to any civilized person and the reason why so many Jews are secular.

875
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
At least one of the reasons.

876
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:24,840
So again, I could go on but I really feel I don't need to.

877
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,840
A corollary question.

878
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,840
Maybe it's just something funny.

879
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,840
Would atheism be a non-religion of peace?

880
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,840
No.

881
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:41,840
No, there's something probably very slightly intolerant about atheism, at least so I hope.

882
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,840
I should, I might just say though, because I really think Professor Namadam misunderstood me.

883
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:52,840
When I say the American Constitution is godless, I mean, I was quoting the title of a famous study of it by Professor Israel Kramnik.

884
01:09:52,840 --> 01:10:02,840
What I mean by that is to say, the US Constitution only mentions religion and God in its preambles when it means to say the ways in which they must be kept out of the public square.

885
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,840
That happens to reflect about our Constitution and the reason why we still have it.

886
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,840
Otherwise the Republic would have been destroyed long before.

887
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,840
And that its first amendment says that religion can be no business of the government.

888
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,840
A statement no Muslim society could begin to make.

889
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,840
Thank you.

890
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:36,840
But once again, once again, you can just refer to the Constitution and you will have Muslims just referring to texts and avoiding the practical consequences and sometimes the policies that are promoted in one country.

891
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:55,840
And remember that the previous president, George W. Bush, was talking when going not for the same reasons as you, or not from the same source because you were supporting the war in Iraq, but he was doing it in the name of God.

892
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:05,840
So the Constitution here is not preventing someone from within to speak in the name of God, even if he's voting exactly the same thing that in the name of the peace that you are promoting.

893
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
You have for the war in Iraq.

894
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,840
I can't imagine you're going to defend President Bush.

895
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:25,840
Well, from that charge I can. No one was ever summoned to vote for the war in Iraq in the name of God and the president's own church as well as every other Christian church that I know of was opposed to the war.

896
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,840
For whatever little difference that might make, none to me.

897
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:43,840
This, I think this one is for Professor Ramadan. Why are there no progressive Muslim majority countries with rights for women and homosexuals, etc.

898
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,840
Go ahead.

899
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:58,840
No, I think that once again, if you look at the Muslim majority countries, we cannot just have something which is a monolithic vision of what is happening.

900
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:11,840
What is happening now in Muslim majority countries is really before just looking at some dimensions of the rights of women within or the rights of homosexuals, for example,

901
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,840
is really to look at the situation in the whole society and the way it's progressing.

902
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,840
Now we have the great majority of the Arab countries. They are under dictatorships. There is no freedom.

903
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,840
Religious or secular society, this is the same for all.

904
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:32,840
So if you look at this and you are expecting from within an evolution in this society, forget about it.

905
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Look now at what is happening in Turkey.

906
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,840
Turkey is changing, moving towards something which is a more democratic system.

907
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,840
And you see within that are rights and discussion and critical discussion that are possible.

908
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,840
So I would say that you cannot essentialize history and say the Muslims cannot do this.

909
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,840
It's evolving and it's changing and it depends where you can have this kind of discussion.

910
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:05,840
And the first, because they are priorities, the first is really to go towards democratization and transparency in the Muslim majority countries.

911
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:15,840
And if you go to Indonesia, even though we are far from a perfect system, you have much more discussion in Indonesia today about the principles,

912
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,840
the critical reading of the text than you have in Arab countries.

913
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,840
So I would say it's evolving. There is no state to school.

914
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:33,840
And now what is also interesting is look at what the Western Muslims living in the democratic system,

915
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:40,840
when they can express themselves, when they are enjoying freedom and they are not under the political pressure,

916
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,840
what they are producing as the Islamic contemporary thought.

917
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,840
We are talking about citizenship. We are promoting women's rights.

918
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,840
We are promoting the rights of the people to live and to be respected without discrimination.

919
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,840
So look at the different historical setting and you can see that it's moving and it's changing.

920
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,840
And there are new answers for new challenges coming from Muslims.

921
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,840
Are you saying Turkey is moving in a progressive direction as it becomes more Islamist?

922
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,840
Is that what you're saying?

923
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,840
That's quite interesting the way you translate what I said.

924
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,840
It says much more about what you think. That's what I said.

925
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,840
But let me finish.

926
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
You said it was moving in a more progressive direction.

927
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:32,840
No. What I said is that even the people who are now leading the country that are referring to Islam and they were perceived as Islamists,

928
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:38,840
now we don't know how to call them. Are they Islamists or are they moderate Muslims or are they ex-Islamists?

929
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,840
The point is that no one here can deny the fact that not only the government,

930
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,840
because we can be and we should be critical towards the government,

931
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:52,840
but the people around and the intellectuals in Turkey and within even the party,

932
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:59,840
you have new thoughts and they are coming with something that we didn't see even in the Muslim majority countries, in the Arab countries.

933
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,840
So speaking about the rule of flow and democracy and transparency,

934
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:11,840
separating and promoting what they are trying to promote and to be in tune today with the European principles.

935
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,840
And I would say this is the only thing for me which is important.

936
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:22,840
If, for example, Turkey is abiding by the European rules, they should be able to integrate the European Union.

937
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,840
And not what we have now, because it's a Muslim majority country.

938
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,840
We don't care about what they are trying to do.

939
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,840
So don't reduce Turkey to labels.

940
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,840
There are dynamics, there are people who are promoting things that are quite interesting.

941
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,840
I went there many times and I can tell you the women in Turkey, the Turkish women,

942
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,840
for all the trends, not only, you know, from the secular for the Islamists everywhere,

943
01:15:49,840 --> 01:16:00,840
they are promoting a better understanding of Islam, a better acknowledging and resisting discriminations and trying to work for more autonomy.

944
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:05,840
And I would say this is what I said and this is what I promote.

945
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:15,840
Well, actually I agree with you that there was a very ossified, out-of-Turkish bureaucratic intolerance system

946
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,840
that to some extent has been opened by the challenge from Mr. Erdogan's party.

947
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:29,840
But the reason why Turkey continues to be looked on as scans by so much of Europe is not because it's a Muslim majority country.

948
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,840
It was a Muslim majority country long before the European Union was formed.

949
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,840
And no one's just discovered that, the faith of most of its people as Muslim.

950
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,840
It's because of legal and political reasons.

951
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,840
One of them is continually legal occupation of the Republic of Cyprus, which is already a member of the European Union,

952
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,840
and the expulsion of a large proportion of its population, the reduction of them to refugee status.

953
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,840
Erdogan's been worse on that than his predecessors.

954
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:01,840
The second is the refusal of Turks to admit that they're not the only people living in Anatolia,

955
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:09,840
that there's another nation called the Kurds that lives there, which has language and national rights, which have been negated.

956
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,840
On that, actually the Erdogan party's been slightly better than some of the other Turks.

957
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:23,840
And the third is the continuing campaign of falsification and lying about the genocide of the Armenian population.

958
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
A continuing disgrace, which Erdogan...

959
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,840
Which Erdogan has spoken of in the most thuggish possible term.

960
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,840
A question from Pittsburgh here.

961
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:45,840
Is there an acceptable literature of interpretation of the Koran, similar to the Jewish oral Torah?

962
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,840
Does that make sense?

963
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Yes, of course.

964
01:17:51,840 --> 01:18:00,840
If you come back to the classical Islamic tradition, in what we call firqh, law and jurisprudence, and ethics,

965
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,840
and we have a huge classical tradition.

966
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:10,840
The problem very often is that the Muslims themselves, they neglect and ignore their own tradition,

967
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,840
but also the people who are coming to Islam, they are just driven by headlines,

968
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:27,840
and they are simplifying the reality of, you know, you can get a PhD in the States or anywhere in the West

969
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,840
without having one notion of what is called Islamic philosophy.

970
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:41,840
While the Islamic philosophers, the philosophers referring to Islam as much as Maimonides and so many,

971
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,840
we only know Averaes, because he is very close to us.

972
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:52,840
But the fact that we refer only to him is just showing us how much we ignore about the others.

973
01:18:52,840 --> 01:19:00,840
Do you know that Descartes, who came with the rationality and doubt, read, himself read,

974
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:09,840
the thesis of Abou-Hamed El-Razali, who was talking about doubt and doubt as a sense of getting certitude and knowledge,

975
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,840
neglected, not known, and I think that the Islamic tradition is full of that.

976
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,840
We have to reconcile ourselves with our past in order to come with a diversity of new visions for the future,

977
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
and I think that this is missing for all of us.

978
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:33,840
I would say that this neglectfulness towards history and tradition is a problem within the Muslim universe of reference

979
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,840
as much as it is for Christianity and Judaism and all the other great philosophies and religions.

980
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,840
We have a few questions here. I don't think we can avoid this tonight about Sharia.

981
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:57,840
It's become an assumption among many Americans now that what Muslims are really after is the imposition of Sharia

982
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,840
in every society in which they live, even Muslim minority countries.

983
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:10,840
It's not a lot understood about Sharia, but what is known is that crimes such as adultery, blasphemy,

984
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,840
apostasy, and homosexuality are punishable by the death penalty.

985
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:22,840
To Westernize, it seems like a whole legal system that's a violation of human rights.

986
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,840
What is the intention with Sharia, especially for Muslims living in the West?

987
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,840
Is the idea that eventually we get there and we all live under Sharia law?

988
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:38,840
This is a legitimate question and it's an important question because many Muslims living not only in the West,

989
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,840
by the way, throughout the world, you have Muslims, they deny this, they say no, no, they don't understand Sharia,

990
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,840
or they reduce Sharia to the penal code and sometimes it happens.

991
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,840
But Sharia is not the penal code and still with this, that it's not only the penal code,

992
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:59,840
we really have a problem with the understanding of Sharia by Muslims and the way it has to be understood in our time.

993
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,840
Again, many interpretations here. You have some Muslims and you cannot deny this.

994
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:11,840
The perception of Sharia, it starts with the punishment and then it goes towards social justice

995
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:18,840
because you punish, you go to, and this is for me, once again, problematic and I'm critical of this,

996
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,840
but I cannot deny the fact that you have a tiny minority of Muslim scholars, they think like that,

997
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,840
in Nigeria, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, everywhere.

998
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:35,840
You have another understanding of Sharia, which is we start with social justice and then the punishment is part of the whole process.

999
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,840
In my position, I wrote many times on that, for example, in Western Muslims and the future of Islam,

1000
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:46,840
the understanding of Sharia is the way towards faithfulness, in which we are faithful to some of our principles.

1001
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,840
So it's not a closed system.

1002
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:56,840
Muhammad Abdul in the 19th century, when he was studying, he was under the British colonization

1003
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,840
and he was, we don't want this colonization, we want them out of our country,

1004
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,840
but the parliamentarian system is the best for us as Muslims, it doesn't contradict our system

1005
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,840
and he was of the opinion that the democratic system is not opposed to Islam.

1006
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,840
So you have trends saying this.

1007
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:20,840
My position on this is that Sharia is the way towards faithfulness, it's the way towards justice,

1008
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,840
it's the way towards mutual respect and living together.

1009
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:30,840
So this is why, for example, when I read the American constitution or any European constitution today,

1010
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:37,840
and it is said all the citizens, men and women, black or white, should be treated equally by law,

1011
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,840
this is my Sharia, not going to change this.

1012
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:46,840
So the point for me is when the principles are respected and the principles of justice

1013
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,840
is something which are not too system that are opposed, they are principles that are common,

1014
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,840
that we can live together.

1015
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,840
So this is where, from an Islamic viewpoint, from within the Muslim communities in the West,

1016
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,840
you will see that the mainstream position coming from all the Muslim organizations in the West

1017
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:11,840
is we abide by the law of the country, we are loyal to our country,

1018
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,840
and we act as active and responsible citizens within the country.

1019
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:23,840
And the only thing that we can say today is look at the facts and the figures and not only the perceptions

1020
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,840
because I was shocked at what I got as an image.

1021
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,840
I didn't think that this could happen in the States.

1022
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,840
And in the States, what we had was the community center in New York by people saying

1023
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,840
Islamization of America, I saw this in Europe, I thought it was impossible to have it here.

1024
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:48,840
And then it came here, meaning that the people are scared, there is a great deal of mistrust,

1025
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,840
these people are silently colonizing us.

1026
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,840
So this is where the Muslims, and this is why your question is important, should come and say,

1027
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,840
look, we are American citizens, we abide by the law, we respect the Constitution,

1028
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:08,840
we want to be treated equally, mutual respect and equal rights, no discrimination for any religion

1029
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,840
or no religion at all, this is the way it should be.

1030
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:18,840
And if you look at facts and figures, millions of Western Muslims today are just abiding by the law

1031
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:23,840
and they got the three L's that I'm talking about in the book, is the first, they abide by the law,

1032
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,840
the second, they speak the language of the country, English as you speak English,

1033
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
or German or British, they speak the language and they are loyal to the country,

1034
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
they want the best for their country.

1035
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:41,840
This is what it means to be a Western Muslim or Muslim European or Muslim American.

1036
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,840
And I think that the Muslims should also speak out about what they want,

1037
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,840
but they also need to be heard when they say things like this.

1038
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:56,840
Because I have been repeating this for 25 years, and after 25 years what I get is,

1039
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,840
huh, smart guy, he has a double talk, he says this but he means something else.

1040
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:07,840
So if someone is telling you always when you say something that you have something else in mind,

1041
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,840
there is no discussion.

1042
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,840
This is once again the end of the discussion because the point is that there is no trust,

1043
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,840
there is no potential discussion and critical discussion.

1044
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,840
And by doing this, let me tell you something which is also important, it's very counterproductive.

1045
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,840
Because at the end there is no dialogue, it's not possible to talk because if you talk and say,

1046
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:32,840
oh, you are, if you talk in a good way, it means that you have bad intentions.

1047
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,840
And if you speak in a bad way, oh, now we know your intentions.

1048
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,840
So what do you do?

1049
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,840
What are you going to do?

1050
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:44,840
Could we accept that as a closing statement from you and let Mr. Hitchman make it?

1051
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,840
Oh, good.

1052
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,840
Because we've gone over?

1053
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,840
That's fine.

1054
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,840
I think that's a fine closing statement.

1055
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,840
Thank you.

1056
01:25:50,840 --> 01:26:03,840
Do I get the same question?

1057
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,840
I don't mind.

1058
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,840
Would you like to close with that?

1059
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,840
On Sharia.

1060
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
It really is.

1061
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,840
Okay, I like surprises.

1062
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,840
Well, Sharia just means law.

1063
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,840
I mean, all people say Sharia law making an elementary mistake.

1064
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:29,840
And of course it's not the case that every thief has their hand locked off in Muslim society

1065
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,840
or every adulterer gets stoned.

1066
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:40,840
And I'm perfectly sure that's not just because it would diminish the labor force so radically.

1067
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,840
Or so to speak, disable it.

1068
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,840
I think it's more because of something I've claimed to notice elsewhere, which is the religion is man made.

1069
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:58,840
And so there are enormous discrepancies in how these things are promulgated and also how they are enforced.

1070
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:08,840
And the most countries and societies come quite early and easily to the conclusion that their own religions are in one form or another

1071
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,840
are not really practicable.

1072
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:19,840
I mean, after all, in Saudi Arabia, women can't even drive a car.

1073
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:27,840
Whereas in Iran, she can vote, not for much, but she can, as much as a man can, let's say.

1074
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:33,840
Her vote can be stolen and degraded as much as her husband's or her brother's.

1075
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
There's an infinite variation.

1076
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:41,840
I don't know, I can't shake what I heard saw once on the BBC.

1077
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,840
From someone whose career in London I follow, I don't know if you know him, you wouldn't like him.

1078
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:57,840
Anjum Chaudhary, a very well-known noisemaker around London complaining about secularism, Judaism, all this kind of thing.

1079
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,840
And he's been in trouble with the law a few times.

1080
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:13,840
And was interviewed on BBC, went on about how nothing would change until the green flag of Islam was flying over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace and so forth.

1081
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:20,840
And was asked, I felt quite mildly by the BBC interviewer, said, well, if this is the way you feel about Sharia and about the total Islamic rule,

1082
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,840
wouldn't you feel happier moving to a country where they already had it?

1083
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:31,840
And which is, I mean, a polite question, but a rather cheap one, I mean, but still.

1084
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
What didn't prepare me for the answer?

1085
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,840
Chaudhary looked straight at the guy and straight into the camera and said, what makes you think this is your country?

1086
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,840
I thought it was a very good question.

1087
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:48,840
Now, why do you feel, I think I know, partly why I feel, why do you feel it's necessary to affirm that?

1088
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:56,840
And of course, a Muslim should learn the language, should obey the laws, should observe the customs and so forth.

1089
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,840
I mean, most immigrants don't feel they absolutely have to say that.

1090
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:11,840
The answer I suspect is that it's embarrassing to notice that in places like as far apart as Sweden and as Spain,

1091
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,840
there are groups of people who say their countries should be part of the caliphate and that that's why they've come here.

1092
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,840
And if it wasn't for those people, you wouldn't be in this position.

1093
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:31,840
So it seems to me that in order to be consistent, you should fear them and dislike them,

1094
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:38,840
find them morally and intellectually repulsive, at least as much as if not more than I do.

1095
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:45,840
And I don't say that you don't, but I do think that that is the urgent priority.

1096
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:54,840
On the lady's question about where would be the best country to live if you were a Muslim

1097
01:29:54,840 --> 01:30:03,840
and wanting to be a member of a sexual or gender minority, I think she said a female or a homosexual.

1098
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:09,840
So hard to confuse.

1099
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:15,840
Actually, the easiest place for you to live in that case would probably be,

1100
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,840
I was thinking about it, well, Professor, this will be my closing statement,

1101
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,840
would almost certainly be either Bosnia-Herzegovina or Kosovo.

1102
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:34,840
Culturally Muslim, democratic, open societies in southern and Balkan Europe

1103
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:38,840
were saved from obliteration by the power of the United States,

1104
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,840
which has never had a word of thanks for what it did.

1105
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:58,840
And which remains a secular country with a godless constitution.

1106
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,840
That's a note on which we can end.

1107
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,840
Which is the last best hope of humanity. Thank you.

1108
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:15,840
Thank you both. I hope it's been an enlightening evening.
