00:00.000 --> 00:16.020
Welcome back to The 8-Bit Guy, so we start off this episode with a road trip.

00:16.020 --> 00:20.200
I got a call from a guy in Oklahoma City that runs an electronics recycling shop there

00:20.200 --> 00:24.240
and he picked up some things that should be quite interesting and worth the trip.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.720
The drive from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City is 221 miles or a little over 3 hours each

00:28.720 --> 00:29.720
direction.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.320
Usually, I like to point out some interesting sights along the way on road trips, but in

00:33.320 --> 00:36.560
this case, there isn't a huge amount to see in this area.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.200
There is a giant wind farm along the way that you can see for miles away.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.840
Another interesting thing is the multiple casinos along the way, including the Windstar

00:44.840 --> 00:49.320
World Casino and Resort, which is the largest casino in the world.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.800
Believe it or not, gambling is actually illegal in Oklahoma, but these casinos are located

00:53.800 --> 00:58.520
on Native American reservations, which have their own legal autonomy.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.280
For the future Rama fans out there, if you have seen the episode where they all go to

01:01.280 --> 01:09.480
Mars Vegas, that episode is very much a parody of this.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.960
So hopefully this helps to explain that, especially to my European viewers.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.880
After about 3 hours, I finally make it to Oklahoma City, but my final destination is

01:17.880 --> 01:20.840
actually on the other side of town.

01:20.840 --> 01:29.680
And here we are at Oklahoma Electronics Recycling.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.880
Jeremiah starts by opening the back of his truck and showing me some of the recent pickups

01:32.880 --> 01:46.040
he's made.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.200
There were certainly some interesting things in here.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.920
For example, I think that is a keyboard for an Apple II of some kind.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.920
And then there was this mystery keyboard, I just have no idea what that would have been

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
used in.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.640
And there was also a slim cam camcorder, doesn't seem very slim by today's standards.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.120
I also found this wise keyboard, I thought it was for a terminal, but I didn't see the

02:06.120 --> 02:07.800
terminal anywhere.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.720
Of course, I wasn't there to see any of this.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.360
The best stuff was already inside, but first he had to show me his doorbell.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.760
So we needed a doorbell, we had parts, we didn't have a doorbell at the time.

02:20.760 --> 02:29.520
So it's a septic tank alarm for the overflows, a relay, and a mask.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
Both buttons.

02:30.520 --> 02:38.200
They're just wired common together.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.240
Inside the building was, of course, as to be expected, most of this was certainly scrap,

02:42.240 --> 02:44.360
but there were a few gems here and there.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.960
Well, look, we found the wise that goes with that wise keyboard we saw on the back of the

02:49.960 --> 02:50.960
truck.

02:50.960 --> 02:55.560
That's a wise PC, I've never seen one of these.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.280
Oh, wow, those are some big old heavy hard drives.

02:59.280 --> 03:05.120
It's got an old MFM Seagate 225 in it.

03:05.120 --> 03:12.200
It's actually hard for me to believe that it's been long enough to find things like

03:12.200 --> 03:17.920
these old Macbooks and iBooks are now considered scrap.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
Was it too long ago?

03:18.920 --> 03:23.800
I was restoring these and refurbishing them and selling them, and I guess, you know, those

03:23.800 --> 03:26.240
like 10 years ago, I guess at this point.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.880
On this shelf, Jeremiah stores some of his more interesting recent finds.

03:29.880 --> 03:46.000
Of course, the best was yet to come.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.800
So from the description of this system, from the gal who was actually at the company at

03:51.800 --> 03:57.040
the time, they were looking at a system to be able to read audio cues as well as write

03:57.040 --> 03:59.320
them on reel-to-reel recorders.

03:59.320 --> 04:07.120
So they actually had one of the big old reel-to-reels through, I guess, an industry standard connection

04:07.120 --> 04:11.320
for recording studios, and it's actually a dongle that would plug into the back.

04:11.320 --> 04:17.200
Wow, so these are, yeah, you can tell this has been sitting for quite some time.

04:17.200 --> 04:23.120
Yeah, and they didn't have a lid open or closed, so it's picked up quite a bit of dust.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.320
And that was after hitting with the air compressor.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.320
Looks like you got quite a few of these.

04:33.320 --> 04:39.320
These guys were pretty much packed and ready to go, minus the actual interface kit.

04:39.320 --> 04:44.320
Looks like they just reused Commodore's end caps there.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.320
Synchronous technologies.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.320
I have not found an original box form.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.320
Well, there's even more of them.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.320
I think there's about 12 plus the first unit.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.320
Oh, look at that.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.320
A whole bunch of it, 20s.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.320
Yep, in various states of fare.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.320
In various states of yellowing, too.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.320
Look at that.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
Oh, yeah.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.320
I wonder if it's like...

05:07.320 --> 05:12.320
And you can tell which side was facing up, because you get the oxygen fade.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.320
Yeah.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
That one doesn't have the...

05:15.320 --> 05:16.320
Yeah, there's no labels.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.320
No labels on these.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.320
I think they painted the keys.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.320
Yeah, I was looking at that, and I was like, well, these can't be original Commodore keys

05:23.320 --> 05:27.320
because the color, but yeah, they could be technically painted, I guess.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.320
Yeah, you can see the paint on there.

05:30.320 --> 05:34.320
So they probably just set them all out in this braddle tandem.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.320
You got more Vic-20s.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.320
Vic-20 motherboards, box full of them here.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.320
I'm sure you've gotten plenty of familiarity with those.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.320
Yeah, I know a lot about Vic-20 motherboards.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
Look at this.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.320
That is a mostly hand.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.320
I don't know what the story is on that guy.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.320
I don't know if that has anything to do with the Vic-20.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.320
So I heard you had some other really rare Commodore equipment.

06:03.320 --> 06:06.320
But yes, I have some very rare, what became Commodore equipment.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.320
And this was found in the same pile with all the Vic-20s and stuff.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.320
Yes, it was from the same company.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.320
Wow.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.320
That's quite a find.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.320
So what we have here, of course, is a Kim-1 and possibly a very early model.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.320
For those that don't know, this is like the Apple-1 of Commodore systems.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.320
It predates the pet and it's certainly not the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a recycle shop.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.320
Anyway, we had a look at some of the other neat systems you'd found such as this Hazeltine system.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.320
And we found some old Mauser electronics bags, which was quite the throwback for me

06:36.320 --> 06:42.320
because these are the exact bags that we're using when I worked at Mauser in the mid-1990s.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
And of course, now it was time to load all this stuff up in my car.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.320
And honestly, I wasn't even sure if it was all going to fit.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.320
I definitely have to fold my back seats down.

06:49.320 --> 06:54.320
I was also constantly asking myself, where in the world was I going to put all of this when I got it home?

06:54.320 --> 06:59.320
Anyway, we did manage to fit it all in the car and I headed back on the long trip back to Texas.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.320
It was dusk at this point and while it might seem like it would be a pleasant trip home,

07:03.320 --> 07:06.320
I actually thought I'd have to commit myself to an insane asylum

07:06.320 --> 07:10.320
after listening to the squeaky styrofoam all the way home.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.320
You can imagine listening to this for three and a half hours.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.320
So now that I'm back home, let's have a look at one of these Vic-20s.

07:18.320 --> 07:24.320
When I pull the styrofoam off, you can see this huge contrast of color, which is most likely just dirt and dust.

07:24.320 --> 07:29.320
Looking a bit closer, I have a bad feeling there might also be some yellowing going on.

07:29.320 --> 07:33.320
But this was one of the units on top, so maybe the ones underneath wouldn't be as bad.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.320
Obviously, what I needed to do was try cleaning the thing off, so here it goes.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.320
As you can see, just a good five minute cleaning job made a dramatic difference.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.320
But unfortunately, there is some yellowing on the plastic in the center.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.320
So at this point, you may find yourself asking David, you know, what the heck is this thing?

07:50.320 --> 07:53.320
You know, what is the sponstrosity that somebody made?

07:53.320 --> 07:56.320
And I think there's something that I need to explain first.

07:56.320 --> 08:01.320
If you go back to the early 80s, like 1981 to like 1985, there was no Raspberry Pi.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.320
There was no Arduino, right?

08:03.320 --> 08:10.320
If you were building some kind of industrial control system or something that required a computer to interface with it,

08:10.320 --> 08:13.320
the cheapest thing you could get was going to be a Vic-20.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.320
I mean, technically you could get like a ZX81 or, you know, Timex Sinclair 1000 for cheaper,

08:17.320 --> 08:22.320
but the membrane keyboard on that made it very unsuitable for those types of applications.

08:22.320 --> 08:29.320
So the Vic-20 was often the choice of the day for what someone today might use an Arduino for.

08:29.320 --> 08:34.320
And so, you know, I did that episode a while back restoring that old oily, nasty Vic-20,

08:34.320 --> 08:40.320
and I had speculated in that video that that computer was probably used in some sort of industrial environment

08:40.320 --> 08:44.320
to control some sort of, I don't know, milling equipment or something like that.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
And that was actually really common.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.320
I mean, the Vic-20 was way cheaper than Apple II, and even after the Commodore 64 came out,

08:50.320 --> 08:55.320
it was still like half or even sometimes a quarter of the price of the Commodore 64.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.320
And if you didn't need like all the graphics and sprites and the SID chip and all that kind of stuff,

09:00.320 --> 09:05.320
if you were just using it to control something, the Vic-20 was a much more logical choice.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.320
And so that's exactly what we have here.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.320
This is actually not the first time I've seen one of these.

09:10.320 --> 09:15.320
I've actually seen them in photographs before because they've been brought up and discussed on Facebook a few times,

09:15.320 --> 09:19.320
and there's some magazine articles that you can look at, and I'll post some pictures of them here.

09:19.320 --> 09:26.320
And you can see that this was used as some sort of control interface for an audio editing system.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.320
That's the best I can make out.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.320
So in fact, I saw one person make a comparison and say that this was like the,

09:32.320 --> 09:38.320
if you're familiar with the video toaster for the Amiga and how that revolutionized video editing.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.320
Well, this was kind of the audio equivalent of that that came out a few years earlier,

09:42.320 --> 09:44.320
and they used, of course, the Vic-20 for it.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.320
Now, I'm actually really interested to power one of these things on

09:47.320 --> 09:51.320
because I don't know whether it's going to have any custom ROMs in it

09:51.320 --> 09:53.320
or whether that was all handled through the cartridge interface,

09:53.320 --> 09:56.320
which we can't seem to find any of that leftover.

09:56.320 --> 10:02.320
So for those wondering, by the way, Jeremiah actually picked these up from an abandoned building there in Oklahoma City

10:02.320 --> 10:07.320
that actually used to be the headquarters for where this product was actually manufactured.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.320
So that's why there were so many of them there.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.320
Okay, time to plug this thing in and see what happens.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.320
These didn't come with power supplies, so I'll just use my trusty new brick.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.320
These particular Vic-20s used the same power supply as the C64.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.320
The earlier models were different, but these are all the later models.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.320
And here we go. It appears to boot up just like a regular Vic-20.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.320
I guess there are no custom ROMs inside.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.320
Okay, well, let's try the keyboard.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.320
As I suspected, these keys do exactly what they always did.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.320
They simply removed a lot of keys, but the ones that remain are unchanged.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.320
Well, let's open it up and see if there's anything different inside.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.320
I don't think so.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.320
I'm surprised how clean it is inside. This looks like a brand new Vic-20.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.320
I mean, there's a hint of dust on the motherboard, but that's it.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.320
Also, as far as I can see, everything on this board is stock. There are no modifications.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.320
The keyboard, of course, is a different story.

10:56.320 --> 11:00.320
I can see they probably pulled this tape off at one point and didn't put it back on very well.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.320
Oh, and look at this. They completely cut the shift lock key out of the board.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.320
I don't even think they bothered to desolder it.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.320
Okay, well, I put it back together and I wanted to see if I could play some games on them.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.320
I tried Cheese & Onion first.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.320
Most of the good games for the Vic-20 came on cartridge,

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
and typically those didn't require much of any keyboard input,

11:18.320 --> 11:21.320
so I think this shouldn't be a problem.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
I'll just plug in the joystick here.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.320
And as expected, it actually works just fine.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.320
Ironically, I would show the game I'm working on right now for the Vic-20,

11:29.320 --> 11:33.320
but I can't because it requires me to type the load command on the keyboard,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
and there's just no way to do it.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.320
So I tried a few more games, such as Avenger.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.320
Now, this one actually requires that you press F1 to start the game,

11:40.320 --> 11:43.320
which is no problem since that's one of the keys that are still left on the keyboard.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
So, yeah, no problem there.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.320
Same thing with Donkey Kong.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.320
It actually uses three of the function keys, but again, no problem.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
Pole Position works fine.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.320
Tetris works fine.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.320
And I tried one more Pentechorat.

12:03.320 --> 12:07.320
So, yeah, I'd say that virtually all the cartridge games will still work fine on one of these,

12:07.320 --> 12:09.320
despite the missing keys.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.320
So, let's take a look at this stuff in my garage floor.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.320
As you can see, quite a few filthy Vic-20s, a box of scrap Vic-20s,

12:16.320 --> 12:20.320
and of course this stray Atari 2600 that somehow wound up in the box too.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.320
Looking over here, there's a box of cassettes.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.320
These are kind of interesting as they have this little locking mechanism to keep the tape from moving.

12:27.320 --> 12:32.320
This one says drum sys and seems to have what might be some memory addresses in Texas decimal.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.320
Ah, now this is something I've never seen one of these before, but I recognized it right away.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
Now, I'll explain that here shortly.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.320
Now, needless to say, this is an e-prom programmer that fits in the Commodore user port

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
and was most likely used to write the e-prom's for their cartridges.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.320
I also found this, which appears to be a user port peripheral too,

12:50.320 --> 12:53.320
but seems to have some audio and MIDI interfaces on board.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.320
And I was wrong, it looks like there are at least a few power supplies in here.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.320
I'm not sure I'd want to risk using them though.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.320
Digging a little deeper, I found an older style Vic-20 power supply.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.320
This is the two-prong style, and as it turned out,

13:05.320 --> 13:09.320
a few of these Vic-20s are indeed the older board type that have the two-prong power adapter.

13:09.320 --> 13:14.320
There were also a couple of RF modulators, both the old style, which is just a black box,

13:14.320 --> 13:16.320
and the new style, which is smaller and says Commodore on it.

13:16.320 --> 13:20.320
Fortunately, most people today would not need these since composite video is everywhere.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.320
And there were a few of these in here.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.320
This is apparently a metal top piece to some of their hardware,

13:26.320 --> 13:29.320
but that seems to be all I can find of it.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.320
Here we have an almost complete Vic-20 keyboard except for the shift lock key,

13:32.320 --> 13:35.320
which has already been removed.

13:35.320 --> 13:38.320
And in the bottom of the box are these strange boards.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
I'm not sure what these are.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.320
They are hand-wired, but have a lot of what appear to be MIDI and audio ports on them.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.320
Plus a few bare Vic-20 motherboards.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.320
Let's see if we can clean up this e-prong programmer.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.320
Yeah, it seems to clean up pretty easily.

13:52.320 --> 13:57.320
So I told you that I'd never seen one of these, but recognize it right away and you might ask why.

13:57.320 --> 14:02.320
Well, you see, when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I got this book with my Commodore 128.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.320
And I took this book to school and read through every page.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.320
What? You didn't know I was a big-time nerd?

14:08.320 --> 14:11.320
Anyway, so this book shows all the official Commodore products of the era,

14:11.320 --> 14:14.320
but also shows a number of third-party products.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.320
And right here on one of the first pages, you'll see this.

14:17.320 --> 14:22.320
And I used to read about this even though I didn't fully understand what it was supposed to actually do.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.320
But anyway, here it is. And I never thought I'd see one in person.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.320
So moving along, I wanted to find out if these bare Vic-20 boards work or not.

14:30.320 --> 14:34.320
All I need is video and power to get a pretty good idea.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
And here goes nothing.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.320
Well, I think we can safely assume that one doesn't work.

14:39.320 --> 14:43.320
So I thought I'd test the second board and I noticed an empty socket here where the CPU goes.

14:43.320 --> 14:47.320
So no problem. I have a spare working CPU, so I'll stick that in there.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.320
And this one's dead as a doornail.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.320
However, I feel kind of dumb now.

14:52.320 --> 14:57.320
After looking the board over for potential problems, I noticed that there's no friggin' RAM chips in the board.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.320
I would have noticed an empty socket, but I guess my brain wasn't looking for missing chips.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.320
And the other one was also missing RAM as well.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.320
Okay, well, I just happened to have some extra Vic-20 RAM chips laying around.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.320
And I also have a few sockets, so I thought, hey, what the heck?

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
It'll only take five minutes to see if these boards work.

15:13.320 --> 15:17.320
I was curious if these were scrap boards from defective units

15:17.320 --> 15:20.320
or if they were actually experimenting with them.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
For example, to add extra RAM or something like that.

15:22.320 --> 15:27.320
So depending on whether the board works once I add RAM chips, we'll help answer that question.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.320
And lucky there, it works.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.320
The screen's a bit dark, but this is a common issue I've seen working on Vic-20s.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
It just needs a little adjustment.

15:35.320 --> 15:39.320
If you remove the metal cover over the video chip, there's a little puttyometer in there you can adjust.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.320
And as you can see, you can go really dark or super bright.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.320
But I think this setting here is just about perfect.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.320
So the question is, why did they remove the RAM chips?

15:48.320 --> 15:51.320
Hmm, makes me wonder.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.320
Moving along, we need to talk about this Kim 1.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.320
This is a very rare and valuable piece of computing history.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.320
The trouble is, I know next to nothing about it other than historical facts.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
I have no idea how to use it or even test it.

16:04.320 --> 16:10.320
And looking at this old power supply that came with it, I wouldn't dare even consider plugging this thing into power.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.320
I mean, just look at that.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.320
I do think this slot here was added onto the board.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.320
This is not standard equipment.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.320
As you can see, it soldered to a whole bunch of places at the bottom of the board.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.320
I suspect this was used for a video card.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.320
Keep in mind, the Kim 1 was never meant to connect to a display.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.320
Unfortunately, no video card was found with the board.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.320
And so this raises a lot of questions about what the heck to do with this thing.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.320
The board itself is really dirty and grungy, and I can probably clean that up.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.320
But what to do with the rest of it?

16:41.320 --> 16:44.320
So there's several considerations to think about with this Kim 1.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.320
First of all, the question of, does it work?

16:46.320 --> 16:50.320
And then I have to counter that question with, does it matter?

16:50.320 --> 16:55.320
I mean, because nobody's going to sit around and play with a Kim 1.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.320
In the same regard, nobody's going to sit around and play with an Apple 1.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.320
Now, I mean, if you really wanted to play with a Kim 1 that badly,

17:01.320 --> 17:05.320
there are some replica boards, which would make far more sense than playing around with an original one.

17:05.320 --> 17:12.320
So, you know, for example, I don't know that I would want to desolder the CPU or some of these ceramic chips

17:12.320 --> 17:16.320
and replace them with modern ones just to fix it and make it work.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.320
I think it probably looks better just keeping it the way that it is.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.320
Obviously, I do want to clean it up, and I'm investigating what the best way would be to do that.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.320
But here's the other thing.

17:25.320 --> 17:30.320
What to do about this power supply and this ugly green rotted piece of wood that it's attached to?

17:30.320 --> 17:34.320
Those are not original. I mean, they didn't come with the board.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.320
That was something the user added.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.320
Same with this video socket or whatever this expansion socket is that they added here.

17:40.320 --> 17:44.320
So, should I get rid of those and mount this board in something else,

17:44.320 --> 17:47.320
like some kind of glass display case or something like that?

17:47.320 --> 17:51.320
I just don't know. These are things that I'll need to think about.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.320
I'll probably have to follow this up with another video at some point.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.320
So, anyway, I welcome any suggestions on what the best thing to do with this.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.320
Oh, and by the way, I don't actually even plan on keeping this.

18:01.320 --> 18:05.320
There's actually, it's not well known, but I think there's a new computer museum

18:05.320 --> 18:08.320
that's going to be opening up in Austin here maybe next year.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.320
And my plan is to donate this to them.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
That way, it'll be on display for people to see.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.320
So, what will happen to the VIC-20s?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
Well, I've picked out the three best ones,

18:17.320 --> 18:20.320
and I plan to donate one to the Home Computer Museum in the Netherlands,

18:20.320 --> 18:22.320
another one to Bo Zimmerman's collection,

18:22.320 --> 18:25.320
and the third one will go with the Kim-1 to Austin.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
So, that's the plan anyway.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.320
I'm donating the rest of them to my friend Chris Hasledge,

18:29.320 --> 18:32.320
who also came over and helped me clean and test the rest of them.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.320
He works for an organization called One Up on Cancer,

18:35.320 --> 18:38.320
which is a non-profit for helping cancer patients based here in Dallas

18:38.320 --> 18:40.320
and has a video game theme to everything they do.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.320
They're going to finish cleaning and testing these,

18:42.320 --> 18:44.320
and we'll be auctioning them off.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.320
So, if you're interested in getting one of these,

18:46.320 --> 18:49.320
I'll put a link in the description field explaining where to keep an eye out for these.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
Thank you.
