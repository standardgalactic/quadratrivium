00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
Welcome back to The 8-Bit Guy, so we start off this episode with a road trip.

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,200
I got a call from a guy in Oklahoma City that runs an electronics recycling shop there

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,240
and he picked up some things that should be quite interesting and worth the trip.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
The drive from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City is 221 miles or a little over 3 hours each

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
direction.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,320
Usually, I like to point out some interesting sights along the way on road trips, but in

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,560
this case, there isn't a huge amount to see in this area.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,200
There is a giant wind farm along the way that you can see for miles away.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,840
Another interesting thing is the multiple casinos along the way, including the Windstar

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,320
World Casino and Resort, which is the largest casino in the world.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,800
Believe it or not, gambling is actually illegal in Oklahoma, but these casinos are located

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,520
on Native American reservations, which have their own legal autonomy.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,280
For the future Rama fans out there, if you have seen the episode where they all go to

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,480
Mars Vegas, that episode is very much a parody of this.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,960
So hopefully this helps to explain that, especially to my European viewers.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,880
After about 3 hours, I finally make it to Oklahoma City, but my final destination is

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,840
actually on the other side of town.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,680
And here we are at Oklahoma Electronics Recycling.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,880
Jeremiah starts by opening the back of his truck and showing me some of the recent pickups

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:46,040
he's made.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,200
There were certainly some interesting things in here.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,920
For example, I think that is a keyboard for an Apple II of some kind.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
And then there was this mystery keyboard, I just have no idea what that would have been

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
used in.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,640
And there was also a slim cam camcorder, doesn't seem very slim by today's standards.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,120
I also found this wise keyboard, I thought it was for a terminal, but I didn't see the

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
terminal anywhere.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,720
Of course, I wasn't there to see any of this.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,360
The best stuff was already inside, but first he had to show me his doorbell.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,760
So we needed a doorbell, we had parts, we didn't have a doorbell at the time.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:29,520
So it's a septic tank alarm for the overflows, a relay, and a mask.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Both buttons.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,200
They're just wired common together.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,240
Inside the building was, of course, as to be expected, most of this was certainly scrap,

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,360
but there were a few gems here and there.

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,960
Well, look, we found the wise that goes with that wise keyboard we saw on the back of the

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
truck.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,560
That's a wise PC, I've never seen one of these.

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Oh, wow, those are some big old heavy hard drives.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
It's got an old MFM Seagate 225 in it.

41
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,200
It's actually hard for me to believe that it's been long enough to find things like

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,920
these old Macbooks and iBooks are now considered scrap.

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Was it too long ago?

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,800
I was restoring these and refurbishing them and selling them, and I guess, you know, those

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
like 10 years ago, I guess at this point.

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,880
On this shelf, Jeremiah stores some of his more interesting recent finds.

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:46,000
Of course, the best was yet to come.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,800
So from the description of this system, from the gal who was actually at the company at

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,040
the time, they were looking at a system to be able to read audio cues as well as write

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,320
them on reel-to-reel recorders.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,120
So they actually had one of the big old reel-to-reels through, I guess, an industry standard connection

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,320
for recording studios, and it's actually a dongle that would plug into the back.

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Wow, so these are, yeah, you can tell this has been sitting for quite some time.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah, and they didn't have a lid open or closed, so it's picked up quite a bit of dust.

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
And that was after hitting with the air compressor.

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Looks like you got quite a few of these.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,320
These guys were pretty much packed and ready to go, minus the actual interface kit.

58
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Looks like they just reused Commodore's end caps there.

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Synchronous technologies.

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I have not found an original box form.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Well, there's even more of them.

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I think there's about 12 plus the first unit.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Oh, look at that.

64
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
A whole bunch of it, 20s.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Yep, in various states of fare.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
In various states of yellowing, too.

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Look at that.

68
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Oh, yeah.

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I wonder if it's like...

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,320
And you can tell which side was facing up, because you get the oxygen fade.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Yeah.

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
That one doesn't have the...

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Yeah, there's no labels.

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
No labels on these.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I think they painted the keys.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah, I was looking at that, and I was like, well, these can't be original Commodore keys

77
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,320
because the color, but yeah, they could be technically painted, I guess.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah, you can see the paint on there.

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
So they probably just set them all out in this braddle tandem.

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
You got more Vic-20s.

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Vic-20 motherboards, box full of them here.

82
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I'm sure you've gotten plenty of familiarity with those.

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Yeah, I know a lot about Vic-20 motherboards.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Look at this.

85
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
That is a mostly hand.

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
I don't know what the story is on that guy.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't know if that has anything to do with the Vic-20.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,320
So I heard you had some other really rare Commodore equipment.

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,320
But yes, I have some very rare, what became Commodore equipment.

90
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,320
And this was found in the same pile with all the Vic-20s and stuff.

91
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Yes, it was from the same company.

92
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Wow.

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
That's quite a find.

94
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,320
So what we have here, of course, is a Kim-1 and possibly a very early model.

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,320
For those that don't know, this is like the Apple-1 of Commodore systems.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It predates the pet and it's certainly not the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a recycle shop.

97
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Anyway, we had a look at some of the other neat systems you'd found such as this Hazeltine system.

98
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,320
And we found some old Mauser electronics bags, which was quite the throwback for me

99
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,320
because these are the exact bags that we're using when I worked at Mauser in the mid-1990s.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
And of course, now it was time to load all this stuff up in my car.

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,320
And honestly, I wasn't even sure if it was all going to fit.

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I definitely have to fold my back seats down.

103
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I was also constantly asking myself, where in the world was I going to put all of this when I got it home?

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Anyway, we did manage to fit it all in the car and I headed back on the long trip back to Texas.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,320
It was dusk at this point and while it might seem like it would be a pleasant trip home,

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I actually thought I'd have to commit myself to an insane asylum

107
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,320
after listening to the squeaky styrofoam all the way home.

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
You can imagine listening to this for three and a half hours.

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
So now that I'm back home, let's have a look at one of these Vic-20s.

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,320
When I pull the styrofoam off, you can see this huge contrast of color, which is most likely just dirt and dust.

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Looking a bit closer, I have a bad feeling there might also be some yellowing going on.

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,320
But this was one of the units on top, so maybe the ones underneath wouldn't be as bad.

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Obviously, what I needed to do was try cleaning the thing off, so here it goes.

114
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,320
As you can see, just a good five minute cleaning job made a dramatic difference.

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,320
But unfortunately, there is some yellowing on the plastic in the center.

116
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
So at this point, you may find yourself asking David, you know, what the heck is this thing?

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
You know, what is the sponstrosity that somebody made?

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
And I think there's something that I need to explain first.

119
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,320
If you go back to the early 80s, like 1981 to like 1985, there was no Raspberry Pi.

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
There was no Arduino, right?

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:10,320
If you were building some kind of industrial control system or something that required a computer to interface with it,

122
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,320
the cheapest thing you could get was going to be a Vic-20.

123
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I mean, technically you could get like a ZX81 or, you know, Timex Sinclair 1000 for cheaper,

124
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,320
but the membrane keyboard on that made it very unsuitable for those types of applications.

125
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:29,320
So the Vic-20 was often the choice of the day for what someone today might use an Arduino for.

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,320
And so, you know, I did that episode a while back restoring that old oily, nasty Vic-20,

127
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,320
and I had speculated in that video that that computer was probably used in some sort of industrial environment

128
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,320
to control some sort of, I don't know, milling equipment or something like that.

129
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
And that was actually really common.

130
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I mean, the Vic-20 was way cheaper than Apple II, and even after the Commodore 64 came out,

131
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,320
it was still like half or even sometimes a quarter of the price of the Commodore 64.

132
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
And if you didn't need like all the graphics and sprites and the SID chip and all that kind of stuff,

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,320
if you were just using it to control something, the Vic-20 was a much more logical choice.

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
And so that's exactly what we have here.

135
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
This is actually not the first time I've seen one of these.

136
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
I've actually seen them in photographs before because they've been brought up and discussed on Facebook a few times,

137
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,320
and there's some magazine articles that you can look at, and I'll post some pictures of them here.

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,320
And you can see that this was used as some sort of control interface for an audio editing system.

139
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
That's the best I can make out.

140
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
So in fact, I saw one person make a comparison and say that this was like the,

141
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,320
if you're familiar with the video toaster for the Amiga and how that revolutionized video editing.

142
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Well, this was kind of the audio equivalent of that that came out a few years earlier,

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
and they used, of course, the Vic-20 for it.

144
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Now, I'm actually really interested to power one of these things on

145
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
because I don't know whether it's going to have any custom ROMs in it

146
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
or whether that was all handled through the cartridge interface,

147
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
which we can't seem to find any of that leftover.

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,320
So for those wondering, by the way, Jeremiah actually picked these up from an abandoned building there in Oklahoma City

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,320
that actually used to be the headquarters for where this product was actually manufactured.

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,320
So that's why there were so many of them there.

151
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Okay, time to plug this thing in and see what happens.

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
These didn't come with power supplies, so I'll just use my trusty new brick.

153
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,320
These particular Vic-20s used the same power supply as the C64.

154
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
The earlier models were different, but these are all the later models.

155
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
And here we go. It appears to boot up just like a regular Vic-20.

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
I guess there are no custom ROMs inside.

157
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Okay, well, let's try the keyboard.

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
As I suspected, these keys do exactly what they always did.

159
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,320
They simply removed a lot of keys, but the ones that remain are unchanged.

160
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Well, let's open it up and see if there's anything different inside.

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
I don't think so.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm surprised how clean it is inside. This looks like a brand new Vic-20.

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I mean, there's a hint of dust on the motherboard, but that's it.

164
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Also, as far as I can see, everything on this board is stock. There are no modifications.

165
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
The keyboard, of course, is a different story.

166
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I can see they probably pulled this tape off at one point and didn't put it back on very well.

167
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, and look at this. They completely cut the shift lock key out of the board.

168
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
I don't even think they bothered to desolder it.

169
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay, well, I put it back together and I wanted to see if I could play some games on them.

170
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I tried Cheese & Onion first.

171
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Most of the good games for the Vic-20 came on cartridge,

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
and typically those didn't require much of any keyboard input,

173
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
so I think this shouldn't be a problem.

174
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I'll just plug in the joystick here.

175
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,320
And as expected, it actually works just fine.

176
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Ironically, I would show the game I'm working on right now for the Vic-20,

177
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
but I can't because it requires me to type the load command on the keyboard,

178
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
and there's just no way to do it.

179
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
So I tried a few more games, such as Avenger.

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Now, this one actually requires that you press F1 to start the game,

181
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
which is no problem since that's one of the keys that are still left on the keyboard.

182
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
So, yeah, no problem there.

183
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Same thing with Donkey Kong.

184
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,320
It actually uses three of the function keys, but again, no problem.

185
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Pole Position works fine.

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Tetris works fine.

187
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
And I tried one more Pentechorat.

188
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,320
So, yeah, I'd say that virtually all the cartridge games will still work fine on one of these,

189
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
despite the missing keys.

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
So, let's take a look at this stuff in my garage floor.

191
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
As you can see, quite a few filthy Vic-20s, a box of scrap Vic-20s,

192
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
and of course this stray Atari 2600 that somehow wound up in the box too.

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Looking over here, there's a box of cassettes.

194
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,320
These are kind of interesting as they have this little locking mechanism to keep the tape from moving.

195
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,320
This one says drum sys and seems to have what might be some memory addresses in Texas decimal.

196
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Ah, now this is something I've never seen one of these before, but I recognized it right away.

197
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Now, I'll explain that here shortly.

198
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Now, needless to say, this is an e-prom programmer that fits in the Commodore user port

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
and was most likely used to write the e-prom's for their cartridges.

200
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I also found this, which appears to be a user port peripheral too,

201
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
but seems to have some audio and MIDI interfaces on board.

202
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,320
And I was wrong, it looks like there are at least a few power supplies in here.

203
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm not sure I'd want to risk using them though.

204
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Digging a little deeper, I found an older style Vic-20 power supply.

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
This is the two-prong style, and as it turned out,

206
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,320
a few of these Vic-20s are indeed the older board type that have the two-prong power adapter.

207
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,320
There were also a couple of RF modulators, both the old style, which is just a black box,

208
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
and the new style, which is smaller and says Commodore on it.

209
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Fortunately, most people today would not need these since composite video is everywhere.

210
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
And there were a few of these in here.

211
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,320
This is apparently a metal top piece to some of their hardware,

212
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,320
but that seems to be all I can find of it.

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Here we have an almost complete Vic-20 keyboard except for the shift lock key,

214
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
which has already been removed.

215
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
And in the bottom of the box are these strange boards.

216
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm not sure what these are.

217
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
They are hand-wired, but have a lot of what appear to be MIDI and audio ports on them.

218
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Plus a few bare Vic-20 motherboards.

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Let's see if we can clean up this e-prong programmer.

220
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah, it seems to clean up pretty easily.

221
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,320
So I told you that I'd never seen one of these, but recognize it right away and you might ask why.

222
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Well, you see, when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I got this book with my Commodore 128.

223
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
And I took this book to school and read through every page.

224
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
What? You didn't know I was a big-time nerd?

225
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Anyway, so this book shows all the official Commodore products of the era,

226
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,320
but also shows a number of third-party products.

227
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
And right here on one of the first pages, you'll see this.

228
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,320
And I used to read about this even though I didn't fully understand what it was supposed to actually do.

229
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
But anyway, here it is. And I never thought I'd see one in person.

230
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,320
So moving along, I wanted to find out if these bare Vic-20 boards work or not.

231
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
All I need is video and power to get a pretty good idea.

232
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
And here goes nothing.

233
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Well, I think we can safely assume that one doesn't work.

234
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,320
So I thought I'd test the second board and I noticed an empty socket here where the CPU goes.

235
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,320
So no problem. I have a spare working CPU, so I'll stick that in there.

236
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
And this one's dead as a doornail.

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
However, I feel kind of dumb now.

238
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,320
After looking the board over for potential problems, I noticed that there's no friggin' RAM chips in the board.

239
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I would have noticed an empty socket, but I guess my brain wasn't looking for missing chips.

240
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,320
And the other one was also missing RAM as well.

241
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Okay, well, I just happened to have some extra Vic-20 RAM chips laying around.

242
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
And I also have a few sockets, so I thought, hey, what the heck?

243
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
It'll only take five minutes to see if these boards work.

244
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,320
I was curious if these were scrap boards from defective units

245
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
or if they were actually experimenting with them.

246
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
For example, to add extra RAM or something like that.

247
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,320
So depending on whether the board works once I add RAM chips, we'll help answer that question.

248
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,320
And lucky there, it works.

249
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
The screen's a bit dark, but this is a common issue I've seen working on Vic-20s.

250
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
It just needs a little adjustment.

251
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,320
If you remove the metal cover over the video chip, there's a little puttyometer in there you can adjust.

252
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,320
And as you can see, you can go really dark or super bright.

253
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,320
But I think this setting here is just about perfect.

254
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,320
So the question is, why did they remove the RAM chips?

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Hmm, makes me wonder.

256
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Moving along, we need to talk about this Kim 1.

257
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
This is a very rare and valuable piece of computing history.

258
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
The trouble is, I know next to nothing about it other than historical facts.

259
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I have no idea how to use it or even test it.

260
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,320
And looking at this old power supply that came with it, I wouldn't dare even consider plugging this thing into power.

261
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I mean, just look at that.

262
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I do think this slot here was added onto the board.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
This is not standard equipment.

264
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
As you can see, it soldered to a whole bunch of places at the bottom of the board.

265
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I suspect this was used for a video card.

266
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Keep in mind, the Kim 1 was never meant to connect to a display.

267
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
Unfortunately, no video card was found with the board.

268
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
And so this raises a lot of questions about what the heck to do with this thing.

269
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
The board itself is really dirty and grungy, and I can probably clean that up.

270
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
But what to do with the rest of it?

271
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
So there's several considerations to think about with this Kim 1.

272
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
First of all, the question of, does it work?

273
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
And then I have to counter that question with, does it matter?

274
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I mean, because nobody's going to sit around and play with a Kim 1.

275
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,320
In the same regard, nobody's going to sit around and play with an Apple 1.

276
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Now, I mean, if you really wanted to play with a Kim 1 that badly,

277
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,320
there are some replica boards, which would make far more sense than playing around with an original one.

278
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:12,320
So, you know, for example, I don't know that I would want to desolder the CPU or some of these ceramic chips

279
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,320
and replace them with modern ones just to fix it and make it work.

280
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,320
I think it probably looks better just keeping it the way that it is.

281
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Obviously, I do want to clean it up, and I'm investigating what the best way would be to do that.

282
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
But here's the other thing.

283
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,320
What to do about this power supply and this ugly green rotted piece of wood that it's attached to?

284
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Those are not original. I mean, they didn't come with the board.

285
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
That was something the user added.

286
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Same with this video socket or whatever this expansion socket is that they added here.

287
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
So, should I get rid of those and mount this board in something else,

288
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,320
like some kind of glass display case or something like that?

289
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I just don't know. These are things that I'll need to think about.

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I'll probably have to follow this up with another video at some point.

291
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
So, anyway, I welcome any suggestions on what the best thing to do with this.

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh, and by the way, I don't actually even plan on keeping this.

293
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,320
There's actually, it's not well known, but I think there's a new computer museum

294
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,320
that's going to be opening up in Austin here maybe next year.

295
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,320
And my plan is to donate this to them.

296
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
That way, it'll be on display for people to see.

297
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
So, what will happen to the VIC-20s?

298
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Well, I've picked out the three best ones,

299
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,320
and I plan to donate one to the Home Computer Museum in the Netherlands,

300
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
another one to Bo Zimmerman's collection,

301
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
and the third one will go with the Kim-1 to Austin.

302
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
So, that's the plan anyway.

303
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm donating the rest of them to my friend Chris Hasledge,

304
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
who also came over and helped me clean and test the rest of them.

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,320
He works for an organization called One Up on Cancer,

306
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,320
which is a non-profit for helping cancer patients based here in Dallas

307
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
and has a video game theme to everything they do.

308
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
They're going to finish cleaning and testing these,

309
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
and we'll be auctioning them off.

310
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
So, if you're interested in getting one of these,

311
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
I'll put a link in the description field explaining where to keep an eye out for these.

312
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Thank you.
