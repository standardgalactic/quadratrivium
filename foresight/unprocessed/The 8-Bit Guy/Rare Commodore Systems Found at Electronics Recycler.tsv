0	16020	Welcome back to The 8-Bit Guy, so we start off this episode with a road trip.
16020	20200	I got a call from a guy in Oklahoma City that runs an electronics recycling shop there
20200	24240	and he picked up some things that should be quite interesting and worth the trip.
24240	28720	The drive from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City is 221 miles or a little over 3 hours each
28720	29720	direction.
29720	33320	Usually, I like to point out some interesting sights along the way on road trips, but in
33320	36560	this case, there isn't a huge amount to see in this area.
36560	41200	There is a giant wind farm along the way that you can see for miles away.
41200	44840	Another interesting thing is the multiple casinos along the way, including the Windstar
44840	49320	World Casino and Resort, which is the largest casino in the world.
49320	53800	Believe it or not, gambling is actually illegal in Oklahoma, but these casinos are located
53800	58520	on Native American reservations, which have their own legal autonomy.
58520	61280	For the future Rama fans out there, if you have seen the episode where they all go to
61280	69480	Mars Vegas, that episode is very much a parody of this.
69480	73960	So hopefully this helps to explain that, especially to my European viewers.
73960	77880	After about 3 hours, I finally make it to Oklahoma City, but my final destination is
77880	80840	actually on the other side of town.
80840	89680	And here we are at Oklahoma Electronics Recycling.
89680	92880	Jeremiah starts by opening the back of his truck and showing me some of the recent pickups
92880	106040	he's made.
106040	108200	There were certainly some interesting things in here.
108200	111920	For example, I think that is a keyboard for an Apple II of some kind.
111920	114920	And then there was this mystery keyboard, I just have no idea what that would have been
114920	115920	used in.
115920	121640	And there was also a slim cam camcorder, doesn't seem very slim by today's standards.
121640	126120	I also found this wise keyboard, I thought it was for a terminal, but I didn't see the
126120	127800	terminal anywhere.
127800	129720	Of course, I wasn't there to see any of this.
129720	133360	The best stuff was already inside, but first he had to show me his doorbell.
133360	140760	So we needed a doorbell, we had parts, we didn't have a doorbell at the time.
140760	149520	So it's a septic tank alarm for the overflows, a relay, and a mask.
149520	150520	Both buttons.
150520	158200	They're just wired common together.
158200	162240	Inside the building was, of course, as to be expected, most of this was certainly scrap,
162240	164360	but there were a few gems here and there.
164360	169960	Well, look, we found the wise that goes with that wise keyboard we saw on the back of the
169960	170960	truck.
170960	175560	That's a wise PC, I've never seen one of these.
175560	179280	Oh, wow, those are some big old heavy hard drives.
179280	185120	It's got an old MFM Seagate 225 in it.
185120	192200	It's actually hard for me to believe that it's been long enough to find things like
192200	197920	these old Macbooks and iBooks are now considered scrap.
197920	198920	Was it too long ago?
198920	203800	I was restoring these and refurbishing them and selling them, and I guess, you know, those
203800	206240	like 10 years ago, I guess at this point.
206240	209880	On this shelf, Jeremiah stores some of his more interesting recent finds.
209880	226000	Of course, the best was yet to come.
226000	231800	So from the description of this system, from the gal who was actually at the company at
231800	237040	the time, they were looking at a system to be able to read audio cues as well as write
237040	239320	them on reel-to-reel recorders.
239320	247120	So they actually had one of the big old reel-to-reels through, I guess, an industry standard connection
247120	251320	for recording studios, and it's actually a dongle that would plug into the back.
251320	257200	Wow, so these are, yeah, you can tell this has been sitting for quite some time.
257200	263120	Yeah, and they didn't have a lid open or closed, so it's picked up quite a bit of dust.
263120	266320	And that was after hitting with the air compressor.
267320	270320	Looks like you got quite a few of these.
273320	279320	These guys were pretty much packed and ready to go, minus the actual interface kit.
279320	284320	Looks like they just reused Commodore's end caps there.
284320	286320	Synchronous technologies.
286320	289320	I have not found an original box form.
289320	292320	Well, there's even more of them.
292320	295320	I think there's about 12 plus the first unit.
295320	297320	Oh, look at that.
297320	299320	A whole bunch of it, 20s.
299320	302320	Yep, in various states of fare.
302320	304320	In various states of yellowing, too.
304320	305320	Look at that.
305320	306320	Oh, yeah.
306320	307320	I wonder if it's like...
307320	312320	And you can tell which side was facing up, because you get the oxygen fade.
312320	313320	Yeah.
314320	315320	That one doesn't have the...
315320	316320	Yeah, there's no labels.
316320	317320	No labels on these.
317320	319320	I think they painted the keys.
319320	323320	Yeah, I was looking at that, and I was like, well, these can't be original Commodore keys
323320	327320	because the color, but yeah, they could be technically painted, I guess.
327320	330320	Yeah, you can see the paint on there.
330320	334320	So they probably just set them all out in this braddle tandem.
334320	337320	You got more Vic-20s.
337320	341320	Vic-20 motherboards, box full of them here.
341320	344320	I'm sure you've gotten plenty of familiarity with those.
344320	346320	Yeah, I know a lot about Vic-20 motherboards.
346320	348320	Look at this.
348320	352320	That is a mostly hand.
352320	354320	I don't know what the story is on that guy.
354320	358320	I don't know if that has anything to do with the Vic-20.
358320	363320	So I heard you had some other really rare Commodore equipment.
363320	366320	But yes, I have some very rare, what became Commodore equipment.
366320	369320	And this was found in the same pile with all the Vic-20s and stuff.
369320	371320	Yes, it was from the same company.
371320	372320	Wow.
372320	374320	That's quite a find.
374320	378320	So what we have here, of course, is a Kim-1 and possibly a very early model.
378320	382320	For those that don't know, this is like the Apple-1 of Commodore systems.
382320	388320	It predates the pet and it's certainly not the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a recycle shop.
388320	392320	Anyway, we had a look at some of the other neat systems you'd found such as this Hazeltine system.
392320	396320	And we found some old Mauser electronics bags, which was quite the throwback for me
396320	402320	because these are the exact bags that we're using when I worked at Mauser in the mid-1990s.
402320	404320	And of course, now it was time to load all this stuff up in my car.
404320	407320	And honestly, I wasn't even sure if it was all going to fit.
407320	409320	I definitely have to fold my back seats down.
409320	414320	I was also constantly asking myself, where in the world was I going to put all of this when I got it home?
414320	419320	Anyway, we did manage to fit it all in the car and I headed back on the long trip back to Texas.
419320	423320	It was dusk at this point and while it might seem like it would be a pleasant trip home,
423320	426320	I actually thought I'd have to commit myself to an insane asylum
426320	430320	after listening to the squeaky styrofoam all the way home.
430320	433320	You can imagine listening to this for three and a half hours.
435320	438320	So now that I'm back home, let's have a look at one of these Vic-20s.
438320	444320	When I pull the styrofoam off, you can see this huge contrast of color, which is most likely just dirt and dust.
444320	449320	Looking a bit closer, I have a bad feeling there might also be some yellowing going on.
449320	453320	But this was one of the units on top, so maybe the ones underneath wouldn't be as bad.
453320	457320	Obviously, what I needed to do was try cleaning the thing off, so here it goes.
457320	461320	As you can see, just a good five minute cleaning job made a dramatic difference.
461320	465320	But unfortunately, there is some yellowing on the plastic in the center.
465320	470320	So at this point, you may find yourself asking David, you know, what the heck is this thing?
470320	473320	You know, what is the sponstrosity that somebody made?
473320	476320	And I think there's something that I need to explain first.
476320	481320	If you go back to the early 80s, like 1981 to like 1985, there was no Raspberry Pi.
481320	483320	There was no Arduino, right?
483320	490320	If you were building some kind of industrial control system or something that required a computer to interface with it,
490320	493320	the cheapest thing you could get was going to be a Vic-20.
493320	497320	I mean, technically you could get like a ZX81 or, you know, Timex Sinclair 1000 for cheaper,
497320	502320	but the membrane keyboard on that made it very unsuitable for those types of applications.
502320	509320	So the Vic-20 was often the choice of the day for what someone today might use an Arduino for.
509320	514320	And so, you know, I did that episode a while back restoring that old oily, nasty Vic-20,
514320	520320	and I had speculated in that video that that computer was probably used in some sort of industrial environment
520320	524320	to control some sort of, I don't know, milling equipment or something like that.
524320	526320	And that was actually really common.
526320	530320	I mean, the Vic-20 was way cheaper than Apple II, and even after the Commodore 64 came out,
530320	535320	it was still like half or even sometimes a quarter of the price of the Commodore 64.
535320	540320	And if you didn't need like all the graphics and sprites and the SID chip and all that kind of stuff,
540320	545320	if you were just using it to control something, the Vic-20 was a much more logical choice.
545320	547320	And so that's exactly what we have here.
547320	550320	This is actually not the first time I've seen one of these.
550320	555320	I've actually seen them in photographs before because they've been brought up and discussed on Facebook a few times,
555320	559320	and there's some magazine articles that you can look at, and I'll post some pictures of them here.
559320	566320	And you can see that this was used as some sort of control interface for an audio editing system.
566320	568320	That's the best I can make out.
568320	572320	So in fact, I saw one person make a comparison and say that this was like the,
572320	578320	if you're familiar with the video toaster for the Amiga and how that revolutionized video editing.
578320	582320	Well, this was kind of the audio equivalent of that that came out a few years earlier,
582320	584320	and they used, of course, the Vic-20 for it.
584320	587320	Now, I'm actually really interested to power one of these things on
587320	591320	because I don't know whether it's going to have any custom ROMs in it
591320	593320	or whether that was all handled through the cartridge interface,
593320	596320	which we can't seem to find any of that leftover.
596320	602320	So for those wondering, by the way, Jeremiah actually picked these up from an abandoned building there in Oklahoma City
602320	607320	that actually used to be the headquarters for where this product was actually manufactured.
607320	610320	So that's why there were so many of them there.
610320	612320	Okay, time to plug this thing in and see what happens.
612320	615320	These didn't come with power supplies, so I'll just use my trusty new brick.
615320	619320	These particular Vic-20s used the same power supply as the C64.
619320	622320	The earlier models were different, but these are all the later models.
622320	626320	And here we go. It appears to boot up just like a regular Vic-20.
626320	628320	I guess there are no custom ROMs inside.
628320	630320	Okay, well, let's try the keyboard.
630320	633320	As I suspected, these keys do exactly what they always did.
633320	637320	They simply removed a lot of keys, but the ones that remain are unchanged.
637320	641320	Well, let's open it up and see if there's anything different inside.
641320	643320	I don't think so.
643320	647320	I'm surprised how clean it is inside. This looks like a brand new Vic-20.
647320	650320	I mean, there's a hint of dust on the motherboard, but that's it.
650320	654320	Also, as far as I can see, everything on this board is stock. There are no modifications.
654320	656320	The keyboard, of course, is a different story.
656320	660320	I can see they probably pulled this tape off at one point and didn't put it back on very well.
660320	664320	Oh, and look at this. They completely cut the shift lock key out of the board.
664320	667320	I don't even think they bothered to desolder it.
667320	671320	Okay, well, I put it back together and I wanted to see if I could play some games on them.
671320	673320	I tried Cheese & Onion first.
673320	676320	Most of the good games for the Vic-20 came on cartridge,
676320	678320	and typically those didn't require much of any keyboard input,
678320	681320	so I think this shouldn't be a problem.
681320	683320	I'll just plug in the joystick here.
683320	686320	And as expected, it actually works just fine.
686320	689320	Ironically, I would show the game I'm working on right now for the Vic-20,
689320	693320	but I can't because it requires me to type the load command on the keyboard,
693320	695320	and there's just no way to do it.
695320	697320	So I tried a few more games, such as Avenger.
697320	700320	Now, this one actually requires that you press F1 to start the game,
700320	703320	which is no problem since that's one of the keys that are still left on the keyboard.
703320	705320	So, yeah, no problem there.
705320	707320	Same thing with Donkey Kong.
707320	710320	It actually uses three of the function keys, but again, no problem.
712320	714320	Pole Position works fine.
716320	718320	Tetris works fine.
721320	723320	And I tried one more Pentechorat.
723320	727320	So, yeah, I'd say that virtually all the cartridge games will still work fine on one of these,
727320	729320	despite the missing keys.
729320	732320	So, let's take a look at this stuff in my garage floor.
732320	736320	As you can see, quite a few filthy Vic-20s, a box of scrap Vic-20s,
736320	740320	and of course this stray Atari 2600 that somehow wound up in the box too.
740320	743320	Looking over here, there's a box of cassettes.
743320	747320	These are kind of interesting as they have this little locking mechanism to keep the tape from moving.
747320	752320	This one says drum sys and seems to have what might be some memory addresses in Texas decimal.
752320	757320	Ah, now this is something I've never seen one of these before, but I recognized it right away.
757320	759320	Now, I'll explain that here shortly.
759320	763320	Now, needless to say, this is an e-prom programmer that fits in the Commodore user port
763320	766320	and was most likely used to write the e-prom's for their cartridges.
766320	770320	I also found this, which appears to be a user port peripheral too,
770320	773320	but seems to have some audio and MIDI interfaces on board.
773320	777320	And I was wrong, it looks like there are at least a few power supplies in here.
777320	779320	I'm not sure I'd want to risk using them though.
779320	782320	Digging a little deeper, I found an older style Vic-20 power supply.
782320	785320	This is the two-prong style, and as it turned out,
785320	789320	a few of these Vic-20s are indeed the older board type that have the two-prong power adapter.
789320	794320	There were also a couple of RF modulators, both the old style, which is just a black box,
794320	796320	and the new style, which is smaller and says Commodore on it.
796320	800320	Fortunately, most people today would not need these since composite video is everywhere.
801320	803320	And there were a few of these in here.
803320	806320	This is apparently a metal top piece to some of their hardware,
806320	809320	but that seems to be all I can find of it.
809320	812320	Here we have an almost complete Vic-20 keyboard except for the shift lock key,
812320	815320	which has already been removed.
815320	818320	And in the bottom of the box are these strange boards.
818320	820320	I'm not sure what these are.
820320	824320	They are hand-wired, but have a lot of what appear to be MIDI and audio ports on them.
824320	827320	Plus a few bare Vic-20 motherboards.
827320	830320	Let's see if we can clean up this e-prong programmer.
830320	832320	Yeah, it seems to clean up pretty easily.
832320	837320	So I told you that I'd never seen one of these, but recognize it right away and you might ask why.
837320	842320	Well, you see, when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I got this book with my Commodore 128.
842320	846320	And I took this book to school and read through every page.
846320	848320	What? You didn't know I was a big-time nerd?
848320	851320	Anyway, so this book shows all the official Commodore products of the era,
851320	854320	but also shows a number of third-party products.
854320	857320	And right here on one of the first pages, you'll see this.
857320	862320	And I used to read about this even though I didn't fully understand what it was supposed to actually do.
862320	866320	But anyway, here it is. And I never thought I'd see one in person.
866320	870320	So moving along, I wanted to find out if these bare Vic-20 boards work or not.
870320	874320	All I need is video and power to get a pretty good idea.
874320	876320	And here goes nothing.
876320	879320	Well, I think we can safely assume that one doesn't work.
879320	883320	So I thought I'd test the second board and I noticed an empty socket here where the CPU goes.
883320	887320	So no problem. I have a spare working CPU, so I'll stick that in there.
887320	890320	And this one's dead as a doornail.
890320	892320	However, I feel kind of dumb now.
892320	897320	After looking the board over for potential problems, I noticed that there's no friggin' RAM chips in the board.
897320	901320	I would have noticed an empty socket, but I guess my brain wasn't looking for missing chips.
901320	904320	And the other one was also missing RAM as well.
904320	908320	Okay, well, I just happened to have some extra Vic-20 RAM chips laying around.
908320	911320	And I also have a few sockets, so I thought, hey, what the heck?
911320	913320	It'll only take five minutes to see if these boards work.
913320	917320	I was curious if these were scrap boards from defective units
917320	920320	or if they were actually experimenting with them.
920320	922320	For example, to add extra RAM or something like that.
922320	927320	So depending on whether the board works once I add RAM chips, we'll help answer that question.
927320	930320	And lucky there, it works.
930320	934320	The screen's a bit dark, but this is a common issue I've seen working on Vic-20s.
934320	935320	It just needs a little adjustment.
935320	939320	If you remove the metal cover over the video chip, there's a little puttyometer in there you can adjust.
939320	942320	And as you can see, you can go really dark or super bright.
942320	945320	But I think this setting here is just about perfect.
945320	948320	So the question is, why did they remove the RAM chips?
948320	951320	Hmm, makes me wonder.
951320	954320	Moving along, we need to talk about this Kim 1.
954320	958320	This is a very rare and valuable piece of computing history.
958320	962320	The trouble is, I know next to nothing about it other than historical facts.
962320	964320	I have no idea how to use it or even test it.
964320	970320	And looking at this old power supply that came with it, I wouldn't dare even consider plugging this thing into power.
970320	973320	I mean, just look at that.
973320	976320	I do think this slot here was added onto the board.
976320	978320	This is not standard equipment.
978320	981320	As you can see, it soldered to a whole bunch of places at the bottom of the board.
981320	984320	I suspect this was used for a video card.
984320	987320	Keep in mind, the Kim 1 was never meant to connect to a display.
987320	990320	Unfortunately, no video card was found with the board.
990320	994320	And so this raises a lot of questions about what the heck to do with this thing.
994320	998320	The board itself is really dirty and grungy, and I can probably clean that up.
998320	1001320	But what to do with the rest of it?
1001320	1004320	So there's several considerations to think about with this Kim 1.
1004320	1006320	First of all, the question of, does it work?
1006320	1010320	And then I have to counter that question with, does it matter?
1010320	1015320	I mean, because nobody's going to sit around and play with a Kim 1.
1015320	1018320	In the same regard, nobody's going to sit around and play with an Apple 1.
1018320	1021320	Now, I mean, if you really wanted to play with a Kim 1 that badly,
1021320	1025320	there are some replica boards, which would make far more sense than playing around with an original one.
1025320	1032320	So, you know, for example, I don't know that I would want to desolder the CPU or some of these ceramic chips
1032320	1036320	and replace them with modern ones just to fix it and make it work.
1036320	1039320	I think it probably looks better just keeping it the way that it is.
1039320	1043320	Obviously, I do want to clean it up, and I'm investigating what the best way would be to do that.
1043320	1045320	But here's the other thing.
1045320	1050320	What to do about this power supply and this ugly green rotted piece of wood that it's attached to?
1050320	1054320	Those are not original. I mean, they didn't come with the board.
1054320	1056320	That was something the user added.
1056320	1060320	Same with this video socket or whatever this expansion socket is that they added here.
1060320	1064320	So, should I get rid of those and mount this board in something else,
1064320	1067320	like some kind of glass display case or something like that?
1067320	1071320	I just don't know. These are things that I'll need to think about.
1071320	1074320	I'll probably have to follow this up with another video at some point.
1074320	1078320	So, anyway, I welcome any suggestions on what the best thing to do with this.
1078320	1081320	Oh, and by the way, I don't actually even plan on keeping this.
1081320	1085320	There's actually, it's not well known, but I think there's a new computer museum
1085320	1088320	that's going to be opening up in Austin here maybe next year.
1088320	1091320	And my plan is to donate this to them.
1091320	1093320	That way, it'll be on display for people to see.
1093320	1095320	So, what will happen to the VIC-20s?
1095320	1097320	Well, I've picked out the three best ones,
1097320	1100320	and I plan to donate one to the Home Computer Museum in the Netherlands,
1100320	1102320	another one to Bo Zimmerman's collection,
1102320	1105320	and the third one will go with the Kim-1 to Austin.
1105320	1107320	So, that's the plan anyway.
1107320	1109320	I'm donating the rest of them to my friend Chris Hasledge,
1109320	1112320	who also came over and helped me clean and test the rest of them.
1112320	1115320	He works for an organization called One Up on Cancer,
1115320	1118320	which is a non-profit for helping cancer patients based here in Dallas
1118320	1120320	and has a video game theme to everything they do.
1120320	1122320	They're going to finish cleaning and testing these,
1122320	1124320	and we'll be auctioning them off.
1124320	1126320	So, if you're interested in getting one of these,
1126320	1129320	I'll put a link in the description field explaining where to keep an eye out for these.
1130320	1132320	Thank you.
