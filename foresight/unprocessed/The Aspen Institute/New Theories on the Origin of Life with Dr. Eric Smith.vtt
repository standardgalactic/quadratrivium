00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Hey, good evening, welcome.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.400
My name is Jerry Murdoch.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.120
Most of you in the room, or the many of you that know me, mostly know me as that guy who's

00:15.120 --> 00:20.240
married to Gina Murdoch.

00:20.240 --> 00:25.840
But I'm also a board member here at the Aspen Institute and at the Santa Fe Institute and

00:25.840 --> 00:30.560
at the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.

00:30.560 --> 00:37.040
This is the second event of the 2015 McCloskey Speaker Series.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.880
I want to thank Bonnie and Tom McCloskey family who are sitting right here.

00:41.880 --> 00:42.880
Thank you very much.

00:42.880 --> 00:47.160
This is wonderful.

00:47.160 --> 00:54.680
So tonight's speaker, Dr. Eric Smith, has challenged disciplinary boundaries throughout

00:54.680 --> 00:56.440
his career.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.880
First is an undergraduate at Caltech in getting his degree in mathematics and in physics.

01:02.880 --> 01:08.520
And then at the University of Texas, Austin, where he earned his PhD in high-energy physics

01:08.520 --> 01:13.880
while working on string theory and quantum gravity, which was followed by appointments

01:13.880 --> 01:15.920
at Los Alamos.

01:15.920 --> 01:22.880
And then he spent 11 years at the Santa Fe Institute as a full-time faculty member.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.120
During his time at Santa Fe Institute, I had the good fortune to meet him.

01:28.120 --> 01:33.840
And in full disclosure, I've been funding his work for over a decade, his work in regards

01:33.840 --> 01:38.480
to the origin of life, which we're going to hear about tonight.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.640
And while at Santa Fe Institute, he was also doing interdisciplinary work in geochemistry,

01:43.640 --> 01:49.720
biochemistry, and many topics related to complexity.

01:50.360 --> 02:06.320
Currently, Eric is a professor and researcher at the Earth Life Institute in Tokyo.

02:06.320 --> 02:11.960
And he's also a external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.

02:11.960 --> 02:19.040
His goal is to understand origin and nature of the living state through the many windows

02:19.040 --> 02:27.440
that science provides, the physical, geochemical, biochemical, ecological, and evolutionary.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.720
Additionally, he remains interested in the connections or correspondences between energy,

02:34.720 --> 02:38.760
information, and computation.

02:38.760 --> 02:46.240
Most of us think about life as being something created from other living things.

02:46.240 --> 02:52.320
But much of Eric's work focuses on the time before biology, when life on Earth emerge

02:52.320 --> 02:56.360
from geophysical and chemical processes.

02:56.360 --> 03:01.440
The subject of tonight's talk is based on material from his upcoming book, co-written

03:01.440 --> 03:07.000
by the legendary biologist Harold Morowitz, which is entitled, The Emergence of the Fourth

03:07.000 --> 03:12.560
Geosphere, to be published in 2016 by Cambridge University Press.

03:12.560 --> 03:17.760
His work disrupts Francis Crick's notion that life was a happy accident.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.720
Indeed, the material has consequences for the way we think about the relationship of

03:22.720 --> 03:25.760
the individual to ecology.

03:25.760 --> 03:31.920
The big picture of origin of life shows that ecosystems, not individuals, are carrying

03:31.920 --> 03:35.240
some of the most fundamental patterns of life.

03:35.240 --> 03:40.240
Furthermore, the work leads us to understand that the nature of living state is different

03:40.240 --> 03:45.520
from the nature of individuality, and that we have been wrongly conflating the two in

03:45.520 --> 03:47.480
our understanding of biology.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.640
Therefore, we should strive to achieve a more ecology-centered biology to help us guide

03:53.640 --> 03:58.320
our life in a more sustainable way within the biosphere.

03:58.320 --> 04:07.560
Finally, both his upcoming book and tonight's talk will challenge us to rethink what is

04:07.560 --> 04:09.720
the nature of life.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.320
Without further ado, let's welcome Eric Smith.

04:12.320 --> 04:31.640
Thank you.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.760
So thank you, Jerry, and good evening, everybody.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.560
Welcome.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.880
You might think at the least that the problem of the origin of life, how did life appear

04:39.880 --> 04:44.400
on an earth that previously had not had life, is mostly a history problem.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.080
What happened and when and where did it happen?

04:47.080 --> 04:51.000
You could go a little bit beyond that and you might think of it as a problem of cause.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.280
How did things happen and why?

04:54.280 --> 05:02.160
The argument that I want to make tonight is that we actually need to go further than that.

05:02.160 --> 05:07.200
The things that we've learned about the technical problems of when, where, and how have caused

05:07.200 --> 05:11.760
us to realize that the nature of life is different from a lot of the patterns that we've traditionally

05:11.760 --> 05:14.080
used to think about it.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.760
The reason the origin of life problem is hard is that we do something in science that we

05:18.760 --> 05:20.520
also do in everyday life.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.040
We put a big gap between the living things and the nonliving things.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.760
It's very difficult to see across that gap how something like life could have come from

05:29.760 --> 05:33.560
something that was not alive.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.920
So when we think about life, we often think about it in these terms.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.480
Life is made of individuals.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.600
They have agency.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.520
Maybe they have purpose or intentions that gives the biosphere direction.

05:44.520 --> 05:49.440
Even if the direction didn't come from the individuals, it comes from evolution.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.280
Life is energetic, it's complex, and it's endlessly fascinating.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.280
Compare that to rocks.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
What do rocks do?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.960
They just sit there.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.280
They've been around for billions of years.

06:02.280 --> 06:09.640
So what I want to argue to you tonight is that the conceptual gap between the nonliving

06:09.640 --> 06:15.960
world and living world is not real, or it's not where we have tried to place it in the

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
past.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.120
The nonliving world is very active.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.520
It's richly structured in its activity, and the biosphere from the beginning all the way

06:24.520 --> 06:29.760
to the present is embedded in detail in the structure of that chemical activity of the

06:29.760 --> 06:31.680
rest of the planet.

06:31.680 --> 06:37.200
We haven't recognized the connections because our ways of looking have been too small or

06:37.200 --> 06:38.800
they've been too short term.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.920
They've been on the scale of a human life, or maybe we've looked in the wrong places.

06:43.920 --> 06:49.680
But particularly in the last 30 years, things that we've learned in a variety of different

06:49.680 --> 06:55.040
disciplines are changing the way we ask those questions, and those are the things that cause

06:55.040 --> 07:00.920
us to reevaluate what we think the nature of life is and what we're trying to explain.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.840
So tonight, I want to cover four points.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.720
First of all, to understand the nature of life and the origin of life, you have to understand

07:08.720 --> 07:14.520
its planetary context, and that context is what I will call a great arc of disequilibrium

07:14.520 --> 07:17.040
on the scale of the whole planet.

07:17.040 --> 07:22.760
Now even though that disequilibrium or stress runs through all of the systems on the planet,

07:22.760 --> 07:27.040
we can break it apart and we can make it comprehensible by doing something that geologists have done

07:27.040 --> 07:28.740
for more than a century.

07:28.740 --> 07:33.640
We can divide the planet into geospheres, which are separate domains of states of matter

07:33.640 --> 07:37.120
and kinds of chemistry.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.440
What we're looking for in the nature of life is actually at the level of the biosphere

07:41.440 --> 07:48.760
as a whole, not at the level of its components, of species or organisms or sub-organism components.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.640
The conclusion that I want to leave us with at the end of the night is that the biosphere

07:52.640 --> 07:54.760
is the fourth geosphere.

07:54.760 --> 07:59.200
We should understand it as a planetary subsystem, and we should understand the emergence of

07:59.200 --> 08:05.320
life as a stage in planetary maturation akin to the stages that cause the other geospheres

08:05.320 --> 08:09.480
to be separated from each other.

08:09.480 --> 08:15.720
So in classical geology, a lifeless planet can have three geospheres.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.320
The lithosphere, from the word for rock, is the solid bulk.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.360
On Earth, this is almost all of the matter and the mass of the planet.

08:24.360 --> 08:30.160
The state of matter is solid, and the chemistry characteristic of the lithosphere is the chemistry

08:30.160 --> 08:34.720
of minerals and their changes.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.360
Second geosphere is the hydrosphere.

08:36.360 --> 08:39.360
This is all of the watery domains.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.920
Water chemistry is very special.

08:40.920 --> 08:45.920
It's very restrictive, and as we've known forever, water chemistry is fundamental to

08:45.920 --> 08:51.920
the nature of life, and it's in part important because of all the things you can't do in

08:51.920 --> 08:57.840
water that you have to be distinctive that life does.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.680
The third non-living geosphere is the atmosphere.

09:00.680 --> 09:05.440
This is the gas phase because it's cool and because it's at low density.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.440
There are certain kinds of chemistry that are possible in the atmosphere that are not

09:08.440 --> 09:10.680
possible other places.

09:10.680 --> 09:15.280
Now the chemistry of the atmosphere is not actually very much like the chemistry of life,

09:15.280 --> 09:19.760
but it turns out that it's really important to the great arc of planetary disequilibrium

09:19.760 --> 09:23.800
that will be central to our story.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.720
And the fourth is the biosphere.

09:26.720 --> 09:30.840
A lifeless planet will always have a lithosphere.

09:30.840 --> 09:35.320
If it has enough volatiles, as they're called, the liquids and gases, it can also have hydrospheres

09:35.320 --> 09:37.640
or atmospheres.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.880
I want to look at the earth as it is, and everything that causes it to be different

09:41.880 --> 09:45.560
from a planet that only had the three lifeless geospheres.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.240
And all of that difference is what I mean by the biosphere.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.360
So it is organisms, but not only organisms.

09:52.360 --> 09:57.080
It's all of their ecological relations, it's their history, and it's all the changes that

09:57.080 --> 10:01.960
they have collectively brought about in the rest of the planet throughout its history.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.920
So it's in the sum rather than in the components that we look for the nature of the living

10:05.920 --> 10:10.320
state.

10:10.320 --> 10:15.760
So I've said that there's not a gap that separates life conceptually from the rest of the earth,

10:15.760 --> 10:20.080
but certainly the biosphere is different from the non-living geospheres.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.880
It's different in many ways, but if we had to choose one that's most important, here's

10:23.880 --> 10:26.280
the one I would argue it is.

10:26.280 --> 10:31.240
For the other geospheres, the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, we can understand

10:31.240 --> 10:35.280
most of them in terms of their structure.

10:35.280 --> 10:42.480
For the biosphere, you can only really understand it as an organized state of activity.

10:42.480 --> 10:47.600
In order to create an organized state of activity that goes beyond just structure, you have

10:47.600 --> 10:52.120
to be in a circumstance that physicists call far from equilibrium, and I'll explain to

10:52.120 --> 10:54.700
you in a minute what that means.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.920
The important thing is that the disequilibria we need to understand life are not something

10:58.920 --> 11:03.040
local, they're not local in space and they're not local in chemistry, they actually are

11:03.040 --> 11:07.200
built up on the scale of the whole planet.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.600
So to give you a flavor for what is meant by near equilibrium or far from equilibrium,

11:11.600 --> 11:15.560
I'll use something that's a little of an analogy, but it's an analogy that's mathematically

11:15.560 --> 11:17.600
faithful.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.400
Near equilibrium is like the ripples on a pond.

11:20.400 --> 11:25.840
There may be activity that's caused by disturbances, but most of what there is to understand can

11:25.840 --> 11:32.520
be understood from the structure of the flat surface before you start.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.040
This is far from equilibrium.

11:35.040 --> 11:40.480
Think of the biosphere as surfing on a continuously renewed wave of energy flow.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.440
That energy flow is needed to keep it up where it is, it's needed to keep it organized.

11:45.440 --> 11:51.360
Now it's been understood forever that life requires a flow of energy to maintain itself.

11:51.360 --> 11:57.000
But to say that something is required doesn't say that that's necessarily possible, it only

11:57.000 --> 11:59.320
tells you what's impossible.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.480
Tonight I want to argue for something stronger.

12:01.480 --> 12:07.100
I want to argue that the energy flows on earth brought the biosphere into existence.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.680
It's as if the wave had created the surfer.

12:10.680 --> 12:16.620
So traditionally when we come at the problem of the origin of life from the habits of biology,

12:16.620 --> 12:20.480
we ask where is the surfer and what is the surfer like?

12:20.480 --> 12:28.200
What I want to argue with here is that the right question should be where is the wave?

12:28.200 --> 12:31.480
So the story of disequilibrium that makes sense of the origin of life doesn't start

12:31.480 --> 12:35.960
on the planet, it actually starts in the formation of the solar system.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.440
Now when we look at the sun, the part we see is the photosphere.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.440
Photosphere is relatively cool.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.040
It's only about 6,000 degrees Celsius, which is about the same temperature as the core

12:45.040 --> 12:46.200
of the earth.

12:46.200 --> 12:53.280
And it looks relatively smooth and flat like you see here, occasional sunspots.

12:53.280 --> 12:58.120
But if you were to look at the sun in the X-ray with a movie, you'd find a boiling cauldron

12:58.120 --> 13:00.400
of magnetic fluid.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.040
Because the sun produces heat and the heat needs to convect and because it's electrically

13:05.040 --> 13:10.640
conductive, you get loops of magnetism that boil up from the interior and whip plasma into

13:10.640 --> 13:13.360
the outer layers of the atmosphere.

13:13.360 --> 13:18.080
This action can cause the middle atmosphere of the sun, called the chromosphere, to go

13:18.080 --> 13:20.440
up to 100,000 degrees or more.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.240
And it can elevate the corona to a million degrees or more.

13:24.240 --> 13:29.720
So plasma at 100,000 degrees emits extreme ultraviolet radiation, and at a million degrees

13:29.720 --> 13:34.080
or more it emits X-rays.

13:34.080 --> 13:38.920
So if you could look at the sun with a picture in the extreme UV in the X-ray, this is actually

13:38.920 --> 13:41.080
what you would find.

13:41.080 --> 13:46.520
The activity of a star like this is due to convection and the conductivity of the plasma,

13:46.520 --> 13:51.880
but also to the rotation, because this is a Coriolis effect, the same as hurricanes.

13:51.880 --> 13:56.480
And when stars are young when they're born, they rotate much faster and they spin down

13:56.480 --> 13:58.080
over time.

13:58.080 --> 14:03.120
So when the sun was young, all of this activity was actually more vigorous and more violent

14:03.120 --> 14:07.160
than it is today.

14:07.160 --> 14:13.080
Now that kind of hard radiation shapes planetary atmospheres, and in particular it drives them

14:13.080 --> 14:17.160
far out of equilibrium from the planet that they surround.

14:17.160 --> 14:21.120
So in particular, ultraviolet and above will break water.

14:21.120 --> 14:26.440
Water is the H2O molecule where the Hs are white and the O is red, and it will separate

14:26.440 --> 14:29.280
the hydrogen from the oxygen.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.400
Hydrogen is a very light element, and so anything will cause it to escape.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.800
And the result is that you leave the oxygen behind.

14:38.800 --> 14:42.960
This is actually a satellite photo of the Earth taken with a filter for the emission

14:42.960 --> 14:45.200
lines that see hydrogen.

14:45.200 --> 14:50.160
And what you can see is that our planet is surrounded by a halo of hydrogen that's continually

14:50.160 --> 14:54.040
escaping from it.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.960
That turns out to have major consequences.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.400
Because the rates of hydrogen loss that a star like our sun produces will remove a volume

15:01.400 --> 15:05.880
of water comparable to the Earth's ocean in about a billion years.

15:05.880 --> 15:14.120
So if you were Venus, which is about our size but closer to the sun and a little bit warmer,

15:14.120 --> 15:19.240
or if you were Mars, which is smaller and has weaker gravity to hold elements, you would

15:19.320 --> 15:23.960
have wound up in the condition that they're in today, with no surface water, oxygen left

15:23.960 --> 15:27.520
behind that turns the dry surface a rusty red.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.880
In about four and a half billion years, the Earth may be in this condition, depending

15:30.880 --> 15:34.680
on how much water is on the inside, which is something we don't know.

15:34.680 --> 15:39.520
But for the time being, the Earth is a very unusual planet in the solar system, and possibly

15:39.520 --> 15:42.560
more widely than that.

15:42.560 --> 15:47.440
But why does any of this matter to the origin of life?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.800
To answer that, you need to know a little bit of chemistry, but all you need to know

15:50.800 --> 15:54.200
is on this one slide.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.160
And it's intuitive, I promise.

15:57.160 --> 16:03.800
In the periodic table of the elements, we have many different kinds of animals.

16:03.800 --> 16:10.080
Some of the elements have a stronger what's called affinity for electrons than others.

16:10.080 --> 16:15.800
And in particular, important to our story, iron is very ready to give electrons away

16:15.960 --> 16:20.440
to many other elements, giving electrons away to something called reducing that, because

16:20.440 --> 16:23.080
electrons have a negative charge.

16:23.080 --> 16:28.880
At the opposite end, oxygen is very greedy and will steal electrons from many elements.

16:28.880 --> 16:33.360
And so you can see the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen in the suites of minerals

16:33.360 --> 16:35.040
in the world.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.120
Iron metal, which mostly doesn't exist at the surface, has all of its electrons, and

16:39.120 --> 16:42.520
they're loosely bound, so they make a kind of a liquid, and that's why iron is silvery

16:42.520 --> 16:44.880
and shiny and reflects light.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.720
If you bring in a little bit of oxygen, enough that there's one oxygen atom per iron atom,

16:49.720 --> 16:53.600
it will transfer two electrons to the oxygen, and we note that with a plus two on the iron

16:53.600 --> 16:58.520
and a minus two on the oxygen, and you get this dull silvery mineral called vistite,

16:58.520 --> 17:02.400
which is no longer shiny because the free electrons are gone.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.480
Little bit more so that you're in a mix between giving two and giving three electrons away,

17:07.480 --> 17:09.560
and you have magnetite, which is black.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.320
This is what the original compasses were made of.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.600
If you give yet more, you get this rusty red mineral called hematite, which is one of the

17:16.600 --> 17:18.360
elements of rust.

17:18.360 --> 17:25.600
Now as we all know, rust happens, and the spontaneity of this electron donating process

17:25.600 --> 17:29.960
is a source of chemical energy.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.160
If you look at that at a planetary scale, you realize that what happens is that hydrogen

17:34.160 --> 17:38.800
escape is turning our whole planet into a giant battery, because this is how batteries

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
work.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.480
There are two different elements, one of which gives electrons and one of which takes them,

17:43.480 --> 17:48.160
and you force the electrons to flow through something so that you can harness the work.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.320
In the earth, in the interior region known as the mantle, most of the iron is in this

17:52.320 --> 17:58.000
plus two state, but near the surface it gets pulled to the plus three state by the oxygen

17:58.000 --> 18:04.200
that's continually made available as we lose water to hydrogen escape.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.640
Now on a quiet earth, that battery would run down, because even though you originally

18:08.640 --> 18:13.720
had oxygen to donate electrons at the surface, that would basically weather over the same

18:13.720 --> 18:18.280
way you get a layer of oxide on an aluminum window sill.

18:18.280 --> 18:24.680
The only thing that allows the battery to be continually refreshed is that new material

18:24.680 --> 18:29.920
is delivered to the surface of the earth at the same time as hydrogen is continually

18:29.920 --> 18:32.600
scoured away out of the atmosphere.

18:32.600 --> 18:37.560
But that redelivery brings a second kind of disequilibrium into the picture to understand

18:37.560 --> 18:40.520
the context for life.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.800
So if you could look at a cross section of the earth on 100 million year time scales,

18:44.800 --> 18:50.280
so this is where human life is too short to see, you would actually see cool material

18:50.280 --> 18:54.320
being brought down from the surface, and you can barely see in this picture, I apologize

18:54.320 --> 18:58.520
for the colors, the yellow heat from the core being boiled up.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.720
So the interior plastic rock of the mantle is constantly in convective turnover driven

19:03.720 --> 19:07.000
by this need to release heat.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.400
If at the same time you could see the chemical composition of the rock, you would find that

19:12.400 --> 19:17.400
the oxidized, exhausted crust on the surface is being pulled down and remixed into the

19:17.400 --> 19:23.240
mantle, while the electron giving iron material in the interior is allowed to come to the

19:23.240 --> 19:27.400
surface and make new crust.

19:27.400 --> 19:32.800
So when you put all these processes together, this is the picture you get of the big earth.

19:32.800 --> 19:38.240
Convection continually refreshes the surface rock at the same time as the solar radiation

19:38.240 --> 19:41.080
pulls the hydrogen away.

19:41.080 --> 19:45.600
The important thing is that the new crust is not created uniformly everywhere.

19:45.600 --> 19:50.000
It's created in concentrated centers, which are called spreading centers or mid ocean

19:50.000 --> 19:53.840
ridges beneath the ocean bottom.

19:53.840 --> 19:59.920
The process of convection causes what are called plate tectonics, the movement of the

19:59.920 --> 20:05.160
major plates around, where they subduct, they create earthquakes and volcanoes which

20:05.160 --> 20:09.560
deliver other concentrated new rock to the surface, and when there are continents riding

20:09.560 --> 20:15.120
around on them, they cause continental drift.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.600
So this is a map of the bottom of the ocean showing its age.

20:20.600 --> 20:25.560
The entire bottom of the ocean gets replaced about once every 250 million years as the continents

20:25.560 --> 20:29.200
go back and forth opening and closing in a cycle.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.400
The mid ocean ridges are these red regions of newly created crust in the centers of all

20:33.400 --> 20:38.000
of the world's oceans, and then the blue regions are the old crust that's diving back into

20:38.000 --> 20:46.280
the mantle as they do under Tokyo where I'm living.

20:46.280 --> 20:51.400
Now the sites where new crust is created are themselves very interesting because you're

20:51.400 --> 20:56.120
taking rock that's miles thick and you're twisting it and separating it and pulling

20:56.120 --> 20:59.680
it, so they're filled with cracks and pores.

20:59.680 --> 21:06.400
And in this domain, seawater invades and it gets chemically altered by the rock.

21:06.400 --> 21:11.640
The invasion sites and then the remixing zones where the water comes back up are the places

21:11.640 --> 21:17.440
where a battery that accumulates over the entire planetary surface and bulk gets concentrated

21:17.440 --> 21:19.920
into these narrow ranges.

21:19.920 --> 21:24.440
So this map shows you the same spreading centers and the little red dots are the places where

21:24.440 --> 21:29.600
geologists have mapped out regions of active rock-water interaction.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.200
This is a tiny subset of the ones that are believed to exist, but these now constitute

21:34.200 --> 21:38.600
the evidence we have about where the Earth's battery mostly flows.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.700
And if you look at the electron transfer, if you do a calculation from the interior

21:42.700 --> 21:47.880
to the atmosphere, it's concentrated at these little release points right around here.

21:47.880 --> 21:53.160
So the importance of this is that this is where stress piles up in the world even though

21:53.160 --> 22:05.480
it's accumulated diffusely.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.120
So up to this point, we've closed half the gap.

22:08.120 --> 22:13.600
Hopefully I have convinced you that rocks don't just sit there, that the Earth is chemically

22:13.600 --> 22:15.880
active and that it's organized.

22:15.880 --> 22:22.160
But before the 1970s, even knowing all of this, and much of this was understood roughly,

22:22.160 --> 22:26.360
people still would not have been able to make a connection to the origin of life, because

22:26.360 --> 22:30.160
life still seemed so different.

22:30.160 --> 22:35.680
What I want to show you next is that's because up until about the 1970s, we thought we understood

22:35.680 --> 22:41.480
the nature of life, and our view of life was basically entirely upside down.

22:41.480 --> 22:45.720
What's important about the last 50 years is that we've learned about an entire new part

22:45.720 --> 22:50.520
of the biosphere that we didn't understand, and we've learned that it's that other part,

22:50.520 --> 23:03.640
not us, that gives the clues about where life came from and the real foundations of its nature.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.920
So understandably, for most of history, when we think about the nature of life, we think

23:06.920 --> 23:10.880
about things that are big enough to see, because we didn't have microscopes.

23:10.880 --> 23:14.200
And that means the plants and the animals and the fungi.

23:14.200 --> 23:19.600
But what these all have in common is that ultimately they're all fed by this green forest here.

23:19.600 --> 23:24.800
They all live off of the energy from sunlight, and that's a problem, because capturing sunlight

23:24.800 --> 23:28.120
is the most complicated thing living systems do.

23:28.120 --> 23:32.040
And so we were never able to surmount that chicken egg problem.

23:32.040 --> 23:36.520
How would you ever get up to something as complicated as the machinery that harnesses

23:36.520 --> 23:44.520
sunlight if you needed the sunlight energy to build that machinery in the first place?

23:44.520 --> 23:51.040
But in 1977, Jack Corliss, Richard von Herzen, and Robert Ballard led an expedition to the

23:51.040 --> 23:57.480
Galapagos Rift, one of our spreading centers, with the deep submersible elven, which at

23:57.480 --> 24:00.320
that time was new.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.240
They were drawn there because there had been measurements of the seawater overlying that

24:04.240 --> 24:07.840
were anomalously warm, and so they suspected there were rock-water interactions taking

24:07.840 --> 24:09.080
place.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.000
But they were completely unprepared for what they would see, both about the geology and

24:13.000 --> 24:15.760
about the life hosted there.

24:15.760 --> 24:20.520
Immediately after those discoveries, there were new hypotheses about how life had originated

24:20.520 --> 24:25.460
that are substantively much like what is mostly believed today.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.680
But together with other changes that were going on around the same time in microbiology

24:29.680 --> 24:33.840
and molecular biology, they completely changed our understanding of how the biosphere is

24:33.840 --> 24:38.600
organized and what was its history.

24:38.600 --> 24:45.840
So what Alvin saw, the first discovery, was these thundering plumes of sulfide and heavy

24:45.840 --> 24:50.760
metal-rich water coming up from the deep, where they mix with cool seawater.

24:50.760 --> 24:55.720
They precipitate these enormous chimneys that can be 45 or 60 feet tall.

24:55.720 --> 24:59.480
This water would poison us immediately because of the metals and the sulfide that it's full

24:59.480 --> 25:00.480
of.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.640
The temperature differences are extreme.

25:02.640 --> 25:07.520
350 degrees versus 4 degrees makes a mirror under this flange.

25:07.520 --> 25:12.160
But the most amazing thing was the animal colonies that live around here.

25:12.160 --> 25:16.920
The water would poison us, but it's the source of energy for entire ecosystems like these

25:16.920 --> 25:20.800
tube worms and the shrimp that live around them.

25:20.800 --> 25:24.840
Now the red color you see here, even though it looks like flowers, has nothing to do with

25:24.840 --> 25:27.480
pigments because there's no light down here.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.720
That's hemoglobin.

25:28.720 --> 25:34.080
These are the worms' lung that stick out into the water to perform gas exchange.

25:34.080 --> 25:38.640
But the most important thing of all about these ecosystems is that the worms don't build

25:38.640 --> 25:39.640
life.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.960
All of the life is built by bacteria.

25:41.960 --> 25:48.080
The worms gather gases that the bacteria use to build their biomass in these shimmering

25:48.080 --> 25:51.040
zones of mixing.

25:51.040 --> 25:57.080
That was a whole parallel biosphere that was not anticipated.

25:57.080 --> 26:01.280
But the Alvin expedition did more than show us that there's more diversity in the world

26:01.280 --> 26:03.200
than we realized.

26:03.200 --> 26:08.000
Similar with the other discoveries, it forced us to reconsider what it is that determines

26:08.000 --> 26:10.400
living form.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.000
There is a role for evolution in this, but I'll come back to evolution second because

26:14.000 --> 26:17.040
it's actually not our first story.

26:17.040 --> 26:22.160
The first story is that some of the patterns of life are written into the rules of chemistry

26:22.160 --> 26:28.520
and the planetary energy flows before there's ever material for evolution to act on.

26:28.520 --> 26:33.280
The important conclusion in this will not only be new insights about organisms, but

26:33.280 --> 26:39.920
also a new way to understand ecosystems that makes them more fundamental than organisms.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.600
So let me talk about typology.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.960
Suppose we had to play a game of 20 questions where I had to learn as much about some organism

26:46.960 --> 26:50.240
as possible in the fewest number of questions.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.560
What should those questions be?

26:52.560 --> 26:55.360
Turns out they would not first be about its history.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.440
My choice of the first two would be these.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.040
I would first ask, where does it get its energy?

27:00.040 --> 27:04.800
Does it get its energy from molecules that give electrons the way hydrogen does or from

27:04.800 --> 27:08.920
molecules that take electrons the way oxygen does?

27:08.920 --> 27:13.020
Then second, I would ask, how much do I learn if I only see the organism?

27:13.020 --> 27:15.640
Is the organism metabolically complete?

27:15.640 --> 27:19.200
Does it feed itself, which is the condition called autotrophy?

27:19.200 --> 27:25.600
Or is the organism incomplete so that it depends on an ecosystem to provide it, the condition

27:25.600 --> 27:29.520
called heterotrophy or being fed from somebody else?

27:29.520 --> 27:33.960
Because if it's incomplete, then even if I study that metabolism, I haven't understood

27:33.960 --> 27:36.440
what is sufficient to make life.

27:36.440 --> 27:40.880
So the first thing you realize is that everything we used to think about is down in this one

27:40.880 --> 27:42.760
lower right corner here.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.280
So they are not the norm.

27:44.280 --> 27:48.920
The other thing you realize is that on this side, they're all green or they eat something

27:48.920 --> 27:51.800
green or something that eats something green.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.720
So these are the complicated guys and they were the ones we were trying to understand

27:55.720 --> 27:57.720
from.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.940
These are the ones that were discovered in the deep subsurface and the bottoms of the

28:00.940 --> 28:04.240
oceans.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.240
Now if we look at the evolutionary view and we reconstruct history, we realize that it's

28:08.240 --> 28:10.240
telling us the same story.

28:10.240 --> 28:14.480
Of course, people and most of the things people know exist at a little tiny tip of this tree

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
here.

28:15.480 --> 28:20.760
And in fact, anything that has more than one cell lives on these few branches that have

28:20.760 --> 28:22.780
slightly thickened lines.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.080
Everything else in the world is unicells.

28:25.080 --> 28:31.440
And before, I don't know, 600 million years ago, that was all there was in the world.

28:31.440 --> 28:35.800
More than that, these are the only complex single celled organisms.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.840
The cells that have the simpler form of bacteria make up the blue and red branches that are

28:39.840 --> 28:42.280
the substance of the tree of life.

28:42.280 --> 28:49.400
Now the remarkable thing is, as we have reconstructed the properties of these deep branches from

28:49.520 --> 28:55.640
the way their ancestors are left on the tips here, we find that the bacteria that live

28:55.640 --> 28:59.600
without oxygen are the good models for the root here.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.200
And also many of them are heat loving.

29:02.200 --> 29:06.600
So the bacteria that were discovered by the Alvin expedition are not some special branch

29:06.600 --> 29:09.240
that's adapted to an extreme environment.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.160
They are the foundation.

29:11.160 --> 29:16.240
We are the special branch that occurred much later.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.520
So of course, everything here I was talking about organisms, because for organisms you

29:19.520 --> 29:21.720
can draw trees.

29:21.720 --> 29:25.800
If we had talked instead about ecosystems, I could have done even better, because I

29:25.800 --> 29:29.280
could have answered an enormous amount with only one question.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.280
Where do they get their energy?

29:31.280 --> 29:35.440
Because if we draw the boundaries big enough, every ecosystem is self-provisioning.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.360
We don't live off of organic molecules from space anymore if we ever did.

29:39.360 --> 29:44.760
So everything that is needed in an ecosystem is made by somebody in the ecosystem.

29:44.800 --> 29:49.960
Here the major division is between the ones that live from electron donors without oxygen

29:49.960 --> 29:53.880
and those that are powered ultimately by light on the surface.

29:53.880 --> 30:00.400
But we learn something more, kind of like Tolstoy's happy families are all alike and

30:00.400 --> 30:04.000
the unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
The reductive ecosystems are actually all essentially alike.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.480
They may not be the same at the level of organisms, but at the ecosystem level they're doing the

30:11.480 --> 30:13.000
same thing.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.920
Moreover, the process of building up biomass, the way these bacteria that oxidize iron and

30:18.920 --> 30:24.840
leave rust as their waste product do, is essentially also present in here, but it's wrapped in

30:24.840 --> 30:29.600
an energy suit where sunlight provides them what they're no longer getting from the earth's

30:29.600 --> 30:30.720
battery.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.520
So these are actually the fundamental and the deep.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.160
So that leads us to a different view of the biosphere.

30:42.160 --> 30:47.360
Metabolisms are not merely communities, they're entities in their own right.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.040
The reason this matters for the origin of life is threefold.

30:51.040 --> 30:57.560
First, the kinds of ecosystems, reductive or oxidative, are not primarily determined by

30:57.560 --> 31:01.200
genetics or history, they're primarily determined by metabolism.

31:01.200 --> 31:08.120
Second, the similarity of metabolisms is evident or the universality of metabolism can be seen

31:08.120 --> 31:12.040
at the ecosystem level, not necessarily at the organism level.

31:12.040 --> 31:16.840
So organisms cut up a puzzle in different ways, but the picture on the ecological puzzle

31:16.840 --> 31:19.520
is always the same picture.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.760
Here's the one that I need to argue to get you to accept.

31:22.760 --> 31:28.080
It was not organisms that were the bridge from geochemistry into life, it was ecosystems.

31:28.080 --> 31:31.880
The division of becoming special organisms came later.

31:31.880 --> 31:36.920
So now I want to make the argument for plausibility for that.

31:36.920 --> 31:41.920
To understand that argument though, we need to look more at metabolism because metabolism

31:41.920 --> 31:44.320
is the special property.

31:44.320 --> 31:49.040
And there are clues in the structure and the energetics of metabolism that are as remarkable

31:49.040 --> 31:52.280
as anything I've showed you in the world of organisms.

31:52.280 --> 31:56.720
Now usually if you look at metabolism, you of course instantly have a heart attack and

31:56.720 --> 32:02.800
that's because we study metabolism from the level of human physiology and medicine.

32:02.800 --> 32:06.320
It's kind of like taking a beautiful telescope and looking through the wrong end and saying,

32:06.320 --> 32:10.040
it all seems so far away.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.720
So this is what a typical metabolic map looks like in one of the major databases.

32:13.720 --> 32:19.520
But even in this chaos, your eye is drawn to the order at the center of this circle.

32:19.520 --> 32:24.120
What I want to show you is that this circle is in fact the knot that ties the whole thing

32:24.120 --> 32:25.120
together.

32:25.120 --> 32:29.720
It does in the entire biosphere all living things and apparently has throughout all of

32:29.720 --> 32:32.840
history.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.440
So this is what the core looks like a little bit closer.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.360
It's called the citric acid cycle.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.640
It's a cycle of 11 simple molecules.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.120
The colored dots here are carbons.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.800
I don't label them.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.880
The smallest has only two carbons.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.160
You go around to as many as six carbons.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.400
That's citric acid.

32:50.400 --> 32:55.880
We were all, well some of us were taught in high school biology that this cycle is important.

32:55.880 --> 32:56.960
It's called the Krebs cycle.

32:56.960 --> 33:01.480
We were told we needed to get energy from fats and oils so that we can live.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.360
That's why it's important to us, but we're late and we're backward.

33:05.360 --> 33:11.800
The reason the citric acid cycle is important to everything, and this is stunning, all molecules

33:11.800 --> 33:16.440
that you use to make the entire biosphere originate in one of four or five compounds

33:16.440 --> 33:18.200
in this cycle.

33:18.200 --> 33:22.540
All the diversity that you see around you comes later, but the building is all done

33:22.540 --> 33:23.800
from these.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.440
Now I show them to us in the form of foods because we are not ecologically complete.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.920
So we know most of them in terms of the foods we need to eat to live that some plant or

33:32.920 --> 33:34.980
bacterium needs to make.

33:34.980 --> 33:39.380
So this little two carbon compound, this is vinegar, and it's the starting point through

33:39.380 --> 33:41.820
which all of the oils and fats are made.

33:41.820 --> 33:45.580
The three carbon compound here makes all of the sugars, which are structural as well as

33:45.580 --> 33:47.160
energy molecules.

33:47.160 --> 33:51.740
This one here makes the special vitamins that bind metals, and that's why they have bright

33:51.740 --> 33:54.620
colors, so chlorophyll and heme.

33:54.620 --> 33:58.340
There are four different ones that make amino acids that are part of proteins, and then

33:58.340 --> 34:03.380
from some of the amino acids we also make the nucleic acids, RNA and DNA.

34:03.380 --> 34:08.220
So that's how the major classes of molecules come off of this small simple core.

34:08.220 --> 34:13.260
So the first apparent problem with obtaining an origin of life, the problem of complexity,

34:13.260 --> 34:22.740
now doesn't seem so bad, but that's not the only problem we have to address.

34:22.740 --> 34:26.020
There's a classic view of life as a struggle for existence.

34:26.020 --> 34:30.340
The term was coined by the Victorian Reverend Thomas Malthus, who was worried about population

34:30.340 --> 34:33.620
and famines and wars.

34:33.620 --> 34:38.300
And this was a term that was adopted also by Darwin and was fundamental to why natural

34:38.300 --> 34:39.460
selection can work.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.900
You overproduce and then you cull.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.460
The same language permeates the sciences.

34:44.460 --> 34:49.260
We talk about capturing resources or harnessing sunlight energy.

34:49.260 --> 34:54.800
So the intuition is that things fall apart and that you're in the Sisyphean task of building

34:54.800 --> 34:57.220
up against the forces of decay.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.180
And in the oxygenic world, that's right.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.660
If I take organic carbon, I can put it in a furnace and it'll burn and it'll go back

35:02.660 --> 35:07.780
to carbon dioxide, which is where it started from.

35:07.780 --> 35:11.260
But in the world of vents, the rules are different.

35:11.260 --> 35:18.580
My colleague and friend Everett Shock has probably put this best, that instead of no

35:18.580 --> 35:22.900
such thing as a free lunch or a struggle for existence, the vent world is a free lunch

35:22.900 --> 35:25.020
you're paid to eat.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.220
I'll show you how.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.980
What I've done here is taken the citric acid cycle compounds.

35:29.980 --> 35:31.660
They're the 11 different dots.

35:31.660 --> 35:35.860
For a couple of them, I've drawn the molecules just so you can see where they go.

35:35.860 --> 35:41.060
And on this axis, I've showed how many H2, how many electrons we add per carbon to build

35:41.060 --> 35:42.220
the molecule.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.300
So the sugars are two H2s per carbon.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.980
The oils are three.

35:46.980 --> 35:52.540
And then on this axis, I've shown the energy that's used to make the molecule starting

35:52.540 --> 35:56.820
from hydrogen and CO2 because hydrogen is what the vent world provides.

35:56.820 --> 36:03.100
And actually what you see is this is a downhill run all the way to methane here at CH4, that's

36:03.100 --> 36:05.060
our greenhouse gas.

36:05.060 --> 36:11.660
So in the vent world, you are not building up complexity as a struggle against the release

36:11.660 --> 36:13.020
of energy.

36:13.020 --> 36:19.020
You're building up complexity because that's the path of least resistance to release energy.

36:19.020 --> 36:22.580
Now the reason that matters to the citric acid cycle I showed you before is that that's

36:22.580 --> 36:24.360
what drags the cycle around.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.580
You can think of it as an old fashioned water wheel, whereas the water flows over, it pulls

36:28.580 --> 36:30.460
the cycle around.

36:30.460 --> 36:31.760
This is the same picture.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.160
I'm not showing you the other clutter, the hydrogens and oxygens, but I show you the

36:35.160 --> 36:36.760
same molecules.

36:36.760 --> 36:42.640
And the redder a carbon atom is colored, the more oxygens it has bound to it, the bluer

36:42.640 --> 36:45.880
it's colored, the more hydrogens it has bound.

36:45.880 --> 36:52.160
So you're sliding down the hill as more of your atoms become blue and fewer of them red.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.840
This is the citric acid cycle in the same picture where I'm showing you each of the

36:55.840 --> 36:58.760
11 molecules with only the carbons colored.

36:58.760 --> 37:04.220
And what you can see, the cycle goes in this counterclockwise direction in the vent world.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.800
We run it backward the wrong way where it makes no sense.

37:07.800 --> 37:13.080
But in the vent world, red carbon, that's carbon dioxide, comes in and as it goes around

37:13.080 --> 37:18.120
it gets moved toward the interior of the molecule and electrons get added.

37:18.120 --> 37:25.840
So that process of adding electrons and using the available free energy, drags the cycle

37:25.840 --> 37:30.960
around in the directions that the organisms use, and then that becomes the starting material

37:30.960 --> 37:33.560
out of which they build the rest of biomass.

37:33.560 --> 37:41.320
I'll come back and show you this a little bit later in a slightly different form.

37:41.320 --> 37:48.000
So for now, the way the earth provides a battery and the way metabolism use it shows

37:48.000 --> 37:52.600
the essential continuity between geochemistry and biochemistry.

37:52.600 --> 37:57.400
That by itself would not be enough to judge whether the presence of life on earth is surprising

37:57.400 --> 37:58.640
or inevitable.

37:58.640 --> 38:02.620
To answer that question, we need to do something more.

38:02.620 --> 38:07.520
And that's what requires that we reconsider what we think the living state is and what

38:07.520 --> 38:12.200
the right kind of formal model for it is.

38:12.200 --> 38:16.400
I want to argue that the way to understand, the way that makes sense of the fact that

38:16.400 --> 38:21.840
life emerged on a lifeless earth and that it has persisted for almost four billion years

38:21.840 --> 38:26.280
since is the concept of breakdown or failure.

38:26.280 --> 38:31.360
So remember that we're trying to understand a pattern of motion.

38:31.360 --> 38:35.040
Breakdown creates patterns of motion at the same time as it destroys certain patterns

38:35.040 --> 38:36.960
of structure.

38:36.960 --> 38:40.400
So things don't only fall apart.

38:40.400 --> 38:46.720
Sometimes the events become ordered even as the structures are broken.

38:46.720 --> 38:52.640
And so we have the concept that the origin of life could be a kind of collapse.

38:52.640 --> 38:58.080
And once you have a collapse, the idea that when pushed hard enough, anything will give,

38:58.080 --> 39:01.480
that brings with it the notion of necessity.

39:01.480 --> 39:07.400
Because in the world of breakdowns, the things that persist are only the things that were

39:07.400 --> 39:13.200
the favored state or the necessary state to begin with.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.880
Now this is not an exotic idea.

39:14.880 --> 39:20.200
It turns out that it's around us all the time.

39:20.200 --> 39:26.280
The main thing you need in order to understand it is the idea of an energy flow channel.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.520
There are lots of energy flow channels in the natural world.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.520
Lightning is one.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.720
We create a plasma that's very, very, very different from the surrounding dry air, but

39:34.720 --> 39:36.760
it allows electricity to flow.

39:36.760 --> 39:41.520
We create all this organization of wall storms in a cyclone because that transports heat

39:41.520 --> 39:44.320
from the warm oceans to the upper atmosphere.

39:44.320 --> 39:49.040
And this is not the disordered pattern of just thunderstorms or uniformly mixed air.

39:49.040 --> 39:56.160
So these things are well understood in the physical sciences already.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.640
The thing that's important to create a channel and the reason not all things form channels

40:00.640 --> 40:03.040
is that there needs to be feedback.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.160
Because in all of these systems, the initial stress is diffuse.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.640
The clouds have a charge spread out over a great distance.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.280
Or the oceans are warm over an enormous volume.

40:12.280 --> 40:18.200
But the ice storms concentrate only in one area because that moves things more.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.920
So I'll illustrate for you dynamically with the simplest of all channels, which is just

40:21.920 --> 40:25.120
the propagation of a fracture.

40:25.120 --> 40:29.040
If you could see a fracture propagating at the atomic scale, you would see that it's

40:29.040 --> 40:34.340
a self-similar repeating sequence of events as bond after bond breaks.

40:34.340 --> 40:40.360
The reason this is striking is that in the original crystal, there's plenty of energy

40:40.360 --> 40:43.600
in the crystal as a whole to break the bonds.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.480
But the energy is too diffuse.

40:45.480 --> 40:49.360
And so by itself, it can't concentrate to rupture a bond.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.880
The thing that causes the fracture to propagate in an orderly way instead of happening at

40:53.880 --> 40:59.840
random everywhere is that the stress field in the surround, as it deforms, pulls the

40:59.840 --> 41:05.720
stress from the bulk back down to atomic diameters and concentrates it.

41:05.720 --> 41:09.320
This is what hydrothermal vents are doing for the Earth battery, because the battery

41:09.320 --> 41:12.640
is accumulating over the entire atmosphere and interior.

41:12.640 --> 41:17.120
But it's being focused at the regions where rock contacts water and the regions where

41:17.120 --> 41:20.600
the altered water remixes with seawater.

41:20.600 --> 41:25.200
Now I want to show you that this is actually what the citric acid cycle does within chemistry.

41:25.200 --> 41:29.600
It performs a second kind of concentration.

41:29.600 --> 41:35.160
So as the molecule goes around, it pulls in carbon, and then here it splits.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.320
And both parts go back into the cycle.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.800
So where you had one, you now have two.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.520
That's the mathematics of compound interest.

41:42.520 --> 41:47.320
And so you can exponentially grow and you concentrate material within the cycle.

41:47.320 --> 41:52.320
Also like compound interest on an endowment, you can pull molecules off of this to make

41:52.320 --> 41:58.640
your major classes of biological matter, but the material in the cycle is still available

41:58.640 --> 42:03.600
to serve as a kind of flypaper that continues to pull carbon in over and over again.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.440
So this is the second concentration.

42:06.440 --> 42:12.160
Now the thing, this leads to an important way of thinking about the nature of life.

42:12.160 --> 42:16.320
You could imagine that the optimization of this cycle was something carried out by evolution

42:16.320 --> 42:21.360
later, but I think there's actually a better way to view it.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.400
This cycle is self-amplifying.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.880
It works from the environmental sources of carbon.

42:25.880 --> 42:31.280
It works from the Earth's sources of electrons and everything in the biosphere is made from

42:31.280 --> 42:33.040
it.

42:33.040 --> 42:37.800
The biosphere is what you can make if these are the compounds you have.

42:37.800 --> 42:45.600
And so this is why it becomes the core that organizes the whole rest of metabolism.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.400
So does this give us a complete theory of origins?

42:48.400 --> 42:49.400
Not nearly.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.600
There's a lot of work to be done.

42:51.600 --> 42:58.080
There are many problems to be solved and maybe many generations, maybe centuries of work

42:58.080 --> 43:02.360
before we have a satisfactory theory the way we have a theory of matter, but it fundamentally

43:02.360 --> 43:05.840
changes the way we ask questions.

43:05.840 --> 43:09.520
When Darwin was trying to understand the origin of the world, even though he was a consummate

43:09.520 --> 43:14.280
ecologist, he emphasized organisms because that was where he could say something concrete

43:14.280 --> 43:17.000
about the action of selection.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.200
His problem was to understand the patterns of relation, the fact that some things are

43:21.200 --> 43:24.560
more similar to each other than they are to others.

43:24.560 --> 43:28.880
And that was what led him to the importance of the tree of descent, the idea that the

43:28.880 --> 43:35.120
degree of similarity could be understood in terms of how long ago you had a common ancestor.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.960
But organisms, as we said, are very complicated.

43:37.960 --> 43:42.360
And the tree of descent doesn't seem to do a very good job of explaining how you ever

43:42.360 --> 43:45.160
arrive at that level of complexity.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.280
This is the point that Jerry raised in the introduction, that what organisms are is

43:50.280 --> 43:54.200
both part of the living biosphere, but they're also individual, and those are two different

43:54.200 --> 43:55.960
things.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.400
Today we would separate the problems, and I would say we ask the same question the

43:59.400 --> 44:01.800
following way.

44:01.800 --> 44:07.160
We recognize that being an organism or being a virus or being a gene or being a cell in

44:07.160 --> 44:11.520
an organism is just one of many kinds of individuality.

44:11.520 --> 44:17.240
And these forms of individuality almost condense like dew from a kind of a background of chemical

44:17.240 --> 44:22.120
regularity, and that regularity is being carried by the ecosystem.

44:22.120 --> 44:27.480
But like dew, which doesn't condense everywhere, the forms of individuality condense where

44:27.480 --> 44:33.240
they have paths of least resistance laid down that make it easy.

44:33.240 --> 44:39.160
And so the important point about all of the concentrating mechanisms in organic chemistry,

44:39.160 --> 44:45.920
the cycles in metabolism, the Earth's battery, these define the paths of least resistance.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.440
So we can come finally back to the question of chance and necessity.

44:49.440 --> 44:54.360
There are two sort of classic pronouncements each made by a major and truly great scientist

44:54.360 --> 44:57.640
that reflect exactly opposite points of view.

44:57.640 --> 45:03.160
Jacques Monod worked on bacterial regulation and was one of the discoverers of how this

45:03.160 --> 45:04.560
works.

45:04.560 --> 45:11.120
His view from all of the complexity of genetics and genomic regulation was that life could

45:11.120 --> 45:16.080
be understood in terms of scientific principles, but there was no hope of predicting.

45:16.080 --> 45:20.640
He envisioned the trajectory of the biosphere through history as a kind of a random walk

45:20.640 --> 45:25.640
where even the major steps could not have been foreseen.

45:25.640 --> 45:30.320
Christian Dedeuve took exactly the opposite point of view in a way that's very subtle

45:30.320 --> 45:34.240
and I think it's missed by many people.

45:34.240 --> 45:39.280
Dedeuve recognized, of course, that the assembly of a modern cell would only be possible with

45:39.280 --> 45:44.760
selection because there are so many choices, they have to be selected at each range.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.800
But he went on to say something more delicate.

45:48.800 --> 45:56.560
He said even the problem of producing the choices that selection can act on is so complicated,

45:56.560 --> 46:01.760
it's very difficult to understand how that could happen in a process where everything

46:01.760 --> 46:03.920
is equally probable.

46:03.920 --> 46:09.000
And this was what led him to propose that the success of the evolutionary game, as he

46:09.000 --> 46:12.840
puts it, was written into the fabric of the universe.

46:12.840 --> 46:17.840
What I've wanted to show you in the earlier parts of this talk is where in chemistry and

46:17.840 --> 46:23.520
in the properties of our planet those choices were laid down.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.920
So I have many people that I need to thank for this.

46:25.920 --> 46:30.240
I absolutely want to thank Jerry not only for the privilege of giving you this talk,

46:30.240 --> 46:34.280
but for supporting my work and the work of my collaborators for more than a decade.

46:34.280 --> 46:40.000
I want to thank a friend, William Melton, who supported us through the last two years

46:40.000 --> 46:42.840
in which this book was brought to completion.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.360
And Jerry also supported me during that time.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.680
Of course the National Science Foundation for bringing the community together and the

46:49.680 --> 46:51.760
three places.

46:52.760 --> 46:58.760
Yeah, most importantly, Senefa Institute, that we're home for so many years.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
Yes, please.

47:15.760 --> 47:27.760
No, the oxygen is being left behind.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.120
I should stand where I'm expected.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
The oxygen is being left behind.

47:32.120 --> 47:36.760
So what you're doing is you're losing oceans, but you're only losing the hydrogen part of

47:36.760 --> 47:37.760
the oceans.

47:37.760 --> 47:38.760
Good?

47:38.760 --> 47:44.760
Yes, but are we also gaining anything from the solar wind?

47:44.760 --> 47:49.120
Some, but probably not a lot.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.120
We're not gaining water.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
We might...

47:52.120 --> 47:56.760
I don't know, it's a great question.

47:56.760 --> 48:01.480
I don't know what the rate of gain of hydrogen is from the solar wind, quantitatively.

48:01.480 --> 48:06.200
I know it's less than the rate of loss, but I don't know by an order of magnitude how

48:06.200 --> 48:07.200
much less.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.200
Thank you.

48:08.200 --> 48:09.200
Good.

48:10.200 --> 48:16.200
In the back, yes, please.

48:16.200 --> 48:24.200
So you're likely familiar with the debates on whether viruses are considered alive or

48:24.200 --> 48:25.200
not.

48:25.200 --> 48:31.280
I imagine, at least I've heard of cases where a virus can be as simple as just a replicating

48:31.280 --> 48:38.960
molecule like RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein code, not doing anything like metabolism.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.720
So do you think that means it is not alive?

48:42.720 --> 48:43.720
Great.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.160
Yeah, lovely question.

48:47.160 --> 48:51.720
I'm going to answer that by saying that the whole question turns out to use a form of

48:51.720 --> 48:56.440
English that's not meaningful in the following sense.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.960
So here's a little bit of logical semantics.

48:59.960 --> 49:03.800
Work with me and tell me if this works for you.

49:03.800 --> 49:11.760
If I use the term living thing, a thing is a noun, living is a predicate, right?

49:11.760 --> 49:16.040
What that means is I imagine that I can take the whole world of things which are fundamental

49:16.040 --> 49:21.040
and I can divide them into two sets, the living ones and the non-living ones.

49:21.040 --> 49:28.200
But if things are not fundamental and if life is not a property inherent in things, then

49:28.200 --> 49:31.360
the whole notion living thing is a set of words.

49:31.360 --> 49:35.680
They satisfy the rules of syntax, but it's not clear they actually mean anything.

49:35.680 --> 49:41.320
So what happens if the property of being alive is defined by participating in the order of

49:41.320 --> 49:46.400
the biosphere, all the things that build it up, all those that break it down, and what

49:46.400 --> 49:51.800
we're seeing in cells and viruses is a form of individuality.

49:51.800 --> 49:58.360
Now I say is a virus one of the forms of individuality in its life cycle when it's just RNA and

49:58.360 --> 49:59.360
a code?

49:59.360 --> 50:00.360
Absolutely.

50:00.360 --> 50:05.120
And we can talk scientifically about what's special about that form, what makes it different

50:05.120 --> 50:10.960
from a cell, but I don't ever ask the question is the virus alive or not because the virus

50:10.960 --> 50:15.920
is part of the biosphere and it partakes of the character of the living state from the

50:15.920 --> 50:18.840
biosphere as a whole.

50:18.840 --> 50:23.960
So that's a little bit heavy as a way to answer a very good question, but I think it's the

50:23.960 --> 50:32.840
answer that will stand the test of time.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.840
I'll come right back to you.

50:35.840 --> 50:36.840
Yes.

50:36.840 --> 50:41.560
I've read there are some, you know, the big bang at the beginning of that kind of life

50:41.560 --> 50:47.200
that what preceded it was a consciousness or the idea for the universe to grow.

50:47.200 --> 50:53.720
So could you apply that to what you're talking about here that there was a consciousness that

50:53.720 --> 51:00.120
helps to move this or create the origins of life and create, you know, a place for that

51:00.120 --> 51:03.000
life to grow?

51:03.000 --> 51:09.320
That's not a language I have the ability to use in any comfortable way.

51:09.320 --> 51:14.680
In the, no, in a very particular sense, right?

51:14.680 --> 51:20.600
I could say that once a snowflake is formed, like commonplace processes, we can talk about

51:20.600 --> 51:25.280
aspects of the pattern that makes one snowflake different from another.

51:25.280 --> 51:30.840
And in a similar sense, I can go through the emergence of life on a planet and then organisms

51:30.840 --> 51:36.240
and then nervous systems and somewhere late, late, late, I have these incredibly complicated

51:36.240 --> 51:39.560
patterns that we just barely understand.

51:39.560 --> 51:45.720
And for me, it's natural to look for consciousness as a character of patterns at that late level.

51:45.720 --> 51:51.720
But in the same sense as I would not ask whether something about the snowflake was before the

51:51.720 --> 51:56.680
properties of water because it seems to be at the wrong end, I'm not able to use a language

51:56.680 --> 52:01.160
that puts consciousness at the low level.

52:01.160 --> 52:05.720
As a form of non-physical energy, we talk a lot about physical energies, but we don't

52:05.720 --> 52:10.920
talk about non-physical energies and consciousness could be considered, if it's thought of that

52:10.920 --> 52:15.280
way, then it predates everything, doesn't come after the snowflake, comes before the

52:15.280 --> 52:16.280
snowflake.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
No, you know.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.520
Anyway, I just wonder if these kind of, the sciences don't all kind of talk with each

52:21.520 --> 52:22.520
other.

52:22.520 --> 52:26.840
And I think there's some ways to where they can, where there is interdisciplinary study

52:26.840 --> 52:27.840
there.

52:27.840 --> 52:28.840
I'm just questioning.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.320
I think it's wonderful that you ask.

52:30.320 --> 52:34.160
I think it's a right conversation to have.

52:34.160 --> 52:40.040
I think it's very hard to talk and to listen both.

52:40.040 --> 52:45.440
And I will admit that my view is pretty much a mechanics view of a great many things, and

52:45.440 --> 52:51.160
perhaps that limits the set of things I can say.

52:51.160 --> 53:00.000
Well, I think you have largely answered the question I was going to ask.

53:00.000 --> 53:07.440
And it is, indeed, the idea, I understand how you followed this path of metabolism of

53:07.440 --> 53:13.320
energy into living forms as a necessity and how it comes to be.

53:13.320 --> 53:21.000
And that hypothesis is new to me, but I'm missing the same thing, the difference between

53:21.000 --> 53:29.280
the rock and organic and inorganic carbon and carbon, whether or not what we've always

53:29.280 --> 53:34.920
called the life cycle or the carbon cycle, the things you learn in chemistry.

53:34.920 --> 53:40.320
I was at the particular properties that tell us whether or not the energy is living or

53:40.320 --> 53:45.200
non-living in that whole origin and metabolism.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.560
Have you given any thought to that?

53:47.560 --> 53:51.600
I think you've already answered it in the last thing you said, but what are your own

53:51.600 --> 53:52.600
thoughts about that?

53:52.600 --> 53:58.000
And do you have any idea of using the scientific method to try to discern that?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Good.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.800
So that has some words in it that I can't address because I know how to use them carefully.

54:05.800 --> 54:12.920
The notion of energy is one that we have struggled tremendously to get clear for the last 250

54:12.920 --> 54:20.840
years, and one of the great triumphs, I think, of a unification in science is that energy

54:20.840 --> 54:27.720
is energy, and so it's precisely because the role of energy in the non-living world

54:27.720 --> 54:32.880
and in the living world is the same role that we can understand how the living world

54:32.880 --> 54:35.560
embeds in the non-living world.

54:35.560 --> 54:40.400
And so that's not a place where I think it's correct to look for differences.

54:40.400 --> 54:48.880
I think humans are great at when they haven't seen something, imagining something different

54:48.880 --> 54:50.720
from the truth.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.920
Paths of least resistance and failure modes are incredibly complicated, and we've only

54:54.920 --> 54:56.440
figured out a few of them.

54:56.440 --> 55:00.600
I think there's huge scientific mileage in learning how to do that in the dominates of

55:00.600 --> 55:03.680
dynamics and of chemistry, where we're just babies.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.720
We've only begun to form science in those domains.

55:15.920 --> 55:22.680
Does every hydrothermal vent have life associated with it?

55:22.680 --> 55:26.440
Are the chemistries the same across all those different vents?

55:26.440 --> 55:31.800
So they've all been created de novo, but all been the same.

55:31.800 --> 55:32.800
Superb question.

55:32.800 --> 55:37.640
Yes, no, and no.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.000
No.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.200
If I could give you an hour-long talk on only this one subject in a university department,

55:45.200 --> 55:47.720
the things I would tell you.

55:47.720 --> 55:54.080
So first thing to realize, there is no place we have ever drilled, dived, or flown in the

55:54.080 --> 55:56.840
earth that we have not found life.

55:56.840 --> 56:00.360
Which is one of the reasons it's so hard to understand origin, because everything has

56:00.360 --> 56:02.880
been colonized by somebody modern.

56:02.880 --> 56:08.400
So not only does every vent have life in it, every mineshaft hole has life in it, everything

56:08.400 --> 56:12.920
that gets blown up from the subsurface in a volcano winds up having life in it.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.680
So there's life everywhere.

56:14.680 --> 56:21.800
There is certainly life that is uniquely hosted by the energy at vents, but your next question

56:21.800 --> 56:25.320
is wonderfully perceptive, because it is not all the same.

56:25.320 --> 56:30.120
The vent chemistry is not all the same, and the life that they host tracks that vent chemistry

56:30.120 --> 56:31.800
quite in detail.

56:31.800 --> 56:34.680
So the vents that I showed you are the charismatic ones.

56:34.680 --> 56:38.400
Let me give you two-line thing about geology.

56:38.400 --> 56:46.280
I told you that the deep rock in the earth has mostly this iron 2 plus character to it.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.600
When it comes up it gets oxidized.

56:48.600 --> 56:52.800
That's the process of converting what's called mantle into crust.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.960
Normally you don't see mantle on the surface, you only see crust on the surface, and the

56:56.960 --> 57:02.600
magmas that make crust, when they interact with water, they create these black smokers

57:02.600 --> 57:07.240
that are full of metals and they have a very acidic pH 2 or 3.

57:07.240 --> 57:11.920
In rare cases, you can actually get some of the material that's supposed to be protected

57:11.920 --> 57:14.600
down below exposed on the surface.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.720
It can be stripped off by faulting.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.480
The picture I showed you of the lithosphere is Oman.

57:19.480 --> 57:23.080
It's a place where continent formation actually causes it to be shoved up on the surface of

57:23.080 --> 57:24.680
dry land.

57:24.680 --> 57:32.280
In those areas, it turns out you do not produce acidic vents, you produce alkaline vents, and

57:32.280 --> 57:34.920
you produce enormous amounts of hydrogen.

57:34.920 --> 57:38.880
If I showed you the undersea version of those, they do not have black smoke because without

57:38.880 --> 57:43.760
acid they don't dissolve metals, they don't dissolve sulfide, instead they're white and

57:43.760 --> 57:47.480
shimmery and they produce carbonate chimneys in today's oceans.

57:47.480 --> 57:52.400
If you looked at those, you would not find tube worms, you would not find crabs or snails

57:52.400 --> 57:54.440
or clams or shrimp.

57:54.440 --> 57:58.680
You would find only bacteria and archaea, so it would be a very dull picture compared

57:58.680 --> 58:04.160
to the one I showed you, but it's enormously important because it turns out I think the

58:04.160 --> 58:09.160
reason, and there are so many things I didn't tell you about even the black smoker world,

58:09.160 --> 58:13.320
in spite of the fact that they live on a tiny energy budget far from the sun, those tube

58:13.320 --> 58:19.320
worms are actually the fastest grown organisms known, that's the fastest production of biomass

58:19.320 --> 58:24.560
of any known system, and I think the reason for that is that we need metals to live and

58:24.560 --> 58:27.480
that's what those vents are producing in profusion.

58:27.480 --> 58:32.120
Without the metals, you go into a much sort of more miserly mode of life where only the

58:32.160 --> 58:37.160
most conservative bacteria and archaea can make it, but thank you.

58:37.160 --> 58:43.160
Great, and we have a couple people here on the side too.

58:43.160 --> 58:50.160
What do you think of the theory of panspermia as the cause of life and could you define

58:51.360 --> 58:52.360
it for the audience?

58:52.360 --> 58:59.360
Yes, with pleasure, good, so panspermia was the idea that in the non-polemical form,

59:03.080 --> 59:06.960
life may not have originated on earth, it may have originated somewhere else and been

59:06.960 --> 59:10.240
transported to earth.

59:10.240 --> 59:15.920
Now the polemical form, it's really hard to understand how life originated on earth and

59:15.920 --> 59:20.000
we only had four and a half billion years to do it.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.320
The universe is 13 billion years old, so that's more than a factor of two, maybe if we had

59:24.320 --> 59:27.600
the whole universe we'd have more time.

59:27.600 --> 59:31.520
Now that was the old fashioned version, sort of the 1970s version.

59:31.520 --> 59:35.440
There are more modern and more sophisticated versions where people say that some of the

59:35.440 --> 59:40.680
things about the electron battery that I showed you are actually stronger on Mars than they

59:40.680 --> 59:46.520
are on earth and some of the properties of water may have been easier early on.

59:46.520 --> 59:50.760
Those are very technical arguments and I don't know how to evaluate them.

59:50.760 --> 59:56.960
I consider those to be the most plausible arguments that there could be important chemistry

59:56.960 --> 01:00:02.120
relevant to the origin of life that could be on a planet other than our own where the

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.240
life evolved to some significant degree of complexity and was then transported here.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.880
For my own preference, I regard those with suspicion because I think when we find something

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.960
difficult, we probably say, oh that must mean it's impossible and our understanding is too

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.960
primitive to draw a conclusion like that at this point.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.340
We understand how hard it is to make life on earth precisely because we understand the

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:31.100
chemistry of life on earth so well and so is it sensible to go someplace where we understand

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:36.500
the chemistry less well where we have to rely on transport through space to deliver but

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.620
then here's the most important thing.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:43.620
If you think my argument has any validity that we should look at life as a breakdown process

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.340
so that only the only things that persist are the things that were the native state anyway

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:51.180
and you just had to get to them.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.020
If life on earth was not the native state to get into and it was a more native state

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.780
somewhere else then why would it have been a robust thing to build it there and transport

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.900
it here?

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.500
Why would it have survived here for four billion years without interruption if it was not a

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.940
thing that would natively form here?

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.020
Now that's not strong enough to be a science argument and I understand its weakness but

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.020
that direction is the drift of my not worrying a lot about penspermia.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.020
Hi.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:28.940
Do you agree to the theories of George Wald who said that life came from an electric

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:34.500
strike like lightning that hit the elements, the earth's primordial atmosphere and life

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500
evolved from that.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.900
There was experiments where amino acids evolved into proteins in life form.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.940
Do you agree with those theories?

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:51.500
I would not repeat them in the way their original investigators believed them to be true.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.340
Again to speak a little bit carefully.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.420
Lightning strikes turn out to matter on earth because they do something very difficult.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.700
They take N2 which is a very strong molecule and they break it up into the forms of nitrogen

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.660
that wind up being chemically interesting.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:11.740
That may matter but I think it only matters at the scale of the whole planetary dynamic.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.740
The chemistry of the atmosphere is extremely different from the chemistry of life.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.740
You remember I said that chemistry in water is very restrictive and there are a lot of

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.140
things that you can't do with it.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.300
The chemistry of carbon and of metals in the deep subsurface is incredibly similar to our

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.780
biochemistry.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.380
So much so that you can look at enzymes that use metals and they use them as if they had

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:38.260
just taken a mineral center and learned how to harness it for certain types of jobs.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.580
Those things were not known when George Wald was writing these things and I think a lot

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.500
of the opinions you're talking about come more from Stanley Miller and the followers

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.900
of Stanley Miller after 1953.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:54.900
His experiments were groundbreaking but there are two things, two ways you can interpret

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.900
them.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.860
One you could suppose that those experiments were good models for the origin of life.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.940
That I think doesn't hold up so well now though there are still many people who would disagree

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.420
with me.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.900
But what you could say instead is if chemistry in the atmosphere that's so different from

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:16.420
biochemistry led to amino acids many of which are the same as those in biochemistry what

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:22.100
should we be learning about the paths of least resistance in organic chemistry that can cause

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:27.260
very different starting points to collapse into a few paths and then kind of like trees

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.820
growing along the waterways in the desert.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:34.660
Does biochemistry use the chemicals it does because it's following those paths of least

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:41.140
resistance even if we learned about them in the wrong environment?

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.780
And there's somebody who really wants to ask another question and I don't want to cut

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.780
them off.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.180
Okay, so you will be the last one.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.180
You've had your hand up three or four times.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:04:00.260
No, I'm almost embarrassed to stand up considering the quality of all the questions here but as

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:05.180
a practical matter we are so familiar with the term climate change and what's happening

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.420
in climate change.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:13.160
Is mankind doing anything relative to climate change that would affect your theories in

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:19.020
any way shape or form or is they two completely different subjects?

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:24.100
I'm so glad that you got a chance to ask because it would have been a shame not to hear.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:29.740
I don't think that the things that people are doing affect the theories but I would

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.660
like this work to affect the things that people do.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.660
So this was the point that Jerry opened with.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:43.380
In biology too much we have put ecosystem sensibility kind of in the periphery and we

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:49.220
focused on organisms and when we interact with a natural world whether we do it industrially

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:54.900
or agronomically we try to engineer organisms and we try to influence systems with a few

01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:00.780
components as if we were building a watch or a bridge and routinely it winds up putting

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:06.900
us in places where we don't want to be or where we shouldn't want to be.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:17.020
If biology can anchor ecology more centrally and start to understand the regression of ecosystems

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:22.420
towards certain patterns that it's very hard to pull them away from maybe biology can help

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.460
us head off misunderstandings in the world of application and make us a little bit more

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:32.620
intelligent or in some cases a little bit more precautionary about what we do.

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:38.660
Biology as a science is sound but biology as a science is not always proactive enough

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.620
to anticipate the mistakes people are going to make.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:47.180
A more ecological biology may prime us to be a little bit better at second guessing the

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.620
things that can go wrong and trying to be careful ahead of time.
