1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Good afternoon everyone. If you could take your seats. I'm Elliot Gerson and it is my

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,680
great privilege to introduce the next session. It is really, in a sense, central to the theme

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,120
of many of the things that you've been hearing about this week, the world on fire, populism,

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,080
the rise of authoritarianism, and basically the whole mess in the world that we've been

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,320
talking about through one prism or another over the last few days and we will continue

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,440
to. And we are going to have someone address the root causes of that in a way that no one

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,280
else could and he is someone who certainly needs no introduction and I don't want to

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,000
take time away from him and after his remarks you'll all have an opportunity to ask questions.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,480
But I will, given the fact that it is the 20th anniversary of the Ideas Festival, say something

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,800
about our guest who you know all about his distinctions. You read him, you follow him,

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,880
you watch him. He also has a long history with the Institute. He co-founded and the

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,880
chairs weave the social fabric project. But more significantly, although it's pretty

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,040
wonderful, in the annals of the Ideas Festival I can now say to you officially, because I

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,200
went back to our archives and confirmed this, that no one has spoken at the Ideas Festival

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,040
more than David Brooks. And appropriately. David, I think one reason when we created

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,640
this, we had no idea if it would survive more than 2005. One reason it was so successful

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,840
was David Brooks. And then a couple years after that he came and he has been here every

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,120
year, every year since. There is no one spoken as often. A couple of other things that make

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,880
him an exception here, an entirely deserved exception. One is that early in this process

20
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,360
of the Ideas Festival, Guinea and I decided that we would have a rule to make sure we

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,200
keep things fresh and people would come back for new things every year. We had a rule that

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,440
no one would speak more than three consecutive years. But of course we had to have the David

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,000
Brooks exception and we do. And the other thing that this is an example of an exception

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,160
of is that we decided at the very beginning that the format we would use in almost all

25
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,760
instances is conversation and dialogue. Either an interview or a moderated panel. And that

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
we were not going to have lectures as one often has at other kinds of conferences and

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,400
events. But then again, given the wisdom, insight and popularity of this man, we had

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,280
to make a second David Brooks exception, which was to allow him to have these kinds of formats

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,440
with regularity. So without any further ado, it's my great pleasure and privilege to bring

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,640
up David Brooks.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,640
I should correct, Elliot. I haven't actually spoken more than anybody else. It just seems

32
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,640
that way. I read my first book for book on tape and the sound engineer told me a story

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,480
when you read your book for audio, you realize how boring your book is and how often you

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,600
repeat yourselves. But the sound engineer told me the story that there was a novelist who

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,960
was reading a 700 page novel. And he's in the middle of it and the sound engineer looks

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,280
in and the novelist is weeping. And so the engineer says, there's something I can do.

37
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,880
And the novelist says, don't I ever shut up? And so that's me at Aspen. Now every other

38
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,920
talk I've given here has been about how to live a better life, how to improve your life.

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,640
This one is not because of the global situation. I thought I should rise to the occasion and

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,120
try to diagnose the whole global situation. But I felt guilty about that that if I don't

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,360
give you some practical life tips, your lives will fall apart over the next year before

42
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,960
I can give my next talk. So in the first few minutes, I'm going to give you some actual

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,880
life hacks, which I got from the internet or the Bible, one of the two. And so here

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,960
are a few life hacks. These are practical life hacks. Then I'll get to politics. When

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,960
you have 90% of a large project finish, finishing up the final details will take another 90%.

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks. Getting cheated occasionally

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,240
is a small price to pay for trusting the best in everyone. Because when you trust the best

48
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,880
in others, they will treat you the best. Purchase a tourist guidebook to your hometown.

49
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,720
You'll learn a lot playing tourist once a year. The thing that made you weird as a kid

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,720
will make you outstanding as an adult. It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse.

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Just because it's not your fault doesn't mean it's not your responsibility. If you think

52
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,240
you saw a mouse, you did. And if you saw one, there are others. If you can't make up your

53
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,000
mind between two options, flip a coin. But don't go by how the coin comes up. Go by your

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,560
emotional reaction to how the coin went up. Take photos of your parents every day. That's

55
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,760
how you'll want to remember them. If you meet a jerk once a month, you've met a jerk. If

56
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,000
you meet a jerk every day, you're the jerk. Don't ever look at a recent photo of your

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,880
first great love. And this one is from Warren Buffet. You can always tell someone to go

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
to hell tomorrow, which is good. When you're mad at them, you can tell them to go to hell

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,480
tomorrow, way today. So that's my life-altering advice for you cramped into about 90 seconds.

60
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Now we turn to politics. Now, I got my political start when I was five. My parents were somewhat

61
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,040
left-wing. We lived in New York, and they took me to a place where hippies would go called

62
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,920
a be-in. And a be-in was where hippies would go to show how little they cared about money

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,360
and material things. And one of the ways they showed this was they set a garbage can on

64
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,860
fire, threw their wallets into it, just to show we don't care about money. I'm five

65
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,680
years old. I see a $5 bill on fire in the garbage can. I break from the crowd, reach

66
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,800
into the fire, grab the money, and run away. And that was sort of my first step over to

67
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,640
the right. And so I veered right, and then I veered left. But the main thing I am, like

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,000
all of us probably in this room, is I believe in liberal democracy. And I was a foreign

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,080
correspondent in the 1990s at the High Water Mark of liberal democracy. I was in the Soviet

70
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Union, if you remember, in the final days of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin was the

71
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,360
democratically elected president of Russia, and this old Soviet apparatus staged a coup.

72
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,120
And they had tanks rolling through the town, and Yeltsin, if you recall, stood on a tank

73
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,000
in front of the Russian White House, the parliament building, and said, I dare you,

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,200
shoot me. And all the democratic activists surrounded him to offer sort of a buffer.

75
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,840
And I was there, and I found a woman who was handing out sandwiches to the democratic protesters.

76
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,200
And her name was Valentina Kossieva, and she was 93. And so I asked her to tell her

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,560
me her life story, and she told me that she'd grown up in the Palace of the Tsar before

78
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,440
the revolution. Just after the revolution, she'd been lined up for a firing squad because

79
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,800
she was on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution. Her mother saved her life. She got married.

80
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,920
Her husband was disappeared in the 1930s, purged and sent to the Siberia and never to return.

81
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,400
Her two boys were killed in the Battle of Stalingrad by the Nazis. One of her sons was

82
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,560
rifle-butted to death. And then she married again. Her second husband also was sent away

83
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,080
to the Gulag, and she never saw him again. And then in the 1950s, under Khrushchev, she

84
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,080
was part of the Kalmyk people, which is a Muslim people, and they were sent off to exile.

85
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,840
And so my brilliant interviewing techniques when she's telling me this story is, and then

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,480
what happened? And then what happened? And basically every bad thing that happened in

87
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Soviet history happened to her. And they were so moving to be talking to her at age 93,

88
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,840
asking out sandwiches at what we thought would be the rise of Democratic Russia. And

89
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,360
it didn't turn out that way, obviously. And I covered in those days the end of apartheid.

90
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,600
I covered the Oslo peace process. A participant is in the room. And I covered the reunification

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,680
of Germany. I covered nothing but good news for five years. History has since taken a

92
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,120
dark turn. And the interesting thing about the dark turn it has taken, especially this

93
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,080
year, is that it's happening all around the world. I was raised with the idea that we

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Americans are outliers. We're more individualistic, we're more mobile, we're just outliers compared

95
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,680
to most other countries in the world. That is not true anymore. The Ipsos organization,

96
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,880
which is a British firm, asked people in 28 countries about certain attitudes. And we

97
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,600
are absolutely typical of the world now. Our pessimism is typical. 59 percent of Americans

98
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,800
say they believe our country is in decline. That's compared to 58 percent of people around

99
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,120
the world. 60 percent of Americans agree with a statement that the system is broken, compared

100
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,920
to 61 percent worldwide. Our hostility to elites is absolutely typical. 69 percent of

101
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,040
Americans think that the political and economic elite don't care about hardworking people

102
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,920
compared to 67 percent worldwide. 63 percent of Americans agree that experts in this country

103
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
don't know what they're talking about compared to 62 percent worldwide. We're just typical.

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,360
Even our authoritarianism is typical. 66 percent of Americans say the country needs a strong

105
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,080
leader to take it back from the rich and the powerful compared to 63 percent worldwide.

106
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,920
40 percent of Americans, we need a strong leader who will break the rules compared to

107
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,920
41 percent worldwide. So there are two things to take from this. The first is that we're

108
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,680
typical. We're no longer extraordinary. We're a typical country with typical beliefs. And

109
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,400
the second is that all around the world in all these 28 countries measured there's an

110
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:32,000
incredible hostility to the system and infertile landscape for right wing populism. And if

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,840
you look around elections of the world, it's a big election year, you see right wing populists

112
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,280
thriving in place after place. So Geert Wilders, the right wing populist in the Netherlands,

113
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,840
party rose to power in the European elections. The German AFD, very far right group, surged

114
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,080
in France. The Marine Le Pen party surged, causing the whole French political system

115
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,560
to go into meltdown. You look at Indonesia, you look around Latin America. Right wing

116
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,040
populists are surging all around the country. And of course, here at home, Donald Trump,

117
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,520
the economist says it's about two thirds likely that Donald Trump will be a reelected president.

118
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,320
That's typical of what's happening all around the world. And so to me, it's a mistake. We're

119
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,480
going to watch the debate tonight, but it's a mistake to see the U.S. election in isolation

120
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,200
from these global trends. And if Trump ends up winning, it'll be because there's just this

121
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:33,200
global tide in country after country after country. And so what's going on? Why has this

122
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,080
happened? Why is it happening all around the world all at once? Now, there are certain

123
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,800
obvious things we could say. People are reacting against globalization. There have been policy

124
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,440
failures, the financial crisis, Afghanistan, Iraq. But these policy failures are not all

125
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,640
around the world, and yet right wing populism is all around the world. Something deeper

126
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,640
is going on. And I think it's some sort of global spiritual relational and moral crisis.

127
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,680
And it shows up in the deepest essences of our societies. So the first thing is, and

128
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,200
I'll just take U.S. statistics, we've just gotten a lot sadder as a society, rising

129
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,640
suicide rates, rising mental health problems. The number of people who say they have no

130
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,440
close personal friends is up by four folds since 2000. The number of teenagers who say

131
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,000
they are persistently hopeless and despondent is 45%. The number of people not in a romantic

132
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,280
relationship is up by a third since 2000. The number of people who rate themselves in

133
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,680
the lowest happiness category is up by 50% since 2000. So we've just become a lot sadder

134
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,840
as a society. And when you get sadder, you get meaner. I give you all these stats statistics.

135
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,200
I can give you a bunch of mean statistics, gun violence, hate crimes. The one that gets

136
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,440
to me, it used to be two thirds of Americans give to charity, now fewer than half of Americans

137
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,680
give to charity. We've just become sadder and meaner. And that's deep in the fabric

138
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,920
of society. We've also gotten a lot more pessimistic. And some of that is the media's fault. We've

139
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,440
determined that we can get your eyeballs if we create headlines that generate fear and

140
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,520
anger. And so the number of headlines that generate fear and anger is up by about 200%

141
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,520
over the last 15 years. But it's not only the media. Some researchers took a look at

142
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,800
sort of global conversation in print starting in 1850 up till today. And they measured how

143
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,000
many of the books, magazine articles, newspaper articles, whatever, how many of them were positive

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and how many were negative. And from 1850 to about 2008, most of this stuff was positive.

145
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,560
There were dips during the Great Depression, which you'd expect. And there were increases

146
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,240
in the 1990s when we had prosperity. But basically, we're a pretty happy country. And then starting

147
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,240
in the financial crisis, but ever since, the negativity of American culture has just collapsed.

148
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,320
So we have a more negative public culture than we did in the Great Depression, than

149
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,680
during World War II, than during World War I, than any of the crises of the past 150

150
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,480
years. We just are an incredibly pessimistic country. And if you've been asked high school

151
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,480
students, the share of high school students who say it's hard to have hope for my life

152
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,480
has been surging. And so this negativity has a political valence. On the right, it manifests

153
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,640
as catastrophism. And so I interview a lot of Trump people. And the general theme you

154
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,280
hear over and over and over again is this country is on the verge of total destruction.

155
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,200
It's just a catastrophizing mentality. On the left, it shows up in the form of mental

156
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,560
health problems and depression. And so 34% of conservatives say they report feeling in

157
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,320
poor mental health at least half the time, 34% of conservatives. But 57% of progressive

158
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,160
young people say they report feeling negative mental health. Just higher rates of mental

159
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,000
health problems, higher rates of neuroticism. And it's very gendered. 41% of liberal males

160
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,080
say they have poor mental health compared to 60% of liberal females. It's not clear

161
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,840
to me why this is happening, but you see the mental health crisis feeding into our politics.

162
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,040
And so my underlying point is that the global crisis of populism and the rise of authoritarianism

163
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,720
is not just about policy and politics. We're undergoing a global spiritual recession. And

164
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,400
a lot of people are trying to use politics as a form of social therapy. Remember Ryan

165
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,720
Streeter is a researcher formerly at the American Enterprise Institute. He discovered

166
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,000
that people who call themselves lonely are seven times more likely than others to be

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,960
active in politics. So there's a lot of lonely people dominating our political activism.

168
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,880
In a healthy society, we have what you call the politics of redistribution. We have big

169
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,080
arguments, but there are arguments about how high taxes should be or where spending

170
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,920
should go. And that's in a healthy society. We don't have that kind of politics anymore.

171
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,760
We have the politics of recognition. People are going into politics in order to feel good

172
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,080
about themselves and in order to make the other side feel shamed. They're going out

173
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:16,480
for a sense of purpose and meaning. And so people are using politics to fill a hole in

174
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,160
their own soul, to be affirmed and to get retribution on the people they dislike. Politics

175
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,040
is a seductive form of social therapy because it seems to solve your spiritual and psychological

176
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,280
problems. It gives you the illusion that there's a war of good and evil and you're on the side

177
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,240
of good. It gives you a moral landscape so you have some meaning in your life. It gives

178
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,680
people a sense of belonging. If you're lonely, suddenly you're part of team red or team blue.

179
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,560
It gives people a sense of righteousness. That you don't have to sit with a widow or

180
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,200
feed the poor, but if you get indignant in front of the TV set, you feel you're doing

181
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,040
something right for the cause. And it gives people a sense of purpose, a sense that somehow

182
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,280
they're contributing to something larger than themselves. The problem is if you're asking

183
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,120
politics to fill a hole in your soul, to solve your psychological, relational and moral problems,

184
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,840
you're asking more of politics than it can give you. Because you don't really have community.

185
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,480
You're not working with others. You're just hating the same people. You don't really have

186
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,700
moral action. You're just indignant in front of the TV set. There's not really a morally

187
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,080
comprehensible landscape. It's not like one side has the monopoly on virtue and the other

188
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,720
side is monopoly on vice. And so when you try to use politics to fill the hole in your

189
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,160
soul, you're seeking to get out of the sense of anxiety, alienation, depression, but you're

190
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,720
simply winding up in a state of moral war. And it makes everybody mean and brutal and

191
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:53,220
makes all the problems worse. So I've tried to describe a kind of unpleasant America and

192
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,360
an unpleasant world, a negative mood. What's the cause? What are the deep roots of the

193
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,640
negative mood that I think is leading to populism and leading to authoritarianism? Well, I'll

194
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,280
start with some child psychology. There was a guy named John Bolsby many, many years ago who said

195
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,320
one of my favorite sayings about life in general. And the saying is, all of life is a series of

196
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,000
daring explorations from a secure base. All of life is a series of daring explorations from a

197
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,160
secure base. And he's a child psychologist, so he meant you need a strong family, a strong home,

198
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:38,840
and then you can be daring having a daring life. So do we have that in the world today? Do people

199
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,400
have a secure base? Do they have the opportunity to do daring explorations? And I think both those

200
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,000
things are in decline. So what is a secure base? A secure base in Bolsby's terms was family. And

201
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,200
family is not something you choose. Family is something that we're bred into. It's deep in our

202
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,480
soul. People are not transformed by institutions to which they are lightly attached. We're attached

203
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,000
to this specific family, this specific sacred piece of land, this specific country, this specific

204
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,560
philosophy or faith. These are things that we don't choose often, but they are deeply woven into

205
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,720
the fabric of our identity of who we are. And they give us a secure psychological base. When we

206
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,840
get married, it's not a contract. We're not doing it because it's in our self-interest. We're doing

207
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,440
it because we're willing to make a lifelong commitment, hopefully, to another human being.

208
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,080
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who was the head rabbi in Britain until he died recently, explained the

209
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,280
difference between a contract and a covenant. He wrote, a contract is about interests. A covenant

210
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,680
is about identity. It is about you and me coming together to form an us. That is why contracts

211
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,680
benefit. A contract will benefit a person, but a covenant will transform a person. And specifically,

212
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:05,840
it is these attachments often, for most of us, to these deep things that are woven into our soul.

213
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,400
First, the family. Second, the sacred place, loyalty to America, loyalty to your town, loyalty to

214
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,440
your country. And third, is a sense of a moral order. Now, people who are religious have a sense

215
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,720
that there is a coherent moral order that is not dependent on our choices. And you don't have to

216
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,240
be religious to believe that. That there is a sense that the world is morally coherent and you

217
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,640
can build your life around a sense that there is such a thing as right and wrong. Civil rights

218
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,120
movement. Based on the idea that, as Lincoln said, if slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.

219
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,120
If segregation is not wrong, nothing is wrong. There is a coherent moral order woven into the

220
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:57,520
fabric of human life. George Marsden is a historian who wrote, what gave such widely compelling force

221
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,000
to King's leadership and oratory was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the

222
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,400
universe. And so it's very hard to feel existentially safe if everything's up for grabs. If right

223
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,800
and wrong are up for grabs. If your family are up for grabs. If your country is up for grabs. It's

224
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,840
hard to feel secure. Now, liberalism, democratic liberalism, which I revere, is based on individual

225
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,440
choice. It's based on the idea that we respect human dignity and we respect our choices. But

226
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,120
liberal societies only prosper when they are based on things that precede choice. There's only a firm

227
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,160
foundation for us to make our choices when there is these covenantal obligations to each other

228
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,280
through family, through nation, through God, or through some idea that there's a thing that's

229
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,720
called right and wrong. And when individual choice gets so extreme that it's eats away at the

230
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,000
covenants of our life, then it begins to erode the foundation of liberal society. And in my view,

231
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
over the last few years, liberalism has gotten, we've had an extreme form of liberalism. And this

232
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,160
is measurable. There's this thing called the World Value Survey. And the World Value Survey,

233
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,800
they go all around the world, and they ask people about their values, about how individualistic,

234
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,080
how much you believe in autonomy, or how much you believe in community. And especially in Europe

235
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,880
and the English-speaking world. Over the last 20 years, our values have shifted away from the

236
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,040
world. This is my view of a slide. I'm going to hold up a chart, which most of you will not be

237
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,720
able to see. That's my slide. This is my technology. But basically, the slide shows values all

238
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,240
around the world. The African world is over here, Latin America is over here, the Confucian world

239
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,640
is over here, and way out sticking at the end is the US and Western Europe. Our values have shifted

240
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,160
away from the rest of the world. We're much more individualistic, much more autonomous, and we've

241
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,600
entered this form of extreme liberalism, where everything is a matter of choice. I remember I

242
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,200
was teaching at Yale, only teaching at schools I couldn't have gotten into. And we were going around

243
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,560
the classroom, and the kids were, the students were talking about what they wanted to do after

244
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,640
college. And we got to one of my best students, a woman named Zara from Ghana. And she said,

245
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,920
well, you have to understand, it's not my choice. It's the village sent me here. And she just comes

246
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,760
from much more communal culture than those of us in the West. And but we have gotten so

247
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,480
individualistic, I think we've begun to undermine the fundamental foundations. Our families are in

248
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,800
trouble. Patriotism is in trouble. Our sense of social trust with one another is in trouble. But,

249
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,680
and that points to, I think, the most disorienting thing that's subtly disorienting to a lot of us,

250
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:00,200
what I call the privatization of morality. It's not only the privatization of morality is the

251
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,960
idea that each of us has to come up with our own moral values. And this is an extreme form of

252
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,280
liberalism. It's an extreme form of individualism. And if your name is Aristotle or Nietzsche, maybe

253
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,280
you can come up with your own moral philosophy. Most of us learn our morals in morally cohesive

254
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,000
communities. In our neighborhoods and our families, we have that sense of right and wrong formed

255
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,440
within us by the people who love us and the people who embrace us. And we have some sort of

256
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,600
existential security because of that. But when you privatize morality, then everyone set a drift.

257
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,840
And it's not only a drift like physically, deeply at the core of our souls were set a drift. And

258
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Walter Littman, a great columnist in the middle of the 20th century, saw this coming. In 1955, he

259
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,800
wrote a book called The Essays in Public Philosophy. And he wrote, if what is good, what is right,

260
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,440
what is true is only what the individual chooses to invent than we are outside the traditions of

261
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:10,280
civility. And so what I'm really describing here is a sense of constant flux. A constant flux not

262
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
only in a lot of things in our life, which is good, but in the deepest foundations of our lives.

263
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,640
And this situation was foreseen also by two writers who I have never quoted from in a talk,

264
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,000
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. I'm not a Marxist, but in the Communist Manifesto,

265
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,200
they wrote that bourgeois capitalist life will lead to the constant revolutionizing of production,

266
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,080
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation. They wrote

267
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,120
all fixed, fast-frozen relationships with their trained of ancient and venerable prejudices and

268
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,720
opinions are swept away. New-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is

269
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,040
solid melts into air. All that is holy is profaned. And man is at last compelled to face the sober

270
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,040
senses, the real conditions of his life and his relations with his kind. All that is solid melts

271
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,760
into air. All that is holy is profaned. It's that sense of deep inner disturb that I think you

272
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,640
haunt a lot of us. And the authoritarians know exactly what to do with this. Whether it's

273
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:24,160
Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Iran, Hamas, Viktor Orban, Marine Le Pen, MAGA, what unites them? They

274
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,720
say, I'm going to restore order. I'm going to restore order to the street. I'm going to restore

275
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,160
order to the borders. I'm also going to restore order to your soul. They stand up for family. They

276
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,560
stand up for what, to me, are reactionary values on LGBTQ issues. They stand up for everything.

277
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,600
And they make it all about order. And so a lot of people flock to the authoritarians and the

278
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,640
populism because they're not only saying, screw those elites. They're saying, I'm restoring order

279
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,320
to your deepest anxieties. And it's just tremendously powerfully appealing to people all

280
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,880
around the world. So that's the first part, the lack of a secure base. And the authoritarians

281
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,560
promise, of course, they're not really delivering a secure base. They're just delivering authoritarian

282
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:16,920
narcissism. But it has this spiritual resonance with people. So the second part of that, John

283
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Bolz, we quote, that all of life is a series of daring explorations from a secure base is a part

284
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,800
about the daring explorations, the chance and the opportunity to make sure your future is going to

285
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,560
be better than your past. We all need that sense that our life has some movements and purpose and

286
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:41,000
progress. And for a lot of us, it does. But for a lot of people in American society, it doesn't.

287
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,120
And the key divide in American society right now, and the key divide in our politics is over

288
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,560
education levels. And this is only true in America. It's true in all the countries I've been

289
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,960
talking about, what they call the diploma divide. So why would there be this gap which did not

290
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,680
used to exist? It used to be the political divisions are about money. Rich voted Republican,

291
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,920
poor people voted for the Democrats. Now it's highly educated people vote for the Democrats,

292
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,240
less educated people vote for the Republicans. And this basic pattern occurs again and again and

293
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,480
again all around the world. Why is that? The short answer to me and the reason a lot of people feel

294
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,280
they don't have a chance of possibility in daring explorations is that the game is rigged. That rich

295
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,240
people just have vastly better educational opportunities than poor people. Our sorting

296
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,600
society has created a caste system. Three year olds who come from a home with parents making over

297
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,760
$100,000 a year are twice as likely to attend preschool as poor parents, poor kids. By eighth grade,

298
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,240
children from affluent families are performing four grade levels higher than children from

299
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,880
poorer families. Students who grow up in a home making over $200,000 a year have a one in five

300
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,120
chance of scoring a 1,400 on their SATs, one in five. For poorer kids, the chances are one in 50.

301
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,480
At every step of the way, kids from highly educated parents and highly affluent parents

302
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,000
have this huge advantage. There's a guy named Daniel Markovitz who calculates that if you would add

303
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,800
up all the things that affluent parents give to their kids, whether it's private school tuition,

304
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:25,080
oboe practice, soccer practice, travel teams, even trips to museums, trips to Europe, it amounts

305
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,120
to a $10 million investment in each kid, and they just soar ahead. Kids whose families can't make

306
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:39,560
that contribution, they fall way behind. Markovitz made, to me, the shocking claim, which he's a

307
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:47,320
very careful scholar, is that the educational gap between rich kids and poor kids is now wider than

308
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,000
the educational gap between whites and blacks in the era of Jim Crow. That's just a yawning gap,

309
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,760
and it has produced a caste society. We don't live in a single society anymore. We live in a society

310
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,560
divided by educational levels. In 2003, there was a woman named Annette LaRoe, a great sociologist,

311
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:14,200
who studied how children are raised, and she said people from working class backgrounds practice

312
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,000
what she called natural growth parenting. Life is hard, let the kids enjoy their childhood.

313
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,160
Children from college-educated families practice what she called concerted cultivation,

314
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,480
which is how I raise my kids and how a lot of you probably raised your kids. The calendar becomes

315
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,200
the central thing on the door, and you're shepherding your kids, sports practices to

316
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,560
oboe practices to whatever, and you're really investing in your kids so you can thrive in

317
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,640
the meritocracy. But it has created a vast difference, so college-educated people live

318
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,440
very different lives than high school-educated people. The average high school grad in this

319
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,200
country lives eight years shorter than the average college grad. 40% of high school grads are obese

320
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,200
compared to 20% of college grads. High school grads are much less likely to marry and twice as

321
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,240
likely to get divorced than college grads. 60% of births to women with a high school degree

322
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:14,120
happen out of wedlock. That's a rate 20 times higher than college grads. The opioid death rate

323
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,200
for those with a high school degree was 10,000, was 10 deaths per 100,000. 10 deaths per 100,000.

324
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,800
For a college degree it was only two deaths per 100,000. And so these are just vast chasms

325
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:33,160
in how we live, how we prosper, or don't prosper. And so a lot of people look at that gap and they

326
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,280
say the system is rigged. And populists attack the educated class. Or as Donald Trump once put it,

327
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,360
I love the poorly educated. And so populists say those elites, they rig the game,

328
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,120
they close it off opportunities, you are screwed and I will fix the problem.

329
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,760
And so on both these deep levels, the need for a secure spiritual foundation for your life

330
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:05,320
and a sense of hope, populists claim to have an answer. And so I'll spend three minutes on

331
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:13,160
what we should do to repair the situation. The first is people are in the center and people are on

332
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:21,880
the left have to have some version of faith, family, and flag. We have too often allowed populist

333
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,080
authoritarians to grab, for example, patriotism. I took a walk today with a guy named Richard

334
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,520
Reeves who's speaking here today and he's from Britain. And he noticed that the far right was

335
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,280
seizing the British flag and seizing a lot of the symbols of British patriotism. So there's a

336
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,520
paper in the UK called The Guardian, which many of you know, it's a progressive paper. And on page

337
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:52,120
two, they had a big full page picture of the Red Cross, which is what there's a certain symbol of

338
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,680
England. And that the whole page two was that. And on the page one editorial said, we're not letting

339
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,200
the far right take this from us. Please cut out this piece of paper and hang it in your window of

340
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,000
your living room, because we're going to re-seize patriotism. We're not going to let the right have

341
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,760
that. So that's the first thing. And similarly, progressives and centrists have to have a way

342
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,480
to talk about the sacredness of family and the sacredness of patriotism. Second, and this is

343
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,080
Fred Riley who is executive director of Weave, the social fabric project, which we work on together,

344
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,880
it's the need to give people secure base, give them interpersonal trust. 71% of young people,

345
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,960
Gen Z, ask them, if you agree with this statement, most people are selfish and out to get you. 71%

346
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,960
of Gen Z, yes. How do you not live with fear if you think most people are selfish and out to get you?

347
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,120
And that's low social trust. And so what we do at Weave is we take people who are building trust

348
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,200
to the local level, and we try to support them. Trust is built locally by people who show up for

349
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,120
you, by people who are there with you, by people who know you. I wrote a book that came out in

350
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,960
October called How to Know a Person, and it was based on the idea that trust exists. Existential

351
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,240
security exists when the people around you see, hear, respect, and know you. When the reporting

352
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,560
of that book, I was down in Waco, Texas, and I was at a diner, and I'm having breakfast with a,

353
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:36,200
I think a 95-year-old lady named LaRue Dorsey, and she presents herself to me as this stern

354
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,920
disciplinarian, like she'd been a teacher, and she said, I loved my students enough to discipline

355
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,400
them. And I was a little intimidated by this drill sergeant later. But into the diner walks a mutual

356
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,840
friend of ours named Jimmy Dorell. And Jimmy Dorell sees us, he comes up to the diner, he grabs

357
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,360
Mrs. Dorsey by the shoulders, and shakes her way harder than you should ever shake a 95-year-old.

358
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,880
But he says to her, Mrs. Dorsey, you're the best, you're the best, I love you, I love you.

359
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,280
And that stern disciplinarian lady that I've been talking to, in an instant,

360
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,640
turns into a bright, eye-shining, nine-year-old girl. With the power of his gaze, he brought out a

361
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,240
different version of her. And that's when, when you have people around you who are able to see you

362
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,720
in that way, then it's, you feel seen, heard, you feel safe. We evolved to be surrounded by people

363
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,080
who were looking out for us. And part of the reason Jimmy Dorell was able to do that is that he's,

364
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,200
he's a warmer personality than I am. But part of it is he's a pastor. He pastures to the homeless

365
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,960
in Waco. He has a church called Church Under the Bridge. The homeless people didn't feel comfortable

366
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,440
going to his church, so he brought the church to them. He has it under a highway overpass where

367
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:53,480
they sleep. And so he's a pastor. So he thinks every person he sees is made in the image of God.

368
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:00,360
Every person he sees has a soul of infinite value and dignity. Every person he sees is so important,

369
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,080
Jesus was willing to die for that person. Now you could be Christian or Jewish or atheist or Muslim

370
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,040
or Buddhist, I don't care. But we have to learn to see each other with that level of reverence and

371
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:18,520
respect, or else we will feel unseen, disrespected, unheard, existentially unsafe. So that's ways to

372
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,960
try to create a secure base in the community as we've done, interpersonally as I hope to do in my

373
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:32,280
book, and on the national level as people come up with new ways to secure the family, secure the flag,

374
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,760
and secure faith. Then on the other side of the equation, we somehow have to create more opportunity

375
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,160
for a wider array of people. We have to fix the meritocracy. In the 1930s, a guy named James Conan,

376
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,280
who was president of Harvard, created our modern meritocracy. It is not a natural growth, it's an

377
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,840
ideological project. And his ideological project was the central human trait is intelligence.

378
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:05,160
And we're going to sort people starting at age five by how smart they are. And I'm fine with

379
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,760
intelligence. It's a good trait to have. It's not the most important trait in human ability. To me,

380
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,360
the most important trait in human ability is hunger. It's the drive to keep working, to keep

381
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,840
learning, to keep moving, and to keep getting better at something. The second trait is the ability to

382
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,480
work in teams. There's a funny thing that there's zero correlation between how you do in school and

383
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,800
how you do in life. Grades predict nothing. And that's because school is all about self. It's about

384
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,760
how am I doing individually. Life is generally about how am I doing as a team. How am I doing with

385
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,000
others? So there's a basic non sequitur between schools and life. The third trait I think is

386
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,160
character. Ask people, there was somebody who did a study, why do people get fired? In only 11%

387
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,160
of cases are people fired because they're not smart enough to do the job or they lack the technical

388
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:02,920
knowledge. The main reason people get fired, 89% of cases, is because they're assholes. Or they're

389
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,320
unteachable. They're uncoachable. They don't do well with their teammates. And so somehow we have

390
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,000
to build a meritocracy around a broader definition of merit that won't be able to be gained by the

391
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,560
rich. A definition of merit that includes drive, resilience, good character, empathy, social

392
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,720
ability. And if we widen out that, how we define merit, I think we'll have a fairer society.

393
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,720
And we won't have these bottlenecks for people. So these are tough times.

394
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:45,160
I, sometime last November, I was at a hotel bar on my travels. And if you'd seen me there,

395
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:54,920
you would have said, sad guy drinking alone. But I call it reporting. And so I was at the bar

396
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,640
and I'm on Twitter, of course, and I'm scrolling through all these images,

397
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,080
mostly from the Middle East. And they're just brutal images. And you think about the famous

398
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:16,840
dates of our century are just brutal dates. September 11th, January 6th, October 7th. It's

399
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,840
tempting in these times to turn into what the authoritarians want us to be, which is war of

400
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,520
all against all. Us versus them, it's just war. And yet as I'm scrolling through my phone,

401
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,200
looking at all these images, I come across a video and it's an interview with James Baldwin.

402
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,520
And he gave the interview, sometime it looked from the black and white images, it looked like

403
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,000
the early 60s. Now Baldwin was a guy who was horribly mistreated by his society because of

404
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,520
the color of his skin and because of the sexual orientation. And that guy had a right to feel

405
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,760
bitter and hatred. He had the right to sink into the enmity that drives so much of our politics.

406
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,760
But in this interview, he says, you know, there's not as much humanity as you would like in the

407
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:11,240
world. But there's enough. There's more than you would think. And then he says, you've got to remember

408
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,640
as you walk down the street, every single person you meet, that could be you. You could be that person.

409
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,560
You could be that saint. You could be that monster. And you've got to decide who you're going to be.

410
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,840
And so he could have calloused over, as I said, but instead he had this mentality, I could be that

411
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,200
person. I may like them. I may not like them. That could be me. And the phrase that leapt to

412
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,760
mine as I was listening to this little 60-minute or 60-second clip was defiant humanism, that even

413
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:51,320
in brutal times, when a lot of our political opponents are brutal and monstrous and frankly

414
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:58,040
authoritarian, that perversely and paradoxically the way to rebut them is to be more human,

415
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,320
is to touch the things that really we do need to solve our souls and to emphasize the deepest

416
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
parts of our nature. Thank you very much.

417
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,200
Now I have less some time for a question and answer. If anybody has comments or questions,

418
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,360
all that I ask is you make them long and be andering with no question at the end.

419
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:39,720
Do we have any mic runners? We have a mic runner.

420
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Can you talk about your thoughts, how social media for young people especially

421
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,560
contributes to depression and loneliness?

422
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,000
So the mental health crisis has many causes as you expect. Some of it as I said I think is

423
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,800
philosophical and cultural in nature which is what I tried to describe but and I was a little

424
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,360
skeptical that social media was really leading to this incredible ramp up in depression and suicide

425
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,880
and my argument and I'm friends with a guy named Jonathan Hyde who's written about this was that

426
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,920
social media is everywhere but depression and suicide are not going up in Denmark, they're not

427
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:31,960
going up in Ghana and but Jonathan has persuaded me with a fair boatload of data that in fact

428
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,080
they are going up everywhere. Wherever there's social media there's a rise in suicide and a rise

429
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,400
in depression. Now we happen to get it worse because you combine social media with a highly

430
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,120
individualistic culture where people feel solitude it's going to have the effect is going to be a

431
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,960
lot worse so I am become convinced that social media truly is horrible not that I get off it but

432
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,960
um and that one of the Jonathan's proposals which I think is gaining great traction it's rare you

433
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,040
see a somebody in my business say we should do this and then suddenly all across the country

434
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,600
people are doing it and Jonathan's one proposal is no phones in schools and school district after

435
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,880
school district is now adopting this and it's like a lot of technologies at first we don't know that's

436
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,320
dangers but once we learn the dangers we know we adapt and so I think that's happening with social

437
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,200
media we're adapting I think that'll happen with AI eventually too but maybe way there in the back

438
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,800
information could you restate the source of the uh motivating quote at the beginning

439
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,160
about base and exploration who was that a guy named John Bolesby who was the father of the

440
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,080
thing called attachment theory he I think he was like 1940s 1950s John Bolesby uh all of life

441
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:52,120
is a syringe of daring explorations from a secure base I see a couple little Katie

442
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,600
thank you I just love you David Brooks thank you for this incredible presentation

443
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:11,240
you're so thoughtful and smart and compassionate but I wanted to ask you for some real world advice

444
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,600
you know and this isn't going to be a long story I promise but I did a breast cancer walk recently

445
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,240
and a woman came up to me and said I really love you even though we're very different politically

446
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:28,520
I'm pretty sure and then I tried to kind of talk to her and I said oh well why are you

447
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,080
feeling the way you're feeling and I said do you believe are you do you have do you believe the

448
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:42,760
election was rigged and she said yes I do and I said but there's 60 plus lawsuits you know I did

449
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,880
the whole thing like why it wasn't and she said no I really think it was I've seen evidence

450
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:55,080
and can you tell us how to talk to people you know and how to lean into our humanity

451
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:06,120
when people believe things that just aren't true yeah it's really hard right I mean I was nice to

452
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,000
her but I just was frustrated yeah hey this is paradox that you're asking me this question

453
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,960
because one of my earlier years here a woman came up to me after I gave a talk and it was

454
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,520
a more one of my more personal talks and she talked about her son getting killed in a car crash

455
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,200
and I had no idea what to say and but I'm happened to be behind Katie Couric at the

456
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,240
security line at the Espen airport on the way out so I asked you what do you say and you gave me

457
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:40,600
good advice mostly just hugs but I would say so I'm at a baseball game and it's the night

458
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:47,480
inning in Washington and a guy turns around to me and says hey are you David Brooks and I think

459
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,960
nice he'll like my he'll say oh I like your column you know I like your show whatever

460
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,840
and I said yeah and he said you're a fucking asshole

461
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,920
and he like he's and my son was there and he said to my son you should be ashamed of your

462
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,840
father he's awful and this was a Trump guy and my wife is there and she's trying to calm him down

463
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,040
she's get off me woman and then he says I'm shaking I'm in the presence of evil and that was

464
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,040
like oh and I would like to think that at that moment my son and I rose above conflict and reached

465
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:27,240
out with compassion and empathy and understanding sadly that did not happen we were as nasty as he

466
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,360
was so I'm not and my wife was genuinely angry with me with the right to be but what I've learned

467
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,000
there's a highly recommended a book called Crucial Conversations by a guy named Joseph

468
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,040
Granny and a bunch of other people it's how to have these hard conversations and they point out

469
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,600
something which I've learned when somebody comes up with that kind of critique from a Trump's board

470
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:53,240
or whatever or from the further left my first job is to stand in their standpoint it's to ask them

471
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:59,080
three or four or five times how did you come to believe what you believe and I never ask people

472
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,800
anymore what do you believe I ask how did you come to believe that because that way you're getting

473
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:10,440
them in narrative mode and they talk about an experience they talk about a somebody who shaped

474
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:17,720
their values and then so I asked them three or four or five times and I may not persuade them I may

475
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,960
not agree but at least I'm showing them the respect of curiosity and in this book Crucial Conversations

476
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:31,480
the authors say in any conversation respect is like air when it's present nobody notices

477
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,000
when it's absent it's all anybody can think about and so a lot of the people who hold these views

478
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,200
feel profoundly disrespected and if you can show them respect I'm not sure you will persuade them

479
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,480
I'm not sure anything haven't I've been written a million anti-trump columns in the last seven years

480
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,520
for all the good it's done to the world but at least you'll show them that respect and I think

481
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,840
that will solve some of the sense of hurt the sense that you looked at you people look down on me

482
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,840
and the the other thing those people in Crucial Conversations say is that every conversation

483
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,040
that exists at two levels what we're nominally talking about and the real conversation which

484
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,320
is the flow of emotions flowing between us with every comment we make to each other we're making

485
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,240
each other feel more respected or less respected more safe or less safe and so by standing in their

486
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,960
standpoint hopefully you're making them feel more safe and less condescended to

487
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,160
and I don't know if that'll change the world but it's the only thing I could think of

488
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,560
maybe in the in the back I see a couple hands we've got two minutes and 45 seconds

489
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,600
thank you for your talk Fidel Vargas president CEO of the hispanic scholarship fund and I

490
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:55,080
apologize I came in a little late but one of the other things I seem to notice and I would love

491
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,280
to hear your perspective homogenous societies versus diverse societies France the United States

492
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,680
versus say Japan how is that playing out because it's a whole lot easier to

493
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:16,360
say the other and who's causing our problems how does that play into everything yeah I mean

494
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:23,320
we evolved to live with 150 people like ourselves we evolved for homogeneity we now get to live and

495
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,920
it's a privilege and honor to live in much more diverse societies and it's to me it's a wonderfully

496
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,720
great thing but it's just tougher it's tougher for me to relate to somebody whose lifestyle

497
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,400
whose historical narrative is vastly different than my own and that that one of the reasons I

498
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,600
wrote that book I had to know a person is because we have to up our social skills to fit the society

499
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:55,160
we're living in and these traits go super deep I there was an election in Connecticut a guy named

500
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,840
Ned Lamont ran against a guy named Joe Lieberman and researchers found after that election that every

501
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,800
town that was settled by the Portuguese in the 17th century voted for Lieberman and every town

502
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,320
settled by the English voted for Lamont these are 350 year old categories and they're still

503
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:21,000
shaping belief I have a party conversation you can tell how fun I am at parties where I asked the

504
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,080
following question and I asked that at dinner party recently how do your ancestors show up in your

505
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,200
life it's like we all know we're formed by our heritage but how and so there was a Dutch family

506
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,720
there and they talked about their Dutch heritage there was a black family there they talked about

507
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,080
the African-American experience I talked about 5,000 years of Jewish history which I'm sure was

508
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,480
a scintillating two and a half hours for them but you know we're so deeply formed by our ancient

509
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:52,200
heritages and you just have to be very socially skilled to see people in that level of profound

510
00:50:52,200 --> 00:51:00,040
difference but once you do it it's fun and I'll close with this bit of research a concrete way to

511
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,680
change your life so I'm buddies with a guy named Nick Epley he's a social psychologist at University

512
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,920
Chicago and he was because he's a social psychologist he knows that every the thing that makes us

513
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,200
happiest is talking to each other we pretty relational social animals and so he's on his

514
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,480
commuter train on the way up to campus from his home and he's looking around the car and everybody

515
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,360
is on their phones not a single person is talking to each other so he's a social psychologist for

516
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,840
the next couple months he pays people on the train to talk to a stranger and he asks them

517
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,480
afterwards when they get off the train how'd you like it and they all say that was the most

518
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:43,000
enjoyable ride I've had in months we underestimate how we how much we want to talk to each other

519
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,400
we underestimate how much we're going to go deep we want to go deep and so I did a presentation

520
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,240
with them at Chicago a couple months ago now and we're doing our conversation on stage and he says

521
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,000
stop I'm gonna make everybody in this room find a stranger and for the next 10 minutes tell them

522
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,760
about the last time you cried and you hear this groan go up from the crowd and he says how many

523
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,480
of you want to do this and a few hands go up how many of you don't want to do it 80% of the hands

524
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:22,840
went up and he said go and they did it and 10 minutes pass and we can't get them to set up so

525
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:29,240
we can get back to our conversation and then finally when they do come up he says how many

526
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:35,160
of you enjoyed that and 80% of the hands went up and that's just a small practical thing so now

527
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,840
when I'm on the plane I often talk to the stranger I wait till there's only an hour left in the

528
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:48,600
flight in case I'll be boring but still but it's just a concrete practical way to instill a little

529
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,040
social relationship a little social trust and to weaken the kind of existential loneliness

530
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:01,720
that I think is the cause of a lot of our problems so thank you very much

531
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,400
you
