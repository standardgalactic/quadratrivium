0	7440	Hey, good evening, welcome.
7440	10400	My name is Jerry Murdoch.
10400	15120	Most of you in the room, or the many of you that know me, mostly know me as that guy who's
15120	20240	married to Gina Murdoch.
20240	25840	But I'm also a board member here at the Aspen Institute and at the Santa Fe Institute and
25840	30560	at the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.
30560	37040	This is the second event of the 2015 McCloskey Speaker Series.
37040	41880	I want to thank Bonnie and Tom McCloskey family who are sitting right here.
41880	42880	Thank you very much.
42880	47160	This is wonderful.
47160	54680	So tonight's speaker, Dr. Eric Smith, has challenged disciplinary boundaries throughout
54680	56440	his career.
56440	62880	First is an undergraduate at Caltech in getting his degree in mathematics and in physics.
62880	68520	And then at the University of Texas, Austin, where he earned his PhD in high-energy physics
68520	73880	while working on string theory and quantum gravity, which was followed by appointments
73880	75920	at Los Alamos.
75920	82880	And then he spent 11 years at the Santa Fe Institute as a full-time faculty member.
82880	88120	During his time at Santa Fe Institute, I had the good fortune to meet him.
88120	93840	And in full disclosure, I've been funding his work for over a decade, his work in regards
93840	98480	to the origin of life, which we're going to hear about tonight.
98480	103640	And while at Santa Fe Institute, he was also doing interdisciplinary work in geochemistry,
103640	109720	biochemistry, and many topics related to complexity.
110360	126320	Currently, Eric is a professor and researcher at the Earth Life Institute in Tokyo.
126320	131960	And he's also a external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.
131960	139040	His goal is to understand origin and nature of the living state through the many windows
139040	147440	that science provides, the physical, geochemical, biochemical, ecological, and evolutionary.
147440	154720	Additionally, he remains interested in the connections or correspondences between energy,
154720	158760	information, and computation.
158760	166240	Most of us think about life as being something created from other living things.
166240	172320	But much of Eric's work focuses on the time before biology, when life on Earth emerge
172320	176360	from geophysical and chemical processes.
176360	181440	The subject of tonight's talk is based on material from his upcoming book, co-written
181440	187000	by the legendary biologist Harold Morowitz, which is entitled, The Emergence of the Fourth
187000	192560	Geosphere, to be published in 2016 by Cambridge University Press.
192560	197760	His work disrupts Francis Crick's notion that life was a happy accident.
197760	202720	Indeed, the material has consequences for the way we think about the relationship of
202720	205760	the individual to ecology.
205760	211920	The big picture of origin of life shows that ecosystems, not individuals, are carrying
211920	215240	some of the most fundamental patterns of life.
215240	220240	Furthermore, the work leads us to understand that the nature of living state is different
220240	225520	from the nature of individuality, and that we have been wrongly conflating the two in
225520	227480	our understanding of biology.
227480	233640	Therefore, we should strive to achieve a more ecology-centered biology to help us guide
233640	238320	our life in a more sustainable way within the biosphere.
238320	247560	Finally, both his upcoming book and tonight's talk will challenge us to rethink what is
247560	249720	the nature of life.
249720	252320	Without further ado, let's welcome Eric Smith.
252320	271640	Thank you.
271640	273760	So thank you, Jerry, and good evening, everybody.
273760	275560	Welcome.
275560	279880	You might think at the least that the problem of the origin of life, how did life appear
279880	284400	on an earth that previously had not had life, is mostly a history problem.
284400	287080	What happened and when and where did it happen?
287080	291000	You could go a little bit beyond that and you might think of it as a problem of cause.
291000	294280	How did things happen and why?
294280	302160	The argument that I want to make tonight is that we actually need to go further than that.
302160	307200	The things that we've learned about the technical problems of when, where, and how have caused
307200	311760	us to realize that the nature of life is different from a lot of the patterns that we've traditionally
311760	314080	used to think about it.
314080	318760	The reason the origin of life problem is hard is that we do something in science that we
318760	320520	also do in everyday life.
320520	325040	We put a big gap between the living things and the nonliving things.
325040	329760	It's very difficult to see across that gap how something like life could have come from
329760	333560	something that was not alive.
333560	336920	So when we think about life, we often think about it in these terms.
336920	338480	Life is made of individuals.
338480	339600	They have agency.
339600	344520	Maybe they have purpose or intentions that gives the biosphere direction.
344520	349440	Even if the direction didn't come from the individuals, it comes from evolution.
349440	355280	Life is energetic, it's complex, and it's endlessly fascinating.
355280	356280	Compare that to rocks.
356280	357280	What do rocks do?
357280	358960	They just sit there.
358960	362280	They've been around for billions of years.
362280	369640	So what I want to argue to you tonight is that the conceptual gap between the nonliving
369640	375960	world and living world is not real, or it's not where we have tried to place it in the
375960	376960	past.
376960	380120	The nonliving world is very active.
380120	384520	It's richly structured in its activity, and the biosphere from the beginning all the way
384520	389760	to the present is embedded in detail in the structure of that chemical activity of the
389760	391680	rest of the planet.
391680	397200	We haven't recognized the connections because our ways of looking have been too small or
397200	398800	they've been too short term.
398800	403920	They've been on the scale of a human life, or maybe we've looked in the wrong places.
403920	409680	But particularly in the last 30 years, things that we've learned in a variety of different
409680	415040	disciplines are changing the way we ask those questions, and those are the things that cause
415040	420920	us to reevaluate what we think the nature of life is and what we're trying to explain.
420920	424840	So tonight, I want to cover four points.
424840	428720	First of all, to understand the nature of life and the origin of life, you have to understand
428720	434520	its planetary context, and that context is what I will call a great arc of disequilibrium
434520	437040	on the scale of the whole planet.
437040	442760	Now even though that disequilibrium or stress runs through all of the systems on the planet,
442760	447040	we can break it apart and we can make it comprehensible by doing something that geologists have done
447040	448740	for more than a century.
448740	453640	We can divide the planet into geospheres, which are separate domains of states of matter
453640	457120	and kinds of chemistry.
457120	461440	What we're looking for in the nature of life is actually at the level of the biosphere
461440	468760	as a whole, not at the level of its components, of species or organisms or sub-organism components.
468760	472640	The conclusion that I want to leave us with at the end of the night is that the biosphere
472640	474760	is the fourth geosphere.
474760	479200	We should understand it as a planetary subsystem, and we should understand the emergence of
479200	485320	life as a stage in planetary maturation akin to the stages that cause the other geospheres
485320	489480	to be separated from each other.
489480	495720	So in classical geology, a lifeless planet can have three geospheres.
495720	500320	The lithosphere, from the word for rock, is the solid bulk.
500320	504360	On Earth, this is almost all of the matter and the mass of the planet.
504360	510160	The state of matter is solid, and the chemistry characteristic of the lithosphere is the chemistry
510160	514720	of minerals and their changes.
514720	516360	Second geosphere is the hydrosphere.
516360	519360	This is all of the watery domains.
519360	520920	Water chemistry is very special.
520920	525920	It's very restrictive, and as we've known forever, water chemistry is fundamental to
525920	531920	the nature of life, and it's in part important because of all the things you can't do in
531920	537840	water that you have to be distinctive that life does.
537840	540680	The third non-living geosphere is the atmosphere.
540680	545440	This is the gas phase because it's cool and because it's at low density.
545440	548440	There are certain kinds of chemistry that are possible in the atmosphere that are not
548440	550680	possible other places.
550680	555280	Now the chemistry of the atmosphere is not actually very much like the chemistry of life,
555280	559760	but it turns out that it's really important to the great arc of planetary disequilibrium
559760	563800	that will be central to our story.
563800	566720	And the fourth is the biosphere.
566720	570840	A lifeless planet will always have a lithosphere.
570840	575320	If it has enough volatiles, as they're called, the liquids and gases, it can also have hydrospheres
575320	577640	or atmospheres.
577640	581880	I want to look at the earth as it is, and everything that causes it to be different
581880	585560	from a planet that only had the three lifeless geospheres.
585560	589240	And all of that difference is what I mean by the biosphere.
589240	592360	So it is organisms, but not only organisms.
592360	597080	It's all of their ecological relations, it's their history, and it's all the changes that
597080	601960	they have collectively brought about in the rest of the planet throughout its history.
601960	605920	So it's in the sum rather than in the components that we look for the nature of the living
605920	610320	state.
610320	615760	So I've said that there's not a gap that separates life conceptually from the rest of the earth,
615760	620080	but certainly the biosphere is different from the non-living geospheres.
620080	623880	It's different in many ways, but if we had to choose one that's most important, here's
623880	626280	the one I would argue it is.
626280	631240	For the other geospheres, the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, we can understand
631240	635280	most of them in terms of their structure.
635280	642480	For the biosphere, you can only really understand it as an organized state of activity.
642480	647600	In order to create an organized state of activity that goes beyond just structure, you have
647600	652120	to be in a circumstance that physicists call far from equilibrium, and I'll explain to
652120	654700	you in a minute what that means.
654700	658920	The important thing is that the disequilibria we need to understand life are not something
658920	663040	local, they're not local in space and they're not local in chemistry, they actually are
663040	667200	built up on the scale of the whole planet.
667200	671600	So to give you a flavor for what is meant by near equilibrium or far from equilibrium,
671600	675560	I'll use something that's a little of an analogy, but it's an analogy that's mathematically
675560	677600	faithful.
677600	680400	Near equilibrium is like the ripples on a pond.
680400	685840	There may be activity that's caused by disturbances, but most of what there is to understand can
685840	692520	be understood from the structure of the flat surface before you start.
692520	695040	This is far from equilibrium.
695040	700480	Think of the biosphere as surfing on a continuously renewed wave of energy flow.
700480	705440	That energy flow is needed to keep it up where it is, it's needed to keep it organized.
705440	711360	Now it's been understood forever that life requires a flow of energy to maintain itself.
711360	717000	But to say that something is required doesn't say that that's necessarily possible, it only
717000	719320	tells you what's impossible.
719320	721480	Tonight I want to argue for something stronger.
721480	727100	I want to argue that the energy flows on earth brought the biosphere into existence.
727100	730680	It's as if the wave had created the surfer.
730680	736620	So traditionally when we come at the problem of the origin of life from the habits of biology,
736620	740480	we ask where is the surfer and what is the surfer like?
740480	748200	What I want to argue with here is that the right question should be where is the wave?
748200	751480	So the story of disequilibrium that makes sense of the origin of life doesn't start
751480	755960	on the planet, it actually starts in the formation of the solar system.
755960	760440	Now when we look at the sun, the part we see is the photosphere.
760440	761440	Photosphere is relatively cool.
761440	765040	It's only about 6,000 degrees Celsius, which is about the same temperature as the core
765040	766200	of the earth.
766200	773280	And it looks relatively smooth and flat like you see here, occasional sunspots.
773280	778120	But if you were to look at the sun in the X-ray with a movie, you'd find a boiling cauldron
778120	780400	of magnetic fluid.
780400	785040	Because the sun produces heat and the heat needs to convect and because it's electrically
785040	790640	conductive, you get loops of magnetism that boil up from the interior and whip plasma into
790640	793360	the outer layers of the atmosphere.
793360	798080	This action can cause the middle atmosphere of the sun, called the chromosphere, to go
798080	800440	up to 100,000 degrees or more.
800440	804240	And it can elevate the corona to a million degrees or more.
804240	809720	So plasma at 100,000 degrees emits extreme ultraviolet radiation, and at a million degrees
809720	814080	or more it emits X-rays.
814080	818920	So if you could look at the sun with a picture in the extreme UV in the X-ray, this is actually
818920	821080	what you would find.
821080	826520	The activity of a star like this is due to convection and the conductivity of the plasma,
826520	831880	but also to the rotation, because this is a Coriolis effect, the same as hurricanes.
831880	836480	And when stars are young when they're born, they rotate much faster and they spin down
836480	838080	over time.
838080	843120	So when the sun was young, all of this activity was actually more vigorous and more violent
843120	847160	than it is today.
847160	853080	Now that kind of hard radiation shapes planetary atmospheres, and in particular it drives them
853080	857160	far out of equilibrium from the planet that they surround.
857160	861120	So in particular, ultraviolet and above will break water.
861120	866440	Water is the H2O molecule where the Hs are white and the O is red, and it will separate
866440	869280	the hydrogen from the oxygen.
869280	873400	Hydrogen is a very light element, and so anything will cause it to escape.
873400	878800	And the result is that you leave the oxygen behind.
878800	882960	This is actually a satellite photo of the Earth taken with a filter for the emission
882960	885200	lines that see hydrogen.
885200	890160	And what you can see is that our planet is surrounded by a halo of hydrogen that's continually
890160	894040	escaping from it.
894040	896960	That turns out to have major consequences.
896960	901400	Because the rates of hydrogen loss that a star like our sun produces will remove a volume
901400	905880	of water comparable to the Earth's ocean in about a billion years.
905880	914120	So if you were Venus, which is about our size but closer to the sun and a little bit warmer,
914120	919240	or if you were Mars, which is smaller and has weaker gravity to hold elements, you would
919320	923960	have wound up in the condition that they're in today, with no surface water, oxygen left
923960	927520	behind that turns the dry surface a rusty red.
927520	930880	In about four and a half billion years, the Earth may be in this condition, depending
930880	934680	on how much water is on the inside, which is something we don't know.
934680	939520	But for the time being, the Earth is a very unusual planet in the solar system, and possibly
939520	942560	more widely than that.
942560	947440	But why does any of this matter to the origin of life?
947480	950800	To answer that, you need to know a little bit of chemistry, but all you need to know
950800	954200	is on this one slide.
954200	957160	And it's intuitive, I promise.
957160	963800	In the periodic table of the elements, we have many different kinds of animals.
963800	970080	Some of the elements have a stronger what's called affinity for electrons than others.
970080	975800	And in particular, important to our story, iron is very ready to give electrons away
975960	980440	to many other elements, giving electrons away to something called reducing that, because
980440	983080	electrons have a negative charge.
983080	988880	At the opposite end, oxygen is very greedy and will steal electrons from many elements.
988880	993360	And so you can see the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen in the suites of minerals
993360	995040	in the world.
995040	999120	Iron metal, which mostly doesn't exist at the surface, has all of its electrons, and
999120	1002520	they're loosely bound, so they make a kind of a liquid, and that's why iron is silvery
1002520	1004880	and shiny and reflects light.
1004880	1009720	If you bring in a little bit of oxygen, enough that there's one oxygen atom per iron atom,
1009720	1013600	it will transfer two electrons to the oxygen, and we note that with a plus two on the iron
1013600	1018520	and a minus two on the oxygen, and you get this dull silvery mineral called vistite,
1018520	1022400	which is no longer shiny because the free electrons are gone.
1022400	1027480	Little bit more so that you're in a mix between giving two and giving three electrons away,
1027480	1029560	and you have magnetite, which is black.
1029560	1032320	This is what the original compasses were made of.
1032320	1036600	If you give yet more, you get this rusty red mineral called hematite, which is one of the
1036600	1038360	elements of rust.
1038360	1045600	Now as we all know, rust happens, and the spontaneity of this electron donating process
1045600	1049960	is a source of chemical energy.
1049960	1054160	If you look at that at a planetary scale, you realize that what happens is that hydrogen
1054160	1058800	escape is turning our whole planet into a giant battery, because this is how batteries
1058800	1059800	work.
1059800	1063480	There are two different elements, one of which gives electrons and one of which takes them,
1063480	1068160	and you force the electrons to flow through something so that you can harness the work.
1068160	1072320	In the earth, in the interior region known as the mantle, most of the iron is in this
1072320	1078000	plus two state, but near the surface it gets pulled to the plus three state by the oxygen
1078000	1084200	that's continually made available as we lose water to hydrogen escape.
1084200	1088640	Now on a quiet earth, that battery would run down, because even though you originally
1088640	1093720	had oxygen to donate electrons at the surface, that would basically weather over the same
1093720	1098280	way you get a layer of oxide on an aluminum window sill.
1098280	1104680	The only thing that allows the battery to be continually refreshed is that new material
1104680	1109920	is delivered to the surface of the earth at the same time as hydrogen is continually
1109920	1112600	scoured away out of the atmosphere.
1112600	1117560	But that redelivery brings a second kind of disequilibrium into the picture to understand
1117560	1120520	the context for life.
1120520	1124800	So if you could look at a cross section of the earth on 100 million year time scales,
1124800	1130280	so this is where human life is too short to see, you would actually see cool material
1130280	1134320	being brought down from the surface, and you can barely see in this picture, I apologize
1134320	1138520	for the colors, the yellow heat from the core being boiled up.
1138520	1143720	So the interior plastic rock of the mantle is constantly in convective turnover driven
1143720	1147000	by this need to release heat.
1147000	1152400	If at the same time you could see the chemical composition of the rock, you would find that
1152400	1157400	the oxidized, exhausted crust on the surface is being pulled down and remixed into the
1157400	1163240	mantle, while the electron giving iron material in the interior is allowed to come to the
1163240	1167400	surface and make new crust.
1167400	1172800	So when you put all these processes together, this is the picture you get of the big earth.
1172800	1178240	Convection continually refreshes the surface rock at the same time as the solar radiation
1178240	1181080	pulls the hydrogen away.
1181080	1185600	The important thing is that the new crust is not created uniformly everywhere.
1185600	1190000	It's created in concentrated centers, which are called spreading centers or mid ocean
1190000	1193840	ridges beneath the ocean bottom.
1193840	1199920	The process of convection causes what are called plate tectonics, the movement of the
1199920	1205160	major plates around, where they subduct, they create earthquakes and volcanoes which
1205160	1209560	deliver other concentrated new rock to the surface, and when there are continents riding
1209560	1215120	around on them, they cause continental drift.
1215120	1220600	So this is a map of the bottom of the ocean showing its age.
1220600	1225560	The entire bottom of the ocean gets replaced about once every 250 million years as the continents
1225560	1229200	go back and forth opening and closing in a cycle.
1229200	1233400	The mid ocean ridges are these red regions of newly created crust in the centers of all
1233400	1238000	of the world's oceans, and then the blue regions are the old crust that's diving back into
1238000	1246280	the mantle as they do under Tokyo where I'm living.
1246280	1251400	Now the sites where new crust is created are themselves very interesting because you're
1251400	1256120	taking rock that's miles thick and you're twisting it and separating it and pulling
1256120	1259680	it, so they're filled with cracks and pores.
1259680	1266400	And in this domain, seawater invades and it gets chemically altered by the rock.
1266400	1271640	The invasion sites and then the remixing zones where the water comes back up are the places
1271640	1277440	where a battery that accumulates over the entire planetary surface and bulk gets concentrated
1277440	1279920	into these narrow ranges.
1279920	1284440	So this map shows you the same spreading centers and the little red dots are the places where
1284440	1289600	geologists have mapped out regions of active rock-water interaction.
1289600	1294200	This is a tiny subset of the ones that are believed to exist, but these now constitute
1294200	1298600	the evidence we have about where the Earth's battery mostly flows.
1298600	1302700	And if you look at the electron transfer, if you do a calculation from the interior
1302700	1307880	to the atmosphere, it's concentrated at these little release points right around here.
1307880	1313160	So the importance of this is that this is where stress piles up in the world even though
1313160	1325480	it's accumulated diffusely.
1325480	1328120	So up to this point, we've closed half the gap.
1328120	1333600	Hopefully I have convinced you that rocks don't just sit there, that the Earth is chemically
1333600	1335880	active and that it's organized.
1335880	1342160	But before the 1970s, even knowing all of this, and much of this was understood roughly,
1342160	1346360	people still would not have been able to make a connection to the origin of life, because
1346360	1350160	life still seemed so different.
1350160	1355680	What I want to show you next is that's because up until about the 1970s, we thought we understood
1355680	1361480	the nature of life, and our view of life was basically entirely upside down.
1361480	1365720	What's important about the last 50 years is that we've learned about an entire new part
1365720	1370520	of the biosphere that we didn't understand, and we've learned that it's that other part,
1370520	1383640	not us, that gives the clues about where life came from and the real foundations of its nature.
1383640	1386920	So understandably, for most of history, when we think about the nature of life, we think
1386920	1390880	about things that are big enough to see, because we didn't have microscopes.
1390880	1394200	And that means the plants and the animals and the fungi.
1394200	1399600	But what these all have in common is that ultimately they're all fed by this green forest here.
1399600	1404800	They all live off of the energy from sunlight, and that's a problem, because capturing sunlight
1404800	1408120	is the most complicated thing living systems do.
1408120	1412040	And so we were never able to surmount that chicken egg problem.
1412040	1416520	How would you ever get up to something as complicated as the machinery that harnesses
1416520	1424520	sunlight if you needed the sunlight energy to build that machinery in the first place?
1424520	1431040	But in 1977, Jack Corliss, Richard von Herzen, and Robert Ballard led an expedition to the
1431040	1437480	Galapagos Rift, one of our spreading centers, with the deep submersible elven, which at
1437480	1440320	that time was new.
1440320	1444240	They were drawn there because there had been measurements of the seawater overlying that
1444240	1447840	were anomalously warm, and so they suspected there were rock-water interactions taking
1447840	1449080	place.
1449080	1453000	But they were completely unprepared for what they would see, both about the geology and
1453000	1455760	about the life hosted there.
1455760	1460520	Immediately after those discoveries, there were new hypotheses about how life had originated
1460520	1465460	that are substantively much like what is mostly believed today.
1465460	1469680	But together with other changes that were going on around the same time in microbiology
1469680	1473840	and molecular biology, they completely changed our understanding of how the biosphere is
1473840	1478600	organized and what was its history.
1478600	1485840	So what Alvin saw, the first discovery, was these thundering plumes of sulfide and heavy
1485840	1490760	metal-rich water coming up from the deep, where they mix with cool seawater.
1490760	1495720	They precipitate these enormous chimneys that can be 45 or 60 feet tall.
1495720	1499480	This water would poison us immediately because of the metals and the sulfide that it's full
1499480	1500480	of.
1500480	1502640	The temperature differences are extreme.
1502640	1507520	350 degrees versus 4 degrees makes a mirror under this flange.
1507520	1512160	But the most amazing thing was the animal colonies that live around here.
1512160	1516920	The water would poison us, but it's the source of energy for entire ecosystems like these
1516920	1520800	tube worms and the shrimp that live around them.
1520800	1524840	Now the red color you see here, even though it looks like flowers, has nothing to do with
1524840	1527480	pigments because there's no light down here.
1527480	1528720	That's hemoglobin.
1528720	1534080	These are the worms' lung that stick out into the water to perform gas exchange.
1534080	1538640	But the most important thing of all about these ecosystems is that the worms don't build
1538640	1539640	life.
1539640	1541960	All of the life is built by bacteria.
1541960	1548080	The worms gather gases that the bacteria use to build their biomass in these shimmering
1548080	1551040	zones of mixing.
1551040	1557080	That was a whole parallel biosphere that was not anticipated.
1557080	1561280	But the Alvin expedition did more than show us that there's more diversity in the world
1561280	1563200	than we realized.
1563200	1568000	Similar with the other discoveries, it forced us to reconsider what it is that determines
1568000	1570400	living form.
1570400	1574000	There is a role for evolution in this, but I'll come back to evolution second because
1574000	1577040	it's actually not our first story.
1577040	1582160	The first story is that some of the patterns of life are written into the rules of chemistry
1582160	1588520	and the planetary energy flows before there's ever material for evolution to act on.
1588520	1593280	The important conclusion in this will not only be new insights about organisms, but
1593280	1599920	also a new way to understand ecosystems that makes them more fundamental than organisms.
1599920	1602600	So let me talk about typology.
1602600	1606960	Suppose we had to play a game of 20 questions where I had to learn as much about some organism
1606960	1610240	as possible in the fewest number of questions.
1610240	1612560	What should those questions be?
1612560	1615360	Turns out they would not first be about its history.
1615360	1617440	My choice of the first two would be these.
1617440	1620040	I would first ask, where does it get its energy?
1620040	1624800	Does it get its energy from molecules that give electrons the way hydrogen does or from
1624800	1628920	molecules that take electrons the way oxygen does?
1628920	1633020	Then second, I would ask, how much do I learn if I only see the organism?
1633020	1635640	Is the organism metabolically complete?
1635640	1639200	Does it feed itself, which is the condition called autotrophy?
1639200	1645600	Or is the organism incomplete so that it depends on an ecosystem to provide it, the condition
1645600	1649520	called heterotrophy or being fed from somebody else?
1649520	1653960	Because if it's incomplete, then even if I study that metabolism, I haven't understood
1653960	1656440	what is sufficient to make life.
1656440	1660880	So the first thing you realize is that everything we used to think about is down in this one
1660880	1662760	lower right corner here.
1662760	1664280	So they are not the norm.
1664280	1668920	The other thing you realize is that on this side, they're all green or they eat something
1668920	1671800	green or something that eats something green.
1671800	1675720	So these are the complicated guys and they were the ones we were trying to understand
1675720	1677720	from.
1677720	1680940	These are the ones that were discovered in the deep subsurface and the bottoms of the
1680940	1684240	oceans.
1684240	1688240	Now if we look at the evolutionary view and we reconstruct history, we realize that it's
1688240	1690240	telling us the same story.
1690240	1694480	Of course, people and most of the things people know exist at a little tiny tip of this tree
1694480	1695480	here.
1695480	1700760	And in fact, anything that has more than one cell lives on these few branches that have
1700760	1702780	slightly thickened lines.
1702780	1705080	Everything else in the world is unicells.
1705080	1711440	And before, I don't know, 600 million years ago, that was all there was in the world.
1711440	1715800	More than that, these are the only complex single celled organisms.
1715800	1719840	The cells that have the simpler form of bacteria make up the blue and red branches that are
1719840	1722280	the substance of the tree of life.
1722280	1729400	Now the remarkable thing is, as we have reconstructed the properties of these deep branches from
1729520	1735640	the way their ancestors are left on the tips here, we find that the bacteria that live
1735640	1739600	without oxygen are the good models for the root here.
1739600	1742200	And also many of them are heat loving.
1742200	1746600	So the bacteria that were discovered by the Alvin expedition are not some special branch
1746600	1749240	that's adapted to an extreme environment.
1749240	1751160	They are the foundation.
1751160	1756240	We are the special branch that occurred much later.
1756240	1759520	So of course, everything here I was talking about organisms, because for organisms you
1759520	1761720	can draw trees.
1761720	1765800	If we had talked instead about ecosystems, I could have done even better, because I
1765800	1769280	could have answered an enormous amount with only one question.
1769280	1771280	Where do they get their energy?
1771280	1775440	Because if we draw the boundaries big enough, every ecosystem is self-provisioning.
1775440	1779360	We don't live off of organic molecules from space anymore if we ever did.
1779360	1784760	So everything that is needed in an ecosystem is made by somebody in the ecosystem.
1784800	1789960	Here the major division is between the ones that live from electron donors without oxygen
1789960	1793880	and those that are powered ultimately by light on the surface.
1793880	1800400	But we learn something more, kind of like Tolstoy's happy families are all alike and
1800400	1804000	the unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.
1804000	1808000	The reductive ecosystems are actually all essentially alike.
1808000	1811480	They may not be the same at the level of organisms, but at the ecosystem level they're doing the
1811480	1813000	same thing.
1813000	1818920	Moreover, the process of building up biomass, the way these bacteria that oxidize iron and
1818920	1824840	leave rust as their waste product do, is essentially also present in here, but it's wrapped in
1824840	1829600	an energy suit where sunlight provides them what they're no longer getting from the earth's
1829600	1830720	battery.
1830720	1834520	So these are actually the fundamental and the deep.
1838320	1842160	So that leads us to a different view of the biosphere.
1842160	1847360	Metabolisms are not merely communities, they're entities in their own right.
1847360	1851040	The reason this matters for the origin of life is threefold.
1851040	1857560	First, the kinds of ecosystems, reductive or oxidative, are not primarily determined by
1857560	1861200	genetics or history, they're primarily determined by metabolism.
1861200	1868120	Second, the similarity of metabolisms is evident or the universality of metabolism can be seen
1868120	1872040	at the ecosystem level, not necessarily at the organism level.
1872040	1876840	So organisms cut up a puzzle in different ways, but the picture on the ecological puzzle
1876840	1879520	is always the same picture.
1879520	1882760	Here's the one that I need to argue to get you to accept.
1882760	1888080	It was not organisms that were the bridge from geochemistry into life, it was ecosystems.
1888080	1891880	The division of becoming special organisms came later.
1891880	1896920	So now I want to make the argument for plausibility for that.
1896920	1901920	To understand that argument though, we need to look more at metabolism because metabolism
1901920	1904320	is the special property.
1904320	1909040	And there are clues in the structure and the energetics of metabolism that are as remarkable
1909040	1912280	as anything I've showed you in the world of organisms.
1912280	1916720	Now usually if you look at metabolism, you of course instantly have a heart attack and
1916720	1922800	that's because we study metabolism from the level of human physiology and medicine.
1922800	1926320	It's kind of like taking a beautiful telescope and looking through the wrong end and saying,
1926320	1930040	it all seems so far away.
1930040	1933720	So this is what a typical metabolic map looks like in one of the major databases.
1933720	1939520	But even in this chaos, your eye is drawn to the order at the center of this circle.
1939520	1944120	What I want to show you is that this circle is in fact the knot that ties the whole thing
1944120	1945120	together.
1945120	1949720	It does in the entire biosphere all living things and apparently has throughout all of
1949720	1952840	history.
1952840	1955440	So this is what the core looks like a little bit closer.
1955440	1957360	It's called the citric acid cycle.
1957360	1959640	It's a cycle of 11 simple molecules.
1959640	1961120	The colored dots here are carbons.
1961120	1962800	I don't label them.
1962800	1964880	The smallest has only two carbons.
1964880	1967160	You go around to as many as six carbons.
1967160	1970400	That's citric acid.
1970400	1975880	We were all, well some of us were taught in high school biology that this cycle is important.
1975880	1976960	It's called the Krebs cycle.
1976960	1981480	We were told we needed to get energy from fats and oils so that we can live.
1981480	1985360	That's why it's important to us, but we're late and we're backward.
1985360	1991800	The reason the citric acid cycle is important to everything, and this is stunning, all molecules
1991800	1996440	that you use to make the entire biosphere originate in one of four or five compounds
1996440	1998200	in this cycle.
1998200	2002540	All the diversity that you see around you comes later, but the building is all done
2002540	2003800	from these.
2003800	2008440	Now I show them to us in the form of foods because we are not ecologically complete.
2008440	2012920	So we know most of them in terms of the foods we need to eat to live that some plant or
2012920	2014980	bacterium needs to make.
2014980	2019380	So this little two carbon compound, this is vinegar, and it's the starting point through
2019380	2021820	which all of the oils and fats are made.
2021820	2025580	The three carbon compound here makes all of the sugars, which are structural as well as
2025580	2027160	energy molecules.
2027160	2031740	This one here makes the special vitamins that bind metals, and that's why they have bright
2031740	2034620	colors, so chlorophyll and heme.
2034620	2038340	There are four different ones that make amino acids that are part of proteins, and then
2038340	2043380	from some of the amino acids we also make the nucleic acids, RNA and DNA.
2043380	2048220	So that's how the major classes of molecules come off of this small simple core.
2048220	2053260	So the first apparent problem with obtaining an origin of life, the problem of complexity,
2053260	2062740	now doesn't seem so bad, but that's not the only problem we have to address.
2062740	2066020	There's a classic view of life as a struggle for existence.
2066020	2070340	The term was coined by the Victorian Reverend Thomas Malthus, who was worried about population
2070340	2073620	and famines and wars.
2073620	2078300	And this was a term that was adopted also by Darwin and was fundamental to why natural
2078300	2079460	selection can work.
2079460	2081900	You overproduce and then you cull.
2081900	2084460	The same language permeates the sciences.
2084460	2089260	We talk about capturing resources or harnessing sunlight energy.
2089260	2094800	So the intuition is that things fall apart and that you're in the Sisyphean task of building
2094800	2097220	up against the forces of decay.
2097220	2099180	And in the oxygenic world, that's right.
2099180	2102660	If I take organic carbon, I can put it in a furnace and it'll burn and it'll go back
2102660	2107780	to carbon dioxide, which is where it started from.
2107780	2111260	But in the world of vents, the rules are different.
2111260	2118580	My colleague and friend Everett Shock has probably put this best, that instead of no
2118580	2122900	such thing as a free lunch or a struggle for existence, the vent world is a free lunch
2122900	2125020	you're paid to eat.
2125020	2127220	I'll show you how.
2127220	2129980	What I've done here is taken the citric acid cycle compounds.
2129980	2131660	They're the 11 different dots.
2131660	2135860	For a couple of them, I've drawn the molecules just so you can see where they go.
2135860	2141060	And on this axis, I've showed how many H2, how many electrons we add per carbon to build
2141060	2142220	the molecule.
2142220	2145300	So the sugars are two H2s per carbon.
2145300	2146980	The oils are three.
2146980	2152540	And then on this axis, I've shown the energy that's used to make the molecule starting
2152540	2156820	from hydrogen and CO2 because hydrogen is what the vent world provides.
2156820	2163100	And actually what you see is this is a downhill run all the way to methane here at CH4, that's
2163100	2165060	our greenhouse gas.
2165060	2171660	So in the vent world, you are not building up complexity as a struggle against the release
2171660	2173020	of energy.
2173020	2179020	You're building up complexity because that's the path of least resistance to release energy.
2179020	2182580	Now the reason that matters to the citric acid cycle I showed you before is that that's
2182580	2184360	what drags the cycle around.
2184360	2188580	You can think of it as an old fashioned water wheel, whereas the water flows over, it pulls
2188580	2190460	the cycle around.
2190460	2191760	This is the same picture.
2191760	2195160	I'm not showing you the other clutter, the hydrogens and oxygens, but I show you the
2195160	2196760	same molecules.
2196760	2202640	And the redder a carbon atom is colored, the more oxygens it has bound to it, the bluer
2202640	2205880	it's colored, the more hydrogens it has bound.
2205880	2212160	So you're sliding down the hill as more of your atoms become blue and fewer of them red.
2212160	2215840	This is the citric acid cycle in the same picture where I'm showing you each of the
2215840	2218760	11 molecules with only the carbons colored.
2218760	2224220	And what you can see, the cycle goes in this counterclockwise direction in the vent world.
2224220	2227800	We run it backward the wrong way where it makes no sense.
2227800	2233080	But in the vent world, red carbon, that's carbon dioxide, comes in and as it goes around
2233080	2238120	it gets moved toward the interior of the molecule and electrons get added.
2238120	2245840	So that process of adding electrons and using the available free energy, drags the cycle
2245840	2250960	around in the directions that the organisms use, and then that becomes the starting material
2250960	2253560	out of which they build the rest of biomass.
2253560	2261320	I'll come back and show you this a little bit later in a slightly different form.
2261320	2268000	So for now, the way the earth provides a battery and the way metabolism use it shows
2268000	2272600	the essential continuity between geochemistry and biochemistry.
2272600	2277400	That by itself would not be enough to judge whether the presence of life on earth is surprising
2277400	2278640	or inevitable.
2278640	2282620	To answer that question, we need to do something more.
2282620	2287520	And that's what requires that we reconsider what we think the living state is and what
2287520	2292200	the right kind of formal model for it is.
2292200	2296400	I want to argue that the way to understand, the way that makes sense of the fact that
2296400	2301840	life emerged on a lifeless earth and that it has persisted for almost four billion years
2301840	2306280	since is the concept of breakdown or failure.
2306280	2311360	So remember that we're trying to understand a pattern of motion.
2311360	2315040	Breakdown creates patterns of motion at the same time as it destroys certain patterns
2315040	2316960	of structure.
2316960	2320400	So things don't only fall apart.
2320400	2326720	Sometimes the events become ordered even as the structures are broken.
2326720	2332640	And so we have the concept that the origin of life could be a kind of collapse.
2332640	2338080	And once you have a collapse, the idea that when pushed hard enough, anything will give,
2338080	2341480	that brings with it the notion of necessity.
2341480	2347400	Because in the world of breakdowns, the things that persist are only the things that were
2347400	2353200	the favored state or the necessary state to begin with.
2353200	2354880	Now this is not an exotic idea.
2354880	2360200	It turns out that it's around us all the time.
2360200	2366280	The main thing you need in order to understand it is the idea of an energy flow channel.
2366280	2369520	There are lots of energy flow channels in the natural world.
2369520	2370520	Lightning is one.
2370520	2374720	We create a plasma that's very, very, very different from the surrounding dry air, but
2374720	2376760	it allows electricity to flow.
2376760	2381520	We create all this organization of wall storms in a cyclone because that transports heat
2381520	2384320	from the warm oceans to the upper atmosphere.
2384320	2389040	And this is not the disordered pattern of just thunderstorms or uniformly mixed air.
2389040	2396160	So these things are well understood in the physical sciences already.
2396160	2400640	The thing that's important to create a channel and the reason not all things form channels
2400640	2403040	is that there needs to be feedback.
2403040	2406160	Because in all of these systems, the initial stress is diffuse.
2406160	2409640	The clouds have a charge spread out over a great distance.
2409640	2412280	Or the oceans are warm over an enormous volume.
2412280	2418200	But the ice storms concentrate only in one area because that moves things more.
2418200	2421920	So I'll illustrate for you dynamically with the simplest of all channels, which is just
2421920	2425120	the propagation of a fracture.
2425120	2429040	If you could see a fracture propagating at the atomic scale, you would see that it's
2429040	2434340	a self-similar repeating sequence of events as bond after bond breaks.
2434340	2440360	The reason this is striking is that in the original crystal, there's plenty of energy
2440360	2443600	in the crystal as a whole to break the bonds.
2443600	2445480	But the energy is too diffuse.
2445480	2449360	And so by itself, it can't concentrate to rupture a bond.
2449360	2453880	The thing that causes the fracture to propagate in an orderly way instead of happening at
2453880	2459840	random everywhere is that the stress field in the surround, as it deforms, pulls the
2459840	2465720	stress from the bulk back down to atomic diameters and concentrates it.
2465720	2469320	This is what hydrothermal vents are doing for the Earth battery, because the battery
2469320	2472640	is accumulating over the entire atmosphere and interior.
2472640	2477120	But it's being focused at the regions where rock contacts water and the regions where
2477120	2480600	the altered water remixes with seawater.
2480600	2485200	Now I want to show you that this is actually what the citric acid cycle does within chemistry.
2485200	2489600	It performs a second kind of concentration.
2489600	2495160	So as the molecule goes around, it pulls in carbon, and then here it splits.
2495160	2497320	And both parts go back into the cycle.
2497320	2499800	So where you had one, you now have two.
2499800	2502520	That's the mathematics of compound interest.
2502520	2507320	And so you can exponentially grow and you concentrate material within the cycle.
2507320	2512320	Also like compound interest on an endowment, you can pull molecules off of this to make
2512320	2518640	your major classes of biological matter, but the material in the cycle is still available
2518640	2523600	to serve as a kind of flypaper that continues to pull carbon in over and over again.
2523600	2526440	So this is the second concentration.
2526440	2532160	Now the thing, this leads to an important way of thinking about the nature of life.
2532160	2536320	You could imagine that the optimization of this cycle was something carried out by evolution
2536320	2541360	later, but I think there's actually a better way to view it.
2541360	2543400	This cycle is self-amplifying.
2543400	2545880	It works from the environmental sources of carbon.
2545880	2551280	It works from the Earth's sources of electrons and everything in the biosphere is made from
2551280	2553040	it.
2553040	2557800	The biosphere is what you can make if these are the compounds you have.
2557800	2565600	And so this is why it becomes the core that organizes the whole rest of metabolism.
2565600	2568400	So does this give us a complete theory of origins?
2568400	2569400	Not nearly.
2569400	2571600	There's a lot of work to be done.
2571600	2578080	There are many problems to be solved and maybe many generations, maybe centuries of work
2578080	2582360	before we have a satisfactory theory the way we have a theory of matter, but it fundamentally
2582360	2585840	changes the way we ask questions.
2585840	2589520	When Darwin was trying to understand the origin of the world, even though he was a consummate
2589520	2594280	ecologist, he emphasized organisms because that was where he could say something concrete
2594280	2597000	about the action of selection.
2597000	2601200	His problem was to understand the patterns of relation, the fact that some things are
2601200	2604560	more similar to each other than they are to others.
2604560	2608880	And that was what led him to the importance of the tree of descent, the idea that the
2608880	2615120	degree of similarity could be understood in terms of how long ago you had a common ancestor.
2615120	2617960	But organisms, as we said, are very complicated.
2617960	2622360	And the tree of descent doesn't seem to do a very good job of explaining how you ever
2622360	2625160	arrive at that level of complexity.
2625160	2630280	This is the point that Jerry raised in the introduction, that what organisms are is
2630280	2634200	both part of the living biosphere, but they're also individual, and those are two different
2634200	2635960	things.
2635960	2639400	Today we would separate the problems, and I would say we ask the same question the
2639400	2641800	following way.
2641800	2647160	We recognize that being an organism or being a virus or being a gene or being a cell in
2647160	2651520	an organism is just one of many kinds of individuality.
2651520	2657240	And these forms of individuality almost condense like dew from a kind of a background of chemical
2657240	2662120	regularity, and that regularity is being carried by the ecosystem.
2662120	2667480	But like dew, which doesn't condense everywhere, the forms of individuality condense where
2667480	2673240	they have paths of least resistance laid down that make it easy.
2673240	2679160	And so the important point about all of the concentrating mechanisms in organic chemistry,
2679160	2685920	the cycles in metabolism, the Earth's battery, these define the paths of least resistance.
2685920	2689440	So we can come finally back to the question of chance and necessity.
2689440	2694360	There are two sort of classic pronouncements each made by a major and truly great scientist
2694360	2697640	that reflect exactly opposite points of view.
2697640	2703160	Jacques Monod worked on bacterial regulation and was one of the discoverers of how this
2703160	2704560	works.
2704560	2711120	His view from all of the complexity of genetics and genomic regulation was that life could
2711120	2716080	be understood in terms of scientific principles, but there was no hope of predicting.
2716080	2720640	He envisioned the trajectory of the biosphere through history as a kind of a random walk
2720640	2725640	where even the major steps could not have been foreseen.
2725640	2730320	Christian Dedeuve took exactly the opposite point of view in a way that's very subtle
2730320	2734240	and I think it's missed by many people.
2734240	2739280	Dedeuve recognized, of course, that the assembly of a modern cell would only be possible with
2739280	2744760	selection because there are so many choices, they have to be selected at each range.
2744760	2748800	But he went on to say something more delicate.
2748800	2756560	He said even the problem of producing the choices that selection can act on is so complicated,
2756560	2761760	it's very difficult to understand how that could happen in a process where everything
2761760	2763920	is equally probable.
2763920	2769000	And this was what led him to propose that the success of the evolutionary game, as he
2769000	2772840	puts it, was written into the fabric of the universe.
2772840	2777840	What I've wanted to show you in the earlier parts of this talk is where in chemistry and
2777840	2783520	in the properties of our planet those choices were laid down.
2783520	2785920	So I have many people that I need to thank for this.
2785920	2790240	I absolutely want to thank Jerry not only for the privilege of giving you this talk,
2790240	2794280	but for supporting my work and the work of my collaborators for more than a decade.
2794280	2800000	I want to thank a friend, William Melton, who supported us through the last two years
2800000	2802840	in which this book was brought to completion.
2802840	2805360	And Jerry also supported me during that time.
2805360	2809680	Of course the National Science Foundation for bringing the community together and the
2809680	2811760	three places.
2812760	2818760	Yeah, most importantly, Senefa Institute, that we're home for so many years.
2834760	2835760	Yes, please.
2835760	2847760	No, the oxygen is being left behind.
2847760	2850120	I should stand where I'm expected.
2850120	2852120	The oxygen is being left behind.
2852120	2856760	So what you're doing is you're losing oceans, but you're only losing the hydrogen part of
2856760	2857760	the oceans.
2857760	2858760	Good?
2858760	2864760	Yes, but are we also gaining anything from the solar wind?
2864760	2869120	Some, but probably not a lot.
2869120	2871120	We're not gaining water.
2871120	2872120	We might...
2872120	2876760	I don't know, it's a great question.
2876760	2881480	I don't know what the rate of gain of hydrogen is from the solar wind, quantitatively.
2881480	2886200	I know it's less than the rate of loss, but I don't know by an order of magnitude how
2886200	2887200	much less.
2887200	2888200	Thank you.
2888200	2889200	Good.
2890200	2896200	In the back, yes, please.
2896200	2904200	So you're likely familiar with the debates on whether viruses are considered alive or
2904200	2905200	not.
2905200	2911280	I imagine, at least I've heard of cases where a virus can be as simple as just a replicating
2911280	2918960	molecule like RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein code, not doing anything like metabolism.
2918960	2922720	So do you think that means it is not alive?
2922720	2923720	Great.
2923720	2927160	Yeah, lovely question.
2927160	2931720	I'm going to answer that by saying that the whole question turns out to use a form of
2931720	2936440	English that's not meaningful in the following sense.
2936440	2939960	So here's a little bit of logical semantics.
2939960	2943800	Work with me and tell me if this works for you.
2943800	2951760	If I use the term living thing, a thing is a noun, living is a predicate, right?
2951760	2956040	What that means is I imagine that I can take the whole world of things which are fundamental
2956040	2961040	and I can divide them into two sets, the living ones and the non-living ones.
2961040	2968200	But if things are not fundamental and if life is not a property inherent in things, then
2968200	2971360	the whole notion living thing is a set of words.
2971360	2975680	They satisfy the rules of syntax, but it's not clear they actually mean anything.
2975680	2981320	So what happens if the property of being alive is defined by participating in the order of
2981320	2986400	the biosphere, all the things that build it up, all those that break it down, and what
2986400	2991800	we're seeing in cells and viruses is a form of individuality.
2991800	2998360	Now I say is a virus one of the forms of individuality in its life cycle when it's just RNA and
2998360	2999360	a code?
2999360	3000360	Absolutely.
3000360	3005120	And we can talk scientifically about what's special about that form, what makes it different
3005120	3010960	from a cell, but I don't ever ask the question is the virus alive or not because the virus
3010960	3015920	is part of the biosphere and it partakes of the character of the living state from the
3015920	3018840	biosphere as a whole.
3018840	3023960	So that's a little bit heavy as a way to answer a very good question, but I think it's the
3023960	3032840	answer that will stand the test of time.
3032840	3035840	I'll come right back to you.
3035840	3036840	Yes.
3036840	3041560	I've read there are some, you know, the big bang at the beginning of that kind of life
3041560	3047200	that what preceded it was a consciousness or the idea for the universe to grow.
3047200	3053720	So could you apply that to what you're talking about here that there was a consciousness that
3053720	3060120	helps to move this or create the origins of life and create, you know, a place for that
3060120	3063000	life to grow?
3063000	3069320	That's not a language I have the ability to use in any comfortable way.
3069320	3074680	In the, no, in a very particular sense, right?
3074680	3080600	I could say that once a snowflake is formed, like commonplace processes, we can talk about
3080600	3085280	aspects of the pattern that makes one snowflake different from another.
3085280	3090840	And in a similar sense, I can go through the emergence of life on a planet and then organisms
3090840	3096240	and then nervous systems and somewhere late, late, late, I have these incredibly complicated
3096240	3099560	patterns that we just barely understand.
3099560	3105720	And for me, it's natural to look for consciousness as a character of patterns at that late level.
3105720	3111720	But in the same sense as I would not ask whether something about the snowflake was before the
3111720	3116680	properties of water because it seems to be at the wrong end, I'm not able to use a language
3116680	3121160	that puts consciousness at the low level.
3121160	3125720	As a form of non-physical energy, we talk a lot about physical energies, but we don't
3125720	3130920	talk about non-physical energies and consciousness could be considered, if it's thought of that
3130920	3135280	way, then it predates everything, doesn't come after the snowflake, comes before the
3135280	3136280	snowflake.
3136280	3137280	No, you know.
3137280	3141520	Anyway, I just wonder if these kind of, the sciences don't all kind of talk with each
3141520	3142520	other.
3142520	3146840	And I think there's some ways to where they can, where there is interdisciplinary study
3146840	3147840	there.
3147840	3148840	I'm just questioning.
3148840	3150320	I think it's wonderful that you ask.
3150320	3154160	I think it's a right conversation to have.
3154160	3160040	I think it's very hard to talk and to listen both.
3160040	3165440	And I will admit that my view is pretty much a mechanics view of a great many things, and
3165440	3171160	perhaps that limits the set of things I can say.
3171160	3180000	Well, I think you have largely answered the question I was going to ask.
3180000	3187440	And it is, indeed, the idea, I understand how you followed this path of metabolism of
3187440	3193320	energy into living forms as a necessity and how it comes to be.
3193320	3201000	And that hypothesis is new to me, but I'm missing the same thing, the difference between
3201000	3209280	the rock and organic and inorganic carbon and carbon, whether or not what we've always
3209280	3214920	called the life cycle or the carbon cycle, the things you learn in chemistry.
3214920	3220320	I was at the particular properties that tell us whether or not the energy is living or
3220320	3225200	non-living in that whole origin and metabolism.
3225200	3227560	Have you given any thought to that?
3227560	3231600	I think you've already answered it in the last thing you said, but what are your own
3231600	3232600	thoughts about that?
3232600	3238000	And do you have any idea of using the scientific method to try to discern that?
3239000	3240000	Good.
3240000	3245800	So that has some words in it that I can't address because I know how to use them carefully.
3245800	3252920	The notion of energy is one that we have struggled tremendously to get clear for the last 250
3252920	3260840	years, and one of the great triumphs, I think, of a unification in science is that energy
3260840	3267720	is energy, and so it's precisely because the role of energy in the non-living world
3267720	3272880	and in the living world is the same role that we can understand how the living world
3272880	3275560	embeds in the non-living world.
3275560	3280400	And so that's not a place where I think it's correct to look for differences.
3280400	3288880	I think humans are great at when they haven't seen something, imagining something different
3288880	3290720	from the truth.
3290720	3294920	Paths of least resistance and failure modes are incredibly complicated, and we've only
3294920	3296440	figured out a few of them.
3296440	3300600	I think there's huge scientific mileage in learning how to do that in the dominates of
3300600	3303680	dynamics and of chemistry, where we're just babies.
3303680	3305720	We've only begun to form science in those domains.
3315920	3322680	Does every hydrothermal vent have life associated with it?
3322680	3326440	Are the chemistries the same across all those different vents?
3326440	3331800	So they've all been created de novo, but all been the same.
3331800	3332800	Superb question.
3332800	3337640	Yes, no, and no.
3337640	3340000	No.
3340000	3345200	If I could give you an hour-long talk on only this one subject in a university department,
3345200	3347720	the things I would tell you.
3347720	3354080	So first thing to realize, there is no place we have ever drilled, dived, or flown in the
3354080	3356840	earth that we have not found life.
3356840	3360360	Which is one of the reasons it's so hard to understand origin, because everything has
3360360	3362880	been colonized by somebody modern.
3362880	3368400	So not only does every vent have life in it, every mineshaft hole has life in it, everything
3368400	3372920	that gets blown up from the subsurface in a volcano winds up having life in it.
3372920	3374680	So there's life everywhere.
3374680	3381800	There is certainly life that is uniquely hosted by the energy at vents, but your next question
3381800	3385320	is wonderfully perceptive, because it is not all the same.
3385320	3390120	The vent chemistry is not all the same, and the life that they host tracks that vent chemistry
3390120	3391800	quite in detail.
3391800	3394680	So the vents that I showed you are the charismatic ones.
3394680	3398400	Let me give you two-line thing about geology.
3398400	3406280	I told you that the deep rock in the earth has mostly this iron 2 plus character to it.
3406280	3408600	When it comes up it gets oxidized.
3408600	3412800	That's the process of converting what's called mantle into crust.
3412800	3416960	Normally you don't see mantle on the surface, you only see crust on the surface, and the
3416960	3422600	magmas that make crust, when they interact with water, they create these black smokers
3422600	3427240	that are full of metals and they have a very acidic pH 2 or 3.
3427240	3431920	In rare cases, you can actually get some of the material that's supposed to be protected
3431920	3434600	down below exposed on the surface.
3434600	3436720	It can be stripped off by faulting.
3436720	3439480	The picture I showed you of the lithosphere is Oman.
3439480	3443080	It's a place where continent formation actually causes it to be shoved up on the surface of
3443080	3444680	dry land.
3444680	3452280	In those areas, it turns out you do not produce acidic vents, you produce alkaline vents, and
3452280	3454920	you produce enormous amounts of hydrogen.
3454920	3458880	If I showed you the undersea version of those, they do not have black smoke because without
3458880	3463760	acid they don't dissolve metals, they don't dissolve sulfide, instead they're white and
3463760	3467480	shimmery and they produce carbonate chimneys in today's oceans.
3467480	3472400	If you looked at those, you would not find tube worms, you would not find crabs or snails
3472400	3474440	or clams or shrimp.
3474440	3478680	You would find only bacteria and archaea, so it would be a very dull picture compared
3478680	3484160	to the one I showed you, but it's enormously important because it turns out I think the
3484160	3489160	reason, and there are so many things I didn't tell you about even the black smoker world,
3489160	3493320	in spite of the fact that they live on a tiny energy budget far from the sun, those tube
3493320	3499320	worms are actually the fastest grown organisms known, that's the fastest production of biomass
3499320	3504560	of any known system, and I think the reason for that is that we need metals to live and
3504560	3507480	that's what those vents are producing in profusion.
3507480	3512120	Without the metals, you go into a much sort of more miserly mode of life where only the
3512160	3517160	most conservative bacteria and archaea can make it, but thank you.
3517160	3523160	Great, and we have a couple people here on the side too.
3523160	3530160	What do you think of the theory of panspermia as the cause of life and could you define
3531360	3532360	it for the audience?
3532360	3539360	Yes, with pleasure, good, so panspermia was the idea that in the non-polemical form,
3543080	3546960	life may not have originated on earth, it may have originated somewhere else and been
3546960	3550240	transported to earth.
3550240	3555920	Now the polemical form, it's really hard to understand how life originated on earth and
3555920	3560000	we only had four and a half billion years to do it.
3560000	3564320	The universe is 13 billion years old, so that's more than a factor of two, maybe if we had
3564320	3567600	the whole universe we'd have more time.
3567600	3571520	Now that was the old fashioned version, sort of the 1970s version.
3571520	3575440	There are more modern and more sophisticated versions where people say that some of the
3575440	3580680	things about the electron battery that I showed you are actually stronger on Mars than they
3580680	3586520	are on earth and some of the properties of water may have been easier early on.
3586520	3590760	Those are very technical arguments and I don't know how to evaluate them.
3590760	3596960	I consider those to be the most plausible arguments that there could be important chemistry
3596960	3602120	relevant to the origin of life that could be on a planet other than our own where the
3602120	3607240	life evolved to some significant degree of complexity and was then transported here.
3607240	3612880	For my own preference, I regard those with suspicion because I think when we find something
3612880	3617960	difficult, we probably say, oh that must mean it's impossible and our understanding is too
3617960	3621960	primitive to draw a conclusion like that at this point.
3621960	3625340	We understand how hard it is to make life on earth precisely because we understand the
3625340	3631100	chemistry of life on earth so well and so is it sensible to go someplace where we understand
3631100	3636500	the chemistry less well where we have to rely on transport through space to deliver but
3636500	3638620	then here's the most important thing.
3638620	3643620	If you think my argument has any validity that we should look at life as a breakdown process
3643620	3648340	so that only the only things that persist are the things that were the native state anyway
3648340	3651180	and you just had to get to them.
3651180	3656020	If life on earth was not the native state to get into and it was a more native state
3656020	3660780	somewhere else then why would it have been a robust thing to build it there and transport
3660780	3661900	it here?
3661900	3666500	Why would it have survived here for four billion years without interruption if it was not a
3666500	3668940	thing that would natively form here?
3668940	3673020	Now that's not strong enough to be a science argument and I understand its weakness but
3673020	3678020	that direction is the drift of my not worrying a lot about penspermia.
3678020	3679020	Hi.
3679020	3688940	Do you agree to the theories of George Wald who said that life came from an electric
3688940	3694500	strike like lightning that hit the elements, the earth's primordial atmosphere and life
3694500	3695500	evolved from that.
3695500	3699900	There was experiments where amino acids evolved into proteins in life form.
3699900	3702940	Do you agree with those theories?
3702940	3711500	I would not repeat them in the way their original investigators believed them to be true.
3711500	3714340	Again to speak a little bit carefully.
3714340	3717420	Lightning strikes turn out to matter on earth because they do something very difficult.
3717420	3722700	They take N2 which is a very strong molecule and they break it up into the forms of nitrogen
3722700	3725660	that wind up being chemically interesting.
3725660	3731740	That may matter but I think it only matters at the scale of the whole planetary dynamic.
3731740	3735740	The chemistry of the atmosphere is extremely different from the chemistry of life.
3735740	3738740	You remember I said that chemistry in water is very restrictive and there are a lot of
3738740	3741140	things that you can't do with it.
3741140	3747300	The chemistry of carbon and of metals in the deep subsurface is incredibly similar to our
3747300	3748780	biochemistry.
3748780	3753380	So much so that you can look at enzymes that use metals and they use them as if they had
3753380	3758260	just taken a mineral center and learned how to harness it for certain types of jobs.
3758300	3762580	Those things were not known when George Wald was writing these things and I think a lot
3762580	3766500	of the opinions you're talking about come more from Stanley Miller and the followers
3766500	3770900	of Stanley Miller after 1953.
3770900	3774900	His experiments were groundbreaking but there are two things, two ways you can interpret
3774900	3775900	them.
3775900	3779860	One you could suppose that those experiments were good models for the origin of life.
3779860	3783940	That I think doesn't hold up so well now though there are still many people who would disagree
3783940	3785420	with me.
3785420	3789900	But what you could say instead is if chemistry in the atmosphere that's so different from
3789900	3796420	biochemistry led to amino acids many of which are the same as those in biochemistry what
3796420	3802100	should we be learning about the paths of least resistance in organic chemistry that can cause
3802100	3807260	very different starting points to collapse into a few paths and then kind of like trees
3807260	3809820	growing along the waterways in the desert.
3809820	3814660	Does biochemistry use the chemicals it does because it's following those paths of least
3814660	3821140	resistance even if we learned about them in the wrong environment?
3821140	3823780	And there's somebody who really wants to ask another question and I don't want to cut
3823780	3824780	them off.
3824780	3828180	Okay, so you will be the last one.
3828180	3831180	You've had your hand up three or four times.
3831180	3840260	No, I'm almost embarrassed to stand up considering the quality of all the questions here but as
3840260	3845180	a practical matter we are so familiar with the term climate change and what's happening
3845180	3847420	in climate change.
3847420	3853160	Is mankind doing anything relative to climate change that would affect your theories in
3853160	3859020	any way shape or form or is they two completely different subjects?
3859020	3864100	I'm so glad that you got a chance to ask because it would have been a shame not to hear.
3864100	3869740	I don't think that the things that people are doing affect the theories but I would
3869740	3874660	like this work to affect the things that people do.
3874660	3877660	So this was the point that Jerry opened with.
3877660	3883380	In biology too much we have put ecosystem sensibility kind of in the periphery and we
3883380	3889220	focused on organisms and when we interact with a natural world whether we do it industrially
3889220	3894900	or agronomically we try to engineer organisms and we try to influence systems with a few
3894900	3900780	components as if we were building a watch or a bridge and routinely it winds up putting
3900780	3906900	us in places where we don't want to be or where we shouldn't want to be.
3906900	3917020	If biology can anchor ecology more centrally and start to understand the regression of ecosystems
3917020	3922420	towards certain patterns that it's very hard to pull them away from maybe biology can help
3922420	3927460	us head off misunderstandings in the world of application and make us a little bit more
3927460	3932620	intelligent or in some cases a little bit more precautionary about what we do.
3932620	3938660	Biology as a science is sound but biology as a science is not always proactive enough
3938660	3941620	to anticipate the mistakes people are going to make.
3941620	3947180	A more ecological biology may prime us to be a little bit better at second guessing the
3947180	3949620	things that can go wrong and trying to be careful ahead of time.
