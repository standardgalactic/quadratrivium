00:00.000 --> 00:20.120
Good afternoon everyone. If you could take your seats. I'm Elliot Gerson and it is my

00:20.120 --> 00:29.680
great privilege to introduce the next session. It is really, in a sense, central to the theme

00:29.680 --> 00:36.120
of many of the things that you've been hearing about this week, the world on fire, populism,

00:36.120 --> 00:43.080
the rise of authoritarianism, and basically the whole mess in the world that we've been

00:43.080 --> 00:49.320
talking about through one prism or another over the last few days and we will continue

00:49.320 --> 00:56.440
to. And we are going to have someone address the root causes of that in a way that no one

00:56.440 --> 01:02.280
else could and he is someone who certainly needs no introduction and I don't want to

01:02.280 --> 01:08.000
take time away from him and after his remarks you'll all have an opportunity to ask questions.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.480
But I will, given the fact that it is the 20th anniversary of the Ideas Festival, say something

01:14.480 --> 01:20.800
about our guest who you know all about his distinctions. You read him, you follow him,

01:20.800 --> 01:26.880
you watch him. He also has a long history with the Institute. He co-founded and the

01:26.880 --> 01:32.880
chairs weave the social fabric project. But more significantly, although it's pretty

01:32.880 --> 01:38.040
wonderful, in the annals of the Ideas Festival I can now say to you officially, because I

01:38.040 --> 01:44.200
went back to our archives and confirmed this, that no one has spoken at the Ideas Festival

01:44.200 --> 01:52.040
more than David Brooks. And appropriately. David, I think one reason when we created

01:52.040 --> 01:57.640
this, we had no idea if it would survive more than 2005. One reason it was so successful

01:57.640 --> 02:03.840
was David Brooks. And then a couple years after that he came and he has been here every

02:03.840 --> 02:10.120
year, every year since. There is no one spoken as often. A couple of other things that make

02:10.160 --> 02:17.880
him an exception here, an entirely deserved exception. One is that early in this process

02:17.880 --> 02:22.360
of the Ideas Festival, Guinea and I decided that we would have a rule to make sure we

02:22.360 --> 02:27.200
keep things fresh and people would come back for new things every year. We had a rule that

02:27.200 --> 02:32.440
no one would speak more than three consecutive years. But of course we had to have the David

02:32.440 --> 02:38.000
Brooks exception and we do. And the other thing that this is an example of an exception

02:38.000 --> 02:45.160
of is that we decided at the very beginning that the format we would use in almost all

02:45.160 --> 02:51.760
instances is conversation and dialogue. Either an interview or a moderated panel. And that

02:51.760 --> 02:57.360
we were not going to have lectures as one often has at other kinds of conferences and

02:57.360 --> 03:04.400
events. But then again, given the wisdom, insight and popularity of this man, we had

03:04.440 --> 03:11.280
to make a second David Brooks exception, which was to allow him to have these kinds of formats

03:11.280 --> 03:16.440
with regularity. So without any further ado, it's my great pleasure and privilege to bring

03:16.440 --> 03:18.640
up David Brooks.

03:18.640 --> 03:25.640
I should correct, Elliot. I haven't actually spoken more than anybody else. It just seems

03:25.640 --> 03:33.640
that way. I read my first book for book on tape and the sound engineer told me a story

03:33.640 --> 03:38.480
when you read your book for audio, you realize how boring your book is and how often you

03:38.480 --> 03:42.600
repeat yourselves. But the sound engineer told me the story that there was a novelist who

03:42.600 --> 03:47.960
was reading a 700 page novel. And he's in the middle of it and the sound engineer looks

03:47.960 --> 03:54.280
in and the novelist is weeping. And so the engineer says, there's something I can do.

03:54.280 --> 04:00.880
And the novelist says, don't I ever shut up? And so that's me at Aspen. Now every other

04:00.920 --> 04:07.920
talk I've given here has been about how to live a better life, how to improve your life.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.640
This one is not because of the global situation. I thought I should rise to the occasion and

04:12.640 --> 04:17.120
try to diagnose the whole global situation. But I felt guilty about that that if I don't

04:17.120 --> 04:21.360
give you some practical life tips, your lives will fall apart over the next year before

04:21.360 --> 04:24.960
I can give my next talk. So in the first few minutes, I'm going to give you some actual

04:25.000 --> 04:30.880
life hacks, which I got from the internet or the Bible, one of the two. And so here

04:30.880 --> 04:34.960
are a few life hacks. These are practical life hacks. Then I'll get to politics. When

04:34.960 --> 04:40.960
you have 90% of a large project finish, finishing up the final details will take another 90%.

04:40.960 --> 04:47.960
Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks. Getting cheated occasionally

04:48.680 --> 04:53.240
is a small price to pay for trusting the best in everyone. Because when you trust the best

04:53.240 --> 04:58.880
in others, they will treat you the best. Purchase a tourist guidebook to your hometown.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.720
You'll learn a lot playing tourist once a year. The thing that made you weird as a kid

05:03.720 --> 05:10.720
will make you outstanding as an adult. It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse.

05:10.720 --> 05:15.240
Just because it's not your fault doesn't mean it's not your responsibility. If you think

05:15.240 --> 05:22.240
you saw a mouse, you did. And if you saw one, there are others. If you can't make up your

05:22.240 --> 05:27.000
mind between two options, flip a coin. But don't go by how the coin comes up. Go by your

05:27.000 --> 05:32.560
emotional reaction to how the coin went up. Take photos of your parents every day. That's

05:32.560 --> 05:37.760
how you'll want to remember them. If you meet a jerk once a month, you've met a jerk. If

05:37.760 --> 05:44.000
you meet a jerk every day, you're the jerk. Don't ever look at a recent photo of your

05:44.000 --> 05:48.880
first great love. And this one is from Warren Buffet. You can always tell someone to go

05:48.880 --> 05:52.400
to hell tomorrow, which is good. When you're mad at them, you can tell them to go to hell

05:52.400 --> 06:00.480
tomorrow, way today. So that's my life-altering advice for you cramped into about 90 seconds.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.640
Now we turn to politics. Now, I got my political start when I was five. My parents were somewhat

06:05.640 --> 06:10.040
left-wing. We lived in New York, and they took me to a place where hippies would go called

06:10.040 --> 06:15.920
a be-in. And a be-in was where hippies would go to show how little they cared about money

06:15.920 --> 06:20.360
and material things. And one of the ways they showed this was they set a garbage can on

06:20.360 --> 06:25.860
fire, threw their wallets into it, just to show we don't care about money. I'm five

06:25.860 --> 06:30.680
years old. I see a $5 bill on fire in the garbage can. I break from the crowd, reach

06:30.680 --> 06:34.800
into the fire, grab the money, and run away. And that was sort of my first step over to

06:34.800 --> 06:42.640
the right. And so I veered right, and then I veered left. But the main thing I am, like

06:42.640 --> 06:49.000
all of us probably in this room, is I believe in liberal democracy. And I was a foreign

06:49.000 --> 06:54.080
correspondent in the 1990s at the High Water Mark of liberal democracy. I was in the Soviet

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
Union, if you remember, in the final days of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin was the

06:58.080 --> 07:03.360
democratically elected president of Russia, and this old Soviet apparatus staged a coup.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.120
And they had tanks rolling through the town, and Yeltsin, if you recall, stood on a tank

07:08.120 --> 07:12.000
in front of the Russian White House, the parliament building, and said, I dare you,

07:12.000 --> 07:19.200
shoot me. And all the democratic activists surrounded him to offer sort of a buffer.

07:19.200 --> 07:24.840
And I was there, and I found a woman who was handing out sandwiches to the democratic protesters.

07:24.840 --> 07:31.200
And her name was Valentina Kossieva, and she was 93. And so I asked her to tell her

07:31.200 --> 07:35.560
me her life story, and she told me that she'd grown up in the Palace of the Tsar before

07:35.560 --> 07:40.440
the revolution. Just after the revolution, she'd been lined up for a firing squad because

07:40.440 --> 07:46.800
she was on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution. Her mother saved her life. She got married.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.920
Her husband was disappeared in the 1930s, purged and sent to the Siberia and never to return.

07:51.920 --> 07:57.400
Her two boys were killed in the Battle of Stalingrad by the Nazis. One of her sons was

07:57.400 --> 08:02.560
rifle-butted to death. And then she married again. Her second husband also was sent away

08:02.560 --> 08:08.080
to the Gulag, and she never saw him again. And then in the 1950s, under Khrushchev, she

08:08.080 --> 08:13.080
was part of the Kalmyk people, which is a Muslim people, and they were sent off to exile.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.840
And so my brilliant interviewing techniques when she's telling me this story is, and then

08:17.840 --> 08:22.480
what happened? And then what happened? And basically every bad thing that happened in

08:22.480 --> 08:28.240
Soviet history happened to her. And they were so moving to be talking to her at age 93,

08:28.240 --> 08:33.840
asking out sandwiches at what we thought would be the rise of Democratic Russia. And

08:33.840 --> 08:39.360
it didn't turn out that way, obviously. And I covered in those days the end of apartheid.

08:39.360 --> 08:44.600
I covered the Oslo peace process. A participant is in the room. And I covered the reunification

08:44.600 --> 08:49.680
of Germany. I covered nothing but good news for five years. History has since taken a

08:49.680 --> 08:54.120
dark turn. And the interesting thing about the dark turn it has taken, especially this

08:54.200 --> 09:00.080
year, is that it's happening all around the world. I was raised with the idea that we

09:00.080 --> 09:05.920
Americans are outliers. We're more individualistic, we're more mobile, we're just outliers compared

09:05.920 --> 09:10.680
to most other countries in the world. That is not true anymore. The Ipsos organization,

09:10.680 --> 09:16.880
which is a British firm, asked people in 28 countries about certain attitudes. And we

09:16.880 --> 09:23.600
are absolutely typical of the world now. Our pessimism is typical. 59 percent of Americans

09:23.640 --> 09:27.800
say they believe our country is in decline. That's compared to 58 percent of people around

09:27.800 --> 09:33.120
the world. 60 percent of Americans agree with a statement that the system is broken, compared

09:33.120 --> 09:39.920
to 61 percent worldwide. Our hostility to elites is absolutely typical. 69 percent of

09:39.920 --> 09:44.040
Americans think that the political and economic elite don't care about hardworking people

09:44.040 --> 09:49.920
compared to 67 percent worldwide. 63 percent of Americans agree that experts in this country

09:49.960 --> 09:54.960
don't know what they're talking about compared to 62 percent worldwide. We're just typical.

09:54.960 --> 10:00.360
Even our authoritarianism is typical. 66 percent of Americans say the country needs a strong

10:00.360 --> 10:05.080
leader to take it back from the rich and the powerful compared to 63 percent worldwide.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.920
40 percent of Americans, we need a strong leader who will break the rules compared to

10:08.920 --> 10:15.920
41 percent worldwide. So there are two things to take from this. The first is that we're

10:16.160 --> 10:20.680
typical. We're no longer extraordinary. We're a typical country with typical beliefs. And

10:20.680 --> 10:25.400
the second is that all around the world in all these 28 countries measured there's an

10:25.400 --> 10:32.000
incredible hostility to the system and infertile landscape for right wing populism. And if

10:32.000 --> 10:35.840
you look around elections of the world, it's a big election year, you see right wing populists

10:35.840 --> 10:41.280
thriving in place after place. So Geert Wilders, the right wing populist in the Netherlands,

10:41.320 --> 10:47.840
party rose to power in the European elections. The German AFD, very far right group, surged

10:47.840 --> 10:53.080
in France. The Marine Le Pen party surged, causing the whole French political system

10:53.080 --> 10:57.560
to go into meltdown. You look at Indonesia, you look around Latin America. Right wing

10:57.560 --> 11:04.040
populists are surging all around the country. And of course, here at home, Donald Trump,

11:04.040 --> 11:08.520
the economist says it's about two thirds likely that Donald Trump will be a reelected president.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.320
That's typical of what's happening all around the world. And so to me, it's a mistake. We're

11:14.320 --> 11:19.480
going to watch the debate tonight, but it's a mistake to see the U.S. election in isolation

11:19.480 --> 11:24.200
from these global trends. And if Trump ends up winning, it'll be because there's just this

11:24.200 --> 11:33.200
global tide in country after country after country. And so what's going on? Why has this

11:33.280 --> 11:39.080
happened? Why is it happening all around the world all at once? Now, there are certain

11:39.080 --> 11:43.800
obvious things we could say. People are reacting against globalization. There have been policy

11:43.800 --> 11:48.440
failures, the financial crisis, Afghanistan, Iraq. But these policy failures are not all

11:48.440 --> 11:53.640
around the world, and yet right wing populism is all around the world. Something deeper

11:53.640 --> 12:00.640
is going on. And I think it's some sort of global spiritual relational and moral crisis.

12:01.080 --> 12:07.680
And it shows up in the deepest essences of our societies. So the first thing is, and

12:07.680 --> 12:12.200
I'll just take U.S. statistics, we've just gotten a lot sadder as a society, rising

12:12.200 --> 12:16.640
suicide rates, rising mental health problems. The number of people who say they have no

12:16.640 --> 12:21.440
close personal friends is up by four folds since 2000. The number of teenagers who say

12:21.440 --> 12:27.000
they are persistently hopeless and despondent is 45%. The number of people not in a romantic

12:27.040 --> 12:31.280
relationship is up by a third since 2000. The number of people who rate themselves in

12:31.280 --> 12:36.680
the lowest happiness category is up by 50% since 2000. So we've just become a lot sadder

12:36.680 --> 12:41.840
as a society. And when you get sadder, you get meaner. I give you all these stats statistics.

12:41.840 --> 12:46.200
I can give you a bunch of mean statistics, gun violence, hate crimes. The one that gets

12:46.200 --> 12:50.440
to me, it used to be two thirds of Americans give to charity, now fewer than half of Americans

12:50.440 --> 12:55.680
give to charity. We've just become sadder and meaner. And that's deep in the fabric

12:55.720 --> 13:01.920
of society. We've also gotten a lot more pessimistic. And some of that is the media's fault. We've

13:01.920 --> 13:06.440
determined that we can get your eyeballs if we create headlines that generate fear and

13:06.440 --> 13:11.520
anger. And so the number of headlines that generate fear and anger is up by about 200%

13:11.520 --> 13:18.520
over the last 15 years. But it's not only the media. Some researchers took a look at

13:18.800 --> 13:25.800
sort of global conversation in print starting in 1850 up till today. And they measured how

13:26.160 --> 13:32.000
many of the books, magazine articles, newspaper articles, whatever, how many of them were positive

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
and how many were negative. And from 1850 to about 2008, most of this stuff was positive.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.560
There were dips during the Great Depression, which you'd expect. And there were increases

13:43.600 --> 13:49.240
in the 1990s when we had prosperity. But basically, we're a pretty happy country. And then starting

13:49.240 --> 13:55.240
in the financial crisis, but ever since, the negativity of American culture has just collapsed.

13:55.240 --> 13:59.320
So we have a more negative public culture than we did in the Great Depression, than

13:59.320 --> 14:03.680
during World War II, than during World War I, than any of the crises of the past 150

14:03.680 --> 14:09.480
years. We just are an incredibly pessimistic country. And if you've been asked high school

14:10.480 --> 14:15.480
students, the share of high school students who say it's hard to have hope for my life

14:15.480 --> 14:22.480
has been surging. And so this negativity has a political valence. On the right, it manifests

14:22.800 --> 14:27.640
as catastrophism. And so I interview a lot of Trump people. And the general theme you

14:27.640 --> 14:33.280
hear over and over and over again is this country is on the verge of total destruction.

14:33.280 --> 14:39.200
It's just a catastrophizing mentality. On the left, it shows up in the form of mental

14:39.200 --> 14:45.560
health problems and depression. And so 34% of conservatives say they report feeling in

14:45.560 --> 14:52.320
poor mental health at least half the time, 34% of conservatives. But 57% of progressive

14:52.320 --> 14:56.160
young people say they report feeling negative mental health. Just higher rates of mental

14:56.160 --> 15:02.000
health problems, higher rates of neuroticism. And it's very gendered. 41% of liberal males

15:02.040 --> 15:07.080
say they have poor mental health compared to 60% of liberal females. It's not clear

15:07.080 --> 15:13.840
to me why this is happening, but you see the mental health crisis feeding into our politics.

15:13.840 --> 15:20.040
And so my underlying point is that the global crisis of populism and the rise of authoritarianism

15:20.040 --> 15:26.720
is not just about policy and politics. We're undergoing a global spiritual recession. And

15:26.720 --> 15:32.400
a lot of people are trying to use politics as a form of social therapy. Remember Ryan

15:32.400 --> 15:36.720
Streeter is a researcher formerly at the American Enterprise Institute. He discovered

15:36.720 --> 15:41.000
that people who call themselves lonely are seven times more likely than others to be

15:41.000 --> 15:46.960
active in politics. So there's a lot of lonely people dominating our political activism.

15:46.960 --> 15:51.880
In a healthy society, we have what you call the politics of redistribution. We have big

15:51.880 --> 15:56.080
arguments, but there are arguments about how high taxes should be or where spending

15:56.080 --> 16:00.920
should go. And that's in a healthy society. We don't have that kind of politics anymore.

16:00.920 --> 16:05.760
We have the politics of recognition. People are going into politics in order to feel good

16:05.760 --> 16:10.080
about themselves and in order to make the other side feel shamed. They're going out

16:10.080 --> 16:16.480
for a sense of purpose and meaning. And so people are using politics to fill a hole in

16:16.480 --> 16:23.160
their own soul, to be affirmed and to get retribution on the people they dislike. Politics

16:23.160 --> 16:28.040
is a seductive form of social therapy because it seems to solve your spiritual and psychological

16:28.040 --> 16:33.280
problems. It gives you the illusion that there's a war of good and evil and you're on the side

16:33.280 --> 16:37.240
of good. It gives you a moral landscape so you have some meaning in your life. It gives

16:37.240 --> 16:42.680
people a sense of belonging. If you're lonely, suddenly you're part of team red or team blue.

16:42.680 --> 16:47.560
It gives people a sense of righteousness. That you don't have to sit with a widow or

16:47.560 --> 16:51.200
feed the poor, but if you get indignant in front of the TV set, you feel you're doing

16:51.200 --> 16:57.040
something right for the cause. And it gives people a sense of purpose, a sense that somehow

16:57.040 --> 17:01.280
they're contributing to something larger than themselves. The problem is if you're asking

17:01.280 --> 17:07.120
politics to fill a hole in your soul, to solve your psychological, relational and moral problems,

17:07.120 --> 17:11.840
you're asking more of politics than it can give you. Because you don't really have community.

17:11.840 --> 17:16.480
You're not working with others. You're just hating the same people. You don't really have

17:16.480 --> 17:20.700
moral action. You're just indignant in front of the TV set. There's not really a morally

17:20.700 --> 17:25.080
comprehensible landscape. It's not like one side has the monopoly on virtue and the other

17:25.080 --> 17:30.720
side is monopoly on vice. And so when you try to use politics to fill the hole in your

17:30.720 --> 17:38.160
soul, you're seeking to get out of the sense of anxiety, alienation, depression, but you're

17:38.200 --> 17:44.720
simply winding up in a state of moral war. And it makes everybody mean and brutal and

17:44.720 --> 17:53.220
makes all the problems worse. So I've tried to describe a kind of unpleasant America and

17:53.220 --> 17:59.360
an unpleasant world, a negative mood. What's the cause? What are the deep roots of the

17:59.360 --> 18:06.640
negative mood that I think is leading to populism and leading to authoritarianism? Well, I'll

18:06.680 --> 18:13.280
start with some child psychology. There was a guy named John Bolsby many, many years ago who said

18:13.280 --> 18:19.320
one of my favorite sayings about life in general. And the saying is, all of life is a series of

18:19.320 --> 18:26.000
daring explorations from a secure base. All of life is a series of daring explorations from a

18:26.000 --> 18:31.160
secure base. And he's a child psychologist, so he meant you need a strong family, a strong home,

18:31.560 --> 18:38.840
and then you can be daring having a daring life. So do we have that in the world today? Do people

18:38.840 --> 18:44.400
have a secure base? Do they have the opportunity to do daring explorations? And I think both those

18:44.400 --> 18:52.000
things are in decline. So what is a secure base? A secure base in Bolsby's terms was family. And

18:52.000 --> 18:57.200
family is not something you choose. Family is something that we're bred into. It's deep in our

18:57.200 --> 19:04.480
soul. People are not transformed by institutions to which they are lightly attached. We're attached

19:04.480 --> 19:11.000
to this specific family, this specific sacred piece of land, this specific country, this specific

19:11.000 --> 19:16.560
philosophy or faith. These are things that we don't choose often, but they are deeply woven into

19:16.560 --> 19:22.720
the fabric of our identity of who we are. And they give us a secure psychological base. When we

19:22.720 --> 19:28.840
get married, it's not a contract. We're not doing it because it's in our self-interest. We're doing

19:28.840 --> 19:32.440
it because we're willing to make a lifelong commitment, hopefully, to another human being.

19:32.440 --> 19:38.080
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who was the head rabbi in Britain until he died recently, explained the

19:38.080 --> 19:45.280
difference between a contract and a covenant. He wrote, a contract is about interests. A covenant

19:45.280 --> 19:51.680
is about identity. It is about you and me coming together to form an us. That is why contracts

19:51.720 --> 19:58.680
benefit. A contract will benefit a person, but a covenant will transform a person. And specifically,

19:58.680 --> 20:05.840
it is these attachments often, for most of us, to these deep things that are woven into our soul.

20:05.840 --> 20:13.400
First, the family. Second, the sacred place, loyalty to America, loyalty to your town, loyalty to

20:13.400 --> 20:20.440
your country. And third, is a sense of a moral order. Now, people who are religious have a sense

20:20.480 --> 20:25.720
that there is a coherent moral order that is not dependent on our choices. And you don't have to

20:25.720 --> 20:31.240
be religious to believe that. That there is a sense that the world is morally coherent and you

20:31.240 --> 20:37.640
can build your life around a sense that there is such a thing as right and wrong. Civil rights

20:37.640 --> 20:43.120
movement. Based on the idea that, as Lincoln said, if slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.

20:43.120 --> 20:49.120
If segregation is not wrong, nothing is wrong. There is a coherent moral order woven into the

20:49.160 --> 20:57.520
fabric of human life. George Marsden is a historian who wrote, what gave such widely compelling force

20:57.520 --> 21:03.000
to King's leadership and oratory was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the

21:03.000 --> 21:09.400
universe. And so it's very hard to feel existentially safe if everything's up for grabs. If right

21:09.400 --> 21:15.800
and wrong are up for grabs. If your family are up for grabs. If your country is up for grabs. It's

21:15.840 --> 21:22.840
hard to feel secure. Now, liberalism, democratic liberalism, which I revere, is based on individual

21:22.840 --> 21:30.440
choice. It's based on the idea that we respect human dignity and we respect our choices. But

21:30.440 --> 21:37.120
liberal societies only prosper when they are based on things that precede choice. There's only a firm

21:37.120 --> 21:42.160
foundation for us to make our choices when there is these covenantal obligations to each other

21:42.160 --> 21:47.280
through family, through nation, through God, or through some idea that there's a thing that's

21:47.280 --> 21:53.720
called right and wrong. And when individual choice gets so extreme that it's eats away at the

21:53.720 --> 22:00.000
covenants of our life, then it begins to erode the foundation of liberal society. And in my view,

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
over the last few years, liberalism has gotten, we've had an extreme form of liberalism. And this

22:07.000 --> 22:12.160
is measurable. There's this thing called the World Value Survey. And the World Value Survey,

22:12.160 --> 22:18.800
they go all around the world, and they ask people about their values, about how individualistic,

22:18.800 --> 22:24.080
how much you believe in autonomy, or how much you believe in community. And especially in Europe

22:24.080 --> 22:29.880
and the English-speaking world. Over the last 20 years, our values have shifted away from the

22:29.880 --> 22:35.040
world. This is my view of a slide. I'm going to hold up a chart, which most of you will not be

22:35.040 --> 22:41.720
able to see. That's my slide. This is my technology. But basically, the slide shows values all

22:41.720 --> 22:46.240
around the world. The African world is over here, Latin America is over here, the Confucian world

22:46.240 --> 22:54.640
is over here, and way out sticking at the end is the US and Western Europe. Our values have shifted

22:54.640 --> 23:01.160
away from the rest of the world. We're much more individualistic, much more autonomous, and we've

23:01.600 --> 23:06.600
entered this form of extreme liberalism, where everything is a matter of choice. I remember I

23:06.600 --> 23:13.200
was teaching at Yale, only teaching at schools I couldn't have gotten into. And we were going around

23:13.200 --> 23:17.560
the classroom, and the kids were, the students were talking about what they wanted to do after

23:17.560 --> 23:22.640
college. And we got to one of my best students, a woman named Zara from Ghana. And she said,

23:22.640 --> 23:28.920
well, you have to understand, it's not my choice. It's the village sent me here. And she just comes

23:28.960 --> 23:33.760
from much more communal culture than those of us in the West. And but we have gotten so

23:33.760 --> 23:40.480
individualistic, I think we've begun to undermine the fundamental foundations. Our families are in

23:40.480 --> 23:46.800
trouble. Patriotism is in trouble. Our sense of social trust with one another is in trouble. But,

23:46.800 --> 23:51.680
and that points to, I think, the most disorienting thing that's subtly disorienting to a lot of us,

23:52.680 --> 24:00.200
what I call the privatization of morality. It's not only the privatization of morality is the

24:00.200 --> 24:04.960
idea that each of us has to come up with our own moral values. And this is an extreme form of

24:04.960 --> 24:12.280
liberalism. It's an extreme form of individualism. And if your name is Aristotle or Nietzsche, maybe

24:12.280 --> 24:17.280
you can come up with your own moral philosophy. Most of us learn our morals in morally cohesive

24:17.320 --> 24:23.000
communities. In our neighborhoods and our families, we have that sense of right and wrong formed

24:23.000 --> 24:28.440
within us by the people who love us and the people who embrace us. And we have some sort of

24:28.440 --> 24:34.600
existential security because of that. But when you privatize morality, then everyone set a drift.

24:34.600 --> 24:40.840
And it's not only a drift like physically, deeply at the core of our souls were set a drift. And

24:41.840 --> 24:48.880
Walter Littman, a great columnist in the middle of the 20th century, saw this coming. In 1955, he

24:48.880 --> 24:54.800
wrote a book called The Essays in Public Philosophy. And he wrote, if what is good, what is right,

24:54.800 --> 25:01.440
what is true is only what the individual chooses to invent than we are outside the traditions of

25:01.440 --> 25:10.280
civility. And so what I'm really describing here is a sense of constant flux. A constant flux not

25:10.320 --> 25:14.240
only in a lot of things in our life, which is good, but in the deepest foundations of our lives.

25:14.240 --> 25:20.640
And this situation was foreseen also by two writers who I have never quoted from in a talk,

25:20.640 --> 25:26.000
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. I'm not a Marxist, but in the Communist Manifesto,

25:26.000 --> 25:31.200
they wrote that bourgeois capitalist life will lead to the constant revolutionizing of production,

25:31.200 --> 25:38.080
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation. They wrote

25:38.120 --> 25:43.120
all fixed, fast-frozen relationships with their trained of ancient and venerable prejudices and

25:43.120 --> 25:49.720
opinions are swept away. New-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is

25:49.720 --> 25:55.040
solid melts into air. All that is holy is profaned. And man is at last compelled to face the sober

25:55.040 --> 26:01.040
senses, the real conditions of his life and his relations with his kind. All that is solid melts

26:01.040 --> 26:07.760
into air. All that is holy is profaned. It's that sense of deep inner disturb that I think you

26:07.760 --> 26:14.640
haunt a lot of us. And the authoritarians know exactly what to do with this. Whether it's

26:14.640 --> 26:24.160
Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Iran, Hamas, Viktor Orban, Marine Le Pen, MAGA, what unites them? They

26:24.160 --> 26:28.720
say, I'm going to restore order. I'm going to restore order to the street. I'm going to restore

26:28.720 --> 26:35.160
order to the borders. I'm also going to restore order to your soul. They stand up for family. They

26:35.200 --> 26:41.560
stand up for what, to me, are reactionary values on LGBTQ issues. They stand up for everything.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.600
And they make it all about order. And so a lot of people flock to the authoritarians and the

26:46.600 --> 26:52.640
populism because they're not only saying, screw those elites. They're saying, I'm restoring order

26:52.640 --> 26:58.320
to your deepest anxieties. And it's just tremendously powerfully appealing to people all

26:58.360 --> 27:05.880
around the world. So that's the first part, the lack of a secure base. And the authoritarians

27:05.880 --> 27:10.560
promise, of course, they're not really delivering a secure base. They're just delivering authoritarian

27:10.560 --> 27:16.920
narcissism. But it has this spiritual resonance with people. So the second part of that, John

27:16.920 --> 27:21.920
Bolz, we quote, that all of life is a series of daring explorations from a secure base is a part

27:21.920 --> 27:28.800
about the daring explorations, the chance and the opportunity to make sure your future is going to

27:28.800 --> 27:33.560
be better than your past. We all need that sense that our life has some movements and purpose and

27:33.560 --> 27:41.000
progress. And for a lot of us, it does. But for a lot of people in American society, it doesn't.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.120
And the key divide in American society right now, and the key divide in our politics is over

27:48.120 --> 27:52.560
education levels. And this is only true in America. It's true in all the countries I've been

27:52.560 --> 27:57.960
talking about, what they call the diploma divide. So why would there be this gap which did not

27:57.960 --> 28:02.680
used to exist? It used to be the political divisions are about money. Rich voted Republican,

28:02.680 --> 28:06.920
poor people voted for the Democrats. Now it's highly educated people vote for the Democrats,

28:06.920 --> 28:12.240
less educated people vote for the Republicans. And this basic pattern occurs again and again and

28:12.480 --> 28:18.480
again all around the world. Why is that? The short answer to me and the reason a lot of people feel

28:18.480 --> 28:25.280
they don't have a chance of possibility in daring explorations is that the game is rigged. That rich

28:25.280 --> 28:30.240
people just have vastly better educational opportunities than poor people. Our sorting

28:30.240 --> 28:36.600
society has created a caste system. Three year olds who come from a home with parents making over

28:36.600 --> 28:42.760
$100,000 a year are twice as likely to attend preschool as poor parents, poor kids. By eighth grade,

28:42.760 --> 28:48.240
children from affluent families are performing four grade levels higher than children from

28:48.240 --> 28:53.880
poorer families. Students who grow up in a home making over $200,000 a year have a one in five

28:53.880 --> 29:00.120
chance of scoring a 1,400 on their SATs, one in five. For poorer kids, the chances are one in 50.

29:01.000 --> 29:07.480
At every step of the way, kids from highly educated parents and highly affluent parents

29:07.480 --> 29:13.000
have this huge advantage. There's a guy named Daniel Markovitz who calculates that if you would add

29:13.000 --> 29:17.800
up all the things that affluent parents give to their kids, whether it's private school tuition,

29:17.800 --> 29:25.080
oboe practice, soccer practice, travel teams, even trips to museums, trips to Europe, it amounts

29:25.160 --> 29:32.120
to a $10 million investment in each kid, and they just soar ahead. Kids whose families can't make

29:32.120 --> 29:39.560
that contribution, they fall way behind. Markovitz made, to me, the shocking claim, which he's a

29:39.560 --> 29:47.320
very careful scholar, is that the educational gap between rich kids and poor kids is now wider than

29:47.320 --> 29:53.000
the educational gap between whites and blacks in the era of Jim Crow. That's just a yawning gap,

29:53.720 --> 30:00.760
and it has produced a caste society. We don't live in a single society anymore. We live in a society

30:00.760 --> 30:07.560
divided by educational levels. In 2003, there was a woman named Annette LaRoe, a great sociologist,

30:07.560 --> 30:14.200
who studied how children are raised, and she said people from working class backgrounds practice

30:14.200 --> 30:19.000
what she called natural growth parenting. Life is hard, let the kids enjoy their childhood.

30:19.880 --> 30:25.160
Children from college-educated families practice what she called concerted cultivation,

30:25.160 --> 30:29.480
which is how I raise my kids and how a lot of you probably raised your kids. The calendar becomes

30:29.480 --> 30:34.200
the central thing on the door, and you're shepherding your kids, sports practices to

30:34.200 --> 30:39.560
oboe practices to whatever, and you're really investing in your kids so you can thrive in

30:39.560 --> 30:45.640
the meritocracy. But it has created a vast difference, so college-educated people live

30:45.640 --> 30:50.440
very different lives than high school-educated people. The average high school grad in this

30:50.440 --> 30:56.200
country lives eight years shorter than the average college grad. 40% of high school grads are obese

30:56.200 --> 31:02.200
compared to 20% of college grads. High school grads are much less likely to marry and twice as

31:02.200 --> 31:07.240
likely to get divorced than college grads. 60% of births to women with a high school degree

31:07.240 --> 31:14.120
happen out of wedlock. That's a rate 20 times higher than college grads. The opioid death rate

31:14.120 --> 31:20.200
for those with a high school degree was 10,000, was 10 deaths per 100,000. 10 deaths per 100,000.

31:20.760 --> 31:25.800
For a college degree it was only two deaths per 100,000. And so these are just vast chasms

31:26.920 --> 31:33.160
in how we live, how we prosper, or don't prosper. And so a lot of people look at that gap and they

31:33.160 --> 31:40.280
say the system is rigged. And populists attack the educated class. Or as Donald Trump once put it,

31:40.280 --> 31:46.360
I love the poorly educated. And so populists say those elites, they rig the game,

31:46.360 --> 31:50.120
they close it off opportunities, you are screwed and I will fix the problem.

31:51.240 --> 31:56.760
And so on both these deep levels, the need for a secure spiritual foundation for your life

31:56.760 --> 32:05.320
and a sense of hope, populists claim to have an answer. And so I'll spend three minutes on

32:05.320 --> 32:13.160
what we should do to repair the situation. The first is people are in the center and people are on

32:13.160 --> 32:21.880
the left have to have some version of faith, family, and flag. We have too often allowed populist

32:21.880 --> 32:27.080
authoritarians to grab, for example, patriotism. I took a walk today with a guy named Richard

32:27.080 --> 32:32.520
Reeves who's speaking here today and he's from Britain. And he noticed that the far right was

32:32.520 --> 32:38.280
seizing the British flag and seizing a lot of the symbols of British patriotism. So there's a

32:38.280 --> 32:44.520
paper in the UK called The Guardian, which many of you know, it's a progressive paper. And on page

32:44.520 --> 32:52.120
two, they had a big full page picture of the Red Cross, which is what there's a certain symbol of

32:52.120 --> 32:58.680
England. And that the whole page two was that. And on the page one editorial said, we're not letting

32:58.680 --> 33:04.200
the far right take this from us. Please cut out this piece of paper and hang it in your window of

33:04.200 --> 33:09.000
your living room, because we're going to re-seize patriotism. We're not going to let the right have

33:09.000 --> 33:14.760
that. So that's the first thing. And similarly, progressives and centrists have to have a way

33:14.760 --> 33:21.480
to talk about the sacredness of family and the sacredness of patriotism. Second, and this is

33:21.480 --> 33:27.080
Fred Riley who is executive director of Weave, the social fabric project, which we work on together,

33:27.800 --> 33:33.880
it's the need to give people secure base, give them interpersonal trust. 71% of young people,

33:34.600 --> 33:41.960
Gen Z, ask them, if you agree with this statement, most people are selfish and out to get you. 71%

33:41.960 --> 33:47.960
of Gen Z, yes. How do you not live with fear if you think most people are selfish and out to get you?

33:48.680 --> 33:54.120
And that's low social trust. And so what we do at Weave is we take people who are building trust

33:54.120 --> 34:00.200
to the local level, and we try to support them. Trust is built locally by people who show up for

34:00.200 --> 34:06.120
you, by people who are there with you, by people who know you. I wrote a book that came out in

34:06.120 --> 34:13.960
October called How to Know a Person, and it was based on the idea that trust exists. Existential

34:13.960 --> 34:21.240
security exists when the people around you see, hear, respect, and know you. When the reporting

34:21.240 --> 34:29.560
of that book, I was down in Waco, Texas, and I was at a diner, and I'm having breakfast with a,

34:30.120 --> 34:36.200
I think a 95-year-old lady named LaRue Dorsey, and she presents herself to me as this stern

34:36.200 --> 34:40.920
disciplinarian, like she'd been a teacher, and she said, I loved my students enough to discipline

34:40.920 --> 34:47.400
them. And I was a little intimidated by this drill sergeant later. But into the diner walks a mutual

34:47.400 --> 34:52.840
friend of ours named Jimmy Dorell. And Jimmy Dorell sees us, he comes up to the diner, he grabs

34:52.840 --> 34:58.360
Mrs. Dorsey by the shoulders, and shakes her way harder than you should ever shake a 95-year-old.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.880
But he says to her, Mrs. Dorsey, you're the best, you're the best, I love you, I love you.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.280
And that stern disciplinarian lady that I've been talking to, in an instant,

35:08.920 --> 35:15.640
turns into a bright, eye-shining, nine-year-old girl. With the power of his gaze, he brought out a

35:15.640 --> 35:21.240
different version of her. And that's when, when you have people around you who are able to see you

35:21.240 --> 35:27.720
in that way, then it's, you feel seen, heard, you feel safe. We evolved to be surrounded by people

35:27.720 --> 35:33.080
who were looking out for us. And part of the reason Jimmy Dorell was able to do that is that he's,

35:33.080 --> 35:38.200
he's a warmer personality than I am. But part of it is he's a pastor. He pastures to the homeless

35:38.200 --> 35:41.960
in Waco. He has a church called Church Under the Bridge. The homeless people didn't feel comfortable

35:41.960 --> 35:46.440
going to his church, so he brought the church to them. He has it under a highway overpass where

35:46.440 --> 35:53.480
they sleep. And so he's a pastor. So he thinks every person he sees is made in the image of God.

35:54.280 --> 36:00.360
Every person he sees has a soul of infinite value and dignity. Every person he sees is so important,

36:00.360 --> 36:05.080
Jesus was willing to die for that person. Now you could be Christian or Jewish or atheist or Muslim

36:05.080 --> 36:10.040
or Buddhist, I don't care. But we have to learn to see each other with that level of reverence and

36:10.040 --> 36:18.520
respect, or else we will feel unseen, disrespected, unheard, existentially unsafe. So that's ways to

36:18.520 --> 36:23.960
try to create a secure base in the community as we've done, interpersonally as I hope to do in my

36:23.960 --> 36:32.280
book, and on the national level as people come up with new ways to secure the family, secure the flag,

36:32.280 --> 36:38.760
and secure faith. Then on the other side of the equation, we somehow have to create more opportunity

36:38.760 --> 36:45.160
for a wider array of people. We have to fix the meritocracy. In the 1930s, a guy named James Conan,

36:45.160 --> 36:50.280
who was president of Harvard, created our modern meritocracy. It is not a natural growth, it's an

36:50.280 --> 36:56.840
ideological project. And his ideological project was the central human trait is intelligence.

36:57.800 --> 37:05.160
And we're going to sort people starting at age five by how smart they are. And I'm fine with

37:05.160 --> 37:10.760
intelligence. It's a good trait to have. It's not the most important trait in human ability. To me,

37:10.760 --> 37:16.360
the most important trait in human ability is hunger. It's the drive to keep working, to keep

37:16.360 --> 37:22.840
learning, to keep moving, and to keep getting better at something. The second trait is the ability to

37:22.840 --> 37:27.480
work in teams. There's a funny thing that there's zero correlation between how you do in school and

37:27.480 --> 37:33.800
how you do in life. Grades predict nothing. And that's because school is all about self. It's about

37:33.800 --> 37:38.760
how am I doing individually. Life is generally about how am I doing as a team. How am I doing with

37:38.760 --> 37:45.000
others? So there's a basic non sequitur between schools and life. The third trait I think is

37:45.000 --> 37:51.160
character. Ask people, there was somebody who did a study, why do people get fired? In only 11%

37:51.160 --> 37:55.160
of cases are people fired because they're not smart enough to do the job or they lack the technical

37:55.160 --> 38:02.920
knowledge. The main reason people get fired, 89% of cases, is because they're assholes. Or they're

38:03.640 --> 38:09.320
unteachable. They're uncoachable. They don't do well with their teammates. And so somehow we have

38:09.320 --> 38:15.000
to build a meritocracy around a broader definition of merit that won't be able to be gained by the

38:15.000 --> 38:23.560
rich. A definition of merit that includes drive, resilience, good character, empathy, social

38:23.560 --> 38:29.720
ability. And if we widen out that, how we define merit, I think we'll have a fairer society.

38:30.440 --> 38:35.720
And we won't have these bottlenecks for people. So these are tough times.

38:37.240 --> 38:45.160
I, sometime last November, I was at a hotel bar on my travels. And if you'd seen me there,

38:46.120 --> 38:54.920
you would have said, sad guy drinking alone. But I call it reporting. And so I was at the bar

38:55.800 --> 38:59.640
and I'm on Twitter, of course, and I'm scrolling through all these images,

39:00.600 --> 39:07.080
mostly from the Middle East. And they're just brutal images. And you think about the famous

39:07.080 --> 39:16.840
dates of our century are just brutal dates. September 11th, January 6th, October 7th. It's

39:16.840 --> 39:22.840
tempting in these times to turn into what the authoritarians want us to be, which is war of

39:22.920 --> 39:30.520
all against all. Us versus them, it's just war. And yet as I'm scrolling through my phone,

39:30.520 --> 39:36.200
looking at all these images, I come across a video and it's an interview with James Baldwin.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.520
And he gave the interview, sometime it looked from the black and white images, it looked like

39:40.520 --> 39:47.000
the early 60s. Now Baldwin was a guy who was horribly mistreated by his society because of

39:47.000 --> 39:52.520
the color of his skin and because of the sexual orientation. And that guy had a right to feel

39:52.600 --> 39:58.760
bitter and hatred. He had the right to sink into the enmity that drives so much of our politics.

39:59.640 --> 40:04.760
But in this interview, he says, you know, there's not as much humanity as you would like in the

40:04.760 --> 40:11.240
world. But there's enough. There's more than you would think. And then he says, you've got to remember

40:11.240 --> 40:17.640
as you walk down the street, every single person you meet, that could be you. You could be that person.

40:18.600 --> 40:23.560
You could be that saint. You could be that monster. And you've got to decide who you're going to be.

40:24.520 --> 40:30.840
And so he could have calloused over, as I said, but instead he had this mentality, I could be that

40:30.840 --> 40:36.200
person. I may like them. I may not like them. That could be me. And the phrase that leapt to

40:36.200 --> 40:42.760
mine as I was listening to this little 60-minute or 60-second clip was defiant humanism, that even

40:42.920 --> 40:51.320
in brutal times, when a lot of our political opponents are brutal and monstrous and frankly

40:51.320 --> 40:58.040
authoritarian, that perversely and paradoxically the way to rebut them is to be more human,

40:58.920 --> 41:05.320
is to touch the things that really we do need to solve our souls and to emphasize the deepest

41:05.320 --> 41:07.320
parts of our nature. Thank you very much.

41:23.960 --> 41:28.200
Now I have less some time for a question and answer. If anybody has comments or questions,

41:28.200 --> 41:32.360
all that I ask is you make them long and be andering with no question at the end.

41:32.360 --> 41:39.720
Do we have any mic runners? We have a mic runner.

41:46.840 --> 41:52.840
Can you talk about your thoughts, how social media for young people especially

41:53.960 --> 41:57.560
contributes to depression and loneliness?

41:58.200 --> 42:03.000
So the mental health crisis has many causes as you expect. Some of it as I said I think is

42:03.000 --> 42:07.800
philosophical and cultural in nature which is what I tried to describe but and I was a little

42:07.800 --> 42:14.360
skeptical that social media was really leading to this incredible ramp up in depression and suicide

42:15.000 --> 42:19.880
and my argument and I'm friends with a guy named Jonathan Hyde who's written about this was that

42:19.880 --> 42:24.920
social media is everywhere but depression and suicide are not going up in Denmark, they're not

42:24.920 --> 42:31.960
going up in Ghana and but Jonathan has persuaded me with a fair boatload of data that in fact

42:31.960 --> 42:37.080
they are going up everywhere. Wherever there's social media there's a rise in suicide and a rise

42:37.080 --> 42:41.400
in depression. Now we happen to get it worse because you combine social media with a highly

42:41.400 --> 42:46.120
individualistic culture where people feel solitude it's going to have the effect is going to be a

42:46.120 --> 42:51.960
lot worse so I am become convinced that social media truly is horrible not that I get off it but

42:52.200 --> 42:57.960
um and that one of the Jonathan's proposals which I think is gaining great traction it's rare you

42:57.960 --> 43:02.040
see a somebody in my business say we should do this and then suddenly all across the country

43:02.040 --> 43:08.600
people are doing it and Jonathan's one proposal is no phones in schools and school district after

43:08.600 --> 43:13.880
school district is now adopting this and it's like a lot of technologies at first we don't know that's

43:13.880 --> 43:19.320
dangers but once we learn the dangers we know we adapt and so I think that's happening with social

43:19.320 --> 43:24.200
media we're adapting I think that'll happen with AI eventually too but maybe way there in the back

43:27.160 --> 43:33.800
information could you restate the source of the uh motivating quote at the beginning

43:33.800 --> 43:39.160
about base and exploration who was that a guy named John Bolesby who was the father of the

43:39.160 --> 43:45.080
thing called attachment theory he I think he was like 1940s 1950s John Bolesby uh all of life

43:45.080 --> 43:52.120
is a syringe of daring explorations from a secure base I see a couple little Katie

43:56.280 --> 44:02.600
thank you I just love you David Brooks thank you for this incredible presentation

44:03.320 --> 44:11.240
you're so thoughtful and smart and compassionate but I wanted to ask you for some real world advice

44:11.240 --> 44:16.600
you know and this isn't going to be a long story I promise but I did a breast cancer walk recently

44:16.600 --> 44:21.240
and a woman came up to me and said I really love you even though we're very different politically

44:21.240 --> 44:28.520
I'm pretty sure and then I tried to kind of talk to her and I said oh well why are you

44:28.520 --> 44:35.080
feeling the way you're feeling and I said do you believe are you do you have do you believe the

44:35.080 --> 44:42.760
election was rigged and she said yes I do and I said but there's 60 plus lawsuits you know I did

44:42.760 --> 44:47.880
the whole thing like why it wasn't and she said no I really think it was I've seen evidence

44:48.600 --> 44:55.080
and can you tell us how to talk to people you know and how to lean into our humanity

44:55.080 --> 45:06.120
when people believe things that just aren't true yeah it's really hard right I mean I was nice to

45:06.120 --> 45:13.000
her but I just was frustrated yeah hey this is paradox that you're asking me this question

45:13.000 --> 45:17.960
because one of my earlier years here a woman came up to me after I gave a talk and it was

45:17.960 --> 45:22.520
a more one of my more personal talks and she talked about her son getting killed in a car crash

45:23.400 --> 45:28.200
and I had no idea what to say and but I'm happened to be behind Katie Couric at the

45:28.200 --> 45:33.240
security line at the Espen airport on the way out so I asked you what do you say and you gave me

45:33.240 --> 45:40.600
good advice mostly just hugs but I would say so I'm at a baseball game and it's the night

45:40.600 --> 45:47.480
inning in Washington and a guy turns around to me and says hey are you David Brooks and I think

45:48.120 --> 45:51.960
nice he'll like my he'll say oh I like your column you know I like your show whatever

45:52.600 --> 45:54.840
and I said yeah and he said you're a fucking asshole

45:57.720 --> 46:02.920
and he like he's and my son was there and he said to my son you should be ashamed of your

46:02.920 --> 46:06.840
father he's awful and this was a Trump guy and my wife is there and she's trying to calm him down

46:06.840 --> 46:12.040
she's get off me woman and then he says I'm shaking I'm in the presence of evil and that was

46:12.040 --> 46:20.040
like oh and I would like to think that at that moment my son and I rose above conflict and reached

46:20.040 --> 46:27.240
out with compassion and empathy and understanding sadly that did not happen we were as nasty as he

46:27.240 --> 46:32.360
was so I'm not and my wife was genuinely angry with me with the right to be but what I've learned

46:32.360 --> 46:37.000
there's a highly recommended a book called Crucial Conversations by a guy named Joseph

46:37.000 --> 46:42.040
Granny and a bunch of other people it's how to have these hard conversations and they point out

46:42.040 --> 46:46.600
something which I've learned when somebody comes up with that kind of critique from a Trump's board

46:46.600 --> 46:53.240
or whatever or from the further left my first job is to stand in their standpoint it's to ask them

46:53.240 --> 46:59.080
three or four or five times how did you come to believe what you believe and I never ask people

46:59.080 --> 47:03.800
anymore what do you believe I ask how did you come to believe that because that way you're getting

47:03.800 --> 47:10.440
them in narrative mode and they talk about an experience they talk about a somebody who shaped

47:10.440 --> 47:17.720
their values and then so I asked them three or four or five times and I may not persuade them I may

47:17.720 --> 47:23.960
not agree but at least I'm showing them the respect of curiosity and in this book Crucial Conversations

47:24.600 --> 47:31.480
the authors say in any conversation respect is like air when it's present nobody notices

47:31.480 --> 47:37.000
when it's absent it's all anybody can think about and so a lot of the people who hold these views

47:37.000 --> 47:42.200
feel profoundly disrespected and if you can show them respect I'm not sure you will persuade them

47:42.200 --> 47:47.480
I'm not sure anything haven't I've been written a million anti-trump columns in the last seven years

47:47.480 --> 47:52.520
for all the good it's done to the world but at least you'll show them that respect and I think

47:52.520 --> 47:56.840
that will solve some of the sense of hurt the sense that you looked at you people look down on me

47:57.800 --> 48:04.840
and the the other thing those people in Crucial Conversations say is that every conversation

48:04.840 --> 48:10.040
that exists at two levels what we're nominally talking about and the real conversation which

48:10.040 --> 48:15.320
is the flow of emotions flowing between us with every comment we make to each other we're making

48:15.320 --> 48:21.240
each other feel more respected or less respected more safe or less safe and so by standing in their

48:21.320 --> 48:25.960
standpoint hopefully you're making them feel more safe and less condescended to

48:27.240 --> 48:31.160
and I don't know if that'll change the world but it's the only thing I could think of

48:33.000 --> 48:39.560
maybe in the in the back I see a couple hands we've got two minutes and 45 seconds

48:44.680 --> 48:48.600
thank you for your talk Fidel Vargas president CEO of the hispanic scholarship fund and I

48:48.600 --> 48:55.080
apologize I came in a little late but one of the other things I seem to notice and I would love

48:55.080 --> 49:02.280
to hear your perspective homogenous societies versus diverse societies France the United States

49:02.840 --> 49:08.680
versus say Japan how is that playing out because it's a whole lot easier to

49:09.480 --> 49:16.360
say the other and who's causing our problems how does that play into everything yeah I mean

49:16.360 --> 49:23.320
we evolved to live with 150 people like ourselves we evolved for homogeneity we now get to live and

49:23.320 --> 49:28.920
it's a privilege and honor to live in much more diverse societies and it's to me it's a wonderfully

49:28.920 --> 49:35.720
great thing but it's just tougher it's tougher for me to relate to somebody whose lifestyle

49:35.720 --> 49:41.400
whose historical narrative is vastly different than my own and that that one of the reasons I

49:41.400 --> 49:46.600
wrote that book I had to know a person is because we have to up our social skills to fit the society

49:46.600 --> 49:55.160
we're living in and these traits go super deep I there was an election in Connecticut a guy named

49:55.160 --> 50:00.840
Ned Lamont ran against a guy named Joe Lieberman and researchers found after that election that every

50:00.840 --> 50:07.800
town that was settled by the Portuguese in the 17th century voted for Lieberman and every town

50:07.880 --> 50:13.320
settled by the English voted for Lamont these are 350 year old categories and they're still

50:13.320 --> 50:21.000
shaping belief I have a party conversation you can tell how fun I am at parties where I asked the

50:21.000 --> 50:25.080
following question and I asked that at dinner party recently how do your ancestors show up in your

50:25.080 --> 50:30.200
life it's like we all know we're formed by our heritage but how and so there was a Dutch family

50:30.200 --> 50:33.720
there and they talked about their Dutch heritage there was a black family there they talked about

50:33.720 --> 50:39.080
the African-American experience I talked about 5,000 years of Jewish history which I'm sure was

50:39.080 --> 50:45.480
a scintillating two and a half hours for them but you know we're so deeply formed by our ancient

50:45.480 --> 50:52.200
heritages and you just have to be very socially skilled to see people in that level of profound

50:52.200 --> 51:00.040
difference but once you do it it's fun and I'll close with this bit of research a concrete way to

51:00.040 --> 51:04.680
change your life so I'm buddies with a guy named Nick Epley he's a social psychologist at University

51:04.680 --> 51:10.920
Chicago and he was because he's a social psychologist he knows that every the thing that makes us

51:10.920 --> 51:16.200
happiest is talking to each other we pretty relational social animals and so he's on his

51:16.200 --> 51:21.480
commuter train on the way up to campus from his home and he's looking around the car and everybody

51:21.480 --> 51:26.360
is on their phones not a single person is talking to each other so he's a social psychologist for

51:26.360 --> 51:32.840
the next couple months he pays people on the train to talk to a stranger and he asks them

51:32.840 --> 51:37.480
afterwards when they get off the train how'd you like it and they all say that was the most

51:37.480 --> 51:43.000
enjoyable ride I've had in months we underestimate how we how much we want to talk to each other

51:43.000 --> 51:49.400
we underestimate how much we're going to go deep we want to go deep and so I did a presentation

51:49.400 --> 51:55.240
with them at Chicago a couple months ago now and we're doing our conversation on stage and he says

51:55.240 --> 52:01.000
stop I'm gonna make everybody in this room find a stranger and for the next 10 minutes tell them

52:01.000 --> 52:08.760
about the last time you cried and you hear this groan go up from the crowd and he says how many

52:08.760 --> 52:13.480
of you want to do this and a few hands go up how many of you don't want to do it 80% of the hands

52:13.480 --> 52:22.840
went up and he said go and they did it and 10 minutes pass and we can't get them to set up so

52:22.840 --> 52:29.240
we can get back to our conversation and then finally when they do come up he says how many

52:29.240 --> 52:35.160
of you enjoyed that and 80% of the hands went up and that's just a small practical thing so now

52:35.160 --> 52:40.840
when I'm on the plane I often talk to the stranger I wait till there's only an hour left in the

52:40.840 --> 52:48.600
flight in case I'll be boring but still but it's just a concrete practical way to instill a little

52:48.600 --> 52:54.040
social relationship a little social trust and to weaken the kind of existential loneliness

52:54.680 --> 53:01.720
that I think is the cause of a lot of our problems so thank you very much

53:48.600 --> 53:49.400
you
