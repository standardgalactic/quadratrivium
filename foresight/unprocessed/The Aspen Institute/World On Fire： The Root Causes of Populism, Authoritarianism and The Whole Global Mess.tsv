0	20120	Good afternoon everyone. If you could take your seats. I'm Elliot Gerson and it is my
20120	29680	great privilege to introduce the next session. It is really, in a sense, central to the theme
29680	36120	of many of the things that you've been hearing about this week, the world on fire, populism,
36120	43080	the rise of authoritarianism, and basically the whole mess in the world that we've been
43080	49320	talking about through one prism or another over the last few days and we will continue
49320	56440	to. And we are going to have someone address the root causes of that in a way that no one
56440	62280	else could and he is someone who certainly needs no introduction and I don't want to
62280	68000	take time away from him and after his remarks you'll all have an opportunity to ask questions.
68000	74480	But I will, given the fact that it is the 20th anniversary of the Ideas Festival, say something
74480	80800	about our guest who you know all about his distinctions. You read him, you follow him,
80800	86880	you watch him. He also has a long history with the Institute. He co-founded and the
86880	92880	chairs weave the social fabric project. But more significantly, although it's pretty
92880	98040	wonderful, in the annals of the Ideas Festival I can now say to you officially, because I
98040	104200	went back to our archives and confirmed this, that no one has spoken at the Ideas Festival
104200	112040	more than David Brooks. And appropriately. David, I think one reason when we created
112040	117640	this, we had no idea if it would survive more than 2005. One reason it was so successful
117640	123840	was David Brooks. And then a couple years after that he came and he has been here every
123840	130120	year, every year since. There is no one spoken as often. A couple of other things that make
130160	137880	him an exception here, an entirely deserved exception. One is that early in this process
137880	142360	of the Ideas Festival, Guinea and I decided that we would have a rule to make sure we
142360	147200	keep things fresh and people would come back for new things every year. We had a rule that
147200	152440	no one would speak more than three consecutive years. But of course we had to have the David
152440	158000	Brooks exception and we do. And the other thing that this is an example of an exception
158000	165160	of is that we decided at the very beginning that the format we would use in almost all
165160	171760	instances is conversation and dialogue. Either an interview or a moderated panel. And that
171760	177360	we were not going to have lectures as one often has at other kinds of conferences and
177360	184400	events. But then again, given the wisdom, insight and popularity of this man, we had
184440	191280	to make a second David Brooks exception, which was to allow him to have these kinds of formats
191280	196440	with regularity. So without any further ado, it's my great pleasure and privilege to bring
196440	198640	up David Brooks.
198640	205640	I should correct, Elliot. I haven't actually spoken more than anybody else. It just seems
205640	213640	that way. I read my first book for book on tape and the sound engineer told me a story
213640	218480	when you read your book for audio, you realize how boring your book is and how often you
218480	222600	repeat yourselves. But the sound engineer told me the story that there was a novelist who
222600	227960	was reading a 700 page novel. And he's in the middle of it and the sound engineer looks
227960	234280	in and the novelist is weeping. And so the engineer says, there's something I can do.
234280	240880	And the novelist says, don't I ever shut up? And so that's me at Aspen. Now every other
240920	247920	talk I've given here has been about how to live a better life, how to improve your life.
248760	252640	This one is not because of the global situation. I thought I should rise to the occasion and
252640	257120	try to diagnose the whole global situation. But I felt guilty about that that if I don't
257120	261360	give you some practical life tips, your lives will fall apart over the next year before
261360	264960	I can give my next talk. So in the first few minutes, I'm going to give you some actual
265000	270880	life hacks, which I got from the internet or the Bible, one of the two. And so here
270880	274960	are a few life hacks. These are practical life hacks. Then I'll get to politics. When
274960	280960	you have 90% of a large project finish, finishing up the final details will take another 90%.
280960	287960	Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks. Getting cheated occasionally
288680	293240	is a small price to pay for trusting the best in everyone. Because when you trust the best
293240	298880	in others, they will treat you the best. Purchase a tourist guidebook to your hometown.
298880	303720	You'll learn a lot playing tourist once a year. The thing that made you weird as a kid
303720	310720	will make you outstanding as an adult. It's not an apology if it comes with an excuse.
310720	315240	Just because it's not your fault doesn't mean it's not your responsibility. If you think
315240	322240	you saw a mouse, you did. And if you saw one, there are others. If you can't make up your
322240	327000	mind between two options, flip a coin. But don't go by how the coin comes up. Go by your
327000	332560	emotional reaction to how the coin went up. Take photos of your parents every day. That's
332560	337760	how you'll want to remember them. If you meet a jerk once a month, you've met a jerk. If
337760	344000	you meet a jerk every day, you're the jerk. Don't ever look at a recent photo of your
344000	348880	first great love. And this one is from Warren Buffet. You can always tell someone to go
348880	352400	to hell tomorrow, which is good. When you're mad at them, you can tell them to go to hell
352400	360480	tomorrow, way today. So that's my life-altering advice for you cramped into about 90 seconds.
360480	365640	Now we turn to politics. Now, I got my political start when I was five. My parents were somewhat
365640	370040	left-wing. We lived in New York, and they took me to a place where hippies would go called
370040	375920	a be-in. And a be-in was where hippies would go to show how little they cared about money
375920	380360	and material things. And one of the ways they showed this was they set a garbage can on
380360	385860	fire, threw their wallets into it, just to show we don't care about money. I'm five
385860	390680	years old. I see a $5 bill on fire in the garbage can. I break from the crowd, reach
390680	394800	into the fire, grab the money, and run away. And that was sort of my first step over to
394800	402640	the right. And so I veered right, and then I veered left. But the main thing I am, like
402640	409000	all of us probably in this room, is I believe in liberal democracy. And I was a foreign
409000	414080	correspondent in the 1990s at the High Water Mark of liberal democracy. I was in the Soviet
414080	418080	Union, if you remember, in the final days of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin was the
418080	423360	democratically elected president of Russia, and this old Soviet apparatus staged a coup.
423360	428120	And they had tanks rolling through the town, and Yeltsin, if you recall, stood on a tank
428120	432000	in front of the Russian White House, the parliament building, and said, I dare you,
432000	439200	shoot me. And all the democratic activists surrounded him to offer sort of a buffer.
439200	444840	And I was there, and I found a woman who was handing out sandwiches to the democratic protesters.
444840	451200	And her name was Valentina Kossieva, and she was 93. And so I asked her to tell her
451200	455560	me her life story, and she told me that she'd grown up in the Palace of the Tsar before
455560	460440	the revolution. Just after the revolution, she'd been lined up for a firing squad because
460440	466800	she was on the wrong side of the Russian Revolution. Her mother saved her life. She got married.
466800	471920	Her husband was disappeared in the 1930s, purged and sent to the Siberia and never to return.
471920	477400	Her two boys were killed in the Battle of Stalingrad by the Nazis. One of her sons was
477400	482560	rifle-butted to death. And then she married again. Her second husband also was sent away
482560	488080	to the Gulag, and she never saw him again. And then in the 1950s, under Khrushchev, she
488080	493080	was part of the Kalmyk people, which is a Muslim people, and they were sent off to exile.
493080	497840	And so my brilliant interviewing techniques when she's telling me this story is, and then
497840	502480	what happened? And then what happened? And basically every bad thing that happened in
502480	508240	Soviet history happened to her. And they were so moving to be talking to her at age 93,
508240	513840	asking out sandwiches at what we thought would be the rise of Democratic Russia. And
513840	519360	it didn't turn out that way, obviously. And I covered in those days the end of apartheid.
519360	524600	I covered the Oslo peace process. A participant is in the room. And I covered the reunification
524600	529680	of Germany. I covered nothing but good news for five years. History has since taken a
529680	534120	dark turn. And the interesting thing about the dark turn it has taken, especially this
534200	540080	year, is that it's happening all around the world. I was raised with the idea that we
540080	545920	Americans are outliers. We're more individualistic, we're more mobile, we're just outliers compared
545920	550680	to most other countries in the world. That is not true anymore. The Ipsos organization,
550680	556880	which is a British firm, asked people in 28 countries about certain attitudes. And we
556880	563600	are absolutely typical of the world now. Our pessimism is typical. 59 percent of Americans
563640	567800	say they believe our country is in decline. That's compared to 58 percent of people around
567800	573120	the world. 60 percent of Americans agree with a statement that the system is broken, compared
573120	579920	to 61 percent worldwide. Our hostility to elites is absolutely typical. 69 percent of
579920	584040	Americans think that the political and economic elite don't care about hardworking people
584040	589920	compared to 67 percent worldwide. 63 percent of Americans agree that experts in this country
589960	594960	don't know what they're talking about compared to 62 percent worldwide. We're just typical.
594960	600360	Even our authoritarianism is typical. 66 percent of Americans say the country needs a strong
600360	605080	leader to take it back from the rich and the powerful compared to 63 percent worldwide.
605080	608920	40 percent of Americans, we need a strong leader who will break the rules compared to
608920	615920	41 percent worldwide. So there are two things to take from this. The first is that we're
616160	620680	typical. We're no longer extraordinary. We're a typical country with typical beliefs. And
620680	625400	the second is that all around the world in all these 28 countries measured there's an
625400	632000	incredible hostility to the system and infertile landscape for right wing populism. And if
632000	635840	you look around elections of the world, it's a big election year, you see right wing populists
635840	641280	thriving in place after place. So Geert Wilders, the right wing populist in the Netherlands,
641320	647840	party rose to power in the European elections. The German AFD, very far right group, surged
647840	653080	in France. The Marine Le Pen party surged, causing the whole French political system
653080	657560	to go into meltdown. You look at Indonesia, you look around Latin America. Right wing
657560	664040	populists are surging all around the country. And of course, here at home, Donald Trump,
664040	668520	the economist says it's about two thirds likely that Donald Trump will be a reelected president.
669360	674320	That's typical of what's happening all around the world. And so to me, it's a mistake. We're
674320	679480	going to watch the debate tonight, but it's a mistake to see the U.S. election in isolation
679480	684200	from these global trends. And if Trump ends up winning, it'll be because there's just this
684200	693200	global tide in country after country after country. And so what's going on? Why has this
693280	699080	happened? Why is it happening all around the world all at once? Now, there are certain
699080	703800	obvious things we could say. People are reacting against globalization. There have been policy
703800	708440	failures, the financial crisis, Afghanistan, Iraq. But these policy failures are not all
708440	713640	around the world, and yet right wing populism is all around the world. Something deeper
713640	720640	is going on. And I think it's some sort of global spiritual relational and moral crisis.
721080	727680	And it shows up in the deepest essences of our societies. So the first thing is, and
727680	732200	I'll just take U.S. statistics, we've just gotten a lot sadder as a society, rising
732200	736640	suicide rates, rising mental health problems. The number of people who say they have no
736640	741440	close personal friends is up by four folds since 2000. The number of teenagers who say
741440	747000	they are persistently hopeless and despondent is 45%. The number of people not in a romantic
747040	751280	relationship is up by a third since 2000. The number of people who rate themselves in
751280	756680	the lowest happiness category is up by 50% since 2000. So we've just become a lot sadder
756680	761840	as a society. And when you get sadder, you get meaner. I give you all these stats statistics.
761840	766200	I can give you a bunch of mean statistics, gun violence, hate crimes. The one that gets
766200	770440	to me, it used to be two thirds of Americans give to charity, now fewer than half of Americans
770440	775680	give to charity. We've just become sadder and meaner. And that's deep in the fabric
775720	781920	of society. We've also gotten a lot more pessimistic. And some of that is the media's fault. We've
781920	786440	determined that we can get your eyeballs if we create headlines that generate fear and
786440	791520	anger. And so the number of headlines that generate fear and anger is up by about 200%
791520	798520	over the last 15 years. But it's not only the media. Some researchers took a look at
798800	805800	sort of global conversation in print starting in 1850 up till today. And they measured how
806160	812000	many of the books, magazine articles, newspaper articles, whatever, how many of them were positive
812000	819000	and how many were negative. And from 1850 to about 2008, most of this stuff was positive.
820320	823560	There were dips during the Great Depression, which you'd expect. And there were increases
823600	829240	in the 1990s when we had prosperity. But basically, we're a pretty happy country. And then starting
829240	835240	in the financial crisis, but ever since, the negativity of American culture has just collapsed.
835240	839320	So we have a more negative public culture than we did in the Great Depression, than
839320	843680	during World War II, than during World War I, than any of the crises of the past 150
843680	849480	years. We just are an incredibly pessimistic country. And if you've been asked high school
850480	855480	students, the share of high school students who say it's hard to have hope for my life
855480	862480	has been surging. And so this negativity has a political valence. On the right, it manifests
862800	867640	as catastrophism. And so I interview a lot of Trump people. And the general theme you
867640	873280	hear over and over and over again is this country is on the verge of total destruction.
873280	879200	It's just a catastrophizing mentality. On the left, it shows up in the form of mental
879200	885560	health problems and depression. And so 34% of conservatives say they report feeling in
885560	892320	poor mental health at least half the time, 34% of conservatives. But 57% of progressive
892320	896160	young people say they report feeling negative mental health. Just higher rates of mental
896160	902000	health problems, higher rates of neuroticism. And it's very gendered. 41% of liberal males
902040	907080	say they have poor mental health compared to 60% of liberal females. It's not clear
907080	913840	to me why this is happening, but you see the mental health crisis feeding into our politics.
913840	920040	And so my underlying point is that the global crisis of populism and the rise of authoritarianism
920040	926720	is not just about policy and politics. We're undergoing a global spiritual recession. And
926720	932400	a lot of people are trying to use politics as a form of social therapy. Remember Ryan
932400	936720	Streeter is a researcher formerly at the American Enterprise Institute. He discovered
936720	941000	that people who call themselves lonely are seven times more likely than others to be
941000	946960	active in politics. So there's a lot of lonely people dominating our political activism.
946960	951880	In a healthy society, we have what you call the politics of redistribution. We have big
951880	956080	arguments, but there are arguments about how high taxes should be or where spending
956080	960920	should go. And that's in a healthy society. We don't have that kind of politics anymore.
960920	965760	We have the politics of recognition. People are going into politics in order to feel good
965760	970080	about themselves and in order to make the other side feel shamed. They're going out
970080	976480	for a sense of purpose and meaning. And so people are using politics to fill a hole in
976480	983160	their own soul, to be affirmed and to get retribution on the people they dislike. Politics
983160	988040	is a seductive form of social therapy because it seems to solve your spiritual and psychological
988040	993280	problems. It gives you the illusion that there's a war of good and evil and you're on the side
993280	997240	of good. It gives you a moral landscape so you have some meaning in your life. It gives
997240	1002680	people a sense of belonging. If you're lonely, suddenly you're part of team red or team blue.
1002680	1007560	It gives people a sense of righteousness. That you don't have to sit with a widow or
1007560	1011200	feed the poor, but if you get indignant in front of the TV set, you feel you're doing
1011200	1017040	something right for the cause. And it gives people a sense of purpose, a sense that somehow
1017040	1021280	they're contributing to something larger than themselves. The problem is if you're asking
1021280	1027120	politics to fill a hole in your soul, to solve your psychological, relational and moral problems,
1027120	1031840	you're asking more of politics than it can give you. Because you don't really have community.
1031840	1036480	You're not working with others. You're just hating the same people. You don't really have
1036480	1040700	moral action. You're just indignant in front of the TV set. There's not really a morally
1040700	1045080	comprehensible landscape. It's not like one side has the monopoly on virtue and the other
1045080	1050720	side is monopoly on vice. And so when you try to use politics to fill the hole in your
1050720	1058160	soul, you're seeking to get out of the sense of anxiety, alienation, depression, but you're
1058200	1064720	simply winding up in a state of moral war. And it makes everybody mean and brutal and
1064720	1073220	makes all the problems worse. So I've tried to describe a kind of unpleasant America and
1073220	1079360	an unpleasant world, a negative mood. What's the cause? What are the deep roots of the
1079360	1086640	negative mood that I think is leading to populism and leading to authoritarianism? Well, I'll
1086680	1093280	start with some child psychology. There was a guy named John Bolsby many, many years ago who said
1093280	1099320	one of my favorite sayings about life in general. And the saying is, all of life is a series of
1099320	1106000	daring explorations from a secure base. All of life is a series of daring explorations from a
1106000	1111160	secure base. And he's a child psychologist, so he meant you need a strong family, a strong home,
1111560	1118840	and then you can be daring having a daring life. So do we have that in the world today? Do people
1118840	1124400	have a secure base? Do they have the opportunity to do daring explorations? And I think both those
1124400	1132000	things are in decline. So what is a secure base? A secure base in Bolsby's terms was family. And
1132000	1137200	family is not something you choose. Family is something that we're bred into. It's deep in our
1137200	1144480	soul. People are not transformed by institutions to which they are lightly attached. We're attached
1144480	1151000	to this specific family, this specific sacred piece of land, this specific country, this specific
1151000	1156560	philosophy or faith. These are things that we don't choose often, but they are deeply woven into
1156560	1162720	the fabric of our identity of who we are. And they give us a secure psychological base. When we
1162720	1168840	get married, it's not a contract. We're not doing it because it's in our self-interest. We're doing
1168840	1172440	it because we're willing to make a lifelong commitment, hopefully, to another human being.
1172440	1178080	Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who was the head rabbi in Britain until he died recently, explained the
1178080	1185280	difference between a contract and a covenant. He wrote, a contract is about interests. A covenant
1185280	1191680	is about identity. It is about you and me coming together to form an us. That is why contracts
1191720	1198680	benefit. A contract will benefit a person, but a covenant will transform a person. And specifically,
1198680	1205840	it is these attachments often, for most of us, to these deep things that are woven into our soul.
1205840	1213400	First, the family. Second, the sacred place, loyalty to America, loyalty to your town, loyalty to
1213400	1220440	your country. And third, is a sense of a moral order. Now, people who are religious have a sense
1220480	1225720	that there is a coherent moral order that is not dependent on our choices. And you don't have to
1225720	1231240	be religious to believe that. That there is a sense that the world is morally coherent and you
1231240	1237640	can build your life around a sense that there is such a thing as right and wrong. Civil rights
1237640	1243120	movement. Based on the idea that, as Lincoln said, if slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.
1243120	1249120	If segregation is not wrong, nothing is wrong. There is a coherent moral order woven into the
1249160	1257520	fabric of human life. George Marsden is a historian who wrote, what gave such widely compelling force
1257520	1263000	to King's leadership and oratory was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the
1263000	1269400	universe. And so it's very hard to feel existentially safe if everything's up for grabs. If right
1269400	1275800	and wrong are up for grabs. If your family are up for grabs. If your country is up for grabs. It's
1275840	1282840	hard to feel secure. Now, liberalism, democratic liberalism, which I revere, is based on individual
1282840	1290440	choice. It's based on the idea that we respect human dignity and we respect our choices. But
1290440	1297120	liberal societies only prosper when they are based on things that precede choice. There's only a firm
1297120	1302160	foundation for us to make our choices when there is these covenantal obligations to each other
1302160	1307280	through family, through nation, through God, or through some idea that there's a thing that's
1307280	1313720	called right and wrong. And when individual choice gets so extreme that it's eats away at the
1313720	1320000	covenants of our life, then it begins to erode the foundation of liberal society. And in my view,
1320000	1327000	over the last few years, liberalism has gotten, we've had an extreme form of liberalism. And this
1327000	1332160	is measurable. There's this thing called the World Value Survey. And the World Value Survey,
1332160	1338800	they go all around the world, and they ask people about their values, about how individualistic,
1338800	1344080	how much you believe in autonomy, or how much you believe in community. And especially in Europe
1344080	1349880	and the English-speaking world. Over the last 20 years, our values have shifted away from the
1349880	1355040	world. This is my view of a slide. I'm going to hold up a chart, which most of you will not be
1355040	1361720	able to see. That's my slide. This is my technology. But basically, the slide shows values all
1361720	1366240	around the world. The African world is over here, Latin America is over here, the Confucian world
1366240	1374640	is over here, and way out sticking at the end is the US and Western Europe. Our values have shifted
1374640	1381160	away from the rest of the world. We're much more individualistic, much more autonomous, and we've
1381600	1386600	entered this form of extreme liberalism, where everything is a matter of choice. I remember I
1386600	1393200	was teaching at Yale, only teaching at schools I couldn't have gotten into. And we were going around
1393200	1397560	the classroom, and the kids were, the students were talking about what they wanted to do after
1397560	1402640	college. And we got to one of my best students, a woman named Zara from Ghana. And she said,
1402640	1408920	well, you have to understand, it's not my choice. It's the village sent me here. And she just comes
1408960	1413760	from much more communal culture than those of us in the West. And but we have gotten so
1413760	1420480	individualistic, I think we've begun to undermine the fundamental foundations. Our families are in
1420480	1426800	trouble. Patriotism is in trouble. Our sense of social trust with one another is in trouble. But,
1426800	1431680	and that points to, I think, the most disorienting thing that's subtly disorienting to a lot of us,
1432680	1440200	what I call the privatization of morality. It's not only the privatization of morality is the
1440200	1444960	idea that each of us has to come up with our own moral values. And this is an extreme form of
1444960	1452280	liberalism. It's an extreme form of individualism. And if your name is Aristotle or Nietzsche, maybe
1452280	1457280	you can come up with your own moral philosophy. Most of us learn our morals in morally cohesive
1457320	1463000	communities. In our neighborhoods and our families, we have that sense of right and wrong formed
1463000	1468440	within us by the people who love us and the people who embrace us. And we have some sort of
1468440	1474600	existential security because of that. But when you privatize morality, then everyone set a drift.
1474600	1480840	And it's not only a drift like physically, deeply at the core of our souls were set a drift. And
1481840	1488880	Walter Littman, a great columnist in the middle of the 20th century, saw this coming. In 1955, he
1488880	1494800	wrote a book called The Essays in Public Philosophy. And he wrote, if what is good, what is right,
1494800	1501440	what is true is only what the individual chooses to invent than we are outside the traditions of
1501440	1510280	civility. And so what I'm really describing here is a sense of constant flux. A constant flux not
1510320	1514240	only in a lot of things in our life, which is good, but in the deepest foundations of our lives.
1514240	1520640	And this situation was foreseen also by two writers who I have never quoted from in a talk,
1520640	1526000	Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. I'm not a Marxist, but in the Communist Manifesto,
1526000	1531200	they wrote that bourgeois capitalist life will lead to the constant revolutionizing of production,
1531200	1538080	uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation. They wrote
1538120	1543120	all fixed, fast-frozen relationships with their trained of ancient and venerable prejudices and
1543120	1549720	opinions are swept away. New-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is
1549720	1555040	solid melts into air. All that is holy is profaned. And man is at last compelled to face the sober
1555040	1561040	senses, the real conditions of his life and his relations with his kind. All that is solid melts
1561040	1567760	into air. All that is holy is profaned. It's that sense of deep inner disturb that I think you
1567760	1574640	haunt a lot of us. And the authoritarians know exactly what to do with this. Whether it's
1574640	1584160	Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Iran, Hamas, Viktor Orban, Marine Le Pen, MAGA, what unites them? They
1584160	1588720	say, I'm going to restore order. I'm going to restore order to the street. I'm going to restore
1588720	1595160	order to the borders. I'm also going to restore order to your soul. They stand up for family. They
1595200	1601560	stand up for what, to me, are reactionary values on LGBTQ issues. They stand up for everything.
1601560	1606600	And they make it all about order. And so a lot of people flock to the authoritarians and the
1606600	1612640	populism because they're not only saying, screw those elites. They're saying, I'm restoring order
1612640	1618320	to your deepest anxieties. And it's just tremendously powerfully appealing to people all
1618360	1625880	around the world. So that's the first part, the lack of a secure base. And the authoritarians
1625880	1630560	promise, of course, they're not really delivering a secure base. They're just delivering authoritarian
1630560	1636920	narcissism. But it has this spiritual resonance with people. So the second part of that, John
1636920	1641920	Bolz, we quote, that all of life is a series of daring explorations from a secure base is a part
1641920	1648800	about the daring explorations, the chance and the opportunity to make sure your future is going to
1648800	1653560	be better than your past. We all need that sense that our life has some movements and purpose and
1653560	1661000	progress. And for a lot of us, it does. But for a lot of people in American society, it doesn't.
1661000	1668120	And the key divide in American society right now, and the key divide in our politics is over
1668120	1672560	education levels. And this is only true in America. It's true in all the countries I've been
1672560	1677960	talking about, what they call the diploma divide. So why would there be this gap which did not
1677960	1682680	used to exist? It used to be the political divisions are about money. Rich voted Republican,
1682680	1686920	poor people voted for the Democrats. Now it's highly educated people vote for the Democrats,
1686920	1692240	less educated people vote for the Republicans. And this basic pattern occurs again and again and
1692480	1698480	again all around the world. Why is that? The short answer to me and the reason a lot of people feel
1698480	1705280	they don't have a chance of possibility in daring explorations is that the game is rigged. That rich
1705280	1710240	people just have vastly better educational opportunities than poor people. Our sorting
1710240	1716600	society has created a caste system. Three year olds who come from a home with parents making over
1716600	1722760	$100,000 a year are twice as likely to attend preschool as poor parents, poor kids. By eighth grade,
1722760	1728240	children from affluent families are performing four grade levels higher than children from
1728240	1733880	poorer families. Students who grow up in a home making over $200,000 a year have a one in five
1733880	1740120	chance of scoring a 1,400 on their SATs, one in five. For poorer kids, the chances are one in 50.
1741000	1747480	At every step of the way, kids from highly educated parents and highly affluent parents
1747480	1753000	have this huge advantage. There's a guy named Daniel Markovitz who calculates that if you would add
1753000	1757800	up all the things that affluent parents give to their kids, whether it's private school tuition,
1757800	1765080	oboe practice, soccer practice, travel teams, even trips to museums, trips to Europe, it amounts
1765160	1772120	to a $10 million investment in each kid, and they just soar ahead. Kids whose families can't make
1772120	1779560	that contribution, they fall way behind. Markovitz made, to me, the shocking claim, which he's a
1779560	1787320	very careful scholar, is that the educational gap between rich kids and poor kids is now wider than
1787320	1793000	the educational gap between whites and blacks in the era of Jim Crow. That's just a yawning gap,
1793720	1800760	and it has produced a caste society. We don't live in a single society anymore. We live in a society
1800760	1807560	divided by educational levels. In 2003, there was a woman named Annette LaRoe, a great sociologist,
1807560	1814200	who studied how children are raised, and she said people from working class backgrounds practice
1814200	1819000	what she called natural growth parenting. Life is hard, let the kids enjoy their childhood.
1819880	1825160	Children from college-educated families practice what she called concerted cultivation,
1825160	1829480	which is how I raise my kids and how a lot of you probably raised your kids. The calendar becomes
1829480	1834200	the central thing on the door, and you're shepherding your kids, sports practices to
1834200	1839560	oboe practices to whatever, and you're really investing in your kids so you can thrive in
1839560	1845640	the meritocracy. But it has created a vast difference, so college-educated people live
1845640	1850440	very different lives than high school-educated people. The average high school grad in this
1850440	1856200	country lives eight years shorter than the average college grad. 40% of high school grads are obese
1856200	1862200	compared to 20% of college grads. High school grads are much less likely to marry and twice as
1862200	1867240	likely to get divorced than college grads. 60% of births to women with a high school degree
1867240	1874120	happen out of wedlock. That's a rate 20 times higher than college grads. The opioid death rate
1874120	1880200	for those with a high school degree was 10,000, was 10 deaths per 100,000. 10 deaths per 100,000.
1880760	1885800	For a college degree it was only two deaths per 100,000. And so these are just vast chasms
1886920	1893160	in how we live, how we prosper, or don't prosper. And so a lot of people look at that gap and they
1893160	1900280	say the system is rigged. And populists attack the educated class. Or as Donald Trump once put it,
1900280	1906360	I love the poorly educated. And so populists say those elites, they rig the game,
1906360	1910120	they close it off opportunities, you are screwed and I will fix the problem.
1911240	1916760	And so on both these deep levels, the need for a secure spiritual foundation for your life
1916760	1925320	and a sense of hope, populists claim to have an answer. And so I'll spend three minutes on
1925320	1933160	what we should do to repair the situation. The first is people are in the center and people are on
1933160	1941880	the left have to have some version of faith, family, and flag. We have too often allowed populist
1941880	1947080	authoritarians to grab, for example, patriotism. I took a walk today with a guy named Richard
1947080	1952520	Reeves who's speaking here today and he's from Britain. And he noticed that the far right was
1952520	1958280	seizing the British flag and seizing a lot of the symbols of British patriotism. So there's a
1958280	1964520	paper in the UK called The Guardian, which many of you know, it's a progressive paper. And on page
1964520	1972120	two, they had a big full page picture of the Red Cross, which is what there's a certain symbol of
1972120	1978680	England. And that the whole page two was that. And on the page one editorial said, we're not letting
1978680	1984200	the far right take this from us. Please cut out this piece of paper and hang it in your window of
1984200	1989000	your living room, because we're going to re-seize patriotism. We're not going to let the right have
1989000	1994760	that. So that's the first thing. And similarly, progressives and centrists have to have a way
1994760	2001480	to talk about the sacredness of family and the sacredness of patriotism. Second, and this is
2001480	2007080	Fred Riley who is executive director of Weave, the social fabric project, which we work on together,
2007800	2013880	it's the need to give people secure base, give them interpersonal trust. 71% of young people,
2014600	2021960	Gen Z, ask them, if you agree with this statement, most people are selfish and out to get you. 71%
2021960	2027960	of Gen Z, yes. How do you not live with fear if you think most people are selfish and out to get you?
2028680	2034120	And that's low social trust. And so what we do at Weave is we take people who are building trust
2034120	2040200	to the local level, and we try to support them. Trust is built locally by people who show up for
2040200	2046120	you, by people who are there with you, by people who know you. I wrote a book that came out in
2046120	2053960	October called How to Know a Person, and it was based on the idea that trust exists. Existential
2053960	2061240	security exists when the people around you see, hear, respect, and know you. When the reporting
2061240	2069560	of that book, I was down in Waco, Texas, and I was at a diner, and I'm having breakfast with a,
2070120	2076200	I think a 95-year-old lady named LaRue Dorsey, and she presents herself to me as this stern
2076200	2080920	disciplinarian, like she'd been a teacher, and she said, I loved my students enough to discipline
2080920	2087400	them. And I was a little intimidated by this drill sergeant later. But into the diner walks a mutual
2087400	2092840	friend of ours named Jimmy Dorell. And Jimmy Dorell sees us, he comes up to the diner, he grabs
2092840	2098360	Mrs. Dorsey by the shoulders, and shakes her way harder than you should ever shake a 95-year-old.
2099400	2103880	But he says to her, Mrs. Dorsey, you're the best, you're the best, I love you, I love you.
2104760	2108280	And that stern disciplinarian lady that I've been talking to, in an instant,
2108920	2115640	turns into a bright, eye-shining, nine-year-old girl. With the power of his gaze, he brought out a
2115640	2121240	different version of her. And that's when, when you have people around you who are able to see you
2121240	2127720	in that way, then it's, you feel seen, heard, you feel safe. We evolved to be surrounded by people
2127720	2133080	who were looking out for us. And part of the reason Jimmy Dorell was able to do that is that he's,
2133080	2138200	he's a warmer personality than I am. But part of it is he's a pastor. He pastures to the homeless
2138200	2141960	in Waco. He has a church called Church Under the Bridge. The homeless people didn't feel comfortable
2141960	2146440	going to his church, so he brought the church to them. He has it under a highway overpass where
2146440	2153480	they sleep. And so he's a pastor. So he thinks every person he sees is made in the image of God.
2154280	2160360	Every person he sees has a soul of infinite value and dignity. Every person he sees is so important,
2160360	2165080	Jesus was willing to die for that person. Now you could be Christian or Jewish or atheist or Muslim
2165080	2170040	or Buddhist, I don't care. But we have to learn to see each other with that level of reverence and
2170040	2178520	respect, or else we will feel unseen, disrespected, unheard, existentially unsafe. So that's ways to
2178520	2183960	try to create a secure base in the community as we've done, interpersonally as I hope to do in my
2183960	2192280	book, and on the national level as people come up with new ways to secure the family, secure the flag,
2192280	2198760	and secure faith. Then on the other side of the equation, we somehow have to create more opportunity
2198760	2205160	for a wider array of people. We have to fix the meritocracy. In the 1930s, a guy named James Conan,
2205160	2210280	who was president of Harvard, created our modern meritocracy. It is not a natural growth, it's an
2210280	2216840	ideological project. And his ideological project was the central human trait is intelligence.
2217800	2225160	And we're going to sort people starting at age five by how smart they are. And I'm fine with
2225160	2230760	intelligence. It's a good trait to have. It's not the most important trait in human ability. To me,
2230760	2236360	the most important trait in human ability is hunger. It's the drive to keep working, to keep
2236360	2242840	learning, to keep moving, and to keep getting better at something. The second trait is the ability to
2242840	2247480	work in teams. There's a funny thing that there's zero correlation between how you do in school and
2247480	2253800	how you do in life. Grades predict nothing. And that's because school is all about self. It's about
2253800	2258760	how am I doing individually. Life is generally about how am I doing as a team. How am I doing with
2258760	2265000	others? So there's a basic non sequitur between schools and life. The third trait I think is
2265000	2271160	character. Ask people, there was somebody who did a study, why do people get fired? In only 11%
2271160	2275160	of cases are people fired because they're not smart enough to do the job or they lack the technical
2275160	2282920	knowledge. The main reason people get fired, 89% of cases, is because they're assholes. Or they're
2283640	2289320	unteachable. They're uncoachable. They don't do well with their teammates. And so somehow we have
2289320	2295000	to build a meritocracy around a broader definition of merit that won't be able to be gained by the
2295000	2303560	rich. A definition of merit that includes drive, resilience, good character, empathy, social
2303560	2309720	ability. And if we widen out that, how we define merit, I think we'll have a fairer society.
2310440	2315720	And we won't have these bottlenecks for people. So these are tough times.
2317240	2325160	I, sometime last November, I was at a hotel bar on my travels. And if you'd seen me there,
2326120	2334920	you would have said, sad guy drinking alone. But I call it reporting. And so I was at the bar
2335800	2339640	and I'm on Twitter, of course, and I'm scrolling through all these images,
2340600	2347080	mostly from the Middle East. And they're just brutal images. And you think about the famous
2347080	2356840	dates of our century are just brutal dates. September 11th, January 6th, October 7th. It's
2356840	2362840	tempting in these times to turn into what the authoritarians want us to be, which is war of
2362920	2370520	all against all. Us versus them, it's just war. And yet as I'm scrolling through my phone,
2370520	2376200	looking at all these images, I come across a video and it's an interview with James Baldwin.
2377080	2380520	And he gave the interview, sometime it looked from the black and white images, it looked like
2380520	2387000	the early 60s. Now Baldwin was a guy who was horribly mistreated by his society because of
2387000	2392520	the color of his skin and because of the sexual orientation. And that guy had a right to feel
2392600	2398760	bitter and hatred. He had the right to sink into the enmity that drives so much of our politics.
2399640	2404760	But in this interview, he says, you know, there's not as much humanity as you would like in the
2404760	2411240	world. But there's enough. There's more than you would think. And then he says, you've got to remember
2411240	2417640	as you walk down the street, every single person you meet, that could be you. You could be that person.
2418600	2423560	You could be that saint. You could be that monster. And you've got to decide who you're going to be.
2424520	2430840	And so he could have calloused over, as I said, but instead he had this mentality, I could be that
2430840	2436200	person. I may like them. I may not like them. That could be me. And the phrase that leapt to
2436200	2442760	mine as I was listening to this little 60-minute or 60-second clip was defiant humanism, that even
2442920	2451320	in brutal times, when a lot of our political opponents are brutal and monstrous and frankly
2451320	2458040	authoritarian, that perversely and paradoxically the way to rebut them is to be more human,
2458920	2465320	is to touch the things that really we do need to solve our souls and to emphasize the deepest
2465320	2467320	parts of our nature. Thank you very much.
2483960	2488200	Now I have less some time for a question and answer. If anybody has comments or questions,
2488200	2492360	all that I ask is you make them long and be andering with no question at the end.
2492360	2499720	Do we have any mic runners? We have a mic runner.
2506840	2512840	Can you talk about your thoughts, how social media for young people especially
2513960	2517560	contributes to depression and loneliness?
2518200	2523000	So the mental health crisis has many causes as you expect. Some of it as I said I think is
2523000	2527800	philosophical and cultural in nature which is what I tried to describe but and I was a little
2527800	2534360	skeptical that social media was really leading to this incredible ramp up in depression and suicide
2535000	2539880	and my argument and I'm friends with a guy named Jonathan Hyde who's written about this was that
2539880	2544920	social media is everywhere but depression and suicide are not going up in Denmark, they're not
2544920	2551960	going up in Ghana and but Jonathan has persuaded me with a fair boatload of data that in fact
2551960	2557080	they are going up everywhere. Wherever there's social media there's a rise in suicide and a rise
2557080	2561400	in depression. Now we happen to get it worse because you combine social media with a highly
2561400	2566120	individualistic culture where people feel solitude it's going to have the effect is going to be a
2566120	2571960	lot worse so I am become convinced that social media truly is horrible not that I get off it but
2572200	2577960	um and that one of the Jonathan's proposals which I think is gaining great traction it's rare you
2577960	2582040	see a somebody in my business say we should do this and then suddenly all across the country
2582040	2588600	people are doing it and Jonathan's one proposal is no phones in schools and school district after
2588600	2593880	school district is now adopting this and it's like a lot of technologies at first we don't know that's
2593880	2599320	dangers but once we learn the dangers we know we adapt and so I think that's happening with social
2599320	2604200	media we're adapting I think that'll happen with AI eventually too but maybe way there in the back
2607160	2613800	information could you restate the source of the uh motivating quote at the beginning
2613800	2619160	about base and exploration who was that a guy named John Bolesby who was the father of the
2619160	2625080	thing called attachment theory he I think he was like 1940s 1950s John Bolesby uh all of life
2625080	2632120	is a syringe of daring explorations from a secure base I see a couple little Katie
2636280	2642600	thank you I just love you David Brooks thank you for this incredible presentation
2643320	2651240	you're so thoughtful and smart and compassionate but I wanted to ask you for some real world advice
2651240	2656600	you know and this isn't going to be a long story I promise but I did a breast cancer walk recently
2656600	2661240	and a woman came up to me and said I really love you even though we're very different politically
2661240	2668520	I'm pretty sure and then I tried to kind of talk to her and I said oh well why are you
2668520	2675080	feeling the way you're feeling and I said do you believe are you do you have do you believe the
2675080	2682760	election was rigged and she said yes I do and I said but there's 60 plus lawsuits you know I did
2682760	2687880	the whole thing like why it wasn't and she said no I really think it was I've seen evidence
2688600	2695080	and can you tell us how to talk to people you know and how to lean into our humanity
2695080	2706120	when people believe things that just aren't true yeah it's really hard right I mean I was nice to
2706120	2713000	her but I just was frustrated yeah hey this is paradox that you're asking me this question
2713000	2717960	because one of my earlier years here a woman came up to me after I gave a talk and it was
2717960	2722520	a more one of my more personal talks and she talked about her son getting killed in a car crash
2723400	2728200	and I had no idea what to say and but I'm happened to be behind Katie Couric at the
2728200	2733240	security line at the Espen airport on the way out so I asked you what do you say and you gave me
2733240	2740600	good advice mostly just hugs but I would say so I'm at a baseball game and it's the night
2740600	2747480	inning in Washington and a guy turns around to me and says hey are you David Brooks and I think
2748120	2751960	nice he'll like my he'll say oh I like your column you know I like your show whatever
2752600	2754840	and I said yeah and he said you're a fucking asshole
2757720	2762920	and he like he's and my son was there and he said to my son you should be ashamed of your
2762920	2766840	father he's awful and this was a Trump guy and my wife is there and she's trying to calm him down
2766840	2772040	she's get off me woman and then he says I'm shaking I'm in the presence of evil and that was
2772040	2780040	like oh and I would like to think that at that moment my son and I rose above conflict and reached
2780040	2787240	out with compassion and empathy and understanding sadly that did not happen we were as nasty as he
2787240	2792360	was so I'm not and my wife was genuinely angry with me with the right to be but what I've learned
2792360	2797000	there's a highly recommended a book called Crucial Conversations by a guy named Joseph
2797000	2802040	Granny and a bunch of other people it's how to have these hard conversations and they point out
2802040	2806600	something which I've learned when somebody comes up with that kind of critique from a Trump's board
2806600	2813240	or whatever or from the further left my first job is to stand in their standpoint it's to ask them
2813240	2819080	three or four or five times how did you come to believe what you believe and I never ask people
2819080	2823800	anymore what do you believe I ask how did you come to believe that because that way you're getting
2823800	2830440	them in narrative mode and they talk about an experience they talk about a somebody who shaped
2830440	2837720	their values and then so I asked them three or four or five times and I may not persuade them I may
2837720	2843960	not agree but at least I'm showing them the respect of curiosity and in this book Crucial Conversations
2844600	2851480	the authors say in any conversation respect is like air when it's present nobody notices
2851480	2857000	when it's absent it's all anybody can think about and so a lot of the people who hold these views
2857000	2862200	feel profoundly disrespected and if you can show them respect I'm not sure you will persuade them
2862200	2867480	I'm not sure anything haven't I've been written a million anti-trump columns in the last seven years
2867480	2872520	for all the good it's done to the world but at least you'll show them that respect and I think
2872520	2876840	that will solve some of the sense of hurt the sense that you looked at you people look down on me
2877800	2884840	and the the other thing those people in Crucial Conversations say is that every conversation
2884840	2890040	that exists at two levels what we're nominally talking about and the real conversation which
2890040	2895320	is the flow of emotions flowing between us with every comment we make to each other we're making
2895320	2901240	each other feel more respected or less respected more safe or less safe and so by standing in their
2901320	2905960	standpoint hopefully you're making them feel more safe and less condescended to
2907240	2911160	and I don't know if that'll change the world but it's the only thing I could think of
2913000	2919560	maybe in the in the back I see a couple hands we've got two minutes and 45 seconds
2924680	2928600	thank you for your talk Fidel Vargas president CEO of the hispanic scholarship fund and I
2928600	2935080	apologize I came in a little late but one of the other things I seem to notice and I would love
2935080	2942280	to hear your perspective homogenous societies versus diverse societies France the United States
2942840	2948680	versus say Japan how is that playing out because it's a whole lot easier to
2949480	2956360	say the other and who's causing our problems how does that play into everything yeah I mean
2956360	2963320	we evolved to live with 150 people like ourselves we evolved for homogeneity we now get to live and
2963320	2968920	it's a privilege and honor to live in much more diverse societies and it's to me it's a wonderfully
2968920	2975720	great thing but it's just tougher it's tougher for me to relate to somebody whose lifestyle
2975720	2981400	whose historical narrative is vastly different than my own and that that one of the reasons I
2981400	2986600	wrote that book I had to know a person is because we have to up our social skills to fit the society
2986600	2995160	we're living in and these traits go super deep I there was an election in Connecticut a guy named
2995160	3000840	Ned Lamont ran against a guy named Joe Lieberman and researchers found after that election that every
3000840	3007800	town that was settled by the Portuguese in the 17th century voted for Lieberman and every town
3007880	3013320	settled by the English voted for Lamont these are 350 year old categories and they're still
3013320	3021000	shaping belief I have a party conversation you can tell how fun I am at parties where I asked the
3021000	3025080	following question and I asked that at dinner party recently how do your ancestors show up in your
3025080	3030200	life it's like we all know we're formed by our heritage but how and so there was a Dutch family
3030200	3033720	there and they talked about their Dutch heritage there was a black family there they talked about
3033720	3039080	the African-American experience I talked about 5,000 years of Jewish history which I'm sure was
3039080	3045480	a scintillating two and a half hours for them but you know we're so deeply formed by our ancient
3045480	3052200	heritages and you just have to be very socially skilled to see people in that level of profound
3052200	3060040	difference but once you do it it's fun and I'll close with this bit of research a concrete way to
3060040	3064680	change your life so I'm buddies with a guy named Nick Epley he's a social psychologist at University
3064680	3070920	Chicago and he was because he's a social psychologist he knows that every the thing that makes us
3070920	3076200	happiest is talking to each other we pretty relational social animals and so he's on his
3076200	3081480	commuter train on the way up to campus from his home and he's looking around the car and everybody
3081480	3086360	is on their phones not a single person is talking to each other so he's a social psychologist for
3086360	3092840	the next couple months he pays people on the train to talk to a stranger and he asks them
3092840	3097480	afterwards when they get off the train how'd you like it and they all say that was the most
3097480	3103000	enjoyable ride I've had in months we underestimate how we how much we want to talk to each other
3103000	3109400	we underestimate how much we're going to go deep we want to go deep and so I did a presentation
3109400	3115240	with them at Chicago a couple months ago now and we're doing our conversation on stage and he says
3115240	3121000	stop I'm gonna make everybody in this room find a stranger and for the next 10 minutes tell them
3121000	3128760	about the last time you cried and you hear this groan go up from the crowd and he says how many
3128760	3133480	of you want to do this and a few hands go up how many of you don't want to do it 80% of the hands
3133480	3142840	went up and he said go and they did it and 10 minutes pass and we can't get them to set up so
3142840	3149240	we can get back to our conversation and then finally when they do come up he says how many
3149240	3155160	of you enjoyed that and 80% of the hands went up and that's just a small practical thing so now
3155160	3160840	when I'm on the plane I often talk to the stranger I wait till there's only an hour left in the
3160840	3168600	flight in case I'll be boring but still but it's just a concrete practical way to instill a little
3168600	3174040	social relationship a little social trust and to weaken the kind of existential loneliness
3174680	3181720	that I think is the cause of a lot of our problems so thank you very much
3228600	3229400	you
