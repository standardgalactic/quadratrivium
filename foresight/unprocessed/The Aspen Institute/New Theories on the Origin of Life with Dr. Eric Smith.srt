1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Hey, good evening, welcome.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,400
My name is Jerry Murdoch.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,120
Most of you in the room, or the many of you that know me, mostly know me as that guy who's

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
married to Gina Murdoch.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,840
But I'm also a board member here at the Aspen Institute and at the Santa Fe Institute and

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
at the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,040
This is the second event of the 2015 McCloskey Speaker Series.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,880
I want to thank Bonnie and Tom McCloskey family who are sitting right here.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,160
This is wonderful.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,680
So tonight's speaker, Dr. Eric Smith, has challenged disciplinary boundaries throughout

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,440
his career.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,880
First is an undergraduate at Caltech in getting his degree in mathematics and in physics.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,520
And then at the University of Texas, Austin, where he earned his PhD in high-energy physics

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,880
while working on string theory and quantum gravity, which was followed by appointments

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,920
at Los Alamos.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,880
And then he spent 11 years at the Santa Fe Institute as a full-time faculty member.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,120
During his time at Santa Fe Institute, I had the good fortune to meet him.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,840
And in full disclosure, I've been funding his work for over a decade, his work in regards

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,480
to the origin of life, which we're going to hear about tonight.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,640
And while at Santa Fe Institute, he was also doing interdisciplinary work in geochemistry,

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,720
biochemistry, and many topics related to complexity.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:02:06,320
Currently, Eric is a professor and researcher at the Earth Life Institute in Tokyo.

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,960
And he's also a external faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,040
His goal is to understand origin and nature of the living state through the many windows

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,440
that science provides, the physical, geochemical, biochemical, ecological, and evolutionary.

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,720
Additionally, he remains interested in the connections or correspondences between energy,

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,760
information, and computation.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,240
Most of us think about life as being something created from other living things.

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,320
But much of Eric's work focuses on the time before biology, when life on Earth emerge

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,360
from geophysical and chemical processes.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,440
The subject of tonight's talk is based on material from his upcoming book, co-written

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,000
by the legendary biologist Harold Morowitz, which is entitled, The Emergence of the Fourth

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,560
Geosphere, to be published in 2016 by Cambridge University Press.

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
His work disrupts Francis Crick's notion that life was a happy accident.

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Indeed, the material has consequences for the way we think about the relationship of

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,760
the individual to ecology.

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,920
The big picture of origin of life shows that ecosystems, not individuals, are carrying

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,240
some of the most fundamental patterns of life.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Furthermore, the work leads us to understand that the nature of living state is different

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,520
from the nature of individuality, and that we have been wrongly conflating the two in

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,480
our understanding of biology.

43
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,640
Therefore, we should strive to achieve a more ecology-centered biology to help us guide

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,320
our life in a more sustainable way within the biosphere.

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:07,560
Finally, both his upcoming book and tonight's talk will challenge us to rethink what is

46
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,720
the nature of life.

47
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,320
Without further ado, let's welcome Eric Smith.

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:31,640
Thank you.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,760
So thank you, Jerry, and good evening, everybody.

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Welcome.

51
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,880
You might think at the least that the problem of the origin of life, how did life appear

52
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,400
on an earth that previously had not had life, is mostly a history problem.

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,080
What happened and when and where did it happen?

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,000
You could go a little bit beyond that and you might think of it as a problem of cause.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,280
How did things happen and why?

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:02,160
The argument that I want to make tonight is that we actually need to go further than that.

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,200
The things that we've learned about the technical problems of when, where, and how have caused

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,760
us to realize that the nature of life is different from a lot of the patterns that we've traditionally

59
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,080
used to think about it.

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,760
The reason the origin of life problem is hard is that we do something in science that we

61
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
also do in everyday life.

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,040
We put a big gap between the living things and the nonliving things.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,760
It's very difficult to see across that gap how something like life could have come from

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,560
something that was not alive.

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,920
So when we think about life, we often think about it in these terms.

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,480
Life is made of individuals.

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
They have agency.

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,520
Maybe they have purpose or intentions that gives the biosphere direction.

69
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,440
Even if the direction didn't come from the individuals, it comes from evolution.

70
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Life is energetic, it's complex, and it's endlessly fascinating.

71
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Compare that to rocks.

72
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
What do rocks do?

73
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
They just sit there.

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,280
They've been around for billions of years.

75
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,640
So what I want to argue to you tonight is that the conceptual gap between the nonliving

76
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,960
world and living world is not real, or it's not where we have tried to place it in the

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
past.

78
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,120
The nonliving world is very active.

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,520
It's richly structured in its activity, and the biosphere from the beginning all the way

80
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,760
to the present is embedded in detail in the structure of that chemical activity of the

81
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,680
rest of the planet.

82
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,200
We haven't recognized the connections because our ways of looking have been too small or

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,800
they've been too short term.

84
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,920
They've been on the scale of a human life, or maybe we've looked in the wrong places.

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,680
But particularly in the last 30 years, things that we've learned in a variety of different

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,040
disciplines are changing the way we ask those questions, and those are the things that cause

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,920
us to reevaluate what we think the nature of life is and what we're trying to explain.

88
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,840
So tonight, I want to cover four points.

89
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,720
First of all, to understand the nature of life and the origin of life, you have to understand

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,520
its planetary context, and that context is what I will call a great arc of disequilibrium

91
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,040
on the scale of the whole planet.

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,760
Now even though that disequilibrium or stress runs through all of the systems on the planet,

93
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,040
we can break it apart and we can make it comprehensible by doing something that geologists have done

94
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,740
for more than a century.

95
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,640
We can divide the planet into geospheres, which are separate domains of states of matter

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,120
and kinds of chemistry.

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
What we're looking for in the nature of life is actually at the level of the biosphere

98
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,760
as a whole, not at the level of its components, of species or organisms or sub-organism components.

99
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,640
The conclusion that I want to leave us with at the end of the night is that the biosphere

100
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,760
is the fourth geosphere.

101
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,200
We should understand it as a planetary subsystem, and we should understand the emergence of

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,320
life as a stage in planetary maturation akin to the stages that cause the other geospheres

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,480
to be separated from each other.

104
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,720
So in classical geology, a lifeless planet can have three geospheres.

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,320
The lithosphere, from the word for rock, is the solid bulk.

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,360
On Earth, this is almost all of the matter and the mass of the planet.

107
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,160
The state of matter is solid, and the chemistry characteristic of the lithosphere is the chemistry

108
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,720
of minerals and their changes.

109
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,360
Second geosphere is the hydrosphere.

110
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
This is all of the watery domains.

111
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,920
Water chemistry is very special.

112
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,920
It's very restrictive, and as we've known forever, water chemistry is fundamental to

113
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,920
the nature of life, and it's in part important because of all the things you can't do in

114
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,840
water that you have to be distinctive that life does.

115
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,680
The third non-living geosphere is the atmosphere.

116
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,440
This is the gas phase because it's cool and because it's at low density.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,440
There are certain kinds of chemistry that are possible in the atmosphere that are not

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
possible other places.

119
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,280
Now the chemistry of the atmosphere is not actually very much like the chemistry of life,

120
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,760
but it turns out that it's really important to the great arc of planetary disequilibrium

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,800
that will be central to our story.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,720
And the fourth is the biosphere.

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,840
A lifeless planet will always have a lithosphere.

124
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,320
If it has enough volatiles, as they're called, the liquids and gases, it can also have hydrospheres

125
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,640
or atmospheres.

126
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,880
I want to look at the earth as it is, and everything that causes it to be different

127
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,560
from a planet that only had the three lifeless geospheres.

128
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,240
And all of that difference is what I mean by the biosphere.

129
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,360
So it is organisms, but not only organisms.

130
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,080
It's all of their ecological relations, it's their history, and it's all the changes that

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,960
they have collectively brought about in the rest of the planet throughout its history.

132
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,920
So it's in the sum rather than in the components that we look for the nature of the living

133
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
state.

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,760
So I've said that there's not a gap that separates life conceptually from the rest of the earth,

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,080
but certainly the biosphere is different from the non-living geospheres.

136
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,880
It's different in many ways, but if we had to choose one that's most important, here's

137
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,280
the one I would argue it is.

138
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,240
For the other geospheres, the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, we can understand

139
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,280
most of them in terms of their structure.

140
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,480
For the biosphere, you can only really understand it as an organized state of activity.

141
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,600
In order to create an organized state of activity that goes beyond just structure, you have

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,120
to be in a circumstance that physicists call far from equilibrium, and I'll explain to

143
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,700
you in a minute what that means.

144
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,920
The important thing is that the disequilibria we need to understand life are not something

145
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,040
local, they're not local in space and they're not local in chemistry, they actually are

146
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
built up on the scale of the whole planet.

147
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,600
So to give you a flavor for what is meant by near equilibrium or far from equilibrium,

148
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,560
I'll use something that's a little of an analogy, but it's an analogy that's mathematically

149
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,600
faithful.

150
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,400
Near equilibrium is like the ripples on a pond.

151
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,840
There may be activity that's caused by disturbances, but most of what there is to understand can

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,520
be understood from the structure of the flat surface before you start.

153
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,040
This is far from equilibrium.

154
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Think of the biosphere as surfing on a continuously renewed wave of energy flow.

155
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
That energy flow is needed to keep it up where it is, it's needed to keep it organized.

156
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,360
Now it's been understood forever that life requires a flow of energy to maintain itself.

157
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,000
But to say that something is required doesn't say that that's necessarily possible, it only

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,320
tells you what's impossible.

159
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,480
Tonight I want to argue for something stronger.

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,100
I want to argue that the energy flows on earth brought the biosphere into existence.

161
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,680
It's as if the wave had created the surfer.

162
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,620
So traditionally when we come at the problem of the origin of life from the habits of biology,

163
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,480
we ask where is the surfer and what is the surfer like?

164
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,200
What I want to argue with here is that the right question should be where is the wave?

165
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
So the story of disequilibrium that makes sense of the origin of life doesn't start

166
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,960
on the planet, it actually starts in the formation of the solar system.

167
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,440
Now when we look at the sun, the part we see is the photosphere.

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Photosphere is relatively cool.

169
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
It's only about 6,000 degrees Celsius, which is about the same temperature as the core

170
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,200
of the earth.

171
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,280
And it looks relatively smooth and flat like you see here, occasional sunspots.

172
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,120
But if you were to look at the sun in the X-ray with a movie, you'd find a boiling cauldron

173
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,400
of magnetic fluid.

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,040
Because the sun produces heat and the heat needs to convect and because it's electrically

175
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,640
conductive, you get loops of magnetism that boil up from the interior and whip plasma into

176
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,360
the outer layers of the atmosphere.

177
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,080
This action can cause the middle atmosphere of the sun, called the chromosphere, to go

178
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,440
up to 100,000 degrees or more.

179
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,240
And it can elevate the corona to a million degrees or more.

180
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,720
So plasma at 100,000 degrees emits extreme ultraviolet radiation, and at a million degrees

181
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,080
or more it emits X-rays.

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,920
So if you could look at the sun with a picture in the extreme UV in the X-ray, this is actually

183
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,080
what you would find.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,520
The activity of a star like this is due to convection and the conductivity of the plasma,

185
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,880
but also to the rotation, because this is a Coriolis effect, the same as hurricanes.

186
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,480
And when stars are young when they're born, they rotate much faster and they spin down

187
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
over time.

188
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,120
So when the sun was young, all of this activity was actually more vigorous and more violent

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,160
than it is today.

190
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,080
Now that kind of hard radiation shapes planetary atmospheres, and in particular it drives them

191
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,160
far out of equilibrium from the planet that they surround.

192
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,120
So in particular, ultraviolet and above will break water.

193
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,440
Water is the H2O molecule where the Hs are white and the O is red, and it will separate

194
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,280
the hydrogen from the oxygen.

195
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,400
Hydrogen is a very light element, and so anything will cause it to escape.

196
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,800
And the result is that you leave the oxygen behind.

197
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
This is actually a satellite photo of the Earth taken with a filter for the emission

198
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,200
lines that see hydrogen.

199
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,160
And what you can see is that our planet is surrounded by a halo of hydrogen that's continually

200
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,040
escaping from it.

201
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,960
That turns out to have major consequences.

202
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,400
Because the rates of hydrogen loss that a star like our sun produces will remove a volume

203
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,880
of water comparable to the Earth's ocean in about a billion years.

204
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:14,120
So if you were Venus, which is about our size but closer to the sun and a little bit warmer,

205
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,240
or if you were Mars, which is smaller and has weaker gravity to hold elements, you would

206
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,960
have wound up in the condition that they're in today, with no surface water, oxygen left

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,520
behind that turns the dry surface a rusty red.

208
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,880
In about four and a half billion years, the Earth may be in this condition, depending

209
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,680
on how much water is on the inside, which is something we don't know.

210
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,520
But for the time being, the Earth is a very unusual planet in the solar system, and possibly

211
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,560
more widely than that.

212
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,440
But why does any of this matter to the origin of life?

213
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,800
To answer that, you need to know a little bit of chemistry, but all you need to know

214
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,200
is on this one slide.

215
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,160
And it's intuitive, I promise.

216
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,800
In the periodic table of the elements, we have many different kinds of animals.

217
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,080
Some of the elements have a stronger what's called affinity for electrons than others.

218
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,800
And in particular, important to our story, iron is very ready to give electrons away

219
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,440
to many other elements, giving electrons away to something called reducing that, because

220
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,080
electrons have a negative charge.

221
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,880
At the opposite end, oxygen is very greedy and will steal electrons from many elements.

222
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,360
And so you can see the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen in the suites of minerals

223
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
in the world.

224
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,120
Iron metal, which mostly doesn't exist at the surface, has all of its electrons, and

225
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,520
they're loosely bound, so they make a kind of a liquid, and that's why iron is silvery

226
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,880
and shiny and reflects light.

227
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,720
If you bring in a little bit of oxygen, enough that there's one oxygen atom per iron atom,

228
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,600
it will transfer two electrons to the oxygen, and we note that with a plus two on the iron

229
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,520
and a minus two on the oxygen, and you get this dull silvery mineral called vistite,

230
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,400
which is no longer shiny because the free electrons are gone.

231
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Little bit more so that you're in a mix between giving two and giving three electrons away,

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,560
and you have magnetite, which is black.

233
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,320
This is what the original compasses were made of.

234
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,600
If you give yet more, you get this rusty red mineral called hematite, which is one of the

235
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,360
elements of rust.

236
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,600
Now as we all know, rust happens, and the spontaneity of this electron donating process

237
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,960
is a source of chemical energy.

238
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,160
If you look at that at a planetary scale, you realize that what happens is that hydrogen

239
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,800
escape is turning our whole planet into a giant battery, because this is how batteries

240
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
work.

241
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,480
There are two different elements, one of which gives electrons and one of which takes them,

242
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,160
and you force the electrons to flow through something so that you can harness the work.

243
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
In the earth, in the interior region known as the mantle, most of the iron is in this

244
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,000
plus two state, but near the surface it gets pulled to the plus three state by the oxygen

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,200
that's continually made available as we lose water to hydrogen escape.

246
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,640
Now on a quiet earth, that battery would run down, because even though you originally

247
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,720
had oxygen to donate electrons at the surface, that would basically weather over the same

248
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,280
way you get a layer of oxide on an aluminum window sill.

249
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,680
The only thing that allows the battery to be continually refreshed is that new material

250
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,920
is delivered to the surface of the earth at the same time as hydrogen is continually

251
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,600
scoured away out of the atmosphere.

252
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,560
But that redelivery brings a second kind of disequilibrium into the picture to understand

253
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,520
the context for life.

254
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,800
So if you could look at a cross section of the earth on 100 million year time scales,

255
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,280
so this is where human life is too short to see, you would actually see cool material

256
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,320
being brought down from the surface, and you can barely see in this picture, I apologize

257
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,520
for the colors, the yellow heat from the core being boiled up.

258
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,720
So the interior plastic rock of the mantle is constantly in convective turnover driven

259
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,000
by this need to release heat.

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,400
If at the same time you could see the chemical composition of the rock, you would find that

261
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,400
the oxidized, exhausted crust on the surface is being pulled down and remixed into the

262
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,240
mantle, while the electron giving iron material in the interior is allowed to come to the

263
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,400
surface and make new crust.

264
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,800
So when you put all these processes together, this is the picture you get of the big earth.

265
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,240
Convection continually refreshes the surface rock at the same time as the solar radiation

266
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,080
pulls the hydrogen away.

267
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,600
The important thing is that the new crust is not created uniformly everywhere.

268
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,000
It's created in concentrated centers, which are called spreading centers or mid ocean

269
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
ridges beneath the ocean bottom.

270
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,920
The process of convection causes what are called plate tectonics, the movement of the

271
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,160
major plates around, where they subduct, they create earthquakes and volcanoes which

272
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,560
deliver other concentrated new rock to the surface, and when there are continents riding

273
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,120
around on them, they cause continental drift.

274
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,600
So this is a map of the bottom of the ocean showing its age.

275
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,560
The entire bottom of the ocean gets replaced about once every 250 million years as the continents

276
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,200
go back and forth opening and closing in a cycle.

277
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,400
The mid ocean ridges are these red regions of newly created crust in the centers of all

278
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,000
of the world's oceans, and then the blue regions are the old crust that's diving back into

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,280
the mantle as they do under Tokyo where I'm living.

280
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,400
Now the sites where new crust is created are themselves very interesting because you're

281
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,120
taking rock that's miles thick and you're twisting it and separating it and pulling

282
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,680
it, so they're filled with cracks and pores.

283
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,400
And in this domain, seawater invades and it gets chemically altered by the rock.

284
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,640
The invasion sites and then the remixing zones where the water comes back up are the places

285
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,440
where a battery that accumulates over the entire planetary surface and bulk gets concentrated

286
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,920
into these narrow ranges.

287
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,440
So this map shows you the same spreading centers and the little red dots are the places where

288
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,600
geologists have mapped out regions of active rock-water interaction.

289
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,200
This is a tiny subset of the ones that are believed to exist, but these now constitute

290
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,600
the evidence we have about where the Earth's battery mostly flows.

291
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,700
And if you look at the electron transfer, if you do a calculation from the interior

292
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,880
to the atmosphere, it's concentrated at these little release points right around here.

293
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,160
So the importance of this is that this is where stress piles up in the world even though

294
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:05,480
it's accumulated diffusely.

295
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,120
So up to this point, we've closed half the gap.

296
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,600
Hopefully I have convinced you that rocks don't just sit there, that the Earth is chemically

297
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,880
active and that it's organized.

298
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,160
But before the 1970s, even knowing all of this, and much of this was understood roughly,

299
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,360
people still would not have been able to make a connection to the origin of life, because

300
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,160
life still seemed so different.

301
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,680
What I want to show you next is that's because up until about the 1970s, we thought we understood

302
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,480
the nature of life, and our view of life was basically entirely upside down.

303
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,720
What's important about the last 50 years is that we've learned about an entire new part

304
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,520
of the biosphere that we didn't understand, and we've learned that it's that other part,

305
00:22:50,520 --> 00:23:03,640
not us, that gives the clues about where life came from and the real foundations of its nature.

306
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,920
So understandably, for most of history, when we think about the nature of life, we think

307
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,880
about things that are big enough to see, because we didn't have microscopes.

308
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,200
And that means the plants and the animals and the fungi.

309
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,600
But what these all have in common is that ultimately they're all fed by this green forest here.

310
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,800
They all live off of the energy from sunlight, and that's a problem, because capturing sunlight

311
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,120
is the most complicated thing living systems do.

312
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,040
And so we were never able to surmount that chicken egg problem.

313
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,520
How would you ever get up to something as complicated as the machinery that harnesses

314
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:44,520
sunlight if you needed the sunlight energy to build that machinery in the first place?

315
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:51,040
But in 1977, Jack Corliss, Richard von Herzen, and Robert Ballard led an expedition to the

316
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,480
Galapagos Rift, one of our spreading centers, with the deep submersible elven, which at

317
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,320
that time was new.

318
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
They were drawn there because there had been measurements of the seawater overlying that

319
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,840
were anomalously warm, and so they suspected there were rock-water interactions taking

320
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,080
place.

321
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,000
But they were completely unprepared for what they would see, both about the geology and

322
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,760
about the life hosted there.

323
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,520
Immediately after those discoveries, there were new hypotheses about how life had originated

324
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,460
that are substantively much like what is mostly believed today.

325
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,680
But together with other changes that were going on around the same time in microbiology

326
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,840
and molecular biology, they completely changed our understanding of how the biosphere is

327
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,600
organized and what was its history.

328
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,840
So what Alvin saw, the first discovery, was these thundering plumes of sulfide and heavy

329
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,760
metal-rich water coming up from the deep, where they mix with cool seawater.

330
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,720
They precipitate these enormous chimneys that can be 45 or 60 feet tall.

331
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,480
This water would poison us immediately because of the metals and the sulfide that it's full

332
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
of.

333
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
The temperature differences are extreme.

334
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
350 degrees versus 4 degrees makes a mirror under this flange.

335
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,160
But the most amazing thing was the animal colonies that live around here.

336
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,920
The water would poison us, but it's the source of energy for entire ecosystems like these

337
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,800
tube worms and the shrimp that live around them.

338
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,840
Now the red color you see here, even though it looks like flowers, has nothing to do with

339
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,480
pigments because there's no light down here.

340
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,720
That's hemoglobin.

341
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
These are the worms' lung that stick out into the water to perform gas exchange.

342
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,640
But the most important thing of all about these ecosystems is that the worms don't build

343
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
life.

344
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,960
All of the life is built by bacteria.

345
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,080
The worms gather gases that the bacteria use to build their biomass in these shimmering

346
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,040
zones of mixing.

347
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,080
That was a whole parallel biosphere that was not anticipated.

348
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,280
But the Alvin expedition did more than show us that there's more diversity in the world

349
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,200
than we realized.

350
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Similar with the other discoveries, it forced us to reconsider what it is that determines

351
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
living form.

352
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
There is a role for evolution in this, but I'll come back to evolution second because

353
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,040
it's actually not our first story.

354
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,160
The first story is that some of the patterns of life are written into the rules of chemistry

355
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,520
and the planetary energy flows before there's ever material for evolution to act on.

356
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,280
The important conclusion in this will not only be new insights about organisms, but

357
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,920
also a new way to understand ecosystems that makes them more fundamental than organisms.

358
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,600
So let me talk about typology.

359
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Suppose we had to play a game of 20 questions where I had to learn as much about some organism

360
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
as possible in the fewest number of questions.

361
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,560
What should those questions be?

362
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,360
Turns out they would not first be about its history.

363
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
My choice of the first two would be these.

364
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,040
I would first ask, where does it get its energy?

365
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,800
Does it get its energy from molecules that give electrons the way hydrogen does or from

366
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,920
molecules that take electrons the way oxygen does?

367
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,020
Then second, I would ask, how much do I learn if I only see the organism?

368
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,640
Is the organism metabolically complete?

369
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,200
Does it feed itself, which is the condition called autotrophy?

370
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,600
Or is the organism incomplete so that it depends on an ecosystem to provide it, the condition

371
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
called heterotrophy or being fed from somebody else?

372
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,960
Because if it's incomplete, then even if I study that metabolism, I haven't understood

373
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,440
what is sufficient to make life.

374
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,880
So the first thing you realize is that everything we used to think about is down in this one

375
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,760
lower right corner here.

376
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
So they are not the norm.

377
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,920
The other thing you realize is that on this side, they're all green or they eat something

378
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,800
green or something that eats something green.

379
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,720
So these are the complicated guys and they were the ones we were trying to understand

380
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
from.

381
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,940
These are the ones that were discovered in the deep subsurface and the bottoms of the

382
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,240
oceans.

383
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Now if we look at the evolutionary view and we reconstruct history, we realize that it's

384
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
telling us the same story.

385
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,480
Of course, people and most of the things people know exist at a little tiny tip of this tree

386
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
here.

387
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,760
And in fact, anything that has more than one cell lives on these few branches that have

388
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,780
slightly thickened lines.

389
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,080
Everything else in the world is unicells.

390
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,440
And before, I don't know, 600 million years ago, that was all there was in the world.

391
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,800
More than that, these are the only complex single celled organisms.

392
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,840
The cells that have the simpler form of bacteria make up the blue and red branches that are

393
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,280
the substance of the tree of life.

394
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,400
Now the remarkable thing is, as we have reconstructed the properties of these deep branches from

395
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,640
the way their ancestors are left on the tips here, we find that the bacteria that live

396
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,600
without oxygen are the good models for the root here.

397
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,200
And also many of them are heat loving.

398
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,600
So the bacteria that were discovered by the Alvin expedition are not some special branch

399
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,240
that's adapted to an extreme environment.

400
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,160
They are the foundation.

401
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,240
We are the special branch that occurred much later.

402
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,520
So of course, everything here I was talking about organisms, because for organisms you

403
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,720
can draw trees.

404
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,800
If we had talked instead about ecosystems, I could have done even better, because I

405
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,280
could have answered an enormous amount with only one question.

406
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Where do they get their energy?

407
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,440
Because if we draw the boundaries big enough, every ecosystem is self-provisioning.

408
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
We don't live off of organic molecules from space anymore if we ever did.

409
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,760
So everything that is needed in an ecosystem is made by somebody in the ecosystem.

410
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Here the major division is between the ones that live from electron donors without oxygen

411
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,880
and those that are powered ultimately by light on the surface.

412
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,400
But we learn something more, kind of like Tolstoy's happy families are all alike and

413
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,000
the unhappy ones are unhappy in their own way.

414
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The reductive ecosystems are actually all essentially alike.

415
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,480
They may not be the same at the level of organisms, but at the ecosystem level they're doing the

416
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,000
same thing.

417
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,920
Moreover, the process of building up biomass, the way these bacteria that oxidize iron and

418
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,840
leave rust as their waste product do, is essentially also present in here, but it's wrapped in

419
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,600
an energy suit where sunlight provides them what they're no longer getting from the earth's

420
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,720
battery.

421
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,520
So these are actually the fundamental and the deep.

422
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,160
So that leads us to a different view of the biosphere.

423
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,360
Metabolisms are not merely communities, they're entities in their own right.

424
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,040
The reason this matters for the origin of life is threefold.

425
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,560
First, the kinds of ecosystems, reductive or oxidative, are not primarily determined by

426
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,200
genetics or history, they're primarily determined by metabolism.

427
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,120
Second, the similarity of metabolisms is evident or the universality of metabolism can be seen

428
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,040
at the ecosystem level, not necessarily at the organism level.

429
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,840
So organisms cut up a puzzle in different ways, but the picture on the ecological puzzle

430
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,520
is always the same picture.

431
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,760
Here's the one that I need to argue to get you to accept.

432
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,080
It was not organisms that were the bridge from geochemistry into life, it was ecosystems.

433
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,880
The division of becoming special organisms came later.

434
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,920
So now I want to make the argument for plausibility for that.

435
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,920
To understand that argument though, we need to look more at metabolism because metabolism

436
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,320
is the special property.

437
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,040
And there are clues in the structure and the energetics of metabolism that are as remarkable

438
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,280
as anything I've showed you in the world of organisms.

439
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,720
Now usually if you look at metabolism, you of course instantly have a heart attack and

440
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,800
that's because we study metabolism from the level of human physiology and medicine.

441
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,320
It's kind of like taking a beautiful telescope and looking through the wrong end and saying,

442
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,040
it all seems so far away.

443
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,720
So this is what a typical metabolic map looks like in one of the major databases.

444
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,520
But even in this chaos, your eye is drawn to the order at the center of this circle.

445
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,120
What I want to show you is that this circle is in fact the knot that ties the whole thing

446
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
together.

447
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,720
It does in the entire biosphere all living things and apparently has throughout all of

448
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,840
history.

449
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,440
So this is what the core looks like a little bit closer.

450
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
It's called the citric acid cycle.

451
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,640
It's a cycle of 11 simple molecules.

452
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,120
The colored dots here are carbons.

453
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,800
I don't label them.

454
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,880
The smallest has only two carbons.

455
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
You go around to as many as six carbons.

456
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,400
That's citric acid.

457
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,880
We were all, well some of us were taught in high school biology that this cycle is important.

458
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,960
It's called the Krebs cycle.

459
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,480
We were told we needed to get energy from fats and oils so that we can live.

460
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,360
That's why it's important to us, but we're late and we're backward.

461
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,800
The reason the citric acid cycle is important to everything, and this is stunning, all molecules

462
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,440
that you use to make the entire biosphere originate in one of four or five compounds

463
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,200
in this cycle.

464
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,540
All the diversity that you see around you comes later, but the building is all done

465
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,800
from these.

466
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,440
Now I show them to us in the form of foods because we are not ecologically complete.

467
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,920
So we know most of them in terms of the foods we need to eat to live that some plant or

468
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,980
bacterium needs to make.

469
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,380
So this little two carbon compound, this is vinegar, and it's the starting point through

470
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,820
which all of the oils and fats are made.

471
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,580
The three carbon compound here makes all of the sugars, which are structural as well as

472
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,160
energy molecules.

473
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,740
This one here makes the special vitamins that bind metals, and that's why they have bright

474
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,620
colors, so chlorophyll and heme.

475
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,340
There are four different ones that make amino acids that are part of proteins, and then

476
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,380
from some of the amino acids we also make the nucleic acids, RNA and DNA.

477
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,220
So that's how the major classes of molecules come off of this small simple core.

478
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,260
So the first apparent problem with obtaining an origin of life, the problem of complexity,

479
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:22,740
now doesn't seem so bad, but that's not the only problem we have to address.

480
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,020
There's a classic view of life as a struggle for existence.

481
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,340
The term was coined by the Victorian Reverend Thomas Malthus, who was worried about population

482
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,620
and famines and wars.

483
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,300
And this was a term that was adopted also by Darwin and was fundamental to why natural

484
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,460
selection can work.

485
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,900
You overproduce and then you cull.

486
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,460
The same language permeates the sciences.

487
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,260
We talk about capturing resources or harnessing sunlight energy.

488
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,800
So the intuition is that things fall apart and that you're in the Sisyphean task of building

489
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,220
up against the forces of decay.

490
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,180
And in the oxygenic world, that's right.

491
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,660
If I take organic carbon, I can put it in a furnace and it'll burn and it'll go back

492
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,780
to carbon dioxide, which is where it started from.

493
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,260
But in the world of vents, the rules are different.

494
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:18,580
My colleague and friend Everett Shock has probably put this best, that instead of no

495
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,900
such thing as a free lunch or a struggle for existence, the vent world is a free lunch

496
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,020
you're paid to eat.

497
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,220
I'll show you how.

498
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,980
What I've done here is taken the citric acid cycle compounds.

499
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,660
They're the 11 different dots.

500
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,860
For a couple of them, I've drawn the molecules just so you can see where they go.

501
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:41,060
And on this axis, I've showed how many H2, how many electrons we add per carbon to build

502
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,220
the molecule.

503
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,300
So the sugars are two H2s per carbon.

504
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,980
The oils are three.

505
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,540
And then on this axis, I've shown the energy that's used to make the molecule starting

506
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,820
from hydrogen and CO2 because hydrogen is what the vent world provides.

507
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,100
And actually what you see is this is a downhill run all the way to methane here at CH4, that's

508
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,060
our greenhouse gas.

509
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:11,660
So in the vent world, you are not building up complexity as a struggle against the release

510
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,020
of energy.

511
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:19,020
You're building up complexity because that's the path of least resistance to release energy.

512
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,580
Now the reason that matters to the citric acid cycle I showed you before is that that's

513
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,360
what drags the cycle around.

514
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,580
You can think of it as an old fashioned water wheel, whereas the water flows over, it pulls

515
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,460
the cycle around.

516
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,760
This is the same picture.

517
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm not showing you the other clutter, the hydrogens and oxygens, but I show you the

518
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,760
same molecules.

519
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,640
And the redder a carbon atom is colored, the more oxygens it has bound to it, the bluer

520
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,880
it's colored, the more hydrogens it has bound.

521
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,160
So you're sliding down the hill as more of your atoms become blue and fewer of them red.

522
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,840
This is the citric acid cycle in the same picture where I'm showing you each of the

523
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,760
11 molecules with only the carbons colored.

524
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,220
And what you can see, the cycle goes in this counterclockwise direction in the vent world.

525
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,800
We run it backward the wrong way where it makes no sense.

526
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,080
But in the vent world, red carbon, that's carbon dioxide, comes in and as it goes around

527
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,120
it gets moved toward the interior of the molecule and electrons get added.

528
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:25,840
So that process of adding electrons and using the available free energy, drags the cycle

529
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,960
around in the directions that the organisms use, and then that becomes the starting material

530
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,560
out of which they build the rest of biomass.

531
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,320
I'll come back and show you this a little bit later in a slightly different form.

532
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,000
So for now, the way the earth provides a battery and the way metabolism use it shows

533
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,600
the essential continuity between geochemistry and biochemistry.

534
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:57,400
That by itself would not be enough to judge whether the presence of life on earth is surprising

535
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,640
or inevitable.

536
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,620
To answer that question, we need to do something more.

537
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,520
And that's what requires that we reconsider what we think the living state is and what

538
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,200
the right kind of formal model for it is.

539
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,400
I want to argue that the way to understand, the way that makes sense of the fact that

540
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,840
life emerged on a lifeless earth and that it has persisted for almost four billion years

541
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,280
since is the concept of breakdown or failure.

542
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,360
So remember that we're trying to understand a pattern of motion.

543
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,040
Breakdown creates patterns of motion at the same time as it destroys certain patterns

544
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
of structure.

545
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,400
So things don't only fall apart.

546
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,720
Sometimes the events become ordered even as the structures are broken.

547
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,640
And so we have the concept that the origin of life could be a kind of collapse.

548
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,080
And once you have a collapse, the idea that when pushed hard enough, anything will give,

549
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,480
that brings with it the notion of necessity.

550
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,400
Because in the world of breakdowns, the things that persist are only the things that were

551
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,200
the favored state or the necessary state to begin with.

552
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,880
Now this is not an exotic idea.

553
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,200
It turns out that it's around us all the time.

554
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,280
The main thing you need in order to understand it is the idea of an energy flow channel.

555
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,520
There are lots of energy flow channels in the natural world.

556
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Lightning is one.

557
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,720
We create a plasma that's very, very, very different from the surrounding dry air, but

558
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,760
it allows electricity to flow.

559
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,520
We create all this organization of wall storms in a cyclone because that transports heat

560
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,320
from the warm oceans to the upper atmosphere.

561
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,040
And this is not the disordered pattern of just thunderstorms or uniformly mixed air.

562
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,160
So these things are well understood in the physical sciences already.

563
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,640
The thing that's important to create a channel and the reason not all things form channels

564
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
is that there needs to be feedback.

565
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
Because in all of these systems, the initial stress is diffuse.

566
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,640
The clouds have a charge spread out over a great distance.

567
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,280
Or the oceans are warm over an enormous volume.

568
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,200
But the ice storms concentrate only in one area because that moves things more.

569
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,920
So I'll illustrate for you dynamically with the simplest of all channels, which is just

570
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,120
the propagation of a fracture.

571
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,040
If you could see a fracture propagating at the atomic scale, you would see that it's

572
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,340
a self-similar repeating sequence of events as bond after bond breaks.

573
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,360
The reason this is striking is that in the original crystal, there's plenty of energy

574
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,600
in the crystal as a whole to break the bonds.

575
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,480
But the energy is too diffuse.

576
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,360
And so by itself, it can't concentrate to rupture a bond.

577
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,880
The thing that causes the fracture to propagate in an orderly way instead of happening at

578
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,840
random everywhere is that the stress field in the surround, as it deforms, pulls the

579
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,720
stress from the bulk back down to atomic diameters and concentrates it.

580
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,320
This is what hydrothermal vents are doing for the Earth battery, because the battery

581
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,640
is accumulating over the entire atmosphere and interior.

582
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,120
But it's being focused at the regions where rock contacts water and the regions where

583
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,600
the altered water remixes with seawater.

584
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,200
Now I want to show you that this is actually what the citric acid cycle does within chemistry.

585
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,600
It performs a second kind of concentration.

586
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,160
So as the molecule goes around, it pulls in carbon, and then here it splits.

587
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,320
And both parts go back into the cycle.

588
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,800
So where you had one, you now have two.

589
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,520
That's the mathematics of compound interest.

590
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,320
And so you can exponentially grow and you concentrate material within the cycle.

591
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Also like compound interest on an endowment, you can pull molecules off of this to make

592
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,640
your major classes of biological matter, but the material in the cycle is still available

593
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,600
to serve as a kind of flypaper that continues to pull carbon in over and over again.

594
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,440
So this is the second concentration.

595
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,160
Now the thing, this leads to an important way of thinking about the nature of life.

596
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,320
You could imagine that the optimization of this cycle was something carried out by evolution

597
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,360
later, but I think there's actually a better way to view it.

598
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,400
This cycle is self-amplifying.

599
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,880
It works from the environmental sources of carbon.

600
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,280
It works from the Earth's sources of electrons and everything in the biosphere is made from

601
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,040
it.

602
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,800
The biosphere is what you can make if these are the compounds you have.

603
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:45,600
And so this is why it becomes the core that organizes the whole rest of metabolism.

604
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
So does this give us a complete theory of origins?

605
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Not nearly.

606
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,600
There's a lot of work to be done.

607
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:58,080
There are many problems to be solved and maybe many generations, maybe centuries of work

608
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,360
before we have a satisfactory theory the way we have a theory of matter, but it fundamentally

609
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,840
changes the way we ask questions.

610
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,520
When Darwin was trying to understand the origin of the world, even though he was a consummate

611
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,280
ecologist, he emphasized organisms because that was where he could say something concrete

612
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,000
about the action of selection.

613
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,200
His problem was to understand the patterns of relation, the fact that some things are

614
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,560
more similar to each other than they are to others.

615
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,880
And that was what led him to the importance of the tree of descent, the idea that the

616
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,120
degree of similarity could be understood in terms of how long ago you had a common ancestor.

617
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,960
But organisms, as we said, are very complicated.

618
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,360
And the tree of descent doesn't seem to do a very good job of explaining how you ever

619
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,160
arrive at that level of complexity.

620
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,280
This is the point that Jerry raised in the introduction, that what organisms are is

621
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,200
both part of the living biosphere, but they're also individual, and those are two different

622
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,960
things.

623
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,400
Today we would separate the problems, and I would say we ask the same question the

624
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,800
following way.

625
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,160
We recognize that being an organism or being a virus or being a gene or being a cell in

626
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,520
an organism is just one of many kinds of individuality.

627
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,240
And these forms of individuality almost condense like dew from a kind of a background of chemical

628
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,120
regularity, and that regularity is being carried by the ecosystem.

629
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,480
But like dew, which doesn't condense everywhere, the forms of individuality condense where

630
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,240
they have paths of least resistance laid down that make it easy.

631
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,160
And so the important point about all of the concentrating mechanisms in organic chemistry,

632
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:45,920
the cycles in metabolism, the Earth's battery, these define the paths of least resistance.

633
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,440
So we can come finally back to the question of chance and necessity.

634
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,360
There are two sort of classic pronouncements each made by a major and truly great scientist

635
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,640
that reflect exactly opposite points of view.

636
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,160
Jacques Monod worked on bacterial regulation and was one of the discoverers of how this

637
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,560
works.

638
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,120
His view from all of the complexity of genetics and genomic regulation was that life could

639
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,080
be understood in terms of scientific principles, but there was no hope of predicting.

640
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,640
He envisioned the trajectory of the biosphere through history as a kind of a random walk

641
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,640
where even the major steps could not have been foreseen.

642
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,320
Christian Dedeuve took exactly the opposite point of view in a way that's very subtle

643
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,240
and I think it's missed by many people.

644
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,280
Dedeuve recognized, of course, that the assembly of a modern cell would only be possible with

645
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,760
selection because there are so many choices, they have to be selected at each range.

646
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,800
But he went on to say something more delicate.

647
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:56,560
He said even the problem of producing the choices that selection can act on is so complicated,

648
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,760
it's very difficult to understand how that could happen in a process where everything

649
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
is equally probable.

650
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,000
And this was what led him to propose that the success of the evolutionary game, as he

651
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,840
puts it, was written into the fabric of the universe.

652
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,840
What I've wanted to show you in the earlier parts of this talk is where in chemistry and

653
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,520
in the properties of our planet those choices were laid down.

654
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
So I have many people that I need to thank for this.

655
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,240
I absolutely want to thank Jerry not only for the privilege of giving you this talk,

656
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,280
but for supporting my work and the work of my collaborators for more than a decade.

657
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,000
I want to thank a friend, William Melton, who supported us through the last two years

658
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,840
in which this book was brought to completion.

659
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,360
And Jerry also supported me during that time.

660
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,680
Of course the National Science Foundation for bringing the community together and the

661
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,760
three places.

662
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Yeah, most importantly, Senefa Institute, that we're home for so many years.

663
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Yes, please.

664
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:27,760
No, the oxygen is being left behind.

665
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,120
I should stand where I'm expected.

666
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
The oxygen is being left behind.

667
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,760
So what you're doing is you're losing oceans, but you're only losing the hydrogen part of

668
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,760
the oceans.

669
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
Good?

670
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Yes, but are we also gaining anything from the solar wind?

671
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,120
Some, but probably not a lot.

672
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,120
We're not gaining water.

673
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
We might...

674
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,760
I don't know, it's a great question.

675
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,480
I don't know what the rate of gain of hydrogen is from the solar wind, quantitatively.

676
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,200
I know it's less than the rate of loss, but I don't know by an order of magnitude how

677
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
much less.

678
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Thank you.

679
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
Good.

680
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,200
In the back, yes, please.

681
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:24,200
So you're likely familiar with the debates on whether viruses are considered alive or

682
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
not.

683
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,280
I imagine, at least I've heard of cases where a virus can be as simple as just a replicating

684
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,960
molecule like RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein code, not doing anything like metabolism.

685
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,720
So do you think that means it is not alive?

686
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Great.

687
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,160
Yeah, lovely question.

688
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,720
I'm going to answer that by saying that the whole question turns out to use a form of

689
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,440
English that's not meaningful in the following sense.

690
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,960
So here's a little bit of logical semantics.

691
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,800
Work with me and tell me if this works for you.

692
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:11,760
If I use the term living thing, a thing is a noun, living is a predicate, right?

693
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,040
What that means is I imagine that I can take the whole world of things which are fundamental

694
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,040
and I can divide them into two sets, the living ones and the non-living ones.

695
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:28,200
But if things are not fundamental and if life is not a property inherent in things, then

696
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,360
the whole notion living thing is a set of words.

697
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,680
They satisfy the rules of syntax, but it's not clear they actually mean anything.

698
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,320
So what happens if the property of being alive is defined by participating in the order of

699
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,400
the biosphere, all the things that build it up, all those that break it down, and what

700
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,800
we're seeing in cells and viruses is a form of individuality.

701
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:58,360
Now I say is a virus one of the forms of individuality in its life cycle when it's just RNA and

702
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
a code?

703
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Absolutely.

704
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,120
And we can talk scientifically about what's special about that form, what makes it different

705
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,960
from a cell, but I don't ever ask the question is the virus alive or not because the virus

706
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,920
is part of the biosphere and it partakes of the character of the living state from the

707
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,840
biosphere as a whole.

708
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,960
So that's a little bit heavy as a way to answer a very good question, but I think it's the

709
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:32,840
answer that will stand the test of time.

710
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,840
I'll come right back to you.

711
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Yes.

712
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,560
I've read there are some, you know, the big bang at the beginning of that kind of life

713
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,200
that what preceded it was a consciousness or the idea for the universe to grow.

714
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,720
So could you apply that to what you're talking about here that there was a consciousness that

715
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:00,120
helps to move this or create the origins of life and create, you know, a place for that

716
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,000
life to grow?

717
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,320
That's not a language I have the ability to use in any comfortable way.

718
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,680
In the, no, in a very particular sense, right?

719
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:20,600
I could say that once a snowflake is formed, like commonplace processes, we can talk about

720
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,280
aspects of the pattern that makes one snowflake different from another.

721
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,840
And in a similar sense, I can go through the emergence of life on a planet and then organisms

722
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:36,240
and then nervous systems and somewhere late, late, late, I have these incredibly complicated

723
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,560
patterns that we just barely understand.

724
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:45,720
And for me, it's natural to look for consciousness as a character of patterns at that late level.

725
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:51,720
But in the same sense as I would not ask whether something about the snowflake was before the

726
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,680
properties of water because it seems to be at the wrong end, I'm not able to use a language

727
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,160
that puts consciousness at the low level.

728
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,720
As a form of non-physical energy, we talk a lot about physical energies, but we don't

729
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,920
talk about non-physical energies and consciousness could be considered, if it's thought of that

730
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,280
way, then it predates everything, doesn't come after the snowflake, comes before the

731
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,280
snowflake.

732
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
No, you know.

733
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,520
Anyway, I just wonder if these kind of, the sciences don't all kind of talk with each

734
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
other.

735
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,840
And I think there's some ways to where they can, where there is interdisciplinary study

736
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,840
there.

737
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
I'm just questioning.

738
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,320
I think it's wonderful that you ask.

739
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,160
I think it's a right conversation to have.

740
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,040
I think it's very hard to talk and to listen both.

741
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,440
And I will admit that my view is pretty much a mechanics view of a great many things, and

742
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,160
perhaps that limits the set of things I can say.

743
00:52:51,160 --> 00:53:00,000
Well, I think you have largely answered the question I was going to ask.

744
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,440
And it is, indeed, the idea, I understand how you followed this path of metabolism of

745
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,320
energy into living forms as a necessity and how it comes to be.

746
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:21,000
And that hypothesis is new to me, but I'm missing the same thing, the difference between

747
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:29,280
the rock and organic and inorganic carbon and carbon, whether or not what we've always

748
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,920
called the life cycle or the carbon cycle, the things you learn in chemistry.

749
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,320
I was at the particular properties that tell us whether or not the energy is living or

750
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,200
non-living in that whole origin and metabolism.

751
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,560
Have you given any thought to that?

752
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,600
I think you've already answered it in the last thing you said, but what are your own

753
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
thoughts about that?

754
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,000
And do you have any idea of using the scientific method to try to discern that?

755
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Good.

756
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,800
So that has some words in it that I can't address because I know how to use them carefully.

757
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:12,920
The notion of energy is one that we have struggled tremendously to get clear for the last 250

758
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:20,840
years, and one of the great triumphs, I think, of a unification in science is that energy

759
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:27,720
is energy, and so it's precisely because the role of energy in the non-living world

760
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,880
and in the living world is the same role that we can understand how the living world

761
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,560
embeds in the non-living world.

762
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,400
And so that's not a place where I think it's correct to look for differences.

763
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:48,880
I think humans are great at when they haven't seen something, imagining something different

764
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,720
from the truth.

765
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,920
Paths of least resistance and failure modes are incredibly complicated, and we've only

766
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,440
figured out a few of them.

767
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,600
I think there's huge scientific mileage in learning how to do that in the dominates of

768
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,680
dynamics and of chemistry, where we're just babies.

769
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,720
We've only begun to form science in those domains.

770
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,680
Does every hydrothermal vent have life associated with it?

771
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,440
Are the chemistries the same across all those different vents?

772
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,800
So they've all been created de novo, but all been the same.

773
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,800
Superb question.

774
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,640
Yes, no, and no.

775
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,000
No.

776
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,200
If I could give you an hour-long talk on only this one subject in a university department,

777
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,720
the things I would tell you.

778
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:54,080
So first thing to realize, there is no place we have ever drilled, dived, or flown in the

779
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,840
earth that we have not found life.

780
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,360
Which is one of the reasons it's so hard to understand origin, because everything has

781
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,880
been colonized by somebody modern.

782
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,400
So not only does every vent have life in it, every mineshaft hole has life in it, everything

783
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,920
that gets blown up from the subsurface in a volcano winds up having life in it.

784
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,680
So there's life everywhere.

785
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:21,800
There is certainly life that is uniquely hosted by the energy at vents, but your next question

786
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,320
is wonderfully perceptive, because it is not all the same.

787
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:30,120
The vent chemistry is not all the same, and the life that they host tracks that vent chemistry

788
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,800
quite in detail.

789
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,680
So the vents that I showed you are the charismatic ones.

790
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,400
Let me give you two-line thing about geology.

791
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:46,280
I told you that the deep rock in the earth has mostly this iron 2 plus character to it.

792
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,600
When it comes up it gets oxidized.

793
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,800
That's the process of converting what's called mantle into crust.

794
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,960
Normally you don't see mantle on the surface, you only see crust on the surface, and the

795
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,600
magmas that make crust, when they interact with water, they create these black smokers

796
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,240
that are full of metals and they have a very acidic pH 2 or 3.

797
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,920
In rare cases, you can actually get some of the material that's supposed to be protected

798
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,600
down below exposed on the surface.

799
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,720
It can be stripped off by faulting.

800
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,480
The picture I showed you of the lithosphere is Oman.

801
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,080
It's a place where continent formation actually causes it to be shoved up on the surface of

802
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,680
dry land.

803
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:32,280
In those areas, it turns out you do not produce acidic vents, you produce alkaline vents, and

804
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,920
you produce enormous amounts of hydrogen.

805
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,880
If I showed you the undersea version of those, they do not have black smoke because without

806
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,760
acid they don't dissolve metals, they don't dissolve sulfide, instead they're white and

807
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,480
shimmery and they produce carbonate chimneys in today's oceans.

808
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,400
If you looked at those, you would not find tube worms, you would not find crabs or snails

809
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,440
or clams or shrimp.

810
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,680
You would find only bacteria and archaea, so it would be a very dull picture compared

811
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:04,160
to the one I showed you, but it's enormously important because it turns out I think the

812
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,160
reason, and there are so many things I didn't tell you about even the black smoker world,

813
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,320
in spite of the fact that they live on a tiny energy budget far from the sun, those tube

814
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:19,320
worms are actually the fastest grown organisms known, that's the fastest production of biomass

815
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,560
of any known system, and I think the reason for that is that we need metals to live and

816
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,480
that's what those vents are producing in profusion.

817
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,120
Without the metals, you go into a much sort of more miserly mode of life where only the

818
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,160
most conservative bacteria and archaea can make it, but thank you.

819
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Great, and we have a couple people here on the side too.

820
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:50,160
What do you think of the theory of panspermia as the cause of life and could you define

821
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360
it for the audience?

822
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:59,360
Yes, with pleasure, good, so panspermia was the idea that in the non-polemical form,

823
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,960
life may not have originated on earth, it may have originated somewhere else and been

824
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,240
transported to earth.

825
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,920
Now the polemical form, it's really hard to understand how life originated on earth and

826
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,000
we only had four and a half billion years to do it.

827
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,320
The universe is 13 billion years old, so that's more than a factor of two, maybe if we had

828
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,600
the whole universe we'd have more time.

829
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,520
Now that was the old fashioned version, sort of the 1970s version.

830
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,440
There are more modern and more sophisticated versions where people say that some of the

831
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,680
things about the electron battery that I showed you are actually stronger on Mars than they

832
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:46,520
are on earth and some of the properties of water may have been easier early on.

833
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,760
Those are very technical arguments and I don't know how to evaluate them.

834
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,960
I consider those to be the most plausible arguments that there could be important chemistry

835
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,120
relevant to the origin of life that could be on a planet other than our own where the

836
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,240
life evolved to some significant degree of complexity and was then transported here.

837
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:12,880
For my own preference, I regard those with suspicion because I think when we find something

838
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,960
difficult, we probably say, oh that must mean it's impossible and our understanding is too

839
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,960
primitive to draw a conclusion like that at this point.

840
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,340
We understand how hard it is to make life on earth precisely because we understand the

841
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:31,100
chemistry of life on earth so well and so is it sensible to go someplace where we understand

842
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,500
the chemistry less well where we have to rely on transport through space to deliver but

843
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,620
then here's the most important thing.

844
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:43,620
If you think my argument has any validity that we should look at life as a breakdown process

845
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:48,340
so that only the only things that persist are the things that were the native state anyway

846
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,180
and you just had to get to them.

847
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,020
If life on earth was not the native state to get into and it was a more native state

848
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,780
somewhere else then why would it have been a robust thing to build it there and transport

849
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,900
it here?

850
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,500
Why would it have survived here for four billion years without interruption if it was not a

851
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,940
thing that would natively form here?

852
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,020
Now that's not strong enough to be a science argument and I understand its weakness but

853
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:18,020
that direction is the drift of my not worrying a lot about penspermia.

854
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,020
Hi.

855
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:28,940
Do you agree to the theories of George Wald who said that life came from an electric

856
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:34,500
strike like lightning that hit the elements, the earth's primordial atmosphere and life

857
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,500
evolved from that.

858
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,900
There was experiments where amino acids evolved into proteins in life form.

859
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,940
Do you agree with those theories?

860
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:51,500
I would not repeat them in the way their original investigators believed them to be true.

861
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,340
Again to speak a little bit carefully.

862
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,420
Lightning strikes turn out to matter on earth because they do something very difficult.

863
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,700
They take N2 which is a very strong molecule and they break it up into the forms of nitrogen

864
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,660
that wind up being chemically interesting.

865
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:11,740
That may matter but I think it only matters at the scale of the whole planetary dynamic.

866
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:15,740
The chemistry of the atmosphere is extremely different from the chemistry of life.

867
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,740
You remember I said that chemistry in water is very restrictive and there are a lot of

868
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,140
things that you can't do with it.

869
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:27,300
The chemistry of carbon and of metals in the deep subsurface is incredibly similar to our

870
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,780
biochemistry.

871
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33,380
So much so that you can look at enzymes that use metals and they use them as if they had

872
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:38,260
just taken a mineral center and learned how to harness it for certain types of jobs.

873
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,580
Those things were not known when George Wald was writing these things and I think a lot

874
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,500
of the opinions you're talking about come more from Stanley Miller and the followers

875
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,900
of Stanley Miller after 1953.

876
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,900
His experiments were groundbreaking but there are two things, two ways you can interpret

877
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,900
them.

878
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,860
One you could suppose that those experiments were good models for the origin of life.

879
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,940
That I think doesn't hold up so well now though there are still many people who would disagree

880
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,420
with me.

881
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,900
But what you could say instead is if chemistry in the atmosphere that's so different from

882
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:16,420
biochemistry led to amino acids many of which are the same as those in biochemistry what

883
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:22,100
should we be learning about the paths of least resistance in organic chemistry that can cause

884
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:27,260
very different starting points to collapse into a few paths and then kind of like trees

885
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,820
growing along the waterways in the desert.

886
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,660
Does biochemistry use the chemicals it does because it's following those paths of least

887
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:41,140
resistance even if we learned about them in the wrong environment?

888
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,780
And there's somebody who really wants to ask another question and I don't want to cut

889
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,780
them off.

890
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,180
Okay, so you will be the last one.

891
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,180
You've had your hand up three or four times.

892
01:03:51,180 --> 01:04:00,260
No, I'm almost embarrassed to stand up considering the quality of all the questions here but as

893
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:05,180
a practical matter we are so familiar with the term climate change and what's happening

894
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,420
in climate change.

895
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:13,160
Is mankind doing anything relative to climate change that would affect your theories in

896
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:19,020
any way shape or form or is they two completely different subjects?

897
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:24,100
I'm so glad that you got a chance to ask because it would have been a shame not to hear.

898
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:29,740
I don't think that the things that people are doing affect the theories but I would

899
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:34,660
like this work to affect the things that people do.

900
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,660
So this was the point that Jerry opened with.

901
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:43,380
In biology too much we have put ecosystem sensibility kind of in the periphery and we

902
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:49,220
focused on organisms and when we interact with a natural world whether we do it industrially

903
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:54,900
or agronomically we try to engineer organisms and we try to influence systems with a few

904
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:00,780
components as if we were building a watch or a bridge and routinely it winds up putting

905
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:06,900
us in places where we don't want to be or where we shouldn't want to be.

906
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:17,020
If biology can anchor ecology more centrally and start to understand the regression of ecosystems

907
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:22,420
towards certain patterns that it's very hard to pull them away from maybe biology can help

908
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,460
us head off misunderstandings in the world of application and make us a little bit more

909
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:32,620
intelligent or in some cases a little bit more precautionary about what we do.

910
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:38,660
Biology as a science is sound but biology as a science is not always proactive enough

911
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,620
to anticipate the mistakes people are going to make.

912
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:47,180
A more ecological biology may prime us to be a little bit better at second guessing the

913
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,620
things that can go wrong and trying to be careful ahead of time.
