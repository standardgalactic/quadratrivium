00:00.000 --> 00:22.560
This is the Nordstrom store in San Francisco.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.800
It's one of 74 Nordstroms all around the country with annual sales of nearly $3.5 billion.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.640
Nordstroms maintains an inventory of items nearly double that of the typical specialty

00:32.640 --> 00:34.320
store or department store.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.280
That means a gigantic database to keep track of inventory and sales.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.880
So when they went looking around for a computing environment, it was serious business.

00:41.880 --> 00:47.000
They looked at OS2, they looked at Unix, but they settled on Windows NT for Microsoft.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Why?

00:48.000 --> 00:53.560
Well, we'll try to find out today as we try on Windows NT on this edition of the Computer

00:53.560 --> 00:54.360
Chronicles.

00:58.800 --> 01:14.240
Computer Chronicles is brought to you in part by Intel, microprocessor technology for

01:14.240 --> 01:19.000
the software of today and tomorrow, Intel, the computer inside.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.280
Additional funding is provided by the Software Publishers Association, providers of educational

01:24.280 --> 01:26.920
materials to help manage software.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.280
Don't copy that floppy.

01:29.280 --> 01:37.640
And by Hewlett Packard, personal computer division.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.920
Welcome to the Computer Chronicles.

01:38.920 --> 01:44.520
I'm Stuart Sheffa and with me today is Mike Nash, Windows NT product manager with Microsoft.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.960
Mike, I have Windows 3.1 running over here on my HP vector.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.760
You have Windows NT running over there on your machine.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.200
They look almost identical.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
What is the difference?

01:53.200 --> 01:56.040
Well, the idea was to make them look as much the same as was possible.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.720
They both use the same familiar program manager, and in fact, a lot of the tools like the file

01:59.720 --> 02:01.200
manager are exactly the same.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.600
In fact, if you could launch my file manager in 3.1, you launch yours in NT.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.100
They're basically the same.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.280
I've got a few extra things that aren't there on Windows 3.1.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.880
For instance, I can have long file names.

02:11.880 --> 02:16.600
A file like names like the Computer Chronicles can have a space in it, whatever special characters

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
I want to use.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.640
You'll also notice that Windows NT automatically generates a short file name so that older

02:21.640 --> 02:25.840
DOS applications can be 100% compatible on Windows NT.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.800
Windows NT is also designed to be a secure operating system, so we actually have full

02:28.800 --> 02:32.160
support to control the permissions to see who can look at a file.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.520
The Computer Chronicles plan can be viewed by anyone, but we want to make sure that all

02:35.520 --> 02:37.480
the power users have full access to this.

02:37.480 --> 02:44.400
We'll simply go in, choose power users from the list, add them, give them full control,

02:44.400 --> 02:47.800
and now they can access this file any way they want.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.000
While Windows NT runs all the standard Windows applications that you'd ever want, Windows

02:52.000 --> 02:54.640
NT is designed to run more than one application at the same time.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.240
You'll look the same on the surface, but you were running all these other operations

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
underneath.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.040
Right in the background, exactly.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.040
Windows NT is also designed to be a very manageable system, so if we actually launch

03:03.040 --> 03:06.720
the performance monitor, you'll see that I can actually look and control exactly how

03:06.720 --> 03:08.000
the system is being used.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.320
In this case, I'm monitoring CPU utilization in total and seeing how it's being shared

03:12.320 --> 03:14.760
between the applications and between the system.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.840
Okay, today we will look into Windows NT to see what else it can do, and we'll look at

03:18.840 --> 03:24.320
several new applications written specifically for NT to see how the NT environment improves

03:24.320 --> 03:25.720
on application performance.

03:25.720 --> 03:29.880
First, we're going to visit the Microsoft Labs up in Redmond, Washington to meet the

03:29.880 --> 03:33.320
NT development team.

03:33.320 --> 03:38.880
The Windows NT team at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters barely had time for a brief vacation

03:38.880 --> 03:41.800
before work started on product improvements.

03:41.800 --> 03:48.600
Before the next major version release, codenamed Cairo is ready, Microsoft will release NT upgrades.

03:48.600 --> 03:56.280
We're sitting down trying to figure out how to get an update out with sort of some small

03:56.280 --> 04:02.920
features, double space, and some better networking, enterprise networking support, and better

04:02.920 --> 04:11.720
performance, and then figure out how to get to the next ease of use features in a seamless

04:11.720 --> 04:16.080
short times period without disrupting current applications that are in progress.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.960
Team engineers rebuild and test the NT operating system on a daily basis.

04:20.960 --> 04:26.240
There's an interoperability test lab where they're building connections to OS2 and Novell

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
servers.

04:27.240 --> 04:32.440
Ongoing tests are run for software compatibility, but special emphasis is placed on hardware

04:32.440 --> 04:36.920
compatibility since NT runs on a variety of platforms.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.720
All the machines that passed the test were put on a hardware compatibility list, and

04:41.720 --> 04:48.920
we had over 1600 machines on a hardware compatibility list, which is, I believe, a record for any

04:48.920 --> 04:50.600
operating system.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.840
Program managers say Cairo will bring a new level of intuitive ability to NT.

04:55.840 --> 05:02.240
Cairo will make it easier for people to say, just give me the sales data for the month

05:02.240 --> 05:07.400
of December, and the system will take care of finding the data, but also enable people

05:07.400 --> 05:13.240
to build solutions where they can work with the data in exactly the way they want to.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.920
They don't have to worry about what application they're running in, they don't have to worry

05:16.920 --> 05:19.920
about the exact structure of the data.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.560
Things will just flow more smoothly in the way that people want it.

05:23.560 --> 05:39.120
For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonel Patterson.

05:39.120 --> 05:43.560
Two of the nice features of Windows NT are portability and scalability.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.640
Here to show us what that means are Ray Court of Microsoft and also back with us Mike Nash

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
of Microsoft.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.880
Ray, we're going to start with you and talk about portability, and what does that mean?

05:52.240 --> 05:57.000
Well, what we have here is the same consistent Windows user interface, but of course, it's

05:57.000 --> 06:00.560
Windows NT that's running here, and it's running on a different microprocessor chip.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.000
All right, so what do we have over here on this NetPower PC?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.120
Well, they say that scene is believe-in.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.840
If I use this little utility here, I can show you what hardware we have installed in this

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
machine.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.560
If I choose hardware, you can see that my CPU type is actually a MIPS microprocessor.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.760
So we're not running a 486 or a Pentium here.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.840
This is a MIPS R4000, and we're running NT.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.280
What's the advantage to me of being able to do this?

06:22.280 --> 06:26.120
The advantage of being able to do this is that you can integrate a new generation of

06:26.120 --> 06:31.520
32-bit applications with your most popular applications, for example, like Excel, 1,

06:31.520 --> 06:33.440
2, 3 for Windows, or WordPerfect.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.760
So you're running 16-bit Excel up here.

06:35.760 --> 06:41.000
I'm running 16-bit Excel, and in the background, I have a 32-bit application called PVWave,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.600
which is used to visualize data.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.160
So what I'm going to do is to hide this data here.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.120
So that's data coming out of Excel.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.440
This is data coming out of Excel, Excel to PVWave, 16-bit to 32-bit, and I'm going to

06:53.440 --> 06:56.760
plot that information so that we can see it in a different form.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.840
And as you can see, as the charts begin to roll out on the screen here, these are quite

06:59.840 --> 07:01.920
complex plots.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.240
So what you're able to do is use your familiar Excel, which you could have been running on

07:05.240 --> 07:10.800
in your 3.1 mode or whatever, with NT you can actually talk now to this 32-bit PVWave

07:10.800 --> 07:11.800
application.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.800
Absolutely.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.840
In essence, what you're doing here is actually using the best tools for the appropriate job.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.160
Okay, let's turn to the next platform here.

07:19.160 --> 07:23.360
You've got a digital machine, so I won't guess you show me again what CPU we're running here.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.640
I'll use our little utility again, and if I select the hardware option, it tells me

07:27.640 --> 07:31.680
what type of CPU I'm running, and here it says I'm running a DEC Alpha processor.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.320
So here NT is running under an Alpha chip, and show me what I can do with this.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.520
Okay, what I'm running here is Hyperion, which is a corporate-level financial management

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
application.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.960
What it allows me to do is to visualize my corporation very easily, very graphically.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.720
We're using the Windows interface here.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.280
I can do things like drag and drop sections of my company.

07:52.280 --> 07:58.120
So if I say I want to move production from Portugal and move it to the American region,

07:58.120 --> 08:01.520
and then I can go and have a look late and see if I consolidate that information, what

08:01.520 --> 08:03.200
that means on my numbers.

08:03.200 --> 08:09.360
So if we end out here, I'll save the change to my organization, bit of mouse problems

08:09.360 --> 08:11.960
there, and we choose consolidation.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.440
I select the total corporation here.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.880
I choose options, consolidate all, and we look down in the bottom here, and this is

08:17.880 --> 08:20.720
consolidating 12 megabytes of data, and it's finished.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.280
So you've really recalculated this gigantic spreadsheet in a couple of seconds.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.280
In a couple of seconds.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.320
On Windows 3.1, that would normally take several minutes.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.800
Okay, thank you very much Ray.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.680
Let's move along from portability to scalability, and talk to Mike again.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.680
And Mike, what are you going to show us about scalability then?

08:36.960 --> 08:40.440
Well, scalability has a lot to do with the way we can harness new hardware.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.840
What I have running here is the server version of Windows NT, a product called Microsoft

08:43.840 --> 08:45.640
Windows NT Advanced Server.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.520
And Windows NT Advanced Server is much more than just a file and print server.

08:48.520 --> 08:52.200
It's actually designed to be an application server, so that we can run server applications

08:52.200 --> 08:55.000
and have multiple users share information.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.040
What we're doing here is running SQL Server on a four CPU compact ProLiant 4000.

08:59.040 --> 09:03.320
And actually, as you can see from these transaction processing numbers, we're able to deliver

09:03.320 --> 09:05.880
about 290 transactions per second.

09:05.880 --> 09:10.120
Just for reference, a mini-computer does about mid to high 200s, and really the high end

09:10.120 --> 09:11.800
of the mini-computer class.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.040
So what you're saying is using a four processor machine like this and NT at a relatively low

09:16.040 --> 09:18.040
cost, we can really get mini-computer performance.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.040
Exactly.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.240
And it has a lot to do with Windows NT's ability to share the load, if you will, across the

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
four CPUs.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.040
In fact, let me take a look at how we do that.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.640
In the performance monitor, I can actually monitor CPU utilization.

09:28.640 --> 09:33.920
So what I want to do is actually look at how we're sharing the load across these four CPUs

09:33.920 --> 09:35.840
in the system.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.360
Take a look here at this histogram, and what you can see is we're pretty evenly spreading

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
the load across the four.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.200
So each color is representing one of the Pentium chips inside the compact.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.200
Exactly.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.360
Now, SQL Server is designed to be very easy to use as well.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.720
We want to make it possible for people that maybe don't know so much about application

09:49.720 --> 09:53.280
servers to use solutions based on Windows NT and SQL Server.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.800
Actually, this is the SQL Server Manager, and I can actually start and stop SQL Server

09:57.800 --> 10:00.160
using very easy and intuitive stoplight.

10:00.160 --> 10:05.000
And as you'll see, as I double-click and stop the server, it automatically will bring transaction

10:05.000 --> 10:07.560
processing and the CPU utilization right to zero.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
All right.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.120
So again, the point in scalability is NT can kind of work with the hardware it has.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.880
You crank it up here with four Pentiums.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.360
It'll crank up to take advantage of that.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.800
It could work with one chip PC, et cetera.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.800
Exactly.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
All right.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
Now, if you're using advanced server, I take it the point is network management.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.920
Show me some of the other network management tools in NT Advanced Server.

10:24.920 --> 10:25.920
Very good points to it.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.720
Really, what we're trying to do here is to do the best of what file servers and traditional

10:29.720 --> 10:33.200
PC class servers did, and really combine that with the best of what many computers and main

10:33.240 --> 10:34.720
frames did in terms of manageability.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.560
And a big part of managing the system is managing the users that need to access it.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.280
Go in here and take a look at your account here.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.680
And we've actually created one that looks at the groups that you're a member of and

10:43.680 --> 10:47.240
show that you're a member of the Computer Chronicles and Domain Users Group, but we want to make

10:47.240 --> 10:48.760
you an administrator here as well.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.400
So by simply dragging and dropping the administrator group onto your profile, I can automatically

10:53.400 --> 10:56.800
give you all the rights and privileges that an administrator on the system would get.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.760
You can also look to control other parameters of your account, like the hours that you're

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
allowed to log onto the system.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.720
And in fact, for some reason, we've disabled your ability to log on on Tuesday evenings.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.560
We want to re-enable that, just touch the allow box, and you automatically get the ability

11:09.560 --> 11:12.840
to log on at all times.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.000
What other network management features can you show me?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.400
Another important aspect of network management is the ability to manage groups of servers

11:18.400 --> 11:20.760
and workstations together from a single point of management.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.200
So we have a product here, a process here called the Server Manager, which allows us

11:24.200 --> 11:27.160
to drill down and look at any server on the system.

11:27.160 --> 11:31.000
I'll look again at this four CPU per line that we've been using today, and look and

11:31.000 --> 11:32.440
see what users are connected to it.

11:32.440 --> 11:37.280
You can see that just the administrator from the other machine is logged on here.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.440
We can look and see the share points, the files that are running on this machine, and

11:41.440 --> 11:45.200
look and see all the shares that are allowed from this machine.

11:45.200 --> 11:51.720
I can also look to see what services are running here, and actually look to see all the applications

11:51.720 --> 11:55.880
and server-based processes that are running on this machine.

11:56.880 --> 12:01.680
The next thing that's really interesting about Windows NT is something called the Event

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Viewer.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.520
The Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server ships with this product that allows you to look

12:07.520 --> 12:11.400
and see all the things that have occurred on the system for as far back as you want

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
to keep the logs.

12:12.400 --> 12:18.560
We can look and see a detailed breakdown of every instance of anything that's happened

12:18.560 --> 12:20.560
on this machine since it was first booted.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.760
All right, Mike.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.760
Thank you very much.

12:22.760 --> 12:27.480
All right, as we've seen, Windows NT is not so much an upgrade for Windows 3.1 as it is

12:27.480 --> 12:31.920
a competitor for other high-end computing platforms like Unix and OS2.

12:31.920 --> 12:35.680
We talked to some users who are working on those platforms to see what they think about

12:35.680 --> 12:37.320
Windows NT.

12:37.320 --> 12:42.560
A Unix workstation gives commercial artist Lee Seiler the power he needs for the multimedia

12:42.560 --> 12:45.880
design work he does here at his Berkeley studio.

12:45.880 --> 12:51.280
Seiler developed his own computer graphics software for the Atari ST, then ported it

12:51.320 --> 12:53.240
to the Unix platform.

12:53.240 --> 12:58.040
Seiler says his own user-friendly interface running on a silicon graphics indigo gives

12:58.040 --> 13:03.480
him more power and speed than he's seen so far on any Windows NT-based system.

13:03.480 --> 13:08.680
The problem right now probably isn't NT in and of itself, but the fact is running on

13:08.680 --> 13:16.880
what I would say is a low horsepower hardware platform until the PCs or whatever system

13:16.880 --> 13:24.960
they're going to run this on gets up to the horsepower of the risk systems that you find

13:24.960 --> 13:29.640
in silicon graphics and in the sun systems.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.400
They just simply don't have the power.

13:31.400 --> 13:36.040
And now with Unix vendors aiming at the desktop multimedia market, it's possible to have

13:36.040 --> 13:38.760
high power in an affordable price range.

13:38.760 --> 13:43.480
Now with technology being what it is and being able to go out and for say something in the

13:43.480 --> 13:51.760
neighborhood of like $5,000 indie, you can now buy a machine that is running at 135 million

13:51.760 --> 13:53.760
operations a second.

13:53.760 --> 14:00.840
Unix, which required a big powerful system just to exist, now has an ideal environment.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.600
At Fireman's Fund Insurance Headquarters in San Rafael, the system's developers prefer

14:05.600 --> 14:08.840
IBM's OS2 operating system.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.880
They've been using OS2 corporate-wide since 1989.

14:12.880 --> 14:18.000
And our decision to use OS2 and more, our decision to go to client server was based

14:18.000 --> 14:21.640
on our ability to write mission-critical applications.

14:21.640 --> 14:28.200
So we have written the applications that support the underwriting in our commercial, in our

14:28.200 --> 14:31.600
personal, and also in our specialty profit centers.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.800
We've also written claim-adjusting applications.

14:34.800 --> 14:39.840
And within the system's organization, we now have all of our mainframe development enhancement

14:39.840 --> 14:45.120
actually being performed on a client-server basis using OS2.

14:45.120 --> 14:50.920
Fireman's Fund agents are able to issue policies, process forms and letters, and automate underwriting

14:50.920 --> 14:52.960
functions from their desktop.

14:52.960 --> 14:58.080
The productivity of all divisions, including claims adjustment, has increased dramatically.

14:58.080 --> 15:03.720
A claims adjuster will have somewhere from 60 to 70 active claim files that they'll be

15:03.720 --> 15:04.960
dealing with.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.640
And we've taken the client-server technology, OS2, and written the front-end application

15:09.640 --> 15:15.080
to our existing mainframe claims processing system to automate a lot of the workflow and

15:15.080 --> 15:17.560
procedures that a claim adjuster has to deal with.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.880
Since application programming is done on the desktop, end users are able to get involved

15:21.880 --> 15:24.680
early on in the development process.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.480
Fireman's Fund has so completely absorbed OS2 into its corporate functions, they're

15:29.480 --> 15:32.280
not looking to make a move to Windows NT.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.600
We're not seriously looking at Windows NT right now.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.600
We made the decision to go with OS2 and suffered through some of the growing pains, but now

15:40.600 --> 15:45.320
have no complaint or no real reason to cause us to look otherwise.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.560
We're frankly very happy with what OS2 provides to us.

15:48.560 --> 16:03.840
For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonelle Patterson.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.320
If you want the 32-bit speed of Windows NT, it's probably because you're interested in

16:08.320 --> 16:12.240
computation-intensive applications like graphics or CAD.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.000
So that's what we'll show you next.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.720
Helped out by Michael Gibbons of AltSys and also joining us Glenn Burnett of Bentley Systems

16:18.720 --> 16:19.720
and InterGraph.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
Michael, let's begin with you.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.080
You're with AltSys, and you guys have a technology called Virtuoso, which you've then applied

16:25.080 --> 16:30.040
to the new Aldous Freehand 4.0 written specifically for NT, which is the first graphics design

16:30.040 --> 16:31.560
application for NT.

16:31.560 --> 16:35.720
Show us some of the power of running this kind of design program under NT.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.760
First of all, Stuart, it's the inspector, which gives it a very nice interface.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.280
What we'll do is we're going to bring in some text.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.440
We have the text already in, and we're going to bring in an image.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.920
Because you're laying out an ad or something right now.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.920
Correct.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.880
You've already got some text, and you've got a headline in there.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.880
Correct.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.560
So what we'll do is we'll place a document that we've already created with Freehand.

16:57.560 --> 17:03.160
If you notice, simply by double clicking, cursor turns into a corner icon.

17:03.160 --> 17:08.560
I'm going to place and scale this accordingly.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.560
And this is a very complex document, and just in a matter of seconds, boom.

17:12.560 --> 17:18.400
Okay, now what we'll do is we're going to open up an inspector panel again, and we're

17:18.400 --> 17:27.800
going to link the text, as you'll see here, to another container, and we'll go in and

17:27.800 --> 17:29.240
we'll fit the copy.

17:29.240 --> 17:37.320
So you're going to try to wrap that copy around the graphic you pulled in?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.320
Correct.

17:38.320 --> 17:45.760
And taking into account all the letter spacing, the kerning, it's quite complex, and it doesn't

17:45.760 --> 17:48.480
matter seconds due to NT's speed.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.960
Sure, and there it is.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.280
And now we also have one other feature here, it's a layers feature, where we have a table

17:55.280 --> 18:00.880
that we've pre-set in another program, and by clicking, we've got that.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.280
So in the lower right, you just added a new layer to this graphic, okay?

18:04.280 --> 18:05.280
It's correct.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.520
All right, now you've got something called multiple page technology inside here, which

18:08.520 --> 18:10.120
also is a pretty powerful tool.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.120
Show us what that is.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120
That's the first, I guess you're the first graphics program to have this.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
On any platform.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
Yes, that's correct.

18:15.640 --> 18:20.480
Multiple page is going to allow you to take, for this particular company right here, we've

18:20.480 --> 18:25.000
done a page layout, now they need letterhead, business cards and envelopes.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.600
So by simply clicking on, for instance, number two, we're going to go in, we have letterhead

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
set up.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.680
The options button here will allow you to add pages, duplicate or remove.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.680
You can also go in and see that we have a business card set here.

18:38.680 --> 18:45.280
We could duplicate this a number of times.

18:45.280 --> 18:50.320
And again, what we'll do is we'll select all and you can see the complete layout that

18:50.320 --> 18:51.320
we have here.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.400
That's a little small, but you do get the picture.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
So you can do the whole bit.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.320
Take your graphic design, put it in the ad, put it in your letterhead, put it in your

18:57.320 --> 19:00.360
business card and so on, all using the same environment.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.360
That's correct.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.360
All right, thank you very much, Michael.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.360
Thank you.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.040
We're going to move over here to Glendown, take a look at another application under

19:05.040 --> 19:06.040
NT.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.280
I guess the question for you as I had for Michael, what's the benefit?

19:09.280 --> 19:13.520
You wrote Microstation just for NT and what's the extra power you get out of that?

19:13.520 --> 19:17.000
Well the extra power comes both on the front end and in the speed and on the back end in

19:17.000 --> 19:21.240
the ability to make this software product portable to other platforms as they become

19:21.240 --> 19:22.240
available.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.320
So the advantage we saw portability before, you write for NT, you're automatically on

19:25.320 --> 19:26.320
all these platforms.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, with a quick compile, you bet.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.680
All right, so show us a little bit about Microstation and what some of the power it is.

19:31.680 --> 19:36.920
Microstation is a very powerful CAD program that uses the icon capabilities of Windows

19:36.920 --> 19:43.120
NT as well as the ability to drag off our icons so that I can arrange my desktop to

19:43.120 --> 19:49.040
an efficient method where it makes it easy for me to use or users to use.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.760
I've got a design here that we call dimension-driven design.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.720
Quickly, I want to show you how easy it is to turn off.

19:55.720 --> 20:00.640
In this view, you see all the dotted lines are our dimension, our construction elements

20:00.640 --> 20:02.080
that define the constraints.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.680
I just quickly turn those off globally regardless of their level.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.720
I'm going to grab all the elements on this view here and change their color, graphically.

20:11.720 --> 20:17.240
I just simply go pick a color on the color palette and bingo, there's our colors.

20:17.240 --> 20:23.960
Being dimension-driven, I can modify the dimension itself and as you see, I modify the dimension.

20:23.960 --> 20:29.720
The entire design changes and you'll notice it changes in all the views as well, exactly.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.480
That gives you the power and especially in 3D, this gives you the power to design in

20:34.480 --> 20:35.480
multiple views.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.320
I'm going to open a different design file.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.880
I just simply go up and Microstation saves previous design files that I've been in, grab

20:42.880 --> 20:51.920
another one, grab our tags palette, show you that we can modify existing data that's non-graphical

20:51.920 --> 20:53.680
to graphical data.

20:53.680 --> 21:00.160
For example, this is a piece of property, the owner, the lot number and the value.

21:00.160 --> 21:07.000
I'm going to pick on the value here and I'm going to change it from 225 to say $250,000.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.280
As soon as I do that, you'll notice over here, it will change automatically.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.600
You can change text without affecting the graphics and getting into the graphics part

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
of it.

21:15.600 --> 21:21.680
Right, but I'm also assigning data to these graphics for GIS, geographical information

21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
systems purposes.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.840
What else can you do with Microstation?

21:24.840 --> 21:29.440
I'm going to go ahead and go into one additional design file and show you the rendering power

21:29.440 --> 21:31.200
of Microstation.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.400
You'll see the first thing that comes up is a background bitmap.

21:34.400 --> 21:39.760
We can apply bitmaps to objects and this may be difficult to see at the moment, but we've

21:39.760 --> 21:42.560
got a architectural design here.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.760
I'm going to show you by opening up a smaller view, I'm going to render that for you and

21:46.760 --> 21:49.320
show you our capabilities.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.480
You can see we have a number of different renderings.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.520
That's the wire mesh version, you're going to render that drawing now.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.080
I'm going to render it Fong.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.600
What you'll see is it's going to map some lights.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.360
Right now it's updating each of the individual polygons that we see in the background here

22:06.360 --> 22:11.760
and you'll see the water in the pool actually has a texture map to it so you get a feel

22:11.760 --> 22:13.440
that it's actually rippling water.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.480
We see shadows that are being cast by something that we haven't even put in there yet.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
Correct.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.760
The calculation is done so it's displaying the calculation that shadows are available

22:22.760 --> 22:28.480
from these light, skylights that are up here.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.320
You also see the texture on the walls.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.320
We have texture mapping.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.040
So it's sort of stuck to the walls we can see there.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
Correct.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.440
And the plants that you see in the background are bitmaps with transparency that are applied

22:41.440 --> 22:47.080
to polygons that sit in the background to give your user or your client the ability to

22:47.080 --> 22:52.400
see what their design is going to be like even before it's done.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.840
You'll also see as this window is updated back here that we have translucency.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.960
We're putting a kind of fogged glass in there.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.120
And the thing's fully rendered.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
Correct.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
I took about a minute or something.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
Approximately a minute.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.120
Yeah.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Normally you would wait a long time to see that render.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
Yes.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.120
Exactly.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.280
We also have the ability to do animations.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.400
I've got an animation loaded here.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.040
This is of a living room and again I'm just going to play that animation.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.560
And you see that we have the fan turning.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
You can do walkthroughs.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.560
And the shatters and the fans casting.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.560
Right.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
Exactly.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.560
Exactly.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.520
So Microstation is a very powerful CAD environment for multiple disciplines of designing.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.160
And taking advantage of the NT platform.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
Absolutely.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.160
All right.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.160
Thank you very much.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.160
That is our look at Windows NT.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.000
Stay tuned now for this week's Computer News on Random Access.

23:47.040 --> 23:54.480
In the Random Access file this week lots of new products and technology announcements

23:54.480 --> 23:55.480
at Fall Comdex.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.680
We'll have a full report on this year's Comdex in an upcoming show.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.960
Apple Computer grabbed Comdex headlines with the announcement of its combination Macintosh

24:03.960 --> 24:05.360
Windows machine.

24:05.360 --> 24:11.200
The Quadra 610 DOS compatible codenamed Houdini will let users switch between System 7, DOS

24:11.200 --> 24:13.960
and Windows with the touch of a hotkey.

24:13.960 --> 24:20.200
The DOS compatible Quadra will sell for about $500 more than standard Quadra 610 models.

24:20.200 --> 24:25.400
Phillips Consumer Electronics says its new Brilliant's 2130 monitor represents a major

24:25.400 --> 24:27.880
advancement in display technology.

24:27.880 --> 24:32.600
It's the first monitor that extends digital technology to all the internal signals governing

24:32.600 --> 24:34.160
picture performance.

24:34.160 --> 24:40.000
The Brilliant's 2130 provides high contrast and brilliant colors with low image distortion.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.800
The new digital monitor is priced at $3,500 and will begin shipping in January.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.720
Texas Instruments has added a new color notebook to its travelmate line.

24:49.720 --> 24:57.360
The TM-4000 packs a 486 DX2 processor and features a keyboard similar to a desktop computer.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.200
Prices start around $3,500.

25:00.200 --> 25:05.240
Hewlett Packard packs a lot into its new Omnibook 425, the newest member of its palm

25:05.240 --> 25:06.880
top PC family.

25:06.880 --> 25:11.480
The 486-based system comes loaded with a suite of Windows applications.

25:11.480 --> 25:17.880
The Omnibook 425 weighs in at 2.9 pounds and runs on four AA batteries.

25:17.880 --> 25:23.400
The IBM PC company is aggressively marketing its PS2 server line by cutting prices by up

25:23.400 --> 25:24.920
