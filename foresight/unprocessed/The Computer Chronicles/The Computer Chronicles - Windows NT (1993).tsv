0	22560	This is the Nordstrom store in San Francisco.
22560	28800	It's one of 74 Nordstroms all around the country with annual sales of nearly $3.5 billion.
28800	32640	Nordstroms maintains an inventory of items nearly double that of the typical specialty
32640	34320	store or department store.
34320	38280	That means a gigantic database to keep track of inventory and sales.
38280	41880	So when they went looking around for a computing environment, it was serious business.
41880	47000	They looked at OS2, they looked at Unix, but they settled on Windows NT for Microsoft.
47000	48000	Why?
48000	53560	Well, we'll try to find out today as we try on Windows NT on this edition of the Computer
53560	54360	Chronicles.
58800	74240	Computer Chronicles is brought to you in part by Intel, microprocessor technology for
74240	79000	the software of today and tomorrow, Intel, the computer inside.
79000	84280	Additional funding is provided by the Software Publishers Association, providers of educational
84280	86920	materials to help manage software.
86920	89280	Don't copy that floppy.
89280	97640	And by Hewlett Packard, personal computer division.
97640	98920	Welcome to the Computer Chronicles.
98920	104520	I'm Stuart Sheffa and with me today is Mike Nash, Windows NT product manager with Microsoft.
104520	107960	Mike, I have Windows 3.1 running over here on my HP vector.
107960	110760	You have Windows NT running over there on your machine.
110760	112200	They look almost identical.
112200	113200	What is the difference?
113200	116040	Well, the idea was to make them look as much the same as was possible.
116040	119720	They both use the same familiar program manager, and in fact, a lot of the tools like the file
119720	121200	manager are exactly the same.
121200	125600	In fact, if you could launch my file manager in 3.1, you launch yours in NT.
125600	127100	They're basically the same.
127100	130280	I've got a few extra things that aren't there on Windows 3.1.
130280	131880	For instance, I can have long file names.
131880	136600	A file like names like the Computer Chronicles can have a space in it, whatever special characters
136600	137600	I want to use.
137600	141640	You'll also notice that Windows NT automatically generates a short file name so that older
141640	145840	DOS applications can be 100% compatible on Windows NT.
145840	148800	Windows NT is also designed to be a secure operating system, so we actually have full
148800	152160	support to control the permissions to see who can look at a file.
152160	155520	The Computer Chronicles plan can be viewed by anyone, but we want to make sure that all
155520	157480	the power users have full access to this.
157480	164400	We'll simply go in, choose power users from the list, add them, give them full control,
164400	167800	and now they can access this file any way they want.
167800	172000	While Windows NT runs all the standard Windows applications that you'd ever want, Windows
172000	174640	NT is designed to run more than one application at the same time.
174640	177240	You'll look the same on the surface, but you were running all these other operations
177240	178240	underneath.
178240	180040	Right in the background, exactly.
180040	183040	Windows NT is also designed to be a very manageable system, so if we actually launch
183040	186720	the performance monitor, you'll see that I can actually look and control exactly how
186720	188000	the system is being used.
188000	192320	In this case, I'm monitoring CPU utilization in total and seeing how it's being shared
192320	194760	between the applications and between the system.
194760	198840	Okay, today we will look into Windows NT to see what else it can do, and we'll look at
198840	204320	several new applications written specifically for NT to see how the NT environment improves
204320	205720	on application performance.
205720	209880	First, we're going to visit the Microsoft Labs up in Redmond, Washington to meet the
209880	213320	NT development team.
213320	218880	The Windows NT team at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters barely had time for a brief vacation
218880	221800	before work started on product improvements.
221800	228600	Before the next major version release, codenamed Cairo is ready, Microsoft will release NT upgrades.
228600	236280	We're sitting down trying to figure out how to get an update out with sort of some small
236280	242920	features, double space, and some better networking, enterprise networking support, and better
242920	251720	performance, and then figure out how to get to the next ease of use features in a seamless
251720	256080	short times period without disrupting current applications that are in progress.
256080	260960	Team engineers rebuild and test the NT operating system on a daily basis.
260960	266240	There's an interoperability test lab where they're building connections to OS2 and Novell
266240	267240	servers.
267240	272440	Ongoing tests are run for software compatibility, but special emphasis is placed on hardware
272440	276920	compatibility since NT runs on a variety of platforms.
276920	281720	All the machines that passed the test were put on a hardware compatibility list, and
281720	288920	we had over 1600 machines on a hardware compatibility list, which is, I believe, a record for any
288920	290600	operating system.
290600	295840	Program managers say Cairo will bring a new level of intuitive ability to NT.
295840	302240	Cairo will make it easier for people to say, just give me the sales data for the month
302240	307400	of December, and the system will take care of finding the data, but also enable people
307400	313240	to build solutions where they can work with the data in exactly the way they want to.
313240	316920	They don't have to worry about what application they're running in, they don't have to worry
316920	319920	about the exact structure of the data.
319920	323560	Things will just flow more smoothly in the way that people want it.
323560	339120	For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonel Patterson.
339120	343560	Two of the nice features of Windows NT are portability and scalability.
343560	347640	Here to show us what that means are Ray Court of Microsoft and also back with us Mike Nash
347640	348640	of Microsoft.
348640	351880	Ray, we're going to start with you and talk about portability, and what does that mean?
352240	357000	Well, what we have here is the same consistent Windows user interface, but of course, it's
357000	360560	Windows NT that's running here, and it's running on a different microprocessor chip.
360560	363000	All right, so what do we have over here on this NetPower PC?
363000	365120	Well, they say that scene is believe-in.
365120	368840	If I use this little utility here, I can show you what hardware we have installed in this
368840	369840	machine.
369840	374560	If I choose hardware, you can see that my CPU type is actually a MIPS microprocessor.
374560	376760	So we're not running a 486 or a Pentium here.
376760	379840	This is a MIPS R4000, and we're running NT.
379920	382280	What's the advantage to me of being able to do this?
382280	386120	The advantage of being able to do this is that you can integrate a new generation of
386120	391520	32-bit applications with your most popular applications, for example, like Excel, 1,
391520	393440	2, 3 for Windows, or WordPerfect.
393440	395760	So you're running 16-bit Excel up here.
395760	401000	I'm running 16-bit Excel, and in the background, I have a 32-bit application called PVWave,
401000	402600	which is used to visualize data.
402600	406160	So what I'm going to do is to hide this data here.
406160	408120	So that's data coming out of Excel.
408120	413440	This is data coming out of Excel, Excel to PVWave, 16-bit to 32-bit, and I'm going to
413440	416760	plot that information so that we can see it in a different form.
416760	419840	And as you can see, as the charts begin to roll out on the screen here, these are quite
419840	421920	complex plots.
421920	425240	So what you're able to do is use your familiar Excel, which you could have been running on
425240	430800	in your 3.1 mode or whatever, with NT you can actually talk now to this 32-bit PVWave
430800	431800	application.
431800	432800	Absolutely.
432800	436840	In essence, what you're doing here is actually using the best tools for the appropriate job.
436960	439160	Okay, let's turn to the next platform here.
439160	443360	You've got a digital machine, so I won't guess you show me again what CPU we're running here.
443360	447640	I'll use our little utility again, and if I select the hardware option, it tells me
447640	451680	what type of CPU I'm running, and here it says I'm running a DEC Alpha processor.
451680	456320	So here NT is running under an Alpha chip, and show me what I can do with this.
456320	460520	Okay, what I'm running here is Hyperion, which is a corporate-level financial management
460520	461520	application.
461640	466960	What it allows me to do is to visualize my corporation very easily, very graphically.
466960	468720	We're using the Windows interface here.
468720	472280	I can do things like drag and drop sections of my company.
472280	478120	So if I say I want to move production from Portugal and move it to the American region,
478120	481520	and then I can go and have a look late and see if I consolidate that information, what
481520	483200	that means on my numbers.
483200	489360	So if we end out here, I'll save the change to my organization, bit of mouse problems
489360	491960	there, and we choose consolidation.
491960	494440	I select the total corporation here.
494440	497880	I choose options, consolidate all, and we look down in the bottom here, and this is
497880	500720	consolidating 12 megabytes of data, and it's finished.
500720	504280	So you've really recalculated this gigantic spreadsheet in a couple of seconds.
504280	505280	In a couple of seconds.
505280	508320	On Windows 3.1, that would normally take several minutes.
508320	509800	Okay, thank you very much Ray.
509800	513680	Let's move along from portability to scalability, and talk to Mike again.
513680	516680	And Mike, what are you going to show us about scalability then?
516960	520440	Well, scalability has a lot to do with the way we can harness new hardware.
520440	523840	What I have running here is the server version of Windows NT, a product called Microsoft
523840	525640	Windows NT Advanced Server.
525640	528520	And Windows NT Advanced Server is much more than just a file and print server.
528520	532200	It's actually designed to be an application server, so that we can run server applications
532200	535000	and have multiple users share information.
535000	539040	What we're doing here is running SQL Server on a four CPU compact ProLiant 4000.
539040	543320	And actually, as you can see from these transaction processing numbers, we're able to deliver
543320	545880	about 290 transactions per second.
545880	550120	Just for reference, a mini-computer does about mid to high 200s, and really the high end
550120	551800	of the mini-computer class.
551800	556040	So what you're saying is using a four processor machine like this and NT at a relatively low
556040	558040	cost, we can really get mini-computer performance.
558040	559040	Exactly.
559040	562240	And it has a lot to do with Windows NT's ability to share the load, if you will, across the
562240	563240	four CPUs.
563240	566040	In fact, let me take a look at how we do that.
566040	568640	In the performance monitor, I can actually monitor CPU utilization.
568640	573920	So what I want to do is actually look at how we're sharing the load across these four CPUs
573920	575840	in the system.
575840	579360	Take a look here at this histogram, and what you can see is we're pretty evenly spreading
579360	580360	the load across the four.
580360	583200	So each color is representing one of the Pentium chips inside the compact.
583200	584200	Exactly.
584200	586360	Now, SQL Server is designed to be very easy to use as well.
586360	589720	We want to make it possible for people that maybe don't know so much about application
589720	593280	servers to use solutions based on Windows NT and SQL Server.
593280	597800	Actually, this is the SQL Server Manager, and I can actually start and stop SQL Server
597800	600160	using very easy and intuitive stoplight.
600160	605000	And as you'll see, as I double-click and stop the server, it automatically will bring transaction
605000	607560	processing and the CPU utilization right to zero.
607560	608560	All right.
608560	612120	So again, the point in scalability is NT can kind of work with the hardware it has.
612120	613880	You crank it up here with four Pentiums.
613880	615360	It'll crank up to take advantage of that.
615360	617800	It could work with one chip PC, et cetera.
617800	618800	Exactly.
618800	619800	All right.
619800	621800	Now, if you're using advanced server, I take it the point is network management.
621800	624920	Show me some of the other network management tools in NT Advanced Server.
624920	625920	Very good points to it.
625920	629720	Really, what we're trying to do here is to do the best of what file servers and traditional
629720	633200	PC class servers did, and really combine that with the best of what many computers and main
633240	634720	frames did in terms of manageability.
634720	638560	And a big part of managing the system is managing the users that need to access it.
638560	641280	Go in here and take a look at your account here.
641280	643680	And we've actually created one that looks at the groups that you're a member of and
643680	647240	show that you're a member of the Computer Chronicles and Domain Users Group, but we want to make
647240	648760	you an administrator here as well.
648760	653400	So by simply dragging and dropping the administrator group onto your profile, I can automatically
653400	656800	give you all the rights and privileges that an administrator on the system would get.
656800	660760	You can also look to control other parameters of your account, like the hours that you're
660760	661760	allowed to log onto the system.
661800	665720	And in fact, for some reason, we've disabled your ability to log on on Tuesday evenings.
665720	669560	We want to re-enable that, just touch the allow box, and you automatically get the ability
669560	672840	to log on at all times.
672840	675000	What other network management features can you show me?
675000	678400	Another important aspect of network management is the ability to manage groups of servers
678400	680760	and workstations together from a single point of management.
680760	684200	So we have a product here, a process here called the Server Manager, which allows us
684200	687160	to drill down and look at any server on the system.
687160	691000	I'll look again at this four CPU per line that we've been using today, and look and
691000	692440	see what users are connected to it.
692440	697280	You can see that just the administrator from the other machine is logged on here.
697280	701440	We can look and see the share points, the files that are running on this machine, and
701440	705200	look and see all the shares that are allowed from this machine.
705200	711720	I can also look to see what services are running here, and actually look to see all the applications
711720	715880	and server-based processes that are running on this machine.
716880	721680	The next thing that's really interesting about Windows NT is something called the Event
721680	722680	Viewer.
722680	727520	The Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server ships with this product that allows you to look
727520	731400	and see all the things that have occurred on the system for as far back as you want
731400	732400	to keep the logs.
732400	738560	We can look and see a detailed breakdown of every instance of anything that's happened
738560	740560	on this machine since it was first booted.
740560	741760	All right, Mike.
741760	742760	Thank you very much.
742760	747480	All right, as we've seen, Windows NT is not so much an upgrade for Windows 3.1 as it is
747480	751920	a competitor for other high-end computing platforms like Unix and OS2.
751920	755680	We talked to some users who are working on those platforms to see what they think about
755680	757320	Windows NT.
757320	762560	A Unix workstation gives commercial artist Lee Seiler the power he needs for the multimedia
762560	765880	design work he does here at his Berkeley studio.
765880	771280	Seiler developed his own computer graphics software for the Atari ST, then ported it
771320	773240	to the Unix platform.
773240	778040	Seiler says his own user-friendly interface running on a silicon graphics indigo gives
778040	783480	him more power and speed than he's seen so far on any Windows NT-based system.
783480	788680	The problem right now probably isn't NT in and of itself, but the fact is running on
788680	796880	what I would say is a low horsepower hardware platform until the PCs or whatever system
796880	804960	they're going to run this on gets up to the horsepower of the risk systems that you find
804960	809640	in silicon graphics and in the sun systems.
809640	811400	They just simply don't have the power.
811400	816040	And now with Unix vendors aiming at the desktop multimedia market, it's possible to have
816040	818760	high power in an affordable price range.
818760	823480	Now with technology being what it is and being able to go out and for say something in the
823480	831760	neighborhood of like $5,000 indie, you can now buy a machine that is running at 135 million
831760	833760	operations a second.
833760	840840	Unix, which required a big powerful system just to exist, now has an ideal environment.
840840	845600	At Fireman's Fund Insurance Headquarters in San Rafael, the system's developers prefer
845600	848840	IBM's OS2 operating system.
848840	852880	They've been using OS2 corporate-wide since 1989.
852880	858000	And our decision to use OS2 and more, our decision to go to client server was based
858000	861640	on our ability to write mission-critical applications.
861640	868200	So we have written the applications that support the underwriting in our commercial, in our
868200	871600	personal, and also in our specialty profit centers.
871600	874800	We've also written claim-adjusting applications.
874800	879840	And within the system's organization, we now have all of our mainframe development enhancement
879840	885120	actually being performed on a client-server basis using OS2.
885120	890920	Fireman's Fund agents are able to issue policies, process forms and letters, and automate underwriting
890920	892960	functions from their desktop.
892960	898080	The productivity of all divisions, including claims adjustment, has increased dramatically.
898080	903720	A claims adjuster will have somewhere from 60 to 70 active claim files that they'll be
903720	904960	dealing with.
904960	909640	And we've taken the client-server technology, OS2, and written the front-end application
909640	915080	to our existing mainframe claims processing system to automate a lot of the workflow and
915080	917560	procedures that a claim adjuster has to deal with.
917560	921880	Since application programming is done on the desktop, end users are able to get involved
921880	924680	early on in the development process.
924680	929480	Fireman's Fund has so completely absorbed OS2 into its corporate functions, they're
929480	932280	not looking to make a move to Windows NT.
932280	935600	We're not seriously looking at Windows NT right now.
935600	940600	We made the decision to go with OS2 and suffered through some of the growing pains, but now
940600	945320	have no complaint or no real reason to cause us to look otherwise.
945320	948560	We're frankly very happy with what OS2 provides to us.
948560	963840	For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonelle Patterson.
963840	968320	If you want the 32-bit speed of Windows NT, it's probably because you're interested in
968320	972240	computation-intensive applications like graphics or CAD.
972240	974000	So that's what we'll show you next.
974000	978720	Helped out by Michael Gibbons of AltSys and also joining us Glenn Burnett of Bentley Systems
978720	979720	and InterGraph.
979720	980720	Michael, let's begin with you.
980720	985080	You're with AltSys, and you guys have a technology called Virtuoso, which you've then applied
985080	990040	to the new Aldous Freehand 4.0 written specifically for NT, which is the first graphics design
990040	991560	application for NT.
991560	995720	Show us some of the power of running this kind of design program under NT.
995720	1000760	First of all, Stuart, it's the inspector, which gives it a very nice interface.
1000760	1004280	What we'll do is we're going to bring in some text.
1004280	1007440	We have the text already in, and we're going to bring in an image.
1007440	1008920	Because you're laying out an ad or something right now.
1008920	1009920	Correct.
1009920	1011880	You've already got some text, and you've got a headline in there.
1011880	1012880	Correct.
1012880	1017560	So what we'll do is we'll place a document that we've already created with Freehand.
1017560	1023160	If you notice, simply by double clicking, cursor turns into a corner icon.
1023160	1028560	I'm going to place and scale this accordingly.
1028560	1032560	And this is a very complex document, and just in a matter of seconds, boom.
1032560	1038400	Okay, now what we'll do is we're going to open up an inspector panel again, and we're
1038400	1047800	going to link the text, as you'll see here, to another container, and we'll go in and
1047800	1049240	we'll fit the copy.
1049240	1057320	So you're going to try to wrap that copy around the graphic you pulled in?
1057320	1058320	Correct.
1058320	1065760	And taking into account all the letter spacing, the kerning, it's quite complex, and it doesn't
1065760	1068480	matter seconds due to NT's speed.
1068480	1070960	Sure, and there it is.
1070960	1075280	And now we also have one other feature here, it's a layers feature, where we have a table
1075280	1080880	that we've pre-set in another program, and by clicking, we've got that.
1080880	1084280	So in the lower right, you just added a new layer to this graphic, okay?
1084280	1085280	It's correct.
1085280	1088520	All right, now you've got something called multiple page technology inside here, which
1088520	1090120	also is a pretty powerful tool.
1090120	1091120	Show us what that is.
1091120	1093120	That's the first, I guess you're the first graphics program to have this.
1093120	1094120	On any platform.
1094120	1095120	Yes, that's correct.
1095640	1100480	Multiple page is going to allow you to take, for this particular company right here, we've
1100480	1105000	done a page layout, now they need letterhead, business cards and envelopes.
1105000	1109600	So by simply clicking on, for instance, number two, we're going to go in, we have letterhead
1109600	1110600	set up.
1110600	1114680	The options button here will allow you to add pages, duplicate or remove.
1114680	1118680	You can also go in and see that we have a business card set here.
1118680	1125280	We could duplicate this a number of times.
1125280	1130320	And again, what we'll do is we'll select all and you can see the complete layout that
1130320	1131320	we have here.
1131320	1133400	That's a little small, but you do get the picture.
1133400	1134400	So you can do the whole bit.
1134400	1137320	Take your graphic design, put it in the ad, put it in your letterhead, put it in your
1137320	1140360	business card and so on, all using the same environment.
1140360	1141360	That's correct.
1141360	1142360	All right, thank you very much, Michael.
1142360	1143360	Thank you.
1143360	1145040	We're going to move over here to Glendown, take a look at another application under
1145040	1146040	NT.
1146040	1149280	I guess the question for you as I had for Michael, what's the benefit?
1149280	1153520	You wrote Microstation just for NT and what's the extra power you get out of that?
1153520	1157000	Well the extra power comes both on the front end and in the speed and on the back end in
1157000	1161240	the ability to make this software product portable to other platforms as they become
1161240	1162240	available.
1162240	1165320	So the advantage we saw portability before, you write for NT, you're automatically on
1165320	1166320	all these platforms.
1166320	1168000	Yeah, with a quick compile, you bet.
1168000	1171680	All right, so show us a little bit about Microstation and what some of the power it is.
1171680	1176920	Microstation is a very powerful CAD program that uses the icon capabilities of Windows
1176920	1183120	NT as well as the ability to drag off our icons so that I can arrange my desktop to
1183120	1189040	an efficient method where it makes it easy for me to use or users to use.
1189040	1192760	I've got a design here that we call dimension-driven design.
1192760	1195720	Quickly, I want to show you how easy it is to turn off.
1195720	1200640	In this view, you see all the dotted lines are our dimension, our construction elements
1200640	1202080	that define the constraints.
1202080	1205680	I just quickly turn those off globally regardless of their level.
1205680	1211720	I'm going to grab all the elements on this view here and change their color, graphically.
1211720	1217240	I just simply go pick a color on the color palette and bingo, there's our colors.
1217240	1223960	Being dimension-driven, I can modify the dimension itself and as you see, I modify the dimension.
1223960	1229720	The entire design changes and you'll notice it changes in all the views as well, exactly.
1229720	1234480	That gives you the power and especially in 3D, this gives you the power to design in
1234480	1235480	multiple views.
1235480	1238320	I'm going to open a different design file.
1238320	1242880	I just simply go up and Microstation saves previous design files that I've been in, grab
1242880	1251920	another one, grab our tags palette, show you that we can modify existing data that's non-graphical
1251920	1253680	to graphical data.
1253680	1260160	For example, this is a piece of property, the owner, the lot number and the value.
1260160	1267000	I'm going to pick on the value here and I'm going to change it from 225 to say $250,000.
1267000	1271280	As soon as I do that, you'll notice over here, it will change automatically.
1271280	1274600	You can change text without affecting the graphics and getting into the graphics part
1274600	1275600	of it.
1275600	1281680	Right, but I'm also assigning data to these graphics for GIS, geographical information
1281680	1282680	systems purposes.
1283200	1284840	What else can you do with Microstation?
1284840	1289440	I'm going to go ahead and go into one additional design file and show you the rendering power
1289440	1291200	of Microstation.
1291200	1294400	You'll see the first thing that comes up is a background bitmap.
1294400	1299760	We can apply bitmaps to objects and this may be difficult to see at the moment, but we've
1299760	1302560	got a architectural design here.
1302560	1306760	I'm going to show you by opening up a smaller view, I'm going to render that for you and
1306760	1309320	show you our capabilities.
1310320	1312480	You can see we have a number of different renderings.
1312480	1315520	That's the wire mesh version, you're going to render that drawing now.
1315520	1318080	I'm going to render it Fong.
1318080	1321600	What you'll see is it's going to map some lights.
1321600	1326360	Right now it's updating each of the individual polygons that we see in the background here
1326360	1331760	and you'll see the water in the pool actually has a texture map to it so you get a feel
1331760	1333440	that it's actually rippling water.
1333440	1337480	We see shadows that are being cast by something that we haven't even put in there yet.
1337480	1338480	Correct.
1338480	1342760	The calculation is done so it's displaying the calculation that shadows are available
1342760	1348480	from these light, skylights that are up here.
1348480	1352320	You also see the texture on the walls.
1352320	1353320	We have texture mapping.
1353320	1356040	So it's sort of stuck to the walls we can see there.
1356040	1357040	Correct.
1357040	1361440	And the plants that you see in the background are bitmaps with transparency that are applied
1361440	1367080	to polygons that sit in the background to give your user or your client the ability to
1367080	1372400	see what their design is going to be like even before it's done.
1372400	1376840	You'll also see as this window is updated back here that we have translucency.
1376840	1380960	We're putting a kind of fogged glass in there.
1380960	1382120	And the thing's fully rendered.
1382120	1383120	Correct.
1383120	1384120	I took about a minute or something.
1384120	1385120	Approximately a minute.
1385120	1386120	Yeah.
1386120	1387120	Normally you would wait a long time to see that render.
1387120	1388120	Yes.
1388120	1389120	Exactly.
1389120	1391280	We also have the ability to do animations.
1391280	1393400	I've got an animation loaded here.
1393400	1397040	This is of a living room and again I'm just going to play that animation.
1397040	1398560	And you see that we have the fan turning.
1398560	1399560	You can do walkthroughs.
1399560	1401560	And the shatters and the fans casting.
1401560	1402560	Right.
1402560	1403560	Exactly.
1403560	1404560	Exactly.
1404560	1408520	So Microstation is a very powerful CAD environment for multiple disciplines of designing.
1408520	1410160	And taking advantage of the NT platform.
1410160	1411160	Absolutely.
1411160	1412160	All right.
1412160	1413160	Thank you very much.
1413160	1414160	That is our look at Windows NT.
1414160	1417000	Stay tuned now for this week's Computer News on Random Access.
