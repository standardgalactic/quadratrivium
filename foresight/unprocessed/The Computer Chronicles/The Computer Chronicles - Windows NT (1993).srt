1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,560
This is the Nordstrom store in San Francisco.

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,800
It's one of 74 Nordstroms all around the country with annual sales of nearly $3.5 billion.

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
Nordstroms maintains an inventory of items nearly double that of the typical specialty

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
store or department store.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,280
That means a gigantic database to keep track of inventory and sales.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,880
So when they went looking around for a computing environment, it was serious business.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,000
They looked at OS2, they looked at Unix, but they settled on Windows NT for Microsoft.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,560
Well, we'll try to find out today as we try on Windows NT on this edition of the Computer

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,360
Chronicles.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:14,240
Computer Chronicles is brought to you in part by Intel, microprocessor technology for

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,000
the software of today and tomorrow, Intel, the computer inside.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,280
Additional funding is provided by the Software Publishers Association, providers of educational

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,920
materials to help manage software.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,280
Don't copy that floppy.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,640
And by Hewlett Packard, personal computer division.

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
Welcome to the Computer Chronicles.

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,520
I'm Stuart Sheffa and with me today is Mike Nash, Windows NT product manager with Microsoft.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,960
Mike, I have Windows 3.1 running over here on my HP vector.

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,760
You have Windows NT running over there on your machine.

21
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,200
They look almost identical.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
What is the difference?

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Well, the idea was to make them look as much the same as was possible.

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,720
They both use the same familiar program manager, and in fact, a lot of the tools like the file

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,200
manager are exactly the same.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
In fact, if you could launch my file manager in 3.1, you launch yours in NT.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
They're basically the same.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,280
I've got a few extra things that aren't there on Windows 3.1.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,880
For instance, I can have long file names.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,600
A file like names like the Computer Chronicles can have a space in it, whatever special characters

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I want to use.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,640
You'll also notice that Windows NT automatically generates a short file name so that older

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,840
DOS applications can be 100% compatible on Windows NT.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
Windows NT is also designed to be a secure operating system, so we actually have full

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
support to control the permissions to see who can look at a file.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,520
The Computer Chronicles plan can be viewed by anyone, but we want to make sure that all

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,480
the power users have full access to this.

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,400
We'll simply go in, choose power users from the list, add them, give them full control,

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,800
and now they can access this file any way they want.

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,000
While Windows NT runs all the standard Windows applications that you'd ever want, Windows

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
NT is designed to run more than one application at the same time.

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,240
You'll look the same on the surface, but you were running all these other operations

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
underneath.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,040
Right in the background, exactly.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Windows NT is also designed to be a very manageable system, so if we actually launch

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
the performance monitor, you'll see that I can actually look and control exactly how

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
the system is being used.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,320
In this case, I'm monitoring CPU utilization in total and seeing how it's being shared

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,760
between the applications and between the system.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,840
Okay, today we will look into Windows NT to see what else it can do, and we'll look at

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,320
several new applications written specifically for NT to see how the NT environment improves

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,720
on application performance.

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,880
First, we're going to visit the Microsoft Labs up in Redmond, Washington to meet the

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
NT development team.

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,880
The Windows NT team at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters barely had time for a brief vacation

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,800
before work started on product improvements.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Before the next major version release, codenamed Cairo is ready, Microsoft will release NT upgrades.

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:56,280
We're sitting down trying to figure out how to get an update out with sort of some small

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,920
features, double space, and some better networking, enterprise networking support, and better

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:11,720
performance, and then figure out how to get to the next ease of use features in a seamless

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,080
short times period without disrupting current applications that are in progress.

62
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,960
Team engineers rebuild and test the NT operating system on a daily basis.

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,240
There's an interoperability test lab where they're building connections to OS2 and Novell

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
servers.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,440
Ongoing tests are run for software compatibility, but special emphasis is placed on hardware

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,920
compatibility since NT runs on a variety of platforms.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,720
All the machines that passed the test were put on a hardware compatibility list, and

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,920
we had over 1600 machines on a hardware compatibility list, which is, I believe, a record for any

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
operating system.

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Program managers say Cairo will bring a new level of intuitive ability to NT.

71
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,240
Cairo will make it easier for people to say, just give me the sales data for the month

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,400
of December, and the system will take care of finding the data, but also enable people

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,240
to build solutions where they can work with the data in exactly the way they want to.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,920
They don't have to worry about what application they're running in, they don't have to worry

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,920
about the exact structure of the data.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Things will just flow more smoothly in the way that people want it.

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:39,120
For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonel Patterson.

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,560
Two of the nice features of Windows NT are portability and scalability.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,640
Here to show us what that means are Ray Court of Microsoft and also back with us Mike Nash

80
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
of Microsoft.

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,880
Ray, we're going to start with you and talk about portability, and what does that mean?

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, what we have here is the same consistent Windows user interface, but of course, it's

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Windows NT that's running here, and it's running on a different microprocessor chip.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
All right, so what do we have over here on this NetPower PC?

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,120
Well, they say that scene is believe-in.

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,840
If I use this little utility here, I can show you what hardware we have installed in this

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
machine.

88
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,560
If I choose hardware, you can see that my CPU type is actually a MIPS microprocessor.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,760
So we're not running a 486 or a Pentium here.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,840
This is a MIPS R4000, and we're running NT.

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,280
What's the advantage to me of being able to do this?

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,120
The advantage of being able to do this is that you can integrate a new generation of

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,520
32-bit applications with your most popular applications, for example, like Excel, 1,

94
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
2, 3 for Windows, or WordPerfect.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,760
So you're running 16-bit Excel up here.

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm running 16-bit Excel, and in the background, I have a 32-bit application called PVWave,

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
which is used to visualize data.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,160
So what I'm going to do is to hide this data here.

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,120
So that's data coming out of Excel.

100
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,440
This is data coming out of Excel, Excel to PVWave, 16-bit to 32-bit, and I'm going to

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,760
plot that information so that we can see it in a different form.

102
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,840
And as you can see, as the charts begin to roll out on the screen here, these are quite

103
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,920
complex plots.

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,240
So what you're able to do is use your familiar Excel, which you could have been running on

105
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,800
in your 3.1 mode or whatever, with NT you can actually talk now to this 32-bit PVWave

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
application.

107
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Absolutely.

108
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,840
In essence, what you're doing here is actually using the best tools for the appropriate job.

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,160
Okay, let's turn to the next platform here.

110
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,360
You've got a digital machine, so I won't guess you show me again what CPU we're running here.

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,640
I'll use our little utility again, and if I select the hardware option, it tells me

112
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,680
what type of CPU I'm running, and here it says I'm running a DEC Alpha processor.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,320
So here NT is running under an Alpha chip, and show me what I can do with this.

114
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,520
Okay, what I'm running here is Hyperion, which is a corporate-level financial management

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
application.

116
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,960
What it allows me to do is to visualize my corporation very easily, very graphically.

117
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
We're using the Windows interface here.

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,280
I can do things like drag and drop sections of my company.

119
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,120
So if I say I want to move production from Portugal and move it to the American region,

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,520
and then I can go and have a look late and see if I consolidate that information, what

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,200
that means on my numbers.

122
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,360
So if we end out here, I'll save the change to my organization, bit of mouse problems

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,960
there, and we choose consolidation.

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,440
I select the total corporation here.

125
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,880
I choose options, consolidate all, and we look down in the bottom here, and this is

126
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,720
consolidating 12 megabytes of data, and it's finished.

127
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,280
So you've really recalculated this gigantic spreadsheet in a couple of seconds.

128
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
In a couple of seconds.

129
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,320
On Windows 3.1, that would normally take several minutes.

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,800
Okay, thank you very much Ray.

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,680
Let's move along from portability to scalability, and talk to Mike again.

132
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
And Mike, what are you going to show us about scalability then?

133
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,440
Well, scalability has a lot to do with the way we can harness new hardware.

134
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,840
What I have running here is the server version of Windows NT, a product called Microsoft

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
Windows NT Advanced Server.

136
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,520
And Windows NT Advanced Server is much more than just a file and print server.

137
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,200
It's actually designed to be an application server, so that we can run server applications

138
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
and have multiple users share information.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,040
What we're doing here is running SQL Server on a four CPU compact ProLiant 4000.

140
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,320
And actually, as you can see from these transaction processing numbers, we're able to deliver

141
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,880
about 290 transactions per second.

142
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,120
Just for reference, a mini-computer does about mid to high 200s, and really the high end

143
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,800
of the mini-computer class.

144
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,040
So what you're saying is using a four processor machine like this and NT at a relatively low

145
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
cost, we can really get mini-computer performance.

146
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Exactly.

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
And it has a lot to do with Windows NT's ability to share the load, if you will, across the

148
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
four CPUs.

149
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,040
In fact, let me take a look at how we do that.

150
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
In the performance monitor, I can actually monitor CPU utilization.

151
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,920
So what I want to do is actually look at how we're sharing the load across these four CPUs

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,840
in the system.

153
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,360
Take a look here at this histogram, and what you can see is we're pretty evenly spreading

154
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
the load across the four.

155
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,200
So each color is representing one of the Pentium chips inside the compact.

156
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Exactly.

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Now, SQL Server is designed to be very easy to use as well.

158
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,720
We want to make it possible for people that maybe don't know so much about application

159
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,280
servers to use solutions based on Windows NT and SQL Server.

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,800
Actually, this is the SQL Server Manager, and I can actually start and stop SQL Server

161
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,160
using very easy and intuitive stoplight.

162
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,000
And as you'll see, as I double-click and stop the server, it automatically will bring transaction

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,560
processing and the CPU utilization right to zero.

164
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
All right.

165
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,120
So again, the point in scalability is NT can kind of work with the hardware it has.

166
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,880
You crank it up here with four Pentiums.

167
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,360
It'll crank up to take advantage of that.

168
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,800
It could work with one chip PC, et cetera.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Exactly.

170
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
All right.

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Now, if you're using advanced server, I take it the point is network management.

172
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,920
Show me some of the other network management tools in NT Advanced Server.

173
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Very good points to it.

174
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,720
Really, what we're trying to do here is to do the best of what file servers and traditional

175
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,200
PC class servers did, and really combine that with the best of what many computers and main

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,720
frames did in terms of manageability.

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,560
And a big part of managing the system is managing the users that need to access it.

178
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,280
Go in here and take a look at your account here.

179
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,680
And we've actually created one that looks at the groups that you're a member of and

180
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,240
show that you're a member of the Computer Chronicles and Domain Users Group, but we want to make

181
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,760
you an administrator here as well.

182
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,400
So by simply dragging and dropping the administrator group onto your profile, I can automatically

183
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,800
give you all the rights and privileges that an administrator on the system would get.

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,760
You can also look to control other parameters of your account, like the hours that you're

185
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
allowed to log onto the system.

186
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,720
And in fact, for some reason, we've disabled your ability to log on on Tuesday evenings.

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,560
We want to re-enable that, just touch the allow box, and you automatically get the ability

188
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,840
to log on at all times.

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,000
What other network management features can you show me?

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Another important aspect of network management is the ability to manage groups of servers

191
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
and workstations together from a single point of management.

192
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,200
So we have a product here, a process here called the Server Manager, which allows us

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,160
to drill down and look at any server on the system.

194
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll look again at this four CPU per line that we've been using today, and look and

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
see what users are connected to it.

196
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,280
You can see that just the administrator from the other machine is logged on here.

197
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,440
We can look and see the share points, the files that are running on this machine, and

198
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
look and see all the shares that are allowed from this machine.

199
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,720
I can also look to see what services are running here, and actually look to see all the applications

200
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,880
and server-based processes that are running on this machine.

201
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,680
The next thing that's really interesting about Windows NT is something called the Event

202
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Viewer.

203
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,520
The Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server ships with this product that allows you to look

204
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,400
and see all the things that have occurred on the system for as far back as you want

205
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
to keep the logs.

206
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,560
We can look and see a detailed breakdown of every instance of anything that's happened

207
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
on this machine since it was first booted.

208
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
All right, Mike.

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Thank you very much.

210
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,480
All right, as we've seen, Windows NT is not so much an upgrade for Windows 3.1 as it is

211
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,920
a competitor for other high-end computing platforms like Unix and OS2.

212
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
We talked to some users who are working on those platforms to see what they think about

213
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,320
Windows NT.

214
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,560
A Unix workstation gives commercial artist Lee Seiler the power he needs for the multimedia

215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,880
design work he does here at his Berkeley studio.

216
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,280
Seiler developed his own computer graphics software for the Atari ST, then ported it

217
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,240
to the Unix platform.

218
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,040
Seiler says his own user-friendly interface running on a silicon graphics indigo gives

219
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,480
him more power and speed than he's seen so far on any Windows NT-based system.

220
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,680
The problem right now probably isn't NT in and of itself, but the fact is running on

221
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:16,880
what I would say is a low horsepower hardware platform until the PCs or whatever system

222
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,960
they're going to run this on gets up to the horsepower of the risk systems that you find

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,640
in silicon graphics and in the sun systems.

224
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,400
They just simply don't have the power.

225
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,040
And now with Unix vendors aiming at the desktop multimedia market, it's possible to have

226
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,760
high power in an affordable price range.

227
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,480
Now with technology being what it is and being able to go out and for say something in the

228
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,760
neighborhood of like $5,000 indie, you can now buy a machine that is running at 135 million

229
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
operations a second.

230
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,840
Unix, which required a big powerful system just to exist, now has an ideal environment.

231
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,600
At Fireman's Fund Insurance Headquarters in San Rafael, the system's developers prefer

232
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,840
IBM's OS2 operating system.

233
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,880
They've been using OS2 corporate-wide since 1989.

234
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,000
And our decision to use OS2 and more, our decision to go to client server was based

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,640
on our ability to write mission-critical applications.

236
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,200
So we have written the applications that support the underwriting in our commercial, in our

237
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,600
personal, and also in our specialty profit centers.

238
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
We've also written claim-adjusting applications.

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,840
And within the system's organization, we now have all of our mainframe development enhancement

240
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,120
actually being performed on a client-server basis using OS2.

241
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,920
Fireman's Fund agents are able to issue policies, process forms and letters, and automate underwriting

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,960
functions from their desktop.

243
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,080
The productivity of all divisions, including claims adjustment, has increased dramatically.

244
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,720
A claims adjuster will have somewhere from 60 to 70 active claim files that they'll be

245
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,960
dealing with.

246
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,640
And we've taken the client-server technology, OS2, and written the front-end application

247
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,080
to our existing mainframe claims processing system to automate a lot of the workflow and

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,560
procedures that a claim adjuster has to deal with.

249
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,880
Since application programming is done on the desktop, end users are able to get involved

250
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,680
early on in the development process.

251
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,480
Fireman's Fund has so completely absorbed OS2 into its corporate functions, they're

252
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,280
not looking to make a move to Windows NT.

253
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,600
We're not seriously looking at Windows NT right now.

254
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
We made the decision to go with OS2 and suffered through some of the growing pains, but now

255
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,320
have no complaint or no real reason to cause us to look otherwise.

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,560
We're frankly very happy with what OS2 provides to us.

257
00:15:48,560 --> 00:16:03,840
For the Computer Chronicles, I'm Jonelle Patterson.

258
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,320
If you want the 32-bit speed of Windows NT, it's probably because you're interested in

259
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
computation-intensive applications like graphics or CAD.

260
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,000
So that's what we'll show you next.

261
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
Helped out by Michael Gibbons of AltSys and also joining us Glenn Burnett of Bentley Systems

262
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
and InterGraph.

263
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Michael, let's begin with you.

264
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,080
You're with AltSys, and you guys have a technology called Virtuoso, which you've then applied

265
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,040
to the new Aldous Freehand 4.0 written specifically for NT, which is the first graphics design

266
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,560
application for NT.

267
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,720
Show us some of the power of running this kind of design program under NT.

268
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,760
First of all, Stuart, it's the inspector, which gives it a very nice interface.

269
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,280
What we'll do is we're going to bring in some text.

270
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,440
We have the text already in, and we're going to bring in an image.

271
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,920
Because you're laying out an ad or something right now.

272
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Correct.

273
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,880
You've already got some text, and you've got a headline in there.

274
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Correct.

275
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,560
So what we'll do is we'll place a document that we've already created with Freehand.

276
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,160
If you notice, simply by double clicking, cursor turns into a corner icon.

277
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm going to place and scale this accordingly.

278
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,560
And this is a very complex document, and just in a matter of seconds, boom.

279
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,400
Okay, now what we'll do is we're going to open up an inspector panel again, and we're

280
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,800
going to link the text, as you'll see here, to another container, and we'll go in and

281
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,240
we'll fit the copy.

282
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:37,320
So you're going to try to wrap that copy around the graphic you pulled in?

283
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Correct.

284
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,760
And taking into account all the letter spacing, the kerning, it's quite complex, and it doesn't

285
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,480
matter seconds due to NT's speed.

286
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Sure, and there it is.

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,280
And now we also have one other feature here, it's a layers feature, where we have a table

288
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,880
that we've pre-set in another program, and by clicking, we've got that.

289
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,280
So in the lower right, you just added a new layer to this graphic, okay?

290
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
It's correct.

291
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,520
All right, now you've got something called multiple page technology inside here, which

292
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
also is a pretty powerful tool.

293
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Show us what that is.

294
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
That's the first, I guess you're the first graphics program to have this.

295
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
On any platform.

296
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Yes, that's correct.

297
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,480
Multiple page is going to allow you to take, for this particular company right here, we've

298
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,000
done a page layout, now they need letterhead, business cards and envelopes.

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,600
So by simply clicking on, for instance, number two, we're going to go in, we have letterhead

300
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
set up.

301
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,680
The options button here will allow you to add pages, duplicate or remove.

302
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,680
You can also go in and see that we have a business card set here.

303
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,280
We could duplicate this a number of times.

304
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,320
And again, what we'll do is we'll select all and you can see the complete layout that

305
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
we have here.

306
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,400
That's a little small, but you do get the picture.

307
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
So you can do the whole bit.

308
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,320
Take your graphic design, put it in the ad, put it in your letterhead, put it in your

309
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,360
business card and so on, all using the same environment.

310
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
That's correct.

311
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
All right, thank you very much, Michael.

312
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Thank you.

313
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,040
We're going to move over here to Glendown, take a look at another application under

314
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
NT.

315
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,280
I guess the question for you as I had for Michael, what's the benefit?

316
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
You wrote Microstation just for NT and what's the extra power you get out of that?

317
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,000
Well the extra power comes both on the front end and in the speed and on the back end in

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,240
the ability to make this software product portable to other platforms as they become

319
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
available.

320
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,320
So the advantage we saw portability before, you write for NT, you're automatically on

321
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
all these platforms.

322
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, with a quick compile, you bet.

323
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,680
All right, so show us a little bit about Microstation and what some of the power it is.

324
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,920
Microstation is a very powerful CAD program that uses the icon capabilities of Windows

325
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,120
NT as well as the ability to drag off our icons so that I can arrange my desktop to

326
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,040
an efficient method where it makes it easy for me to use or users to use.

327
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,760
I've got a design here that we call dimension-driven design.

328
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,720
Quickly, I want to show you how easy it is to turn off.

329
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,640
In this view, you see all the dotted lines are our dimension, our construction elements

330
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
that define the constraints.

331
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,680
I just quickly turn those off globally regardless of their level.

332
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm going to grab all the elements on this view here and change their color, graphically.

333
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,240
I just simply go pick a color on the color palette and bingo, there's our colors.

334
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,960
Being dimension-driven, I can modify the dimension itself and as you see, I modify the dimension.

335
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,720
The entire design changes and you'll notice it changes in all the views as well, exactly.

336
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,480
That gives you the power and especially in 3D, this gives you the power to design in

337
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
multiple views.

338
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm going to open a different design file.

339
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,880
I just simply go up and Microstation saves previous design files that I've been in, grab

340
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,920
another one, grab our tags palette, show you that we can modify existing data that's non-graphical

341
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,680
to graphical data.

342
00:20:53,680 --> 00:21:00,160
For example, this is a piece of property, the owner, the lot number and the value.

343
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to pick on the value here and I'm going to change it from 225 to say $250,000.

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,280
As soon as I do that, you'll notice over here, it will change automatically.

345
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,600
You can change text without affecting the graphics and getting into the graphics part

346
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
of it.

347
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,680
Right, but I'm also assigning data to these graphics for GIS, geographical information

348
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
systems purposes.

349
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,840
What else can you do with Microstation?

350
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,440
I'm going to go ahead and go into one additional design file and show you the rendering power

351
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,200
of Microstation.

352
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
You'll see the first thing that comes up is a background bitmap.

353
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,760
We can apply bitmaps to objects and this may be difficult to see at the moment, but we've

354
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,560
got a architectural design here.

355
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,760
I'm going to show you by opening up a smaller view, I'm going to render that for you and

356
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,320
show you our capabilities.

357
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
You can see we have a number of different renderings.

358
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
That's the wire mesh version, you're going to render that drawing now.

359
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,080
I'm going to render it Fong.

360
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
What you'll see is it's going to map some lights.

361
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,360
Right now it's updating each of the individual polygons that we see in the background here

362
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,760
and you'll see the water in the pool actually has a texture map to it so you get a feel

363
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,440
that it's actually rippling water.

364
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,480
We see shadows that are being cast by something that we haven't even put in there yet.

365
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Correct.

366
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,760
The calculation is done so it's displaying the calculation that shadows are available

367
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,480
from these light, skylights that are up here.

368
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
You also see the texture on the walls.

369
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
We have texture mapping.

370
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,040
So it's sort of stuck to the walls we can see there.

371
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Correct.

372
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,440
And the plants that you see in the background are bitmaps with transparency that are applied

373
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,080
to polygons that sit in the background to give your user or your client the ability to

374
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,400
see what their design is going to be like even before it's done.

375
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,840
You'll also see as this window is updated back here that we have translucency.

376
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,960
We're putting a kind of fogged glass in there.

377
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,120
And the thing's fully rendered.

378
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Correct.

379
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
I took about a minute or something.

380
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Approximately a minute.

381
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Yeah.

382
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Normally you would wait a long time to see that render.

383
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Yes.

384
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Exactly.

385
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
We also have the ability to do animations.

386
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,400
I've got an animation loaded here.

387
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,040
This is of a living room and again I'm just going to play that animation.

388
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,560
And you see that we have the fan turning.

389
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
You can do walkthroughs.

390
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
And the shatters and the fans casting.

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Right.

392
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Exactly.

393
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Exactly.

394
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,520
So Microstation is a very powerful CAD environment for multiple disciplines of designing.

395
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,160
And taking advantage of the NT platform.

396
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Absolutely.

397
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
All right.

398
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Thank you very much.

399
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
That is our look at Windows NT.

400
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,000

The 486-based system comes loaded with a suite of Windows applications.

421
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,880
The Omnibook 425 weighs in at 2.9 pounds and runs on four AA batteries.

422
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,400
The IBM PC company is aggressively marketing its PS2 server line by cutting prices by up

423
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,920
to 26 percent.

424

It turns your body movements into on-screen action, allowing you to become the game character

433
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,200
or moving object on the screen.

434
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,560
The Activator works with all Sega Genesis games.

435
