00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
The most resilient parasite is not a bacteria, it's not a virus, it is a thought, and it

00:05.040 --> 00:06.040
shapes everything.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.040
He is an expert on the topic of happiness.

00:09.040 --> 00:13.600
Google made him the head of Google X, the return of a mobile browser.

00:13.600 --> 00:19.040
I know people will hate me when I say this, dating is an entirely an economics problem.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.000
When you don't know what you're looking for, then you're advertising wrong.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.800
How do you find out what you're looking for though?

00:23.800 --> 00:27.120
If you want to find love, it's very straightforward.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.200
In the last line in your book, you say, please find the compassion in your heart to want

00:31.200 --> 00:33.120
happiness for my wonderful son, Ali.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.800
Why did you bring that up?

00:34.800 --> 00:40.280
We were having an easy conversation.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.800
I wrote Soul for Happy at a time where Ali had just left our world and he helped me really,

00:45.800 --> 00:47.680
really figure things out.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.400
We think that this brain is supposed to be there to make us successful.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.880
Your brain is supposed to make you happy.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.960
I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world are...

00:59.960 --> 01:03.400
Without further ado, I'm Stephen Bartlett, and this is The Diary of a CEO.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.400
I hope nobody's listening, but if you are, then please keep this to yourself.

01:07.400 --> 01:17.400
The Return of Mo Gouda

01:17.400 --> 01:21.560
Oh man, no pressure.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.040
I mean, I don't really know what to say.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.920
Our first conversation, as you'll know, as I've said many times to my audience, is still

01:27.920 --> 01:33.160
to this day my favorite podcast episode of all time for so many reasons.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.040
It had everything that I've ever wanted from a conversation.

01:37.040 --> 01:44.280
It had the personal story delivered in a way with immense honesty and vulnerability and

01:44.280 --> 01:45.280
wisdom.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.040
I learnt so much from that conversation, and of all the conversations I've had, whenever

01:49.040 --> 01:52.680
I'm asked wherever I go, I said that that conversation is the conversation that's had

01:52.680 --> 01:58.360
the most profound impact on the real fundamentals of my life than any other.

01:58.360 --> 02:03.800
The words that you said then still show up at pivotal moments in my life when I'm feeling

02:03.800 --> 02:08.440
a certain way or I'm letting something get the best of me, and it's really, really liberated

02:08.440 --> 02:09.440
me of so many things.

02:09.440 --> 02:16.000
So when I heard you were back in London, I had to have another conversation with you.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
It's an honour.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Honestly, thanks for asking.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.160
I have to ask, since we spoke, what's changed in your life?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.760
And how does your life look now?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.360
Ever-changing, interestingly.

02:29.360 --> 02:36.040
I'm on, you know, 2020 was my year of silence and space.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.560
2021 was my year of flow.

02:39.160 --> 02:44.520
And then at the beginning of 2022, I asked myself, what will this year be about?

02:44.520 --> 02:50.800
I take a theme for every year because it's sort of an interesting way to guide your life

02:50.800 --> 02:52.240
in terms of where you want to go.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.600
I don't like targets.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.240
It's too businessy when it comes to your own connection to yourself.

02:58.240 --> 03:04.000
And 2022, I decided it will also be a year of flow, but I called it the year of joy

03:04.000 --> 03:06.080
in flow, which is really interesting.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.640
So to me, believe it or not, as I worked through the years on empowering more of my

03:11.640 --> 03:17.840
feminine side and, you know, creativity, paradoxical thinking, flow, all of those

03:17.840 --> 03:24.440
sometimes appearingly not so disciplined traits are hyper feminine and they're very

03:24.440 --> 03:30.080
valuable in terms of enjoying life, but also seeing the full reality of life, if you want.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.800
I did very well in 2020 with my approach to flow.

03:34.800 --> 03:41.600
I went wherever life wanted me to go, but I was still the same mo, you know, very

03:41.600 --> 03:47.080
targeted, very focused, very able to get the maximum out of everything.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.440
Around that, of course, there has been a lot of interesting repercussions of our

03:53.440 --> 03:59.560
conversation that basically allowed me to write more, to connect more.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.000
I tend to be very personal when it comes to my presence on social media.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.120
So got in touch with so many wonderful people.

04:06.120 --> 04:13.480
And I think that's created waves of flow, if you want, in my life, whereby by end of

04:13.480 --> 04:18.800
April, I packed everything up that I had in Dubai, put it in a tiny little storage

04:18.800 --> 04:22.640
space. I've always been a minimalist anyway, so it wasn't much.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.200
And now I have no idea where I'm going from here, completely in flow.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.160
What does that mean?

04:29.160 --> 04:30.880
You have no idea where you're going from here.

04:30.880 --> 04:36.520
I'm in London because of my book publication until end of the month.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.560
And then.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.560
We'll find out.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.920
There's something quite curious about that, because I think we tend to believe

04:44.920 --> 04:50.560
that we need stability or a home or, I don't know, those home

04:50.560 --> 04:52.040
comforts to make ourselves happy.

04:52.040 --> 04:56.880
So I think about sometimes in my life where I, where I was a freelancer,

04:56.880 --> 04:59.880
kind of like drifting through the world, I could do it for a short period of time.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.400
But in the long term, I ultimately craved that sense of home again.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.720
So I think we need both, right?

05:06.720 --> 05:08.200
I think we need the balance.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.800
I think the story that most of us don't realize is that every one of us

05:11.800 --> 05:14.320
wants an adventure and every one of us wants stability.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.960
Every one of us wants, at the point in time, a long term committed,

05:17.960 --> 05:22.160
wonderful, connected relationship and a little and at other times,

05:22.360 --> 05:28.400
once the parties and the fun and, you know, Russian experience and so on.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.560
And I think context is a big part of what we miss as humans,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.440
that through life, context changes.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.720
OK, and I've been on an interesting journey because, of course,

05:40.040 --> 05:43.880
you can imagine, I have always been extreme in whichever stage

05:43.880 --> 05:48.760
I had been in my life when I, when I became, you know, a business executive.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.480
I was a very serious business executive, you know, the 12, 14 hour days,

05:53.480 --> 05:58.440
the, you know, the constant hopping around the world and so on and so forth.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.760
And when I became an author, I became a very serious author.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.200
You know, I started to really, really spend a lot of hours

06:05.200 --> 06:08.280
not writing and, you know, documenting my, my thoughts.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.200
And I write two or three books at the same time.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.920
When you're extreme in those things, you tend to be quite a bit

06:16.760 --> 06:22.600
blinded, if you want, by the pace, by the detail you're swamped into it.

06:23.080 --> 06:29.720
And it does take does take challenging yourself, if you want,

06:30.160 --> 06:34.920
to get to a point where you say, perhaps, perhaps this was wonderful

06:34.920 --> 06:40.000
for my last seven years of my life, but perhaps, you know, context has changed.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.400
Perhaps I need to explore another part of my life to reach that point

06:44.400 --> 06:45.680
where I feel complete.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.000
And was there something that some kind of signal that life gave you

06:49.000 --> 06:51.080
that said it's time to pack up and flow?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.440
What was that?

06:53.440 --> 06:58.560
For most of us who rush really fast in life, we don't even recognize what we feel.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.520
We don't even even recognize what our hearts, what our souls,

07:02.520 --> 07:04.400
what our bodies are signaling to us.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.200
And and I think there has been a very strong longing in my life

07:10.480 --> 07:13.560
to live that idea of, I call it half monk,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.960
which, you know, it's interesting.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.800
Again, the way we stack life is quite strange.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.800
So you you you we work really, really, really hard for the first 30 or 40 years

07:26.800 --> 07:30.680
of our lives, and then we retire when we can't really enjoy life.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.560
You know, it's like when you retire, you're basically taking your stick

07:33.560 --> 07:36.640
and going to whatever Florida or whatever.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.720
When it's actually the way life should be, is that you probably should

07:41.240 --> 07:44.520
take the 10 years of retirement, divide them across the 40 years

07:44.520 --> 07:46.400
and perhaps take three months off every year.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.760
If if we were to redesign life, you know, it would be wonderful

07:49.760 --> 07:53.200
to work seven months of every year and take three or nine months of every year

07:53.200 --> 07:54.880
and take three months off.

07:54.920 --> 07:59.120
Similarly, you know, if you look even at the spiritual path

07:59.120 --> 08:04.480
of some some of the most renowned monks in the world,

08:04.920 --> 08:08.560
you go through a certain path through life and then you stop completely

08:08.560 --> 08:13.640
and then you call become a monk, you know, for for for a for a while.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.880
And then, you know, you may come back to life or become something else.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.240
And I decided there would be an interesting ambition to

08:22.160 --> 08:25.960
to to investigate the possibility of maybe 50 percent of your life

08:26.040 --> 08:30.120
as a monk and 50 percent as a modern day warrior, as I call it.

08:30.200 --> 08:34.760
Right. And I took the number 50 because that's how mathematicians will work.

08:34.760 --> 08:38.400
I'll start from the midpoint and then, you know, irritate around it.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.280
Maybe I'll end at 60 or whatever.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.840
OK. And it's actually interestingly possible.

08:42.920 --> 08:48.040
It's interestingly possible to spend 50 percent of your days

08:49.040 --> 08:53.920
in in monklike activities, which would be connection, reflection,

08:54.720 --> 08:59.920
you know, some some stillness and silence, some service to the world

09:00.320 --> 09:06.120
and 50 percent completely engaged in, you know, writing, writing,

09:06.120 --> 09:09.720
I consider is a service, but, you know, like business and business

09:09.720 --> 09:13.960
conversations and, you know, coaching and whatever it is else that I do,

09:14.200 --> 09:17.000
being stuck in traffic and so on and so forth. OK.

09:17.400 --> 09:21.080
And it was a stupid ambition, but then it started to become a lot more

09:21.480 --> 09:25.440
viable in my mind that actually I could do that 50 percent of every day,

09:25.440 --> 09:28.520
50 percent of every week, 50 percent of every year

09:29.000 --> 09:30.560
could actually be spent that way.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.080
And then and the thing you need to to make that happen is to step out

09:35.080 --> 09:38.080
of the mainstream of your steady life. OK.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.440
So I had a wonderful conversation with my manager, Munir, who,

09:43.160 --> 09:46.320
you know, really wants our success and the success of the mission.

09:46.320 --> 09:51.000
But that sometimes makes him push me very hard to add stuff in my calendar.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.160
And I said, can you allow me the life of a creative?

09:54.720 --> 09:59.520
So can you cram my Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the point where I start hating you

09:59.960 --> 10:04.000
but then leave my rest of the week free with one day

10:04.320 --> 10:06.760
that is negotiable between us. OK.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.680
And that basically is even better than 50 50.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.320
So in those two days, I'm completely a modern day warrior,

10:13.680 --> 10:17.760
completely engaged in, you know, whatever the modern world wants from me.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.840
But then that allows me the rest of the week, if you want,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.560
to do the other things that may allow me to find and reflect and maybe

10:25.760 --> 10:30.120
maybe figure something out that is so much better for the days where I get

10:30.760 --> 10:34.760
engaged. Right. So if my if my work is to spread some ideas,

10:35.080 --> 10:38.880
then silence to find those ideas is actually useful for it.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.560
And so that was the feeling you said.

10:41.560 --> 10:46.400
What what what was the the signal, the feeling has been there for quite a bit

10:46.400 --> 10:48.680
of time. And then when the landlord said, hey, by the way,

10:48.880 --> 10:51.880
want the apartment back, I was like, great, let's do this.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.160
Let's leave the mainstream. OK.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.880
Let's go somewhere and see where that takes us.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.320
See where where serendipity will will show us.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.280
I think that's an interesting place to be. Are you single?

11:04.560 --> 11:08.160
I am single and not single.

11:08.160 --> 11:14.920
I think I know how that that may get a lot of people judging me.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.680
So I again, in an interesting way,

11:20.200 --> 11:24.800
found that my current lifestyle does not qualify me,

11:25.240 --> 11:27.520
if you want, for a committed relationship.

11:27.920 --> 11:33.320
OK. But that a committed relationship is one specific definition

11:33.840 --> 11:39.760
of relationships that I think our world has stuck to for a period of time

11:39.760 --> 11:43.320
that evolved. OK. There are multiple, multiple,

11:43.320 --> 11:45.440
multiple definitions of relationships today.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.840
I think if you if you look back 20 years, 30 years at most,

11:51.240 --> 11:55.280
you'd realize that that singular traditional model

11:55.600 --> 12:00.760
excluded all same sex relationships, all bisexual relationships,

12:00.760 --> 12:05.560
all this and all of that. It also included it also excluded

12:05.560 --> 12:10.800
relationships that were not till death do us part and so on and so forth.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.240
I found and I say that with.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.120
Worry that people will judge me.

12:17.120 --> 12:20.920
I found that what I'm doing is more important to me at the moment

12:21.760 --> 12:25.440
than a traditional committed relationship.

12:25.800 --> 12:30.520
OK. Simply because I feel that an hour spent

12:31.080 --> 12:37.880
with one person could also be an hour that I spend helping a thousand people.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.080
OK. And even though that hour for me

12:42.440 --> 12:46.360
is definitely enriching and fulfilling and so on and so forth,

12:46.840 --> 12:48.720
it becomes sometimes

12:50.320 --> 12:53.520
the commitment associated with it doesn't make it an hour.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.680
Normally makes it several hours, makes it a big chunk of your life

12:57.680 --> 13:01.040
that I lived for 27 years and loved.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.560
And I would say it's the absolute best way to live all together, right?

13:06.000 --> 13:10.880
But it's definitely not something that from a current phase of my life

13:10.880 --> 13:15.640
where the focus of where I want to put my chips, if you want,

13:15.640 --> 13:18.320
my hours of my life is where I want to be.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
And so I end up when in very, very connected, very deep,

13:23.040 --> 13:26.000
very wonderful and loving relationships

13:26.440 --> 13:30.280
that are super honest, but not lasting.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.560
You know, if my life will take me from here to somewhere else,

13:36.120 --> 13:41.880
I will not consider sticking around here as a prerequisite to find

13:41.880 --> 13:45.440
or, you know, being a prerequisite to find a relationship

13:45.680 --> 13:48.800
more important than my journey of finding where I need to be.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.560
I learned that interestingly when I spoke to my dear friend, Matthew Ricard

13:53.560 --> 13:59.160
on Slow Mo. So Matthew is probably one of the most renowned monks in the world.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.120
He was a PhD in molecular biology, if I remember.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.960
And he quit his life and went and became a monk.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.760
And he had 60,000 hours of lifetime meditation,

14:11.760 --> 14:16.360
which reconfigured his brain in a way that that was publicly

14:16.880 --> 14:18.960
a very, very interesting science study.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.120
He was called the happiest man in the world because of that.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.320
And I asked him and I said, why, Matthew, why, why would you leave your life

14:26.320 --> 14:30.560
and your girlfriend and your, you know, your he was French living in Paris

14:30.560 --> 14:33.800
and your PhD and go and become a monk?

14:33.800 --> 14:37.080
And he he said it would be very unfair

14:38.360 --> 14:43.480
to have someone in my life expect me to be there all the time.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.440
When what I wanted was my pilgrimages and to be next to my teachers

14:48.440 --> 14:54.120
and my time of isolation and my alone time in my hermitage and so on and so forth.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.960
He basically said it's not a promise I can make if I make it, I would be lying.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.680
And I think that probably was a very enlightening moment for me

15:03.680 --> 15:08.920
because there are many things I give up on in my life that would make my life richer.

15:09.880 --> 15:14.000
But they're perhaps not on my path, at least not for the time being.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.920
Is this a do you view that as a phase in your life?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.360
Would you view that as definitely everything is a phase in your life?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.720
Definitely, definitely.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.520
I think that's the changing context.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.400
Steve is probably the biggest failure of humanity.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.640
The changing context is we have a tendency

15:33.640 --> 15:40.720
because we are designed as survival machines to want things to remain exactly the same.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.680
If it's comfortable, if it's safe, let's keep it.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.800
I want my same coffee machine every day because I know that machine.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.320
I know it's really where I can make amazing coffee with it.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.800
And so, of course, when it's time to pack things,

15:56.280 --> 16:00.400
I need it to hug that machine and say, OK, baby, I'm not going to see you for a few months.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.000
But the truth is there are many places all over the world

16:04.000 --> 16:06.480
that will make an amazing coffee, too, right?

16:07.040 --> 16:11.040
That attachment is one of the biggest reasons for unhappiness in life.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.760
It's the idea of I want my glass of water.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.240
I don't want a glass of water.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.480
I want my mug.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.160
I want my glass of water.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.520
I want my streets.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.040
I want my commute every day.

16:24.040 --> 16:28.760
I want my job security and so on and so forth, which is beautiful.

16:28.760 --> 16:34.280
And by the way, every single one of us needs to live that for a phase of our life

16:34.280 --> 16:36.320
for a season, if you want.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
OK.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.880
But the failure to recognize the changing seasons

16:42.720 --> 16:49.040
sometimes results in a narrowness of our life that makes us stick to one path.

16:49.800 --> 16:56.400
When we spoke about you, you started as a CEO of a marketing

16:56.400 --> 16:59.760
very successful business, and now you're a podcast host,

16:59.760 --> 17:02.640
you're an author, you're on Dragonsden and so on and so forth.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.600
That's a recognition within you that this phase

17:06.600 --> 17:10.040
has served its purpose and there is something else I need to do with my life.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.080
And by the way, you could go back to that same phase, right?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.800
You could become a CEO again at a point in time.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.760
And it's that seasonal view of life.

17:19.120 --> 17:24.040
And a big part of flow, you know, where I'm trying to live my life now

17:24.280 --> 17:27.160
is to recognize those seasons, is to say, look,

17:27.800 --> 17:32.040
I had an amazing, amazing woman for 27 years, right?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.160
And I had a family.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.040
I have been there.

17:35.040 --> 17:35.880
I have done that.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.200
I've enjoyed it tremendously.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.880
It enriched my life, but it left gaps behind that need to be fulfilled

17:41.880 --> 17:44.920
or completed with other phases and other seasons.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.680
And I think the game here is to be able to allow yourself

17:51.320 --> 17:55.320
to rather than plan and say my safety, my security, my everything

17:55.560 --> 17:59.240
to allow yourself to sit back and say, where is what's life saying?

17:59.720 --> 18:01.760
Is life hinting that I should be in London?

18:02.440 --> 18:03.640
I can be in London.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.920
Let me be in London.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.120
Right? Let's see.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.120
Maybe at the end of that season, nothing's going to happen.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.400
You're going to go like, oh, it was just very good coffee

18:11.400 --> 18:13.560
and a conversation with Steven, right?

18:14.040 --> 18:17.520
And and it could be that, you know, oh, my God, it was the best coffee

18:17.520 --> 18:20.720
of my life and the best conversation I ever had, right?

18:21.080 --> 18:24.800
And and I think that wisdom, if you want,

18:26.280 --> 18:28.240
it depends on if you're spiritual or not.

18:28.240 --> 18:32.120
If if you believe that there is a part to you that is not physical,

18:32.560 --> 18:36.240
call it consciousness or call it a soul, if you're spiritual.

18:37.080 --> 18:42.600
That part is senses, things that are a little bit beyond the limitations

18:42.600 --> 18:47.080
of the physical day, it might sense, you know, a need for the rest of being

18:47.080 --> 18:51.000
someone else somewhere that may benefit from my presence in London

18:51.000 --> 18:55.560
or maybe a need in within me to get a little bit of rain,

18:55.560 --> 18:56.760
which I hadn't seen for a while.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.960
I don't know, right?

18:58.000 --> 19:02.920
And if the way the way that other part of you communicates to you

19:02.920 --> 19:08.440
is through intuition, it cannot plant a text message in your head

19:08.440 --> 19:11.560
and say, by the way, by the four teens, you need to be in London.

19:11.880 --> 19:17.800
It just gets you gives you that feeling of something is missing from here

19:17.800 --> 19:20.800
and something needs to be attended to there.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.200
Do you want to investigate?

19:23.200 --> 19:27.240
And I found from the spiritual teachers and happiness teachers

19:27.240 --> 19:30.200
and actually business teachers that I worked with in my life

19:30.840 --> 19:34.400
that those who are able who are able to go like, let me find out.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.400
OK, let me find out.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.440
Let me check this out.

19:38.440 --> 19:44.400
Normally, stumble upon some of the biggest changes to our lives,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.440
all of us, not just their lives.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.960
And, you know, and it's it's quite interesting because

19:51.080 --> 19:53.840
if you really look back at your life, really,

19:54.320 --> 19:57.440
most of the events that actually shaped you,

19:57.440 --> 20:00.560
that actually changed your lives were not planned at all.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.200
You know, there probably were always those surprises

20:04.200 --> 20:07.560
and often were the surprises you didn't want. OK.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.440
And then somehow you go through with them and you end up in a place

20:11.440 --> 20:14.240
that suddenly you recognize and go like, ah,

20:14.880 --> 20:17.280
that's why I've been walking for the last 14 days.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.640
And by the way, the game in my view, I say life is a quest.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.280
It's not a journey. OK.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.480
And the difference between a journey and a quest

20:25.480 --> 20:28.840
is when you're on a journey, you've sort of plotted your path.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.640
OK, I'm going to take that flight.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.680
I'm going to go to this place.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.160
I'm going to stay in that hotel.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.360
It's a journey. Right.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.920
And it will eventually end up in a destination. Right.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.440
A quest is very different.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.880
A quest is Christopher Columbus taking a crew on a ship

20:42.200 --> 20:45.440
and in the middle of the, you know, fog,

20:46.320 --> 20:49.800
not knowing where the new world really is. OK.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
That's a quest.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.440
You know, you don't really know where the destination is.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.720
You're basically taking a couple of steps forward

20:57.080 --> 20:59.520
and then stopping and then looking at the fog

20:59.520 --> 21:02.040
and then assessing and then reflecting and then saying,

21:02.640 --> 21:06.000
maybe I should take a step left and then you take one step left.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.240
And then you say, OK, how does it feel now?

21:08.240 --> 21:11.160
Do I want to go forward again or do I want to go one step back?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.640
And by the way, there's absolutely nothing wrong

21:13.640 --> 21:16.400
with taking two steps forward, assessing going to the left.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.640
And then saying, left wasn't what I was supposed to do.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.480
I'll go back and take a step to the right and see what happens.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.280
But like Christopher Columbus, you you set off on your quest.

21:28.720 --> 21:33.120
I'm sure as Christopher Columbus did for a reason,

21:33.440 --> 21:36.400
you wouldn't load up the ship and put all those men on the ship

21:36.400 --> 21:37.160
and get a boat.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.680
And there has to be some kind of inspiration

21:39.680 --> 21:41.440
or some kind of reason why you set off.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.520
That's the question I want to ask, but I was also compelled by

21:44.520 --> 21:46.440
you said you were in the relationship for twenty eight years

21:46.440 --> 21:49.120
and eventually there's something missing.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.840
Yeah, there's always there is always something missing.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.080
What was what was missing?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.520
So let's talk about the big picture first,

21:58.520 --> 22:01.040
because I think people need to understand that there's nothing

22:01.040 --> 22:02.800
wrong with having anything missing.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.040
OK, but we are a very complex being

22:07.040 --> 22:11.280
that is made up of so many emotions and so many reflections

22:11.280 --> 22:16.160
and so many traumas and so many stories and backgrounds and desires.

22:16.880 --> 22:22.960
And we live in a very, very, very, very unsimplifiable world.

22:23.400 --> 22:28.560
OK, and yet we try to simplify it rather than try to enjoy it fully.

22:29.360 --> 22:34.280
OK, when you when they tell you sweet and sour chicken in a Chinese restaurant,

22:35.400 --> 22:37.960
it's not just a little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.080
There is a ton of flavor happening within all of this.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.040
OK, there is there are layers of complexity

22:44.040 --> 22:45.920
that creates a life that's worth living.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.400
And for all for every one of us, it's that attachment.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.640
It's the attachment of but I like this.

22:52.640 --> 22:57.400
I don't want to change this that deprives us of all of the other flavors, right?

22:57.680 --> 23:01.480
Nibel and I, I believe Nibel made me my my ex-wife.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.680
She we met when she was 18 in university.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.480
We fell in love madly.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.040
We got married the day she finished university.

23:12.040 --> 23:17.840
You know, we spent 22 years together with our beautiful children.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.680
And then life changed context.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.760
The context changed.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.960
Ali left our world, my son.

23:24.960 --> 23:29.480
And when Ali left our world, I hit the pedals and went double speed.

23:30.040 --> 23:34.400
When Ali left our left our world, Nibel, on the other hand, looked at her life

23:34.400 --> 23:37.920
and said, for the first time, I can now focus on me.

23:38.560 --> 23:44.720
My my children left one went to university in Canada, and Ali left the world

23:44.720 --> 23:46.200
to his next journey.

23:46.200 --> 23:50.840
And, you know, simply she she looked at herself and said, OK, it's my time.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.560
I'm not going to define my life by you anymore.

23:54.560 --> 23:58.360
I can't travel the world with you because of your passion

23:58.360 --> 24:03.640
and your mission and what you've now assigned yourself as the new task.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.480
I'm going to find what I want to do with my life.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.280
And I think that's wonderful.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.720
If you if you ask me, that's definitely what everyone should do.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.480
Now, with that contradiction, we became further and further apart.

24:17.480 --> 24:23.040
Remember, love and relationships are not ever taken for granted.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.240
I always say this openly.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.240
I fell in love with Nibel six times.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.640
OK, I fell in love with that cute girl that I met in university.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.800
Then I fell in love again when she became my wife, because when you're

24:36.480 --> 24:39.040
your girlfriend and your wife, you're two different people.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.640
And by the way, I was her boyfriend and her husband.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.800
These are two different people, too.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.400
And now suddenly we're left with those boyfriend, girlfriend gone

24:47.600 --> 24:51.280
and the husband and wife looking at each other and saying, where's my sweetheart?

24:51.840 --> 24:55.640
Right. And then suddenly, you know, most people would get into that stage

24:55.640 --> 25:01.040
in one of those constant changes and and say, hey, you know, I don't like this.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.960
I want my sweetheart back, you know, it's an attachment.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.720
Or you can go like, OK, the sweetheart is gone, but oh, my God, this one is so cute.

25:10.240 --> 25:14.360
Right. And when when you actually see it that way, you fall in love again

25:14.360 --> 25:15.880
with a totally different person.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.880
And then again and then again, I believe I counted six times.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.840
OK. And then eventually, when we wanted to to have our different

25:25.760 --> 25:31.080
focuses in life, I would call that falling in love again, but slightly differently

25:31.520 --> 25:38.400
because you see that the thing that we mess in life is we define love.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.680
Love is too big, if you ask me, as a concept to fit within romance.

25:45.240 --> 25:50.040
OK, we've we've narrowed love down to that story that Hollywood told us,

25:50.520 --> 25:52.640
which is love is just romance.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.600
OK, it's a it's a romantic relationship between two people.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.960
It has intimacy in it and it has to be this and that.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.040
And they have to live that way. OK.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.880
The truth is, no, I believe there are 20 ways two partners can enjoy

26:06.880 --> 26:09.840
and benefit from the company of each other and grow together,

26:10.800 --> 26:12.720
two of which are sex and intimacy.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.560
And we've defined love

26:15.560 --> 26:18.320
per as per sex and intimacy. OK.

26:18.560 --> 26:23.080
So if she if she's not your woman, as in as in your sleeping together,

26:23.400 --> 26:25.720
does that end the love in any way? OK.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.120
You know, as a matter of fact, if if it ends the love,

26:29.120 --> 26:32.040
then it was never love if you really think about it.

26:32.640 --> 26:38.520
And so we we define our our relationships that way.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.280
And I think that's a recipe for disappointment,

26:41.320 --> 26:46.800
because in reality, every every relationship will always go through those changes.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.600
There will be times where sex won't be great and there will be other times

26:50.600 --> 26:52.600
when your spiritual connection is at its best.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.720
And, you know, it really is entirely around again, the layers and the flavors

26:57.720 --> 27:01.720
and how you can choose each one of those and embrace it and grow it

27:01.720 --> 27:07.800
and and and make it a prominent and live it as much as you can with that person.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.600
And yeah, if if one of them ends,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.520
my feeling is that the rest should not end, the rest should grow.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.240
You more than anyone now, after those 20 plus years of being

27:19.240 --> 27:22.880
in a committed relationship will understand the value of that committed relationship

27:22.880 --> 27:27.920
and the place that it would I'm presuming add value to your life now.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.680
But I guess there's an equation you're doing about what you would

27:31.880 --> 27:33.280
what would come at the expense of that.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.720
And it sounds like from my perspective,

27:35.720 --> 27:38.440
the thing that would come at the expense of that is your mission,

27:38.680 --> 27:44.160
your freedom, which you are also spending some time to really indulge in.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.640
No, I'm as I think I think we all make those choices all the time.

27:48.640 --> 27:53.320
It just suddenly becomes quite contentious when it's about love and relationship.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.400
OK, but you know what?

27:55.400 --> 27:58.240
You know, I left an apartment that I enjoyed

27:59.000 --> 28:01.680
because I needed to do something else, right?

28:01.880 --> 28:07.320
I am here in London, where when I could be in Silicon Valley, for example,

28:07.320 --> 28:09.840
because they wanted me to talk about innovation there,

28:09.840 --> 28:14.520
because I need to be in London because I want my next book to succeed, right?

28:14.800 --> 28:20.440
So so we we all make those, you know, choices all the time.

28:21.120 --> 28:26.040
And and life, sadly, is a question of compromise,

28:26.520 --> 28:32.360
because, you know, you you you often say that the best of both worlds doesn't happen.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.600
You can't you cannot have best of both worlds.

28:34.600 --> 28:40.760
You can you can either say I'm living fully as my number one priority to achieve a

28:40.760 --> 28:44.880
and I'll achieve as much as I can of B, as long as it doesn't contradict A.

28:45.200 --> 28:49.560
Or you can say I'll go for B and, you know, I'll sacrifice a bit of A for that.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.560
Right. And and it's interesting because most people,

28:53.560 --> 28:57.600
especially the romantics, will say, how can you sacrifice love?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.640
You know, love is the most important.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.800
No, a billion happy is more important than love,

29:02.520 --> 29:04.840
in all honesty, for me, in my to my personal love.

29:05.120 --> 29:10.600
OK, because in my capacity to to feel love for a billion people,

29:10.920 --> 29:17.600
OK, and and actually try and dedicate my life to as many as I can reach with that.

29:18.240 --> 29:23.800
I tend to believe that's that prioritizing my own comforts and my own life

29:23.800 --> 29:30.360
and my own settlement, if you want, being settled is selfish, to be honest.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.800
It's it's a different phase.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.200
It hopefully will happen in two, three years time, but it's not the phase now.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.800
It's not the right time for it at all. OK.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.120
And yes, I wish I could get get get A and B.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.120
And maybe I'll stumble upon that wonderful woman

29:45.480 --> 29:49.880
that is completely aligned and, you know, spends that that my trips with me

29:49.880 --> 29:52.320
and, you know, supports this.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.080
And if I do, that's amazing.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.480
But if I don't, what would I prioritize?

29:56.480 --> 29:58.440
It's life is a question of choices.

29:59.400 --> 30:03.920
You could be doing anything with your time, you know, you're you're clearly

30:03.920 --> 30:06.840
someone that is being very intentional about the use of your time

30:06.840 --> 30:11.480
and making sure that every hour of your time is allocated towards

30:11.960 --> 30:15.800
what you want, whether that is playing video games, whether it is writing a book.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.760
So why did you choose to write a book called That Little Voice in Your Head?

30:21.160 --> 30:25.080
I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world

30:26.280 --> 30:32.040
without competition beyond that, like they are by far bigger than all of the others are

30:32.560 --> 30:35.640
ego, lack of self-love.

30:35.640 --> 30:40.000
And actually, in order, it would be lack of self-love, ego and that little voice

30:40.000 --> 30:41.840
in your head. OK.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.640
And the little voice in your head, as I as I say at the beginning of the book,

30:47.000 --> 30:52.520
that I would dare say that there has never been a moment in your life

30:52.880 --> 30:57.840
where any event had the power to make you unhappy

30:58.200 --> 31:00.560
until you turned it into a thought. OK.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.880
So so anything could happen.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.520
It's the story you tell yourself about it that makes you unhappy.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.120
It's not the event. It's the story. Right.

31:09.560 --> 31:15.440
And so if my if I'm true to my commitment to try and make the world happier,

31:15.680 --> 31:19.600
then I need to talk about those three topics in three different books

31:19.600 --> 31:22.240
if you if you want, or maybe some content of some form.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.720
But but that's not the point.

31:23.720 --> 31:27.640
The point is what's tagged, what's what struck me and really, really puzzled me

31:28.000 --> 31:31.640
was that I realized when I wrote Scary Smart

31:32.080 --> 31:34.680
and, you know, Scary Smart was entirely about technology

31:34.680 --> 31:36.840
and where technology is going and so on.

31:36.840 --> 31:42.280
I realized that we humans have the ultimate technology in our heads,

31:42.560 --> 31:47.200
a brain that is so sophisticated, so capable of doing things that are

31:47.560 --> 31:51.400
really, really beyond the capacity of any supercomputer still today.

31:52.120 --> 31:56.360
And yet we know how to use our smartphones and our devices

31:56.360 --> 31:58.680
better than we know how to use that brain.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.560
Most people get trained on how to use Excel,

32:01.920 --> 32:06.800
but they never really get trained on how to streamline the thoughts in their head.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.520
OK. And and that appeared to me to be a very interesting

32:11.760 --> 32:13.360
engineering problem.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.960
And so the idea was to create that analogy between neuroscience and computer science.

32:18.320 --> 32:22.600
So the book in my mind was if I can show people that those brains,

32:22.600 --> 32:26.640
the neuroscience of them is is actually similar, very analogous

32:26.640 --> 32:29.280
to computer science and the devices you have in your hand,

32:29.720 --> 32:32.160
because people already know how to use those devices,

32:32.160 --> 32:36.800
then that knowledge would allow them to use the brain as good as they use the devices.

32:37.760 --> 32:42.160
The basics here, which is the title of the first chapter of your book.

32:42.760 --> 32:46.320
And it feels like the first chapter really kind of introduces some of the

32:46.600 --> 32:49.400
inspiration behind why you wrote the book.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.800
You talk a lot about your wife and the illusions that you live under.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.360
What are the illusions that you you live under?

32:57.320 --> 32:59.080
Or you lived under?

32:59.080 --> 33:02.000
Again, let's think about the bigger picture first.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.720
Everything that we have, you haven't visited and investigated

33:06.520 --> 33:09.840
and arrived at a competent, confident

33:11.080 --> 33:13.160
conviction that this is your own view.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.800
Is probably an illusion, OK, which is quite striking

33:18.200 --> 33:23.080
because for a man like me, who spends a lot of his time reflecting,

33:24.040 --> 33:26.840
we're surrounded, we're submerged in illusions.

33:27.120 --> 33:31.720
OK, everything from the value of, you know, a branded bag

33:31.720 --> 33:35.520
all the way to, you know, what the TV is telling us,

33:35.520 --> 33:38.280
what the government is supposed to do and all of that stuff.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.160
Unless you've reflected on it and said, OK, I'm being told this,

33:44.480 --> 33:48.640
I'm, you know, behaving this way, which might be contradicting

33:48.760 --> 33:52.800
what I've been told, but I'm feeling that way, which might be a third contradiction.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.560
And where is my reality?

33:54.560 --> 33:56.440
It's safe to assume that this was an illusion.

33:56.440 --> 34:00.800
So a big part of that little voice in your head is an admission

34:00.800 --> 34:04.240
of all of the mistakes I made using that machine in my life.

34:04.240 --> 34:08.320
Or not all, but many, not even many, but many mistakes

34:08.320 --> 34:10.800
that I've made using this machine, not all of them.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.120
There are many more mistakes.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.640
One, I think the biggest of them was a conviction in my early years

34:17.920 --> 34:19.680
that my kids were a burden.

34:19.680 --> 34:25.240
My family was a responsibility, OK, which does happen when they come

34:25.240 --> 34:26.560
to life when you're very young.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.080
I mean, I had Ali when I was 25.

34:29.080 --> 34:36.440
I was just turned 26 and and and you know, I got married when I was 25.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.400
So basically you start to feel responsible.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.600
You start to prioritize work.

34:42.600 --> 34:46.800
You start to go out in that treadmill, you know, the hedonic treadmill

34:46.800 --> 34:49.160
and just run, run, run, run, run, run, OK.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.560
And the pressure that you that you put on yourself when you do that

34:54.000 --> 34:59.200
makes you start to think, OK, they are the reason why I'm working so hard.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.080
They are the reason why I'm stressed. OK.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.120
When in reality, if you had asked them, they would have said,

35:05.120 --> 35:07.320
Papa, just come play with us, right?

35:07.480 --> 35:09.760
We don't want more than what we have.

35:10.120 --> 35:15.000
It's me losing context and running like crazy that made me think that way.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.640
And the basics of the challenges we have with our brains

35:19.360 --> 35:22.800
is that we believe what our brains tell us. OK.

35:22.960 --> 35:27.640
So when my brain tell me they are the the the burden, they are the challenge.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.880
My whole being responds to that.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.600
My whole being starts to behave that way. OK.

35:33.200 --> 35:38.000
And and I think what the reality that we miss when we do those things

35:38.320 --> 35:41.160
becomes what you have seen in that.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.040
If you if you like the movie Inception,

35:44.160 --> 35:48.080
you know, when she when his wife had that

35:49.520 --> 35:53.320
thought, you know, we're waiting for a train or train, you know,

35:53.320 --> 35:57.320
basically that kept playing in her head over and over and over

35:57.560 --> 36:01.280
that convinced her that this is not the real world, that they are in a dream

36:01.280 --> 36:03.200
and that the way to go out of it is to die.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.920
That actually led her to committing suicide.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.280
And and and, you know, big opening of the movie that my favorite movie line

36:10.280 --> 36:13.560
of all time is what is the most resilient parasite.

36:13.920 --> 36:16.760
OK. And the most resilient parasite is not a bacteria.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.320
It's not a virus.

36:18.320 --> 36:22.000
It is a thought that you implant deep in your brain

36:22.320 --> 36:25.440
and believe in it over and over and over through your life.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.000
And it shapes everything, shapes everything.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.520
Interestingly, without you even knowing why you're doing what you're doing

36:33.520 --> 36:36.640
is because because of that thought, because of that belief,

36:36.640 --> 36:41.160
because of that ideology and people do the weirdest things.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.880
I have a very, very dear friend who's a brilliant engineer,

36:44.880 --> 36:48.600
brilliant engineer who had that thought in his head.

36:49.720 --> 36:55.560
He's now in his early 60s, but that's if I tell my ideas to a businessman,

36:56.160 --> 36:57.760
he's going to steal it.

36:57.760 --> 37:02.160
So every startup he ever attempted, he wanted to be the engineer and the CEO.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.520
OK. And as a result, everything he started failed,

37:05.920 --> 37:10.120
even though the ideas and the engineering, the the rigor was incredible.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.360
But he just couldn't get that idea out of his mind.

37:13.520 --> 37:18.080
And you can go all the way to people who have ideas that lead to wars

37:18.080 --> 37:20.800
or to destruction or to terrorist acts or whatever.

37:21.040 --> 37:24.520
It's just one idea seeded deep enough in our head

37:24.880 --> 37:31.400
that really leads us to become who we are and digging out that idea and finding it.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.000
That's the basic.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.360
The basic is to find those thoughts and how you can deal with them

37:37.360 --> 37:41.360
so that you eradicate them so that you can actually live through to who you are,

37:41.680 --> 37:43.720
not the thoughts that have been implanted in your brain.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.200
And how does one go about even knowing

37:47.240 --> 37:50.840
where to start that search for those sort of limiting or imprisoning thoughts

37:50.840 --> 37:54.640
that have become the satellite navigation of our lives?

37:55.040 --> 37:57.720
It is it's a moment of truth.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.160
It's a moment of honesty.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.800
You know, I think you started with that very.

38:02.680 --> 38:06.400
I can't believe I spoke about that about the very personal question

38:06.400 --> 38:08.840
about my relationship choices, right?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.640
But that's a moment of truth.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.120
It's not that I don't want someone in my life,

38:13.400 --> 38:16.280
but it's that if that's someone contradicts priority A,

38:16.640 --> 38:19.400
then priority A is actually what I stand for, right?

38:19.720 --> 38:23.600
And you get those by comparing what you're thinking.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.840
To what you actually do and what you actually feel.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.440
And it's a very interesting exercise if you're coherent in something.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.560
If you say I am vegan, for example, OK,

38:35.920 --> 38:38.640
if if you identify yourself as vegan,

38:39.240 --> 38:42.200
but you crave eating animal protein

38:42.760 --> 38:46.920
and you feel that you're pressured, then you're not a vegan.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.800
OK, you could be a striving vegan.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.080
You're trying to be vegan.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.160
You could be an ideologist vegan.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.040
You want you believe in the ideology of veganism,

38:56.040 --> 38:59.200
but you're not don't call yourself I am a vegan.

38:59.320 --> 39:03.640
OK, you can then change that thought and say, I want to be vegan.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.800
OK, that's a different thought than I am vegan.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.800
And you can apply that to everything, to every part of your life.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.160
I am in that partnership.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.360
I love her and I want to stay with her forever.

39:16.080 --> 39:20.680
But I'm looking at every other woman and I feel that I am in jail.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.800
OK, great. Have that conversation with yourself.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.760
Have that conversation with yourself

39:26.760 --> 39:29.000
because what you're feeling is contradicting.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.120
What you're doing is contradicting what you're thinking.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
So much of my life is filled with contradicting.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.840
Absolutely.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.800
What does that say?

39:36.800 --> 39:40.480
So I'm thinking about, you know, I say that I want to be in a committed relationship,

39:40.840 --> 39:46.640
but then I what I do is work all the time

39:46.840 --> 39:50.160
and want to work all the time and choose work all the time.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.920
So what does that mean?

39:53.920 --> 39:54.920
What does that mean?

39:54.920 --> 39:56.520
You can tell me on camera.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.840
I'm not going to cry.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.360
It is. It's it's really it is look, you're not alone.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.160
All of us are and it's not one topic.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.760
It's on every topic. OK.

40:04.760 --> 40:08.520
So so there are, as I always talk about, there are three compartments in our brains.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.720
OK, one compartment is what I call compartment one,

40:11.720 --> 40:14.400
which are things that are true and we know are true. OK.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.440
The other is compartment three, which are things that are that are not true

40:18.440 --> 40:19.720
and we know they're not true.

40:19.720 --> 40:22.560
OK, and the majority of what's happening inside us

40:23.040 --> 40:26.400
is what I call compartment two, which are things that are undecided.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.080
We either don't know them or we know that they're not aligned,

40:30.080 --> 40:32.320
but we can live with them for now. We don't prioritize them.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.920
What matters is not solving them.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.080
What matters is marking them as compartment two.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.000
If you mark them as compartment two in your head, you go like, OK, hold on.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.040
This topic is unresolved.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.040
It's not within my priority today, but I need to come back to that topic

40:47.320 --> 40:50.640
just as just like my choice of relationships. Right.

40:51.080 --> 40:54.280
You know, it takes a long time and a lot of experimenting

40:54.280 --> 40:58.320
after my separation with my with my wife to try and get to a point

40:58.320 --> 41:02.400
where I actually know that I'm going to put in the time

41:02.400 --> 41:05.000
and investigate where I am in life.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.840
During throughout that time, I acknowledge to myself and I say,

41:08.840 --> 41:11.680
this is compartment two. I don't know what I want. I don't.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.280
Right. And the point is so many of those exist.

41:15.680 --> 41:20.000
If you live assuming that it's compartment one, you're completely messed up.

41:20.640 --> 41:24.040
Right. Because your actions are not matching your your your feelings

41:24.040 --> 41:26.240
and your feelings are not matching your thoughts.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.240
OK, you're not you're not complete.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.160
You're not full. You're not settled.

41:31.160 --> 41:35.720
You know, we, you know, that that idea of equilibrium.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.640
Most people, the easiest way to imagine it

41:39.520 --> 41:42.040
visually is to imagine a pendulum. Right.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.920
If your life is in equilibrium, it's in total balance.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.160
That total balance is the point at which

41:50.760 --> 41:52.720
minimal effort is needed to live.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.560
If you're in balance, you're not struggling.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.000
OK, just like the pendulum, the pendulum, when it's at

41:58.000 --> 42:01.840
at its equilibrium point, you literally need zero force

42:01.840 --> 42:03.960
to keep it in the equilibrium point forever.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.680
You don't have to apply any force to it.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.960
You want to push it a little bit to the right.

42:07.960 --> 42:11.520
You have to apply a force and keep that force for as long as you

42:11.520 --> 42:13.480
you wanted to stay within that place.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.760
And that's what we do with our lives all the time, that our nature,

42:16.760 --> 42:21.080
our balance, our equilibrium is not exactly how we're living.

42:21.320 --> 42:25.280
And so we're constantly applying effort, constantly trying to be in a place

42:26.000 --> 42:28.680
that is not our natural place to be.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.080
We want to be there, so we apply the effort.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.760
Is there anything wrong with that?

42:32.760 --> 42:35.280
Absolutely not, because life is cyclical. OK.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.720
And life is all compromises as we start.

42:37.720 --> 42:42.520
But the trick is to say, when I am in that place,

42:43.480 --> 42:46.920
I am aware that this place is not my natural tendency.

42:47.200 --> 42:51.920
And I am OK with that because that place gives me a B and C.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.000
There is a utility to that place.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.200
At the same time, I want to tell myself openly

42:58.400 --> 43:01.400
that I'm heading from that place to that point of equilibrium.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.280
Could that could be by saying, in the next seven years,

43:05.280 --> 43:07.640
I'm not going to do anything about it, but in seven years time,

43:07.800 --> 43:09.600
I'm going to start to head in that equilibrium.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.520
Or you could say, I'm going to take a step every day

43:11.520 --> 43:13.480
and for the next seven years, whichever way you want.

43:13.960 --> 43:17.920
And or you, by the way, or you can also tell yourself, I don't care.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.480
I know it's not my equilibrium, but I'm going to do it anyway,

43:21.480 --> 43:22.920
because that's what I believe in.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.160
I think that's very much at the state I'm in.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.840
If you ask me, I'd like to be in, you know,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.080
50 percent of the year doing absolutely nothing, OK,

43:32.240 --> 43:36.160
with someone I absolutely love with a very simple life.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.280
But that's not my life every day.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.080
And I know that to be true, and I will do it for a while to go.

43:41.600 --> 43:45.280
You know, because I have, I have assigned myself something

43:45.280 --> 43:48.280
that I believe requires that effort.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.760
OK, the other thing that humans do, most of us,

43:52.120 --> 43:56.360
is we leave a lot of pendulums out of equilibrium.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.640
So so it's actually quite easy to tell yourself, look,

43:59.640 --> 44:02.320
my number one pendulum is my work.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.800
OK, I'm going to put that in equilibrium.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.400
Then my second, you know,

44:09.280 --> 44:12.520
pendulum in importance is relationship or reverse them if you want.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.240
The third is my impact.

44:14.240 --> 44:16.080
The fourth is my friendships.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.120
The fifth is my health and so on.

44:18.120 --> 44:22.360
And then the game is if you want your work to actually benefit,

44:22.760 --> 44:26.680
put the others in equilibrium, OK, or acknowledge to yourself

44:26.680 --> 44:28.680
that they're not, but don't complain about it.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.560
Don't feel bad about it. OK.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.400
And if you do that, you manage to then simply focus yourself

44:34.400 --> 44:36.120
on the one that is your most priority.

44:36.120 --> 44:40.400
And then life is in an interesting way, linear that way in physics.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.880
It's basically it's instead of the parallel processing

44:42.880 --> 44:45.040
of trying to fix all of them at the same time.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.520
You're simply saying, I'm going to process them in series.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.440
I'm going to fix this work element pendulum first.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.520
And when it's done, I'll fix the next one.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.200
And then when it's done, I'll fix the next one.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.520
And it's a constant journey.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.760
So you're not alone.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.720
I'm exactly like you constantly, constantly searching

45:00.720 --> 45:04.920
and constantly reflecting and investigating and finding that equilibrium.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.800
Just going back to something you said there about what you'd probably want.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.560
Is it a case that you don't believe you could live a life

45:11.560 --> 45:16.400
where you have priority of your mission, one one billion happy?

45:17.600 --> 45:23.320
And a partner who is is not impeding on the mission?

45:23.800 --> 45:26.400
No, absolutely not. I believe it's 100 percent possible.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.680
Just not met the person yet. Absolutely. OK.

45:28.680 --> 45:32.360
OK. The economics of love and romance are quite shocking.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.640
Most people don't understand how that works.

45:34.640 --> 45:38.160
You know, if you have if you have one requirement in the if you have zero

45:38.160 --> 45:40.440
requirements in the person that you need in your life,

45:41.720 --> 45:43.440
walk out of your door.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.040
The first person that you meet is that person, right?

45:46.040 --> 45:51.000
Because you have zero of anything that this person is is OK for you.

45:51.480 --> 45:55.800
If you have one requirement and and say one of every ten people

45:55.960 --> 45:59.960
in the world has that requirement, OK, bring that. Yeah.

46:00.560 --> 46:04.480
Yeah, or something deeper, you know, let's start, you know, I am straight.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.640
So I need a woman, OK, that by definition removes 50 percent of the population.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.040
Yeah. OK.

46:10.040 --> 46:15.200
I am, you know, I need a certain age bracket in my life that by by by itself

46:15.440 --> 46:19.000
removes maybe 70 percent of the remaining population and so on.

46:19.240 --> 46:22.040
So every layer that you add to your requirements,

46:22.560 --> 46:25.400
sadly, follows the n squared problem. OK.

46:25.600 --> 46:31.080
So the n squared problem is if you're looking for a person with one criteria

46:32.080 --> 46:34.440
and one in every 10 persons have that.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.320
If you add another layer of criteria, it's not one in 20.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.920
It's one in 100.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.360
If you add a third criteria, it's one in a thousand.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.600
If you add a third or fourth criteria, it's one in 10,000.

46:47.960 --> 46:51.040
Right. So it's it's constantly 10 to the power of. Right.

46:51.440 --> 46:56.600
Now, if if you take anything that you want, I'm I'm looking for someone,

46:56.600 --> 46:59.600
for example, supportive of my mission and free to travel.

47:00.400 --> 47:08.080
Whatever that is, if if that person is, you know, is described by six criteria,

47:08.520 --> 47:11.560
you're now talking about one in 100,000.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.760
Do they exist? Absolutely.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.920
Absolutely. 100 percent.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.680
Do I have the time to spend looking for one in 100,000?

47:20.320 --> 47:22.040
I don't. I do.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.720
But it's not my priority.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.000
Do you understand? And we do that with everything in life.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.640
You you invest in your six pack.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.120
I invest in my little belly, right?

47:31.520 --> 47:38.160
Why? Because for you, the ability to prioritize the six pack at your age

47:38.160 --> 47:41.960
with your current, you know, lifestyle and so on is actually

47:42.120 --> 47:46.640
taking a certain amount of investment from you that's justifiable by the ROI.

47:47.320 --> 47:50.360
OK. For me, if I wanted to achieve your six pack,

47:50.760 --> 47:54.360
I'd probably take double the time, maybe double the effort, right?

47:54.560 --> 47:57.880
And at the same time, I would require a lifetime that has a lifestyle

47:57.880 --> 48:02.360
that has a consistency in it, that I may not be able to to achieve now.

48:03.080 --> 48:07.400
And you look at it and you go like, damn you, Steve, I want a six pack.

48:07.720 --> 48:11.520
But then at the same time, I tell myself, but damn, you know,

48:11.560 --> 48:15.640
you're traveling everywhere and you're really, really, really being true to yourself.

48:16.080 --> 48:18.160
That's fine. It's a reasonable compromise.

48:18.800 --> 48:23.160
So the question just to be very specific, everything exists.

48:23.720 --> 48:27.600
But the probabilities of them happening, if I'm the luckiest

48:27.600 --> 48:32.560
person on earth, OK, I would walk out of here and she's the first person I meet,

48:32.840 --> 48:37.040
right? But if you count that and say, no, reasonable probability,

48:37.040 --> 48:42.160
you will say you'd have to encounter 50,000 encounters for that person to show up.

48:42.400 --> 48:45.600
If you're unlucky, not unlucky and not lucky, right?

48:45.720 --> 48:47.840
Suddenly, it starts to become interesting.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.240
You tell yourself, and I know this sounds really weird for the romantics.

48:51.240 --> 48:56.600
By the way, I am completely a love, you know, junkie.

48:57.440 --> 49:01.840
But but there is a reality to life that sometimes gets you to prioritize things

49:01.840 --> 49:04.680
differently. It's really interesting, because I've never had anybody describe it

49:04.680 --> 49:07.160
in like a mathematical way before.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.600
Yeah, so there is mathematics underlying everything.

49:11.600 --> 49:15.600
I mean, think about that idea of one in a hundred thousand, right?

49:15.640 --> 49:18.000
The mathematics of that, it's true.

49:18.040 --> 49:22.440
When you see the mathematics, it doesn't mean that you have to act in a way

49:22.440 --> 49:26.280
that's not human, but it just allows you to understand how the system is working

49:26.280 --> 49:27.360
so that you can fit in.

49:27.360 --> 49:31.080
So the example I gave is if you're into Shelby Cobra's, right?

49:31.280 --> 49:36.080
If you want to sell that one car among a million other cars on a site,

49:37.120 --> 49:41.480
that million other that car will have very little chance of being found on a

49:41.480 --> 49:46.040
general site. But for the fans of a Shelby Cobra, if you go to a show

49:46.040 --> 49:50.600
of Shelby Cobra's, everyone there, 100 percent of the people there are interested

49:50.600 --> 49:54.640
in it. OK, so the interesting bit is that you can actually increase your

49:54.640 --> 49:58.280
probability of being found quite a lot if you're true to yourself.

49:58.880 --> 50:02.560
If you start to advertise yourself exactly who you as who you are and mix

50:02.560 --> 50:06.600
with the people that you believe are the people that you want to be with, right?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.880
That's the changes the probability drastically.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.600
That's so very, very true.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.800
That's very, very true.

50:13.800 --> 50:17.680
Kind of goes back to what I was saying when I did your podcast about my hairdresser,

50:17.680 --> 50:21.600
who was dripping head to toe in material possessions, jewelry.

50:21.840 --> 50:25.720
He's advertising himself to a certain audience that he doesn't actually want

50:25.720 --> 50:29.320
to attract. And if he is successful in that advertisement,

50:29.520 --> 50:32.480
he'd attract something that makes him unhappy and gives him shitty relationships.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.040
So you get exactly what you advertise.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.200
And that's the interesting thing.

50:36.200 --> 50:40.520
You know, if a young lady wants to to find a committed partner,

50:40.800 --> 50:45.080
but goes to the pub every Friday evening or the or the club every Friday evening

50:45.080 --> 50:49.800
to find that partner, you know, dressed in a certain way, acting in a certain way,

50:49.920 --> 50:52.920
she's going to get the person because people are, you know,

50:53.120 --> 50:55.240
we don't see beyond what you're advertising.

50:55.240 --> 50:59.040
So if that's what you're advertising, the person who's interested in this will show up, right?

50:59.200 --> 51:03.960
If you're into tango dancing and you show and you go to a tango class,

51:04.320 --> 51:06.240
the people there will be interested in tango.

51:06.880 --> 51:10.960
And those people will be the ones that you want to create that relationship with.

51:11.400 --> 51:16.680
And yeah, of course, there are not a million people in the city that are interested in tango,

51:17.040 --> 51:20.240
but a hundred percent of the people that are in that class are.

51:21.520 --> 51:26.280
So I guess you get what your advertisement attracts to be careful, what you advertise.

51:26.280 --> 51:28.640
Absolutely. And to advertise correctly,

51:28.960 --> 51:32.080
the one thing you need most is to know actually who you are.

51:32.760 --> 51:34.520
What are you as a product?

51:34.520 --> 51:35.840
Right. Most people don't know that.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.400
Absolutely. They don't know who they are.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.760
Absolutely. You don't you don't know what who you are.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.040
It's multiple rates, multiple, multiple layers of confusion.

51:44.240 --> 51:46.240
You don't know who you are.

51:46.280 --> 51:48.440
You don't love who you are.

51:48.440 --> 51:52.680
You know or love who you are, but you're advertising differently

51:52.680 --> 51:55.840
because you think others are more interesting, OK?

51:56.760 --> 51:59.040
Or by the way, you don't know what you want.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.200
So one of the most eyeopening, one of the chapters.

52:03.400 --> 52:06.240
So I'm writing all of this in a book called Finding Love.

52:06.680 --> 52:10.160
One of the most interesting chapters is all the models of love, OK?

52:10.480 --> 52:12.520
And it's so eyeopening today.

52:12.520 --> 52:16.640
Someone in my generation only believed that the only way to be with someone

52:16.640 --> 52:18.600
is to have a traditional relationship.

52:18.600 --> 52:22.200
Look at all of the models that are available in today's world, you know,

52:23.440 --> 52:25.960
all the way from hookups to a lifetime commitment.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.280
Everything's available, you know.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.000
And and and when you when you when you don't know what you're looking for,

52:32.000 --> 52:33.520
then you're advertising wrong.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.440
How do you find out what you're looking for, though?

52:35.440 --> 52:37.600
Again, it's the triangle.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.240
What is what am I thinking?

52:39.240 --> 52:40.600
What am I feeling?

52:40.640 --> 52:42.720
And what am I doing? OK?

52:42.880 --> 52:48.840
So openly, some of us will say, especially if you say, say, for example,

52:48.840 --> 52:52.200
you're a woman in her thirties, OK?

52:52.920 --> 52:56.880
And you want a child, you want a child, you feel it in you.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.920
But you're so, you know, so when you look at the triangle,

53:00.920 --> 53:03.240
what you feel is I want a child.

53:03.240 --> 53:07.280
But your actions are you're dating people without talking about the topic.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.360
OK. And then what you're thinking is maybe

53:10.360 --> 53:14.400
if I if I tell them I want a child, they will not want to be with me,

53:15.080 --> 53:18.280
which is quite interesting because, yes, if they don't want to be with you

53:18.280 --> 53:20.840
when you don't want a child, you don't want to be with them either.

53:21.360 --> 53:24.280
Right. And and and accordingly, there is a contradiction.

53:24.760 --> 53:29.360
If you want a child, you want to advertise to the world openly to say

53:29.480 --> 53:32.200
when you meet someone before you get too involved,

53:32.440 --> 53:34.360
you say, what's your position on the topic?

53:34.960 --> 53:38.080
Isn't it so funny that our strategy tends to be the total opposite?

53:38.120 --> 53:40.520
It's false advertising till we get them

53:40.520 --> 53:43.120
because the false advertisement is going to get more people.

53:43.520 --> 53:47.680
And then once we've got them, switch up gradually.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.720
Well, I don't even know if it's a conscious decision to switch up gradually,

53:51.720 --> 53:53.680
but it's an inevitable inevitability.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.800
You can't act for years.

53:56.120 --> 53:59.360
So eventually, once we've got them on the false advertisement

53:59.360 --> 54:02.600
of who we think they wanted us to be, then we'll change.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.080
And that's when all the conflict and relationships happen is when

54:05.200 --> 54:07.640
absolutely you realize this is not what you wanted at all.

54:07.720 --> 54:10.120
Yeah. And you've attracted your.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.160
You attracted the wrong person and you're stuck by acting.

54:14.240 --> 54:17.560
Yeah. But the more the more interesting part of this is

54:18.720 --> 54:22.360
we were prioritizing for the wrong target.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.720
So remember, if you really sit with yourself and you say,

54:26.000 --> 54:27.680
what do I want from a relationship?

54:27.680 --> 54:31.280
I want a committed partner that wants to have a family with me.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.000
If you if you come to that choice,

54:33.960 --> 54:36.840
you would behave very differently, but interestingly,

54:37.040 --> 54:41.680
you have this other conflicting thing of I want reassurance that I'm

54:41.680 --> 54:45.560
interested, interesting and people are still, you know, men are still attracted to me.

54:45.800 --> 54:49.800
So I'm going to go out dating others who are not just to make sure that when I

54:49.800 --> 54:54.880
find this guy, I'll be, I'll be, you know, still, still ready to grab.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.800
Right. That doesn't make any sense at all, because by the way,

54:57.960 --> 55:00.520
the ones that you're attracting are not a resembling

55:01.240 --> 55:03.240
sample to what you're actually looking for.

55:04.240 --> 55:07.560
And I know it sounds really weird when you talk about those things in mathematics

55:07.560 --> 55:10.720
and probabilities and sets and subsets and so on.

55:10.960 --> 55:13.600
But believe it or not, it's entirely.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.480
And I know people will hate me when I say this.

55:16.680 --> 55:19.480
Dating is an entirely an economics problem.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.040
It is economics, economics, meaning

55:23.080 --> 55:28.080
that in my days when I met Nibel, she was one of 14

55:29.080 --> 55:32.520
friends I knew, OK, economics were very straightforward.

55:32.520 --> 55:35.520
Of the 14, Nibel was the one that matched my soul.

55:35.520 --> 55:39.800
Most she was the most beautiful woman on the planet for those 14 and everyone else.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.560
And so I said, I'm after this one, right?

55:43.880 --> 55:49.200
Today, from a supply and demand point of view, you're talking about 14 million

55:49.200 --> 55:53.640
people at any point in time that are in a market that is so complex,

55:53.640 --> 55:55.800
it's like the Nasdaq market, OK?

55:56.160 --> 56:00.680
Literally, products are on the market instantly all the time.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.600
And the game is a game of economics.

56:03.920 --> 56:08.720
Sadly, the more supply there is, the less the value of a product.

56:09.960 --> 56:13.920
Right? So if you simply said to yourself, you know,

56:15.360 --> 56:20.720
this camera is now going to be we're going to make 14 million copies

56:20.720 --> 56:24.120
of it because it's easier for the factory to make 14 million copies than to make

56:24.120 --> 56:29.000
4,000, every one of those copies to manage to sell 14 has to go down in price.

56:29.720 --> 56:34.760
OK, because otherwise people only people who can afford the 4,000 would buy

56:34.760 --> 56:36.880
and then you'll be left with the other 10.

56:36.880 --> 56:41.000
And that's what's happening in the dating and romance market is that there is so

56:41.000 --> 56:45.960
much supply out there that nobody values that relationship anymore.

56:45.960 --> 56:48.320
Everyone is like, OK, I'll try anyway.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.640
You know, it's going to what is it going to take a couple of dates?

56:51.640 --> 56:53.160
But then that's not what happened.

56:53.200 --> 56:56.280
You go on a couple of dates and then it's a nice case and then you stay a little

56:56.280 --> 56:57.520
longer and then you're right.

56:57.520 --> 57:00.600
And all of that basically you realize that you've spent seven months of your

57:00.600 --> 57:03.760
life to figure out that this person is not interested in children.

57:03.760 --> 57:05.440
For example, if we take that example.

57:05.880 --> 57:11.240
So what does that mean in real terms for say that I was single and I was looking,

57:11.920 --> 57:14.640
right? I'm someone, you know what I'm like.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.520
I'm someone that's deeply interested in ideas and thoughts and, you know,

57:18.960 --> 57:21.320
self-development and all of these things.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.240
You know what I'm interested in.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.960
We've talked long enough for you to have at least a gauge of that.

57:25.360 --> 57:28.160
Where would I go?

57:28.560 --> 57:30.160
Is it a place?

57:31.360 --> 57:33.000
And where would I not go?

57:33.000 --> 57:36.520
It could be. I mean, if you want to find love, do what you love.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.160
Yeah, very straightforward.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.600
If you're into reflection and personal development,

57:41.600 --> 57:44.840
go to personal development conferences, sit with personal development.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.000
People like me, I'll buy you coffee anytime, you know.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.280
And or, or, or, you know, go to a retreat, for example,

57:52.280 --> 57:55.040
the people that will go to the retreat will be the type of person that you're

57:55.040 --> 57:58.920
looking for. I gave that advice to one of my dear friends and colleagues.

57:58.920 --> 58:02.640
When I worked at Google, she was part of Google in Poland.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.240
And I told her that I said, if you want to find love, do what you love.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.760
So she went and asked herself, what do I love?

58:08.760 --> 58:13.120
I love tango went and started that, you know, attended the tango class,

58:13.400 --> 58:16.560
ended up marrying the the the instructor, right?

58:16.840 --> 58:19.600
It's simply you want someone that matches you.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.440
Go to the places where those things happen.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.440
Those places could be physical places.

58:24.440 --> 58:28.200
They could be online. OK, they could be serendipitous

58:28.200 --> 58:29.760
because you're searching for those things.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.320
But just know what you stand for.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.080
I'm, you know, not a party animal.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.520
I'm never going to find my match in a party.

58:40.640 --> 58:43.600
So so do I go to parties? No, I don't really.

58:43.640 --> 58:46.560
I mean, I go sometimes when there is a reason to go.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.920
But otherwise, no, that's not how I spend my time.

58:49.520 --> 58:53.920
Quick one, we bring in eight people a month to watch these conversations live

58:54.000 --> 58:57.280
here in the studio when we're here in the UK and when we're in LA.

58:57.760 --> 59:00.680
If you want to be one of those people, all you've got to do is hit subscribe.

59:01.240 --> 59:05.920
You asked me a question about money, and then you said, you know,

59:05.920 --> 59:07.080
what does money mean to me?

59:07.080 --> 59:09.360
And then when I asked you, you said you think you've come to learn

59:09.360 --> 59:11.400
that you think money is one of your illusions.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.200
What did you mean by that?

59:13.680 --> 59:16.240
Money is an illusion at every, every level.

59:17.680 --> 59:18.520
Money doesn't exist.

59:18.520 --> 59:22.000
You and I know that anyone who understands fractional reserve

59:22.000 --> 59:26.080
and how money is printed and generated money does not even exist.

59:26.080 --> 59:30.040
You walk into a bank and you ask for a 50,000 pounds loan for a car.

59:30.160 --> 59:34.640
And they literally write the numbers five, zero, zero, zero, zero in a spreadsheet

59:34.640 --> 59:38.760
and money comes out of nowhere that money never existed before you borrowed it.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.760
OK, and will only exist when you work your backside off to pay it back.

59:43.200 --> 59:49.600
Right. And interestingly, that in that illusion was created to make our

59:49.600 --> 59:54.040
lives easier, and then it ended up making our life a lot more difficult.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.360
Now, why?

59:56.520 --> 01:00:02.200
Because most of us are so chasing the revenue side of money without

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.320
a full understanding of the cost side of money.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.400
Let me try to explain for you to get a job in London that pays

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.800
you 100,000 pounds just for simplification of the mathematics.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.640
You have to live in London, which costs you 70,000 pounds.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.680
For example, I don't know London very well, but let's say these are the numbers.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.600
But on top of the 70,000 pounds, it also causes costs you stress, your stress.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.000
It also costs you being far away from your mom if your mom lives elsewhere.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.240
It costs you, you know, your time, which is your most valuable resource.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.240
The only thing you really have in your life is your time, and it costs you

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.960
so many other things, right?

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:53.000
And so most people don't understand the cost benefit relationship to start.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.280
Now, you take that and then you add a Louis Vuitton bag or a fancy car.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.160
And suddenly your money is not even going as far as it could, because you

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.680
could get yourself a bag that is beautiful and everything for 100 pounds.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.880
But then you choose to buy one for several thousand pounds, and then you

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.280
have to work harder, which makes you may pay more costs and that and the cycle

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.160
becomes even more vicious, right?

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.360
You continue further than that.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.920
And you start to say, so I save some of that, some of my money in the future,

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.880
but your savings are suffering inflation.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.720
So you save a thousand pounds, they become 900, they become 800.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.480
When in reality, by the way, you've saved the thousand pounds, when you could

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.360
have borrowed them by entering some numbers in a spreadsheet.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.960
The entire recipe around that story is wrong.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.760
Everything around money is not what we believe it is, which basically makes

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.680
it an illusion.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.240
Now, the biggest part of that illusion, believe it or not, is, and I know you

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.880
have money in the bank, is that you have nothing.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.640
I don't know if you realize that.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.600
Most people don't understand that if I have 100 pounds in the bank, I literally

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.440
have nothing.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.360
I have nothing.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.960
The bank has my 100 pounds and the bank can decide whatever they want to do if

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.640
they wanted to take it away from me.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.240
Okay.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.640
And it is only my money when I choose to buy an iPhone or something with it.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.480
For that one instant, that money is mine.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.360
And then once I get the iPhone, it's not mine anymore.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.880
I now have the iPhone, right?

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.520
You basically assign that money that is never yours.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.920
It's the banks until the minute you spend it to spending it on things that most

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.600
of us don't ever, ever interact with.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.840
I mean, look at your own home, anyone listening to us and how many things you

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.880
have in that home that you've not ever used ever.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.880
You know, you, you saw that pair of shoes in the window and you were like, oh,

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.160
my God, I have to have them spent several hundred pounds on them or several

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.440
tens of pounds on them and then ended up taking them home, never, ever putting

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.680
them on, right?

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.840
Now, all of that waste along the way, the cost of earning the money, the things

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.720
that you spend it on, the actual value of the thing, the things that you spend

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.280
it on, basically tells you that there is one truth to money, which is I have

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.840
basic needs, I have basic needs and my basic needs are to be reasonably

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.800
covered, reasonably fed, reasonably safe and so on and so forth.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.200
And in, in, in, in the Islamic culture, we call this risk, which is different

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:27.800
than income.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.400
Risk is not what, how much money you earn.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.000
It's the good that that money brings you.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.920
It's, did you eat a meal today?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.400
That is actually what you're looking for in life.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.080
It's not the money that gets you the meal.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.920
Okay.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.200
What you're looking for is the meal.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.080
Could you actually buy something for your daughter today?

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.840
The thing is what you're looking for.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.960
It's not, it's not the money that got the thing.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.480
And if you start to chase that, something very different happens, right?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:04.000
Some, suddenly you start to ask yourself, hmm, is buying that thing worth the 17

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.560
hours of work I'm going to put in them, right?

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.400
Is it, which of those, which would I prefer if I gave you the two choices and

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.560
said, buy this bag or spend 17 hours with your friends.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.760
If you see it that way, you may make very different decisions.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.560
It leaves us with the very big other illusion, which is, but money is safety.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:28.320
Moe, you know, it's not like I want money because I want more fancy things.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.240
I just want to feel safe because the world is unpredictable.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.360
Sadly, when the world is unpredictable, money's not going to save you.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.040
Okay.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.200
And I think my story's been very, very, very big.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.160
I open, I had enough money.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.080
I, you know, I had enough connections and enough influence.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.600
And I, you know, failed to protect my child's life when it was time for him to go.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.240
Right.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.440
I, you know, I think we know many stories of someone that maybe falls and

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.640
breaks your back.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.080
What will your money do for you?

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.360
Safety is a much bigger thing than just a little bit of money in the bank.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.640
And by the way, safety is an attitude, is an idea to tell yourself, when I need it,

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.400
I will make it.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.320
When I need it, I will have it.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.160
Perhaps the answer is I don't need so much of it anyway.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:20.280
And I think, you know, again, like everything in life, you, you want to, to have

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.720
the skill of making money.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.760
Money is, is power, you know, again, when you were speaking on slow mo, you basically

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:33.080
said, I love the idea of being able to build this setup for the podcast of spending on

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.200
my show and so on.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.000
That's wonderful.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:35.560
Okay.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:41.680
Money is power, but it's power as long as you own it and it doesn't own you.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.160
The minute money owns you and lack of it starts to distract you and looking at how

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.280
much your, your other friend has and he has a little more than you, you know, hurts your

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:52.760
ego.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.720
Once it gets into that realm, then money works against you.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.440
It doesn't work for you.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.480
Do you think it's a noble cause that when I answered that question and I said, for me,

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:06.040
money is basically the fuel of my mission.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.960
It enables me to, I said, I put on my, my Diary of a Sea Alive tour, it cost me about

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.360
600,000 pounds to book these 10 venues, to book the London Playdian for three nights,

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.280
to book this massive choir of, you know, 40 people, to book this big musical.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.720
There was about a hundred of us, a hundred people I had to book and pay for to put on

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.200
that show.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.200
At the end of the show, I break even, but without the, that tour, you know, reaches almost

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:34.280
20,000 people, it's the most thrilling, fulfilling, biggest honor that I've ever had to be able

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.040
to do that in front of all of those people and to share that message, which is very much

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.000
in line with my mission.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.480
And I look at money and say, if I, if I didn't have the money, it would have been much,

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.720
much harder, not impossible, but much, much, much harder to do that.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:48.840
Absolutely.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.400
So do you feel like that is a noble relationship with money?

01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:01.240
Look, we agree on this. Nothing is good or bad, nothing is right or wrong.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.400
Everything is both right and wrong and everything is, can be both good and bad.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.560
It depends on what you want to do with it.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.280
And one of the messages I constantly tell everyone in the world is absolutely become

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:18.200
successful, become powerful, become rich, because the biggest problem with our world

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.440
is that the most successful, most powerful and the richest are the worst of us.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.200
Okay. And I don't generalize and say that's the truth, but it's actually easier to make

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.880
money if you break some rules than if it, then it is, if you're ethical.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:38.920
And so as a result of that, a good chunk of the big money in the world is not super ethical.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:44.280
Right. And if, if I have more money, I can fuel my one billion happy mission.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.960
And that's a good thing for the world.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.640
That's by the way, owning money, not letting it own you. Right.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:54.680
So if I, if I can get to the point where I make it and actually give it to one billion happy,

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.040
then that's amazing. If I get to the point where I make it and then suddenly go like,

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.920
oh, let's wait a little bit, grow it a tiny bit and then give it to one billion happy,

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.080
then I'm not doing the right thing. Having said that, you know, of course,

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:15.800
you know how I admire you and respect you. This is your zoom lens of the world. Okay.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.600
For someone else, four pounds, some sticky paper and a couple of scissors and spending an hour

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:29.080
with her daughter doing something beautiful. Okay. Is as impactful, maybe even more impactful than

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:35.080
the entire show, because that one daughter with the sticky paper and scissors might end up becoming

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.640
one of the most pronounced artists in the world, prominent enough to change the world with four,

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:48.440
four pounds, scissors and a piece of paper. Right. Now we, we somehow, especially those of us like

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:55.480
you and I, who, who had experiences in life where they put effort and the effort rewarded them. Okay.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:02.360
We think that we are the ones that are changing the world or making a difference or no, we're not.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:09.080
Okay. The reality is we need, we need to understand that again, I, you know, I admire you and I know

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.280
you'll, you'll not feel upset, but half of what you know is wrong. Half of what I know is wrong.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.480
Absolutely. Right. And it's, it's just an attempt. It's just an attempt with, you know,

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:27.640
whether that attempt, Steve is, is, is an attempt because of money or is it, it's an attempt

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.760
because you just spend time with your driver talking about something or, you know, you were

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:42.760
telling the story, all of those things. I think the game is I'm going to do the best that I can

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:52.120
to acquire the resources that I'm good at acquiring to direct them in the investments that I have

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:59.960
accessible to me. Okay. If, if you are a cashier, you know, at a supermarket and you're making enough

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:07.080
money to spend wonderful time with your daughter to, you know, to, to do a bit of art, then that in

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.480
itself is a form of contribution that changes the world. And you'll never know that one daughter

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:21.000
might cure cancer. It's interesting. I was, I was bouncing around in my head back and forward

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.360
about like, about the role that a lot of my, I don't know, maybe my traumas and securities are

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.440
playing in driving my decision making around these things. Obviously, putting on a big show,

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.680
you have lots of people there that are clapping for you. There's lots of admiration. It's very like,

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.320
it's very massaging of the ego. So one might say to themselves, well, I'm serving the world when,

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.400
in fact, it's more of a selfish thing. And you're like, you know what I mean? It's that, that constant

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.360
battle I find in my life where the greatest service that I do to others is also woven in there with

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.080
loads of like, absolutely insecurities. So even this podcast, like, I'm sure the people listening,

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.840
enjoy listening, I'm sure they get a tremendous amount of value from it. But there is still

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:05.160
this guy in me that is so desperate to be number one and to win, right? And it's almost, I'm almost

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:11.800
at peace with the conflicting forces because I know, I think as we sit here, the podcast is

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.360
number one in the Apple store, pretty sure of that. And I know it wouldn't have been and it

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:21.320
wouldn't have reached as many people if I wasn't someone who was desperate to be the best.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.360
But I also know that this is, that pursuit of being the best is also quite an ugly one,

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.440
because it comes, means you end up sacrificing a bunch of things in the pursuit of being the best

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.560
that might make you more fulfilled. So it's this weird, it's this weird balancing act of

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.520
contradiction and confusion and not really knowing why, why I'm doing what I'm doing at like the

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.400
real fundamental level. You can broadcast what people want you to hear. Oh, I'm doing it because

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.320
I want to help others. But I actually know that there's, it's a recipe, a concoction of many

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.320
conflicting forces and pretty much all my success has been this sort of recipe of conflicting forces.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:06.200
Well, I mean, what I admire most about you is you're able to see and say this, okay? If you're,

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:12.680
you know, if you've achieved total enlightenment, you'll be gone, okay? None of us is ever there.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:18.600
The challenge is this. Some people are completely egocentric and not even aware.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:28.760
Yeah. Okay. Some people are struggling, okay? And some people are, you know, doing the best they

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.960
can, understanding, as I say, that in compartment two, there is something and they're okay with it,

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:41.000
okay? And the trick is you're always trying to move a little bit higher. And that higher,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.640
you know, and that little voice in your head, I follow that model. And it sounds simple,

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.680
but it's actually quite interesting. I call it be learned do, right? Be learned do is

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:56.840
most of us in our life, we look at problems and we say, here's the solution, right? That's,

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:03.640
we're mostly almost anchored in doing. Doing again is a very masculine trait, okay?

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.600
Interestingly, a lot of doing is as harmful as it is, as it is beneficial.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:18.280
You know, the good doing is a doing that is informed by a form of being and by a certain

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:24.200
level of skill that comes from learning. Okay? So when I, what I normally try to follow in the

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:29.640
entire manual to your brain is to say, okay, for everything that we will find, we will have to be,

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.840
then learned and do, okay? So you're very good. One of the people I respect most about that idea

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:42.120
of being, you look at yourself and you say, oh, I am doing that because of that insecurity that

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.520
happened when I was this. That's an amazing achievement in itself. That's a third of the way,

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.640
right? I know what's what I need to work on. And I think it's the challenging third of the way,

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.920
believe it or not, because we humans are very good at solving the problems when they're defined.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.680
If you make it your priority, you're going to learn the skill. Everyone is capable of doing

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.840
that. Again, I speak a lot about neuroplasticity and how learning works. But once you've learned,

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.960
once you've realized what it is, is that you need to work on, you're going to learn the skill and

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.800
then you're going to start practicing and doing it the right way. The challenge is when you don't

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.800
know what you're working on. Now I'll say this openly. What you're doing to the world with your

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.440
awareness that part of it is ego driven, of course, part of what I do is ego driven. I tell the whole

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:32.520
world that I'm an engineer. Being an engineer is an ego. Why do I tell the whole world that there

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.480
is a utility to that ego? The utility is, by the way, guys, if you want to read my work or listen

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.200
to my analysis, it's going to appear a little over engineered, even when I talk about something as

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.280
beautiful as love and relationships. It will have that engineering element to it, which is not entirely

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:54.200
myself, by the way. It's just the way I present myself to the world, because others don't present

01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:00.440
themselves that way. So I'm differentiating. Yeah, I wish I didn't have to use that ego.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:05.960
You may wish that you stood on stage and didn't feel the rush of people clapping and saying,

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:12.280
well done, you're amazing. But by the way, if you're delivering to thousands and hundreds of

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.080
thousands of people on your podcast, great, you're so much better than those who are not.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.200
And now the fact that you have your awareness makes you even better than those who are,

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.960
but are not aware of their parts that they need to work on.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.400
Yeah, it's challenging. I was bouncing around in my head on that, because if I cared a ton about

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:41.080
the clapping part, I probably would be trying to convince everybody that I'm perfect a bit more

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.200
than I do. It's just an interesting battle of ego. But I also think that, I think I said this

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:52.040
on your podcast, is it's okay to be a contradiction. And I think in all facets of my life, when I look

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.240
at my decisions, what I want, what I say, what I do, and there's so many interwoven contradictions,

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:03.480
and it's so remarkable that the contradictions often lead me to success in the things that

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.600
I'm aiming for. It's not making sense. I think the whole idea is that we're all contradictions.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.960
The only difference is you're aware. Yeah. Do you realize that? So the thing, I think you

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:20.200
should be the example for everyone to recognize that we're all contradictions. It's everyone,

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.560
every single one listening to us. Life is a contradiction. This is why one of my favorite

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:31.960
feminine qualities is the ability to embrace paradoxes. And the reality is, the only way you

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:38.120
can almost like at a quantum level, solve life better, is if you're able to embrace two extremes

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:42.360
and say, both are true, and I'm going to include both of them in my lifestyle, both of them in my

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.480
decision making, because both of them are me. It goes back to your point about the equilibrium

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.440
as well, that the reason why the pendulum sits in the middle is because it's at balance with

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:58.440
two opposing forces. Gravity has balanced it on that particular point, but when you apply one

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.200
force to either side, it will swing into a direction. Maybe balance is being a perfect

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:08.120
contradiction. Absolutely. Balance is always a contradiction. Balance is that ability to take

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:13.640
all of those forces. Now, you have to imagine, I separated them into six forces and said your

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.360
health, six pendulums, that your health is one and your love is one and this is one,

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.200
but the reality is you're one pendulum. So many forces are applying from so many directions.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:28.920
And the contradiction is not just, if I work harder, I'll make more money or less money.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.160
If I work harder, I will also be a little more stressed. If I work harder, my relationships

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.280
will be affected. And each of those, eventually you're ending up in one place that is very,

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:46.120
very complex. We're a very complex being as a human and we're dealing with an even more complex

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:52.760
life. And the thing is we need to take it easy on ourselves and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:58.600
out my relationship bit in a while. I now need to figure out my one billion mission and a little

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:03.240
more or I need to figure out this more or I need to do that more. And it's okay to say it's never

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.880
perfect. It's absolutely never perfect. The game is if I told myself, no, no, hold on. I've done the

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:16.440
thinking and this situation is my perfect situation. I'm doomed because I'm basically telling myself,

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.880
keep that pendulum in this place and defend it with your life. Okay. Put all of the effort in the

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.440
world when that pendulum is in the wrong place. It's not in balance. In your book as well,

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.960
that little voice in your head, you describe how like all thoughts aren't really made equally and

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.760
that there's different sort of categories of thoughts and some of them like observation are

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.200
closer to the truth than others. What are the different categories of thoughts that we have in

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:49.960
our head? The first challenge with thought is that we create our thoughts from the wrong ingredients.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:57.720
So if I gave you bad vegetables and told you to make the best salad recipe on the planet,

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:06.440
it's still going to taste bad. And the reality is we have only one proper ingredient

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.840
that we should allow into our brain so that we create proper accurate thoughts. And that

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:20.840
that one ingredient is actual observation. Okay. Observation is I look at this glass and I say

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:29.720
this glass is 37% full. Okay. That is an observation. Yeah, you can, we can debate in physics if it is

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:36.760
or if it isn't and so on. But in, you know, the typical way we look at life, this is 37% full.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:45.000
Right. My brain would then tell me, if I used that information, I may ask someone in the team

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.880
and say, guys, can I please another have another a little bit more water? My brain would then tell

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:56.360
me, no, no, hold on, it's tapered. Okay. It is not, you know, the same from the top as it is

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.160
in the from the bottom. No, you've calculated wrong. No, you're getting old and your mathematics

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:08.200
are not accurate anymore. You're, you know, you can go into so many different inputs into your

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:15.880
thoughts that would debate that fact that it is more empty than it is full. Okay. You take that

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:20.840
and you find you can find them in categories. One of them is conditioning. Believe it or not,

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.960
one of the most frequently used sources for creating your thoughts is not what's happening

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:34.040
in the world at all. It's your conditioning and your conditioning creates thoughts within you

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:40.120
that are not, not at all a reality. I speak about any experience where I was dating a

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:45.560
Buddhist girl who was very calm and wonderful in every possible way. And, you know, two of our

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:52.360
best friends were a couple and they had a big fight before coming to our place. And so anyway,

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.000
the, the girl basically said, no, I need to talk to you about something and, you know,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.560
want to ask your view. And she sat next to me, very, very, very good friends, all the four of

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.280
us for a very long time. And so she hugged me. She sat on, you know, put her head on my shoulder

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:13.320
and cried. Okay. My girlfriend came in and said, excuse my English. She said, take your hands off

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:22.360
my man, you be. Okay. And, you know, I was like, whoa, she's one of the calmest people I know.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:29.480
What happened here? And what happened was she had been cheated on before. Right. By the best,

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:35.960
by her best girlfriend and, you know, a friend of the person she was dating at the time.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:42.200
And the input into her head that said, this girl was sort of doing something inappropriate with

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.720
me was coming from the fact that she had that conditioning in her. It wasn't the event itself,

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:55.000
the event was highly exaggerated by the conditioning. So we're unable to find that when we, when we

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.400
look at our, at the makeup of our thoughts. The second, I, and the third are recycled emotions

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.800
and recycled thoughts. Okay. So we recycle so much of what our parents told us. Recycling

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.680
of a memory or the recycling of a thought, you know, your, your friend tells you, Hey,

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:17.560
by the way, all men are cheats. And you recycle that thought. Okay. All men are cheats. All men

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:24.120
are cheats. And then, you know, you end up making decisions based on that. The fourth, and I think

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:30.520
the most, the biggest challenge we have in the modern world is the mainstream media, basically,

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:37.640
the, the, the, the large advertising media story that we're told that is a ton of input,

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:43.240
whether it's movies, it's social media, it's, you know, tweets or, or reels or, or, or if,

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:49.880
or if it's the BBC or channel for playing the news. And the, the, the reality of what we're

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:57.880
getting is we're getting a highly biased section of life. Why? Because of the human

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.400
nature, which is around negativity bias, humans are only paying attention most of the time to

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:09.320
the negative side of life. Those all, all of those outlets are constantly using that negativity

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.960
bias to broadcast to you. Well, it's actually not the full truth, but the negative side of the truth.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:20.760
So, you know, the, the channel will not talk about a child that went out with his mother and

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:26.280
played on the swings. They'll talk about a child that fell in a well and we have that disaster.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:31.640
And, and, you know, a social media person, I always say, you're a balanced one, but a social

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:37.160
media influencer will always show this, the pictures that appear to be more than what they're

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.880
living and there will be filters and so on. And that negativity that you feel as a result

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:48.120
is not a reflection of the actual truth of life. It's a reflection of the subset of knowledge that

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:54.120
you get from life. Now, what does that mean? I mean, I'm trying to say, if I give you your phone

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:00.920
and your phone has a perfect phone app on it, if you type the wrong number, you're going to call

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.280
the wrong person. Nothing wrong with the phone, nothing wrong with the app. Okay. In your brain,

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.000
if you put in the wrong data all the time, if you allow all of that negativity coming from the media

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.960
and the news, if you allow the conditioning to be part of your, of your decision making criteria,

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.680
the recycled thoughts and emotions, then you're eventually going to end up calling the wrong

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:27.240
action. Okay. And I think the reality is that at that very fundamental level, unless you start to

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:34.440
really iron out all of the wrong inputs, there is very little possibility that you're actually

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.920
going to get to the accurate output. You were talking about all these types and categories

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.000
of thoughts and all of these inputs. One of the inputs is the mainstream media. Some of the

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.040
inputs come from, I guess, our conditioning and experiences. And when you talked about the glass

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:54.440
and your observation that the glass is 37% full, how do you know that that's not your conditioning

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.880
speaking? How do you know that that's not the influence of the mainstream media? How do you

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.880
know that there's not a second layer that's running over your, what you're seeing called your

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.920
perception that is influencing that. I'm trying to figure out for people listening how they can

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:12.760
distinguish between a thought that is truth and observation and worth pursuing and incredible

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:22.120
and one that is conditioned or your spot on. Okay. This is 37% full is my brain's calculation.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.880
Let's use a simpler example. You have an argument with your partner. The next morning you wake up

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:33.400
and say, doesn't love me or she doesn't love me anymore. Right. The argument is what you observed

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.000
that there was a bit of attention that those specific words were said. That's observation.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.480
Right. Observation is literally like narration of the situation. That's it. And if you can stick

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.640
down, you can take yourself all the way down to narration, you're done. Okay. I observe that you're

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:58.200
sitting cross hand, you know, crossing your arms. That's an observation. My brain could take that

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:05.560
observation and say he's bored. He's protective. He is angry with me. We've been talking too much,

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:11.640
whatever. Okay. I can translate it into a million things in my head. None of them is true.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.760
The only truth is Steven's sitting in front of me and he's crossing his arms. If I accept

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:24.440
that to be the truth, then my brain suggests those other things. I can then ask and I say,

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.360
have we been talking too long, Steve? Do you want, should we take a break? Can we do this?

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.560
Can we do that? Right. And then you would say something and that would be my next observation.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.720
I can include that in my analysis as another fact. Okay. Without those facts, sadly, what

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:47.800
happens to us in life is that we're completely absorbed and consumed by stories that we've built.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:54.840
The story is this is 37% full. That's a story. Believe it or not, even so though it appears to

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.440
be very accurate, it's a story that includes, hey, by the way, Moe, you're good in geography.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.600
You've done your mathematics really well. You've looked at those two. It looks as if you,

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:12.520
and you know, it's a big story. And I would tend to tell myself, hey, it's 37. If I complimented

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.400
this with, you know, I think it's 37. It could be a little more or a little less. That's a much

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.400
better observation. Right. If I tell myself the story and believe it and start acting upon it,

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.960
then I'm in a very deep trouble because, because basically my input into my brain

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.240
is leading me to confusion, certain confusion, because I'm not using the truth.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.360
It's that kind of like requirement of having like a looseness of our beliefs as well, isn't it?

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.400
That just the, that old adage of strong, strong beliefs, but held loosely, whatever it's,

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:48.680
that phrase is, I think is the most beautiful thing ever. Yeah. Because what are your beliefs?

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.360
The beliefs are built within context. Again, I write about this. You know, there was a proverb

01:27:54.360 --> 01:28:03.000
in Egypt that was developed in the times of poverty and famine. People couldn't have enough. And it

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:10.920
was a difficult time. And it basically said, as far as your, extend your legs as far as your

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:18.040
blanket goes. Okay. Interesting. When you know, it's basically within context, it invites people

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.760
to say, Hey, within your, live within your resources, live within your means. It's not an easy time.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:29.080
You take that and take it out of context. And it's widely, widely used in Egypt.

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.680
You put it out of context and it becomes, you know, a bit of complacence. It's like,

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:40.680
don't try to buy a bigger blanket. Just live within your blanket. Okay. And that's a very,

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.480
very, very different view of looking at something that was meant to be correct.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.480
And if you take, when I talk about conditioning, you have so many of those in you.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.400
So many, something that your mom said at the point in time, something that your,

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.320
you know, teacher said at the point in time, something that you did and your friends in

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.360
school reacted in a way that you didn't want and so on. And all of that is embedded within us.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.200
How do I get rid of it? Again, it's very simple. It's that contradiction.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.480
It's a very simple contradiction of something is not in balance. I say that I want a Rolls-Royce,

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:20.920
but I actually go, you know, go to the Rolls-Royce and then feel that maybe people will think this

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:26.840
way about me, maybe, you know, it's going to cost me that much, maybe, right? And, and, and suddenly

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.440
you go like, okay, so I'm not in balance. Because what I think we're talking about here is like

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.560
really self-awareness. It's becoming really. But also self-reflection, self-introspection.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:40.280
And that's, that's what I was going to say is I think for most of my life, because of my conditioning,

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.640
I'm essentially this puppet to my conditioning with all these pieces of string hanging off my

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.520
limbs. And self-awareness is the process of gradually cutting one of these strings at a time

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.960
and taking back more control of why I'm doing what I do in my behavior. So that like journaling

01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:00.920
or producing content, that, that introspection and self-reflection is, has been the cutting of

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.560
these strings one by one, or you could view it as the, like the turning on of lights in a room.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:09.800
So you can kind of navigate better the world. But until you do that, the lights really are off.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.720
And I think that's kind of central term to what we were discussing about how to distinguish conditioning,

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:19.960
media influence from truth and your own thoughts.

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:25.480
Quick one, as you might know, Crafted are one of the sponsors of this podcast and Crafted are a

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.280
jewelry brand and they make really meaningful pieces of jewelry. The really wonderful thing

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:35.720
about Crafted jewelry is it's super affordable. It looks amazing. The pieces hold tremendous meaning

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:42.200
and they are really well made. I think I've worn this piece for almost a year. It hasn't broken,

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:47.000
hasn't changed color because it's really, really good quality and it costs roughly

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.760
50 quid. People will be surprised when they hear that. They'd probably assume that all of my

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.920
jewelry is like solid gold and costs thousands and thousands of pounds. But what's the point

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:59.960
when you can achieve the exact same effect from a piece of jewelry that's high quality and costs

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:05.240
50 quid? That's why by Crafted. The other thing that you mentioned in your, in your book, that

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.480
little voice in your head is this concept of neuroplasticity. It says it on the back of the

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:16.600
book. It says, retrain your brain for maximum happiness. This concept that we can retrain

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:24.520
our brain physiologically seems like nonsense. I can't change my arm. So when someone, you know,

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:30.360
asserts that you can actually change your brain. You can change your arm. I can change my arm?

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:36.040
Of course. What, tattoo? No, you work out. That's true. When you work out, you're building

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:41.560
muscles in your arms and that same exact process is exactly what happens inside our brains and

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:46.200
it's called neuroplasticity. The only difference is that you don't see it. You don't see it visibly.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.520
You can see your muscles growing because that's the function that they need, you know, they need

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:56.280
to grow to perform. But in your brain, what actually happens again, like computers, it's almost as if

01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:03.800
you loaded a new piece of software, a new piece of operating system on your brain, literally for

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:09.960
every one of us listening, everyone listening to us right now, at the end of this conversation,

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:16.520
their brain will be wired differently than when it started. Every single instance of anything that

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:22.520
you do literally rewires the hardware itself, the neurons that fire together, wire together.

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:30.920
Okay. So imagine the old days of the switchboard. Okay. And, you know, Steve wants to call his mom,

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:37.000
so you, you know, crank your phone and the operator says, you know, hi, how can I help you? And you

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.560
say, can you please connect me to that number? And she would literally take a wire and patch

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:48.440
you and your mom's phones together. Okay. After a while, the operator constantly, every time you

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.680
call you want to, you ask for your mom. So the operator goes like, why am I even wasting my time

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:57.880
on this? Let me just patch that wire to his mom all the time. Okay. So that's exactly what happens

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:03.080
in our brains. If you, if you perform a single, a certain function, your brain starts to build

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.640
networks that make that function easier to perform in the future. If you do it one time,

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.440
it becomes a little easier. If you do it 20 times, it becomes permanent. Okay. And there are, there

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.800
are tons of studies. If you, if you take a simple task like tapping your finger on the table, okay,

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:24.120
and you're requested to do that, say 20 times every hour, after a few days, you'll find that you're

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.200
so much better at tapping your finger on the table, and you can do it much faster and you can do it

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.000
consistently and you can do it in the background. Gamers know that for certain. Okay. The problem

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:40.280
with neuroplasticity is if you tell your brain to wire for tapping your finger, it will. If you

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.480
tell it to wire for solving complex mathematical equations, it may take a little longer, but it

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:51.160
will. If you tell it to wire for hating people, it will become very good at hating. If you tell it

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.400
to wire for fearing the end of the world because of what the media is telling you, it's going to

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.040
become very good at fearing the world. I know some of these people. I know, absolutely. And you

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.080
don't want them in your life. The challenge of our modern world is that we think that this brain

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:10.680
is supposed to be there to make us successful. Yeah. Okay. First of all, it's not the primary

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.480
function of the brain. The primary function of the brain is to make you safe. Okay. And then

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.400
the secondary function that we push human as humans to, that brain to do is to invent iPhones and

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.120
create podcasts and have amazing things. Right. That's a secondary function. But believe it or

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:32.680
not, before that secondary function, your, your brain is supposed to make you happy because happy

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.960
is the ultimate form for you to perform in life. If you're not happy, you're not as effective as

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:44.200
you could be at achieving survival. Think about it. If you're grumpy all the time at work,

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:49.400
people don't like you. You're not focused. No one wants to help you. You're wasting most of your

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:55.160
time, your brain cycles, you know, thinking about the negative. And so you're not innovative or

01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.920
creative and so on and so forth. It degrades your performance. Happy is a better place for

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:05.000
you to be at work because it will make your customers want to do business with you. It will

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.560
make your colleagues want to, you know, to help you out. It will make your boss welcome you in

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:16.040
their team and so on and so forth. We are social animals by definition. And we want to have that

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.240
in our life. And the easiest way to connect and to open up and to discover the world is to be in a

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.360
happy place. That's a primary function of your brain. It's hard for some people, you know,

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:33.480
because we can all think of someone in our lives who has certain wiring, very stubborn wiring,

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.760
that almost seems impossible to unwire. And I think we all have that ourselves as well,

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:43.560
certain wiring in our brains where something happens and our reaction to that thing might be,

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.680
you know, to catastrophize. It's the end of the world. That's like a, it feels like it's a

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.960
certain set of wiring where trigger and then the brain goes through the circuitry and it goes

01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:01.160
catastrophe panic. Yeah. And the answer to that I found was to actually guide that person or yourself,

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:07.240
if that's yourself, to the opposite of your wiring. So if my wiring is to look at everything and see

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:12.760
what's wrong with it, I should deliberately force my brain to look for what's right with it. So,

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.360
you know, I, when I was, when I was coming here, it was very busy in the morning. And so I came

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.280
late, if you remember, and my brain's immediate reaction is, Oh, what's going to happen? I'm

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:30.200
going to be late for Steve, right? That's the immediate reaction of a brain because something

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:38.040
is wrong. So it looks for what's wrong. I could also say, and what is good about that? What is

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:42.600
good about being a little late? You know, he's been recording for the last few days. So it may

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.000
give him a little bit of extra time. Do you want to know the truth? I was so happy you were late

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.680
because I was late. Right. So I was doing upstairs reading that I was reading the book and I was

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.120
thinking, I just hope he's like 15 minutes late. And then I'm like, I really, he's not coming at

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:59.400
perfect. So I carried on going and carrying on going and carrying on going. And I just finished

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.760
as you arrived. Yeah. So it's perfect. You see, that, that is the truth. That's the truth that

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:11.000
your brain tries to deny you from seeing. And interestingly, you can't train your brain. So,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.560
so basically what you can do is for every thought, for every negative thought that your brain gives

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:21.880
you, task it with the task of giving you a positive one or two positive ones, nine, I say, nine.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:26.840
Yeah. Because in reality, if you look at life around you, more than 90% of life is okay for

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.920
your brain to contribute more than that as negative is not fair. Right. So if literally if your brain

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:39.160
says, Hey, by the way, this studio is a little warm. What else is about this to do? My friend,

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:45.160
Steve is there. The lighting is perfect. The crew is amazing. You know, the coffee is not that bad.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:52.280
You guys got me honey. I can go on for hours. Right. And the idea is by training your brain

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:57.480
to look for that. What are you actually doing? You're firing the neurons together.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:04.360
Gratitude. And exactly your, your, your book basically says it is the answer. The answer is

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.400
when you find gratitude, what that gratitude journal that you keep that you kept for years

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.600
every day, what was it telling you? It was training your brain to look for what's right.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:20.120
That your brain every night that you did it was like, okay, it seems he's going to be asking to

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.840
call his mom a lot more often. It seems he's going to be asking for good things a lot more often.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:30.200
I might as well observe them. I might as well find them. And so yes, you said some people are

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:35.080
impossible to rewire. They're impossible to rewire. If they've been practicing a certain

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.280
wiring for 21 years, it's not going to take 21 seconds to rewire anyone, including me and you.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:47.000
It will take 21 days, let's say, for your brain to recognize I need different wire.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.120
And it will take maybe 21 months for your brain to say, and I don't need the old wiring anymore.

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.720
And the game here is, can you actually keep doing that? Can you keep tapping your finger

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.160
in a way that trains your brain that this is the wiring that you need?

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.480
Like, can I keep going to the gym and working on my guns?

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:12.840
Believe it or not, the research will tell you that a big part of being athletic is wiring

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:18.280
of your brain, not your muscles. For your brain to be able to say, I will go, even if I feel a

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:24.440
little tired, I will go, even if I feel a little busy, I will go and I will do the right exercises,

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:29.080
even if the last push is a little painful. A lot of people will hear that and go, what's

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:33.240
the evidence for this? What's the evidence for neuroplasticity? Is there science? Oh,

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.960
there is a ton of science behind neuroplasticity. Anything from between neuroplasticity and

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:45.880
neurogenesis is when neuroplasticity is to rewire the connections between the neurons.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.840
And neurogenesis is to actually create new neurons when, if you're hit with a ball,

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.360
for example, and part of your brain is damaged, how we can recreate that, right? If you have a stroke

01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:02.440
and how you recreate that. And ample evidence, one of the very famous stories is Matthew Ricard,

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:07.880
when we spoke about him in the beginning. Matthew's brain looks different than the average human

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.680
brain. His insula is much bigger in relative comparison. His prefrontal cortex is bigger.

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:22.360
And it fires more often. It's simply because of the constant neuroplasticity of,

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.840
I need you to meditate. I need you to stay quiet. I need you. I mean, some of Matthew's journeys

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.120
would last four years in isolation. You would meditate for four years?

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:39.640
Be in isolation in hermitage for four years. And so at that level, your brain starts to do

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.040
very different things. And by the way, that's not unusual. Many farmers around the world

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:51.480
live in isolation for a very long time. Believe it or not, you and I, when we spend a long time

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.400
on airplanes, I chose a long time ago to not watch a lot of stuff. I maybe watch one movie,

01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:03.000
but not the entire trip. The other bits of silence, that's actually a form of meditation.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.960
And my absolute wonderful friend, Jamie Nelson, the photographer, if you know him,

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:17.400
he photographs indigenous tribes. And the way he does it is he would go and spend a few months

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.800
outside their premises, their village, if you want, in silence. Camping out there,

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.800
he doesn't speak their language. He's just sitting there waiting for them to accept him.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.920
And then he would start to communicate to them in sign language because he doesn't speak their

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.760
language. And he's one of the wisest people I know. And I said, how did you become this wise?

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.480
He never studied any of those things. And the reality is, is because he's in constant reflection

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:49.240
and meditation. He's sitting out there. And he's spending hours and days in reflection and meditation,

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.760
right? Because you're sitting alone. All of those things are our habits. And all of us have the

01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:02.040
chance to do it. You could be on the tube for a commute of 40 minutes a day. And you could be in

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:08.680
that commute cursing life. And that's a very good 40 minute exercise to work and another 40

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:14.120
minute going back. Or you could be spending the 40 minutes in gratitude. You could be first for,

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.440
you know, for spending the 40 minutes listening to music, could be doing whatever

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.600
what you will do for 40 minutes a day will rewire your brain.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.560
It really is like a paradigm shifting thought that our brains are in this constant

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.760
growth and evolution. But when we look at, as you said, my muscles are,

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.320
my muscles are changing state size, growing more fibers to achieve their objective in a

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:40.120
different way. And of course, my brain is as well. And when you think about that, it's really

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.040
liberating because you realize that you're not stuck with who you are. Absolutely not.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.920
It's my friend, Ro, she's, she's got a podcast as well. She, um, one of the smartest people I've

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.320
ever met. And she, she worked in my company for many years and she got a brain tumor. And

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.520
she showed me the scan of her brain. They found this golf ball in the middle of her brain.

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:06.360
And they removed it. And she showed me those brain scans. And then just months later,

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:13.800
the hole is gone. And her brain has regrown that part. And there's no longer a hole in her brain.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.840
And that was one of those moments when I go, Oh my God, the brain, like,

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.960
like everything around us is a living organism that is shaping and evolving based on the

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:27.320
inputs and what's happening to it. So let's choose what, which parts of it are we going to

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:31.240
grow? I think that's the whole point. And we grow it with our actions and our thoughts.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.760
Repetitive actions, thoughts and memories, believe it or not, one of the interesting

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:41.000
things is if you take a memory in the past and you think about it over and over and over,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.960
it's as if you're hap, it's happening over and over. And you're growing the neurons that are

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.280
needed or you're growing the connections between the neurons that are needed to trigger that memory.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:56.920
Think happy memories. Okay. If you sit next to your partner and focus on one thing that they

01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:00.520
do and go like, they say, do this, they do this, they do this, they do this and forget

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.720
that they do a hundred other things that you love and appreciate,

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.880
your neuroplasticity is making you completely obsessed about that one thing.

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.600
And you can only see that one thing. And eventually, you know, some of my friends

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.480
after a breakup, I go like, what happened then? They'll say one thing.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.120
It's like just, they obsess about it over and over because your brain is growing to say,

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.160
he needs to think about this, right? I'm going to make it easier to think about this.

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.680
I'm going to make it faster, more accessible. And you'll see it more often, like the red cars.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:34.920
You know, the whole thing about when you, if you buy like a red car, if you buy like a green car,

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.000
then every car you see will appear to be green. If you buy a Range Rover, every car you see is a

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Range Rover. Well, this other thing that's really intriguing topic from our last conversation that

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.640
you mentioned and you mentioned in your new book is this idea of masculinity and femininity.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:52.760
I don't really hear many people talking about this. Yeah. Believe it or not, my, my publisher

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:59.560
really was asking, should we include this? It's a contested topic that we want to,

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.480
but I think it's very important for people to understand. We've mixed up again, a few definitions.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:13.320
Like I said, we mix love and romance, for example, with mixed biology, with gender identity,

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.440
with sexual preferences, with the reality of what the feminine and the masculine is.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:26.520
The feminine and the masculine in my definition are approaches to life. Okay.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:35.240
Some basic, basically, some people will want to hold their mug this way and others will want to

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.120
hold it that way. It's an approach to life. No way is right and no way is wrong. Okay.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.400
Some of us will want to go through life with creativity and playfulness and,

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:51.800
and, you know, intuition. And some of us will want to go with analysis and discipline and

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.880
linear thinking. It's an approach to life. Neither is right and neither is wrong.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.400
There is a high correlation between those who are, I archetypically feminine, if you want,

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:10.360
between certain of those qualities, certain, some of those qualities. And, you know, those who are

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:16.920
masculine. Again, there is a correlation with some other qualities. So you'd find that a person

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:22.520
who's masculine, whether that's a man or a woman, straight or gay, it doesn't matter if, if a person

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:28.440
acts in their masculine, they'll tend to be a little more forceful if you think about it. You

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:33.720
know, we, the masculine, one of the masculine qualities is strength. Okay. Strength is a,

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:38.520
is a quality, whether it's strength in mental strength or physical strength. You want to,

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:44.200
you want to use your strengths to move things. Okay. If you're dependent on your masculine side

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:49.960
or more associating with your masculine side, you're going to show that. And as I said, statistically

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:55.880
correlated, those who have male body parts tend to use that a little more. Reasoning doesn't matter.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:05.400
The problem with our world at the global level and the problem at us, about us as individuals

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:11.480
is we've decided that some of those properties or qualities are more valuable to our world than

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:17.240
others. Okay. If, if you live in a capitalist world and the capitalist world is entirely about

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:23.320
let's produce more, let's make more, let's, you know, do more, we're going to have to borrow more

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:30.680
from the doing qualities, which are mostly masculine. Okay. This leads to a world where

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:36.520
there is a lot of doing with little being, which basically means it's a world where we do a lot

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.640
of what we haven't really properly thought about with what, what is not really informed

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:49.000
by the realities of who we are being, being that beautiful. Some of the feminine is being

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:56.440
the feminine is the masculine does. There is a difference between them. And if you continue

01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:02.760
to do without actually asking yourself that awareness question of what should I do? You end

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:08.680
up doing things like building technologies that make our life slightly better and destroy the

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.680
planet in the process. Why? Because you haven't really internalized some of the most beautiful

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.600
feminine qualities of intuition, of creative thinking to look for alternatives, of sensuality

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:28.280
to actually sense what is actually happening in the world as a result of your doing of inclusion,

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.080
you know, to connect to the rest of being to understand that this is not just about us,

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.360
it's also about the bees and the, and the bears and everyone else and so on. So that world that

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.120
we've created being hypermasculine is I think the biggest mistake humanity's ever done. And I think

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:50.360
humanity's paying for that mistake and will pay more in the future. The savior is for us to stop

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:55.960
doing this and to start waking up and saying, hold on, hold on, we need a lot of being before you

01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:03.720
continue to do. So interesting. It's particularly tricky to understand for men, of course, because

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.960
men, I mean, there'll be a lot of men again, you know, listening to this podcast now that hear

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:14.280
the idea that they need to embrace their feminine, that go, oh gosh, no, it will scare them, it will

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:26.760
it will appear to hurt their identity, their sense of self, it'll make them feel weaker,

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:31.080
maybe it'll make them feel like they have, they lack purpose if they're not that masculine,

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.720
because a lot of, a lot of us as men, a lot of our sense of purpose comes from being

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.240
competitive, from winning, from being strong, apparently, that's how it feels anyway.

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:48.360
But what is masculine? I mean, if masculine is to protect, for example, because we have the strength

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.800
or the masculine has the strength, can that protection happen without empathy?

01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:02.840
How can you protect if you don't have empathy? You need the feminine empathy to be able to protect.

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:11.240
If the masculine is to solve a problem, can you solve the problem without actually identifying

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:17.800
the problem? You need intuition and sensuality, and right, if the masculine is about safety and

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:28.040
survival, how can you do that without living, without beauty, without, you know, art, all of

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.360
that is in the feminine. Your comment is right, by the way, but it is not because of any difference

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.400
between the masculine and the feminine. Men will, will feel less comfortable with this,

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:43.160
because women have been sadly pushed to live in their masculine, to survive in this hyper masculine

01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:50.920
world. I will tell you honestly, and I say that with 100% honesty, you know, honesty of that view,

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:57.400
I thought to myself that I was intelligent. Until four and a half years ago, I started to

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:04.120
empower my feminine. And I promise you, I'm 10 times more intelligent. I was in my left brain

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:09.800
doing all of the analysis, thinking I'm a smart person. But I was doing all of the analysis,

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:14.920
all of the wrong inputs. The feminine gives you the inputs. The feminine gives you the,

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.440
the picture of the reality, the, the inclusion, the big, the big view of life. You can't see that

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:28.120
with your narrow-minded, linear brain. And I think the reality is that men who are most successful

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:34.760
ever in changing the world, believe it or not, are more in their masculine, feminine than their

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.720
masculine. Anyone has that, has ever changed the world, has been more in their feminine than

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:45.640
your masculine. The example I gave when we spoke about this Steve Jobs. Most people think that

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:51.320
Steve Jobs was an amazing successful CEO because he was pushy. He was, you know, a bit obnoxious

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:56.440
actually sometimes. Not at all. The reason Steve Jobs was Steve Jobs is because of his feminine

01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:03.000
qualities, his appreciation of beauty, his appreciation of his creativity, his art, his

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.400
appreciation of color and shape, his empathy to his user's needs. All of these are what made

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:14.520
Steve Jobs that amazing visionary that he was. Obnoxious, by the way, pulled it back a little

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:21.720
bit. Gandhi, even though sometimes Gandhi is contested, but Gandhi's success is not in saving

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:26.360
his nation through the masculine qualities. If it was the masculine qualities, he would have

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:35.560
rallied a billion people to kill the Brits. No, he went into a peaceful, nonviolent, an empathy,

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.920
an attempt to make things work through communication. All of these are feminine qualities.

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:47.240
And somehow we forget in our narrow-minded, hypermasculine world, because we've narrowed

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:52.760
everything to dollar signs. So productivity and profit and all of that is dollar signs.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:58.440
And so if that's the target, yes, doing more, producing more, selling more is a good way to

01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:05.240
go. But the reality is anyone who's ever made the world better, not richer, did it by living in

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.880
their feminine first. How does one tap into their feminine side? Because I think it's important to

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:15.560
also say, because these words have been associated with genders for so long, but a woman or someone

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:20.840
that's trans can also be too much in their masculine side and vice versa. A man or someone

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:24.840
that's trans would identify as whatever gender can also be too much in their feminine side.

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:31.480
But so how does someone tap in more to their feminine self? Is there an activity? Is it just

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:37.720
a choice we make? So I think it first requires an exercise of awareness. And actually,

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.240
in that little voice in your head, in that chapter specifically, I have quite a few

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:49.640
awareness exercises. Those awareness exercises start by recognizing what's the feminine.

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:56.200
And that's a beautiful exercise, a beautiful exercise that you can actually experience if you

01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:04.440
invited a couple of friends over that are feminine in their actions most of the time,

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:07.960
and a couple of friends that are masculine in their actions all of the time,

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:15.560
and allocated proper time for each of them to solve a problem. And observe the behavior. You

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:22.600
will find incredible differences between the masculine side, man or woman, it doesn't matter,

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.840
which will jump in and say, okay, we're going to carry this and then take it 10 steps away from

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:32.760
here and then we're going to do this and lift it on the shelf right away. When the feminine will say

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:40.920
things like, I feel that this might be a little heavier for John than it is for Jack. And I sense

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:47.400
that if we can collaborate around it as one being, we can do this slightly different. Sometimes they'll

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:54.680
say things like, why do we have to do this at all? Isn't there a bigger world where maybe we could

01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:02.200
just keep it here? And by that observation, you'll start to identify the qualities.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.400
That's number one. Number two is what I call the appreciation exercise. The appreciation

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:14.440
exercise is to flip roles. It's to sit in front of you and say, Steve, how would you solve that

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:20.760
problem? And then wait and then tell you, how would you solve it if you were Jackie? And that

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.640
appreciation exercise basically starts to get you to say, oh my God, there is another way,

01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.280
and that other way is not really me. It's Jackie's way, but it's interesting. And then the third is

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:35.240
practice, practice, practice, practice. I tell you openly, I've been empowering my feminine for

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:40.520
the last four and a half years, now probably five years. And my biggest exercise for the last two

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:45.000
years has been an exercise of flow. We spoke about that at the beginning. The idea of flow

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:53.800
is the truth of the feminine. The feminine is life itself. It's flowing, it's gushing across

01:55:53.800 --> 01:56:02.120
life, across the world, across territories, across times and stories. And we, if we live

01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.720
in our masculine, we go like, nope, not going there. This is not my place. This is my place. I'm

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:14.920
going there. And I liken it always with a river, a raging whitewater river. If you put the masculine

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.920
in the boat, the masculine will take the water, the push it because they want to go there. They

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.600
want to be right there. The feminine will just hold the arm and basically say, okay,

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.840
the river is going. I just need to balance it every now and then with one strike, just to

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:38.760
stay on track. But it's okay to take a little longer with the river to get to where I want to be.

01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:46.360
And that massive difference, I'm sorry to say, and I'm someone who associated with the masculine

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:52.840
for a very long time is stupid, honestly stupid, because suddenly somehow you realize that life

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:59.640
itself is talking to you through your feminine. Life itself is saying, let go. I'll do things.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:07.480
Okay. I'm much more powerful, mighty wheels. I can do stuff. Just let go a little. Just flow with

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:15.240
me a little. And if you manage to do that, I chose flow. I think there are several other major

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.960
pillars of the feminine. One of them is inclusion, as I say. So relating to others, choose that if

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:26.040
you want to. One of them is temporal. The masculine is very linear. We associate with the arrow of

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:32.440
time where the feminine is very rhythmic. We associate with cycles. And so if you can actually

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:37.720
see the difference between them, that's a very interesting exercise. I think creativity and

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:44.440
playfulness and breaking the rules sort of, I think paradoxical thinking. To me, these are the

01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:52.440
big five pillars. Paradoxical thinking is to be able to be humble enough to embrace that two

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.640
opposing stories are true. Two opposing facts can actually exist together.

01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:04.840
Interesting. And the role of the masculine. Amazing. The role of the masculine energy.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:10.920
So that's a beautiful question. So the problem we had with the movement of feminism,

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:15.080
and I say that with love and respect, is that it demonized the masculine.

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:21.400
Now, what needs to be demonized is overdoing the masculine. So strength is good.

01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.880
That is me sometimes, by the way, I have to admit. I definitely overdo the masculine. My

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:28.680
girlfriend tells me as well, she goes, she'll literally say it like that though, because she's

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:36.440
very in touch with her feminine masculine energy, you'll say you're being too in the masculine

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:43.800
right now. Yeah, you know what's one of the most common things I'm told by a woman who's

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:51.240
uncomfortable with how her boyfriend's behaving is he's unable to be available emotionally.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:57.400
Yeah, of course, we suffer from that. That's a consequence of toxic. Absolutely. So let's talk

01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:02.920
about this concept because it's very important. There is no demonizing of a quality. Linear

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:08.440
thinking is a wonderful quality. If you can think about a problem linearly, that's a wonderful

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:13.720
quality. Overdoing it makes you stubborn. You understand it's the overdoing that's the problem.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:20.120
It's strength. Wonderful. You overdo strength, you become violent. We don't want the overdoing.

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:26.600
And what should be demonized is overdoing that. It's overdoing anything, including, by the way,

01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:35.640
overdoing the feminine. So if you're intuitive, it's a wonderful quality. But if you're too

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:43.720
much intuition, you're ignoring linear facts and analysis. If you're, let's say, paradoxical,

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:49.720
one of my favorites, as I always say, if you can embrace paradoxes, it's a wonderful quality.

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:54.680
It gives you double the amount of information to analyze if you want to do analytical thinking.

01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:00.920
But if you overdo it, you become a little irrational. If you're disciplined as a masculine

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:08.520
quality or not disciplined at all, you become irrational. So overdoing something or underdoing

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:14.040
something is not good for any of us. What is the right amount of doing something, by the way?

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:22.120
It's how you are configured. So I am much more empathetic and maybe creative

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:34.360
and maybe playful than I am paradoxical. I am much more in linear thinking and control

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:41.880
than I am in flow. This is why I work on my flow, believe it or not, through neuroplasticity.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:45.960
So what I'm doing with my life now for the last two years is I'm living a life of flow.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.520
I'm allowing life to tell me what to do. And instead of my hyper-engineered mathematical

02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:55.800
brain saying, nope, that's not the way it should be done. I've done my analysis. It's 37%. I'm going

02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:02.360
to do this. I start to listen and say, hey, I'm going to make the decision of it's 37 or not.

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.680
In a couple of weeks' time, no harm done if I was wrong, but intuition is beautiful.

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:14.200
It's hard to uncondition oneself, but it goes back to this point about rewiring our brains

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:21.000
by repetition. And when I think about being more in my feminine energy and my feminine

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:31.960
qualities and characteristics, it is achieved by repetition, by opening up to that side of me

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:38.520
and spending more time wiring myself to in that way.

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.800
Which I think is so important. It's funny because I know there'll be a lot of people

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.040
listening to this that either don't understand or have kind of misunderstood because we're

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:49.400
using terms that come with like stigma. When we think of femininity or when we think of

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:55.400
masculinity, there's connotations with that. But it's so unbelievably true. And if people

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.800
have listened to this podcast, they'll know it's true. We had Terry Cruz on here who talked about

02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:05.160
his masculinity and how that became incredibly harmful to him and destructive and risked his

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:08.920
relationships and everything that mattered to him. We had Patrice ever talk about how

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:14.440
early experiences that made him lean towards masculinity to help him survive,

02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.600
being abused by his head teacher and watching his brothers and sisters die because of drug

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:25.000
addiction on the streets of France, made him turn more to that masculinity as a tool for survival.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.920
But then that cost him so dearly because he lived out of balance to one day sat with his partner,

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.880
she said, there's something not right with you. There's something not right with you.

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:40.120
He resisted, he resisted, he resisted, then boom, burst into tears. And that's the moment where he

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:46.200
opened up. You see it, you see it and you know it. And by the way, I think in reality,

02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:53.800
what I'm asking for is now that the world has finally accepted gender diversity and fluidity

02:02:53.800 --> 02:03:00.840
and so on. I'm asking us not to be more categorized. I'm asking us to stop saying,

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.400
so I'm category A, category B, category D, because we've just moved from man,

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:12.520
woman to more categories now. I'm asking us to say that Moe is unlike anyone else in his mix

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.720
of masculinity and femininity. I'm 58 percent in certain qualities of the feminine, I'm more than

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.000
others. And you could be 42 percent in other qualities of the feminine and more than others.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.640
And I think the idea is to say each and every one of us is an individual, each and every one of us

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:35.960
is a category of their own. Everyone, the only category I fit in is I'm a Moe. That's it. That's

02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:41.880
my category. And that category includes a beautiful blend of qualities that I can use that are not

02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:49.080
any better or any worse than anyone else. Those qualities that I blend together might be amazing

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:55.160
for this podcast conversation, but horrible at making pizza. I don't know. And I think the

02:03:55.160 --> 02:04:01.560
reality is if you can become true to that reality of who you are, you'll become the best at that

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:06.840
that you're supposed to do in life. And without that balance, you will always, always feel incomplete.

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:16.120
Moe, you've written what is another legendary book on a very related but incredibly foundational

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:22.360
topic, which is our thoughts and that little voice in our heads. And I think if this conversation is

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.640
a flavor of the book, then it is, I think in everyone's view that's listening, a must read.

02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:32.840
You know, it's funny that we, I talk about time being the single currency that we can allocate to

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:39.080
determine the outcomes of our lives, but thoughts are the... Interesting. The other thing that is

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:45.320
determining how we spend that currency. Yeah, I think, I think time is the rhythm of your song,

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:50.280
the song of your life. And thoughts really are the lyrics that you put on top of it. They are the

02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:59.560
melody. They are, they are, as we spend a minute of our life thinking a certain thought, that minute

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:05.480
completely shapes how the song of your life is going to be. It's quite interesting how we ignore that.

02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:11.320
And so maybe, maybe thoughts are the most important thing. And what this book does is it

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:19.960
helps us to adjust the code that runs our brains. At the last line in your book, you say

02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:25.640
I have one last selfish request. Please find the compassion in your heart to want happiness for

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:32.280
my wonderful son, Ali and wise teacher. Send him a prayer, a generous wish that he is happy

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:38.760
wherever he is right now. He started it all and he truly was the kindest, happiest human I have

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:46.200
ever known. I'll keep working on mine for Ali. Why did you bring that up? We were having an easy

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:57.640
conversation. Yeah. So yeah, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for what he taught me. And I wouldn't

02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:02.280
be here if it wasn't for the example he set. And I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for him

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:12.600
leaving us. And, and I, it's interesting that I told, I may have told you this once before that

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:16.440
I write the last sentence of every book before I write the rest of the book.

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.560
Yeah. And I, I have to say I have been

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:30.920
blessed with so many people that send me messages that say I love Ali. And yeah, I feel that

02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:38.600
if it was that, only that, that I got from the work I've done, then I've lived. It's,

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:43.720
there is nothing worse more. And, and, and, but I'm getting so much more. I'm getting so much

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:51.960
purpose if you want, but I don't want to be forgetting him in that purpose. I think that's

02:06:51.960 --> 02:07:01.160
where I stand today that I'm so driven by what I'm trying to achieve. And he's been away for

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:07.960
seven years, almost eight years now. So I once again need him to be part of our journey to

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:16.200
so yes, please send him a happy wish. The work he's done through you is truly magical.

02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:17.800
Through you is the exact right word.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:27.720
It's funny when, when we spoke about the idea of control being a masculine quality. Only when I

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:35.560
let go, only when I let go that life, whether with him or through him, or maybe he's the boss,

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:41.480
I have no idea, but what I've, what I've accomplished was so much more than what I did

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:47.000
when I was trying to control everything. And it's because of how he showed me to do, to do this.

02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:55.640
As you know, we have a closing tradition on this podcast.

02:07:55.640 --> 02:08:00.280
Oh, I should have prepared for that. Oh my God, I didn't think about this.

02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:05.000
It doesn't matter. Sometimes, you know, a lack of preparation leads to the best

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.200
outcomes. Okay, question is,

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:15.400
oh, that's not encouraging, Steve.

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.480
Oh, so I really like this question. It's very fitting, I think.

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:24.280
The previous guest wrote for you, what is the greatest wealth in your life?

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:31.800
What was not the greatest wealth was all of the money, all of the cars, all of the

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:39.320
things. It was a waste of life, I promise you. And I know most people will say, yeah,

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.200
you say that because you had it. When you have it too, you will feel the same. It was a total

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:53.560
waste of life. When you wrote in your book that we come to this life with 500,000 chips, you said,

02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:59.720
remember, you wrote 80 hour, if you live 80 years, you will have 500,000 hours of active life or

02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:05.640
something like that. And that this is your wealth. This is what you come to the, to the world with

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.880
and you place those chips hour by hour. The thought that came to my head was I was born a millionaire.

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:19.720
500,000 hours is a lot of hours. But then you turn, you take that cash and you turn it to equity.

02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:24.280
It's really interesting how you take those hours and by placing those chips,

02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:32.200
you turn one chip into equity, into something that lasts. And the things that I know last are

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:39.320
experiences, knowledge, and love. And I promise you, we will never acquire anything more important

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:46.360
than any of those three. In an interesting order, actually, they are love, knowledge, and experiences.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:54.520
So, so what we, what we, what we go through in all of our life is we do tons of things

02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:02.200
that we think are going to acquire us, one of those three, you know, unhappiness, of course.

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:09.320
But, but in reality, it's so much easier to acquire those three directly. The biggest wealth you

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:16.440
will ever have are a set of experiences that can't be repeated, some knowledge that can be

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:23.640
beneficial for yourself and those around you. And the feeling of love, which I have been overwhelmed

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.360
with. I mean, I can tell you, I'm the richest man I know by far from the number of kind messages that

02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:36.360
I get from people saying, you know, we love what you do, we appreciate your, your, your attempt to

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:42.040
make the world better. That love, I think, is the biggest wealth I have ever acquired. And I

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:49.000
always say, Ali and I am my daughter, definitely have been the biggest love of my life, for sure.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:57.160
And when Ali left to take that life away, I feel that the fairness of life replaced it with the

02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:02.920
life, with the love of hundreds of thousands of people. Which interestingly, I'm so grateful for,

02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:08.680
but it's almost exactly barely enough to balance the love that I have for him.

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:14.200
And so, yeah, maybe, maybe we should spend our life acquiring more of these.

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:17.560
Thank you.

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:25.320
I had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast. For many years, people have been

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:31.320
asking for a coffee-flavored hul. And quite recently, hul released the iced coffee caramel

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:36.440
flavor of their ready-to-drink huls. And I've just become hooked on it over the last couple

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:41.240
of weeks. And now I'm drinking that as well as the protein. Make sure you try the new ready-to-drink

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:46.680
flavors. The caramel flavor is amazing. The new banana flavor as well as amazing. And obviously,

02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.640
as I said, the iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real smash hit. So check it out.

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.240
Let me know what you think on social media. I see all of your tags and Instagram posts and

02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:11.160
tweets about hul. Back to the podcast.
