0	4720	Financial stress on the parents translates into physiological stress in the children.
4720	7360	They didn't inherit anything in terms of a disease.
7360	9040	They're just reacting to the environment.
9760	12560	People call Dr. Gabomate the people whisperer.
12560	14720	Legendary thinker and bestselling author.
14720	19680	He's highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development.
19680	23120	The evidence linking mental illness and childhood adversity
23120	26640	is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.
26720	29520	Any average physician doesn't hear a word about that.
29520	30480	It's astonishing.
30480	32880	I can give you the example of Donald Trump.
32880	34400	I mean, his father was a psychopath.
35040	36400	You are the enemy of the people.
36400	36880	Go ahead.
36880	40960	For him, these were not choices so much as survival techniques.
40960	44160	And that's the mark of a traumatized child, a denial of reality.
45360	48160	What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?
49600	51360	My grandparents were killed in Auschwitz.
51360	53280	And my mother and I barely survived.
53360	57040	And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger.
57040	61120	The sense, I guess, that I'm being rejected and abandoned because I'm not good enough.
61120	63920	How did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?
64480	65520	Any number of ways.
65520	68320	See, trauma, as I define it, is not about what happens to us.
68320	71680	It's about what happens inside of us as a result of what happens to us.
71680	76400	It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our relationship, our mental health, and so on.
76400	78960	How does one go about correcting that?
78960	80480	It's a multi-layered answer.
80480	81040	First of all.
84160	87520	Before this episode begins, I just want to say a huge thank you to all of our new subscribers.
88160	92000	74% of you that watch this channel didn't subscribe before.
92000	94320	And we're now down to about 71%.
94320	97440	So that helps us in a number of ways that are quite hard to explain.
97440	100720	But simply, the bigger the channel gets, the bigger the guests get.
100720	102640	So if you haven't yet subscribed to The Diary of a CEO,
102640	106320	if I could have any favors from you, if you've ever watched this show and enjoyed it,
106320	108400	it's just to please hit the subscribe button.
108400	111120	Without further ado, I'm Stephen Butler.
111120	112960	And this is The Diary of a CEO.
112960	114560	I hope nobody's listening.
114560	116880	But if you are, then please keep this to yourself.
124400	125840	My dear little man.
127280	130640	Only after many long months do I take it in hand, the pen,
131200	135840	so that I may briefly sketch for you the unspeakable horrors of those times,
136400	139600	the details of which I do not wish you to know.
139920	142960	Those are words that your mother wrote into her diary
142960	146800	in the 1940s during the Holocaust.
147760	150480	She wrote those words in April of 1945,
150480	156640	three months after the Soviet Army expelled the Nazis from Budapest,
156640	157840	which is where we live.
157840	162640	So she's referring to the previous year and the beginning of that year,
162640	165520	late 1944 and early 1945.
165520	166960	And in those diary entries,
167120	171520	she's addressing many of them to you directly as a baby.
171520	173120	She wrote a diary to me directly,
174240	178720	as if it was like a count of my life addressed to me.
180080	184000	You talk so much in all your books and much of your work
184000	186800	about the importance of that early context.
186800	190400	It's really been the centre point of all the writing that I've read recently.
190400	194080	And I know because it's so evident in everything that you've done
194080	197200	that that's been a key, your own early context has been a key inspiration
197200	200320	for why you've taken such an interest in these topics.
200880	202320	What was your early context?
202320	205040	What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?
206480	212800	So it's just a fact about human beings that the template that forms us
212800	216160	will affect how we see the world, how we understand ourselves,
216720	218720	how we relate to other people.
218720	223760	And that really template is our earliest months, even in Utah,
223760	227120	already in the womb, we're being affected by the environment,
227120	229920	but certainly in the early years when our brain is being formed
229920	232000	and our personality is taking shape.
233120	235600	And so that forms our worldview.
236320	239920	My worldview was, in my sense of self,
239920	243680	was shaped by the fact that at two months of age,
243680	247040	when I was two months of age, the German army occupied Hungary.
247040	249360	Hungary was the last country in Eastern Europe
249360	252160	where the Jewish population had not been exterminated.
252160	253120	And that was our turn.
253760	256000	The day after the German army marched into Budapest,
256000	259360	which was March the 19th, 1944,
259360	263200	the day after my mother called the pediatrician to say,
263200	265120	would you please come and see Gabor?
265120	266640	Because he's crying all the time.
266640	268240	And the doctor said, of course I'll come,
268240	270400	but all my Jewish babies are crying.
271280	274880	And so that the fact is that when mothers are stressed or in pain,
274880	277280	the infant feels all that and takes it personally,
277280	280720	and it becomes part of their template for how they view the world.
281440	283680	So that was that year, that's when that year began
283680	285520	in which my grandparents were killed in Auschwitz
285520	287600	and my father was away in forced labor.
287600	289280	And my mother and I barely survived.
289280	291520	And it's a story I've told many times,
291520	294560	but that's when my brain is developing
294560	296720	and that's when I'm forming my sense of myself.
297760	302160	And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger
302160	304320	and I don't see her for six weeks.
305120	307280	The sense I get is that I'm not wanted
307280	309280	and I'm being rejected and abandoned
309280	310320	because I'm not good enough.
311280	313440	That's how my life began.
314960	318160	So your mother gives you away for five to six weeks
318800	321040	in order to sort of save you from starvation
321040	324560	in a ghetto that she was going to, right?
324560	325040	That's right.
327040	331440	After your grandparents were killed in Auschwitz by the Nazis,
332400	335200	how do you know in hindsight that that moment
335200	338320	of those six weeks created that sense of abandonment in you?
339440	341440	I wouldn't say just at that one moment.
341440	344160	The children very much view themselves
344880	347600	through their interaction with their parents.
348400	351040	First of all, I had no father because he was gone.
351040	355040	I hadn't seen him, except very briefly
355040	357600	when I was a month old, but there was no father in the picture.
358320	360960	My mother was grief-stricken and terrorized
361600	364880	and full of war and worry about what's going to happen to us
364880	368720	and just the task of surviving each day.
371680	372800	She's not playful with me.
372800	374480	She's not smiling at me very much.
374480	375600	She's worried-looking.
375600	376640	She's stressed-looking.
378960	380560	The infant takes everything personally.
381120	382400	That's just the nature of the infant.
382400	384000	As infants, we're a narcissist.
384000	385360	We think it's all about us.
385920	388800	So when things are great, hey, we're great,
388800	390160	but my mother is unhappy.
391280	393040	It's because she doesn't want me
393040	395040	or I can't make her happy or I'm inadequate.
395840	400960	So that separation from my mother certainly set a template
400960	404240	for some of my relationship interactions with my spouse
404880	406080	decades later.
406080	410800	But the sense of not being good enough and being responsible,
412320	415680	that was inculcated in me throughout that whole first year of life.
416480	419040	So much so that in this book, The Myth of Normal,
419040	422560	I actually talk about an experience with the psychedelic mushrooms
424080	425360	with the therapist.
425360	427600	This is not that long ago, seven years ago, maybe,
429600	431280	when I'm at least 70 years old.
433040	437040	I'm in this therapeutic session with the cytocybin, the medicine,
437920	438720	and the therapist.
439520	442560	And I know that I'm 70 years old
442560	444400	and I know this is a therapy session
444400	448080	and I know her name and I know who I am in the world.
448080	450240	But at the same time, I'm experiencing myself
450240	452880	as a one-year-old baby and she's my mother.
453760	456960	And I start crying tears come down on my face
456960	459680	and I say, I'm so sorry I made your life so difficult.
461760	463680	Now that was an unconscious memory
463680	466560	of my sense of myself as a one-year-old
466560	469040	that I made my mother's life so difficult
469040	471120	because that's the way the baby interprets it.
472080	476480	So even if your mother loves you, which mind did, infinitely,
477040	479040	not that she always treated me the best way possible,
479040	480880	but she did love me.
480880	483920	And can you imagine what a great act of love
483920	485680	even giving me to a stranger in the street
485680	487440	would have been for her, you know?
488480	490400	But because of her own unhappiness,
490400	492160	I can only conclude that I'm not good enough.
493840	494560	And it's my fault.
497280	499920	70 years old, having that cytocybin experience
500000	501920	coming to that realization or having that sort of,
503200	505280	having that response to your therapist
505280	507040	where they take the role of your mother
507040	508240	and you're a one-year-old,
508240	512000	how does somebody at 70 years old go about correcting that,
512720	515040	that sort of interpretation you had
515040	516800	of that traumatic early event?
518160	520960	Well, by bringing up to the conscious level,
522640	525600	then when I noticed that sense of guilt or responsibility
525600	528560	in me, I say, oh, that's what it's about.
528640	533120	So it's a meaning to trauma as I define it.
533120	534480	It's not about what happens to us.
534480	536160	It's about what happens inside of us
536160	537600	as a result of what happens to us.
538240	540400	And so the wound in trauma means wound.
540400	543200	So the wound in this case is my sense of deficiency
543200	545600	or not being good enough, not being worthy enough.
545600	550000	Once I realize that, oh, this has got nothing to do with anything,
550640	554800	except this interpretation that I made with my own experience
554800	557280	all those years ago, then when I noticed it,
557280	558640	I can no longer believe it.
558640	561840	I don't have to any longer be a subject
562640	565040	to that interpretation of myself in the world.
565040	570000	So awareness is one step, it's not adequate,
570000	572720	but it's an essential step towards letting go.
573680	576400	That one belief that you weren't good enough,
576400	580480	how did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?
581840	586080	It made me a workaholic physician
586080	587600	because I had to keep proving my worth.
588160	588880	And it doesn't matter.
590480	591600	I don't know if you ever had an addiction,
591600	594800	but the nature of it is that we're trying to get from the outside
594800	599200	something that only can arise and fulfill us from the inside.
600000	603280	So when you're looking at it from the outside,
603280	605600	it's addictive because you get it temporarily,
605600	610720	but then that internal emptiness, that hole, never goes away.
610720	612720	So it has to be filled over and over and over again.
612720	615200	It can only be done so temporarily.
615200	617520	So it becomes runaway addictive.
617520	619440	So then work becomes an addiction
619440	621040	because I keep trying to prove my worth.
622000	626560	And it doesn't matter how many times I may show up
626560	629440	in a positive way at the beginning of someone's life,
629440	632400	at the end of somebody else's life, or anytime in between.
633200	634880	It never fills that emptiness
634880	638000	that my sense of lack of worthiness creates.
638800	640000	So that's one way it shows up.
640960	644400	Another way it shows up is if in my relationship
646160	648720	I don't feel as satisfied,
650240	653600	my wife doesn't please me the way I like her too,
656560	657520	then I get angry.
658080	659360	But why am I getting angry?
660960	664240	I'm getting angry because it's my sense of not being good enough
664240	665760	that's being now revealed.
666720	670640	That it gets uncovered, this self-acquisition.
672160	673920	But I get angry at her because her job
674080	675200	is to make me not feel that.
676160	679840	We're getting into this relationship for all kinds of reasons.
680480	682000	Some of them are conscious, some are not,
682000	685040	some are positive, some are come out of trauma.
685040	688880	And in my case, I want that relationship to prove to me how good I am.
689920	693040	So when it isn't proving that, then I get upset with my partner.
694560	697600	Except the gap is inside me, not inside.
697600	698640	It's not coming from her.
699280	702800	So it shows up, it showed up in my parenting.
702880	704000	It shows up all over the place.
705360	708240	I mean, I think both of those examples sound a lot like me,
708240	710960	especially the first one, the second one as well.
710960	712240	In what sense?
712240	715040	In the sense that I'm definitely a workaholic
715040	717920	and I thought, I think in the earlier phases of my life,
717920	721200	I sacrificed everything in this pursuit of becoming a millionaire
721200	724080	and having all this stuff and really getting this validation
724080	726160	sacrificed meaningful connections,
726160	728080	everything in the pursuit of this one thing.
728080	729920	Well, part of the toxicity of the culture
729920	734160	that I talk about in this book is that it actually rewards
734160	742480	that kind of emptiness or that desperate seeking to fill that emptiness.
742480	744560	Because you know, you get rewarded.
744560	745760	You make a lot of money.
745760	746960	A lot of people admire you.
748000	750160	You get to feel good about yourself.
750160	753600	Mind you, my guess is that good feeling is only temporary.
753600	757120	At least if my example is any guided,
757840	760080	feeling good because somebody from the outside values you
760080	763680	is only a temporary self for the wound that's inside.
764480	766400	But the world actually rewards it.
766400	768560	You know, so your workaholic doctor, great,
768560	770880	you make more money and all these people respect you.
770880	774160	Meanwhile, you're hollowing yourself from the inside
774160	775840	and you're not available for your family.
775840	779040	You know, so that's part of the craziness of this culture.
779040	782000	And it's like the hedonistic treadmill in a sense,
782000	785920	because you just never, enough is never enough, as you say.
785920	789520	So the last achievement needs to be surpassed
789520	793120	by a greater achievement for me to get an applaud or a clap.
793120	794400	I've never really made the connection
794400	796320	that the reason why I'm a workaholic is because
796960	799040	I am trying to prove to the world that I'm enough,
799040	801200	but I think that it's entirely true.
801200	801840	Yeah.
801840	807680	So in your case, like race and class in this society of inequality
807680	810720	are certainly traumatic, potentially traumatic inputs,
810720	812000	as I pointed in this book.
812000	816880	And to the degree that it affects people's physiology.
818160	820960	But also then, I don't know your family version
820960	823040	or what kind of relationship you have with your parents,
823040	824400	but there also may have been a sense,
825360	827600	like I got with my mom for reasons
827600	830480	and for whatever might have happened in your family.
830480	831840	Maybe you got the sense as well
831840	835600	that even in your family version, you weren't good enough somehow.
836480	839360	So my mom would scream at my dad for like seven hours a day.
839360	840640	And my dad would just sit there.
840640	840960	Okay.
840960	844000	And so my early memories of like looking at my mom and dad
844000	848480	are this kind of violent verbally, not like physically,
849120	851360	this incredibly stressful screaming,
851360	853040	one person screaming at the other.
853040	853920	That's what I remember.
853920	856080	But from reading what you've written in this book
856080	857120	and from what you've said now,
858240	861040	I actually might have learned sort of learned
861040	863840	to that I was the problem to some degree.
864800	866000	Children interpret it that way.
866000	866960	That's just the whole point.
866960	868640	That's what I mean about kids being narcissists.
869600	871360	I don't mean that in the negative sense.
871360	874640	I just mean, actually, they think it's all about them.
874640	878080	So if your mother is unhappy, it's your fault.
879600	880400	And you're not good enough.
880960	883440	So then you have to go out there and work to prove yourself,
883440	885520	to prove to the world and to yourself that you're good enough.
885520	887920	So that going back to your first question
887920	890320	about how these things show up in our lives,
890960	891920	that's how they show up.
894400	897600	And so 12 years old, you emigrate to Vancouver.
897600	897840	Yeah.
898960	901760	By 28, you joined the medical profession.
901760	902480	Yeah.
902480	906320	And you spend the next 32 years, roughly, working in medical degrees.
906320	907920	At 28, I went back to medical school.
907920	909680	Actually, I took a detour.
909680	910880	I was a high school teacher for a while.
911520	916160	And then I was 27, 28 when I started medical school.
916160	922080	At age 33, I think I began my medical career of 32 years.
922080	925120	And in those 33 years, what was your practice?
925120	926160	What did you specialize in?
926160	927440	What did you focus on?
928400	933520	So I was a family physician, which meant I delivered a lot of babies
933520	936240	and I looked after people's problems from beginning to the end of life.
936880	938640	I also worked in palliative care.
939280	942080	I was the director of a unit at the hospital,
942080	944800	which looked after people with terminal disease.
946240	952400	And I did, that was 22 years or so of my practice, 20, 22 years.
953120	956320	And then I switched gears altogether.
956320	960400	And I went to work in the downtown east side of Vancouver, British Columbia,
960400	963760	which is North America's most concentrated area of drug use.
963760	968080	We have more people coming from anywhere in the world are shocked
968080	968720	by what they see.
968720	970560	There are thousands of people in the streets,
970560	977440	injecting, selling, using, inhaling, ingesting drugs of all kinds.
977440	982400	And people are suffered the consequences of drug use in a society
982400	983840	that doesn't understand drug use.
983840	986960	So it punishes it, excludes it, ostracizes it.
986960	990960	So people get HIV from dirty needles and hepatitis C.
990960	993680	So this is the population, often they're homeless.
994240	997200	So that's the population I worked with for 12 years
997200	999360	to the end of my medical work.
1000400	1003360	That experience working with patients that were in palliative care.
1003360	1005440	So that's for anybody that doesn't know,
1005440	1007600	that's patients that are approaching the end of their life
1007600	1011280	that have terminal illnesses and that are aware that they're going to die.
1012400	1014000	What did that experience teach you?
1015440	1023760	It took an acceptance of one's lack of lack of omnipotence as a physician
1023760	1026880	because you go into the, you want to cure people, you want people to heal.
1027760	1029760	And now it takes the tremendous acceptance to say,
1029760	1031920	you know, we've reached the limit of our knowledge.
1032880	1035040	And that doesn't mean we can't help people,
1035040	1038240	but we certainly can't cure them, you know.
1038960	1041760	And so it taught me how to be with the inevitable.
1042800	1047600	And you're working with people who are in the process of dying.
1047600	1050560	I mean, by the way, who isn't in the process of dying, you know,
1050560	1054320	but people whose time is more limited than the rest of us.
1055120	1056960	Acceptance, you learn all of acceptance.
1057920	1059760	It challenges you to do your best
1060080	1064400	when you know your best isn't going to be saving anybody's lives,
1064400	1070160	but it's to help people live a life of as little suffering as possible
1070160	1071920	and as much dignity as possible.
1072560	1075440	So it really challenges the best parts of you to show up.
1076080	1082880	Patience, acceptance, intuition, personally taught me a lot to listen to people.
1083760	1087280	Interesting enough, people really want to be heard when they're dying.
1087840	1089600	They want to make sense of their lives.
1090240	1092720	They want to tell their stories, then I want their stories to be heard.
1094000	1096000	And so I listened a lot.
1096000	1099760	I just sat by the bedside and I listened, all that.
1100400	1105280	When you listened, did you hear any themes relating to regret
1105280	1108000	or things that actually mattered?
1108000	1111360	Because I always imagine if I was given such news
1111360	1114800	that my life was coming to an end and there was an approximate date,
1114800	1118160	it would be quite a powerful way of finally realizing
1118160	1120080	what truly matters and what never did.
1121120	1123760	People react to their impending death in different ways.
1123760	1128080	So there were some people who just fought it to the end.
1128080	1129920	They didn't really want to accept it.
1130720	1134720	But most people were more along the lines that you describe,
1134720	1136720	where they really get to see what's important.
1136720	1139280	And so I mentioned this a number of times.
1139280	1142320	It sounds strange and I don't recommend it.
1142400	1144320	But I've had patients say to me,
1144320	1147600	doctor, I don't know how to tell you this and I can't even explain it perhaps.
1147600	1150320	But this illness that's going to take my life
1150320	1152320	is the best thing that I've happened to me.
1152320	1155040	And they meant a couple of things about it.
1155040	1159600	They meant what you just said, about finding out what's really important in life.
1159600	1163840	In this book, The Myth of Normal, I enter you a young man called Will Pye,
1163840	1166320	who wrote a book called, Blessed with a Brain Tumor.
1167600	1169600	What kind of a blessing is that?
1170560	1171760	What kind of a blessing is that?
1172400	1174960	So I asked Will, what's the blessing?
1174960	1177680	And he said, it made me appreciate every moment.
1178320	1180400	It meant every time I talked to somebody,
1180400	1183680	I knew this might be the last conversation I'm going to have with them.
1183680	1186800	So it better be a human, genuine interaction.
1187680	1189520	So that was that aspect of it.
1190080	1194400	The other aspect of it was that, again, my view is,
1194400	1196880	as I pointed in this book and in previous works,
1196880	1200400	who gets sick and who isn't exactly accidental?
1200400	1202480	There are certainly, personally, patterns
1202480	1206640	based on traumatic experiences in childhood that make disease more likely.
1207440	1210560	And people very often realize that throughout their lives,
1211280	1212640	they had abandoned who they were.
1212640	1214720	They lived a life that wasn't meaningful for them.
1215760	1220480	And on death, they reconnected with themselves in an authentic way.
1220480	1222560	And that seemed to be worth a lot to people.
1223200	1226800	Again, I don't recommend that way of going to reconnect with yourself,
1227360	1230640	but people have certainly, I certainly saw it.
1230640	1232640	So those are the two big lessons.
1234640	1237520	After your 33 years in medical practice,
1238960	1241520	you described that you had a bit of a,
1241520	1245120	you kind of tuned into a creative calling, which was writing.
1245120	1247280	Well, I began to write when I was a physician.
1247280	1251920	So my first book on ADHD after I was diagnosed with it
1252000	1254800	was published in 1999 now.
1254800	1256720	So that was 23 years ago now.
1256720	1258960	So I began to write, and even before then,
1258960	1261680	I wrote because I wrote columns for newspapers.
1263280	1267360	But yes, there was a time in my life where the writing impulse,
1267360	1272880	which had been with me all my life, was stifled and stymied.
1273920	1276240	And so was I, because I had this frustration.
1277200	1279680	In fact, I had the sense that there's something I needed to express.
1280640	1283920	But I didn't know what, and they didn't know how.
1283920	1286640	And at some point I realized, oh yeah, I need to write.
1286640	1289760	So that began before I finished medical practice,
1289760	1297040	but it certainly has been essential to my ongoing unfolding as a human being.
1298080	1300160	I was so compelled by that when I read about that,
1300160	1305040	because I've started to really understand the value of creativity
1305040	1308240	in all of our lives, regardless of whether we have the luxury
1308400	1310560	of being called an artist or not.
1310560	1312720	And so what, in your view, is the importance of?
1313840	1316960	Well, you're singing my tune here, if I may say it that way,
1316960	1322160	because I code in this book, there's a great Hungarian Canadian
1322160	1326080	stress researcher called Yanush Selye, S-E-L-Y-E.
1326080	1329360	And Selye is the one who actually coined the word stress
1329360	1330800	in the sense that we use it today.
1330800	1333040	And he's the one that showed in the laboratory
1333040	1335120	how stress diminishes the immune system,
1335120	1340080	and this organizes the hormones and also rates the stomach
1340080	1341280	and all this kind of stuff.
1341280	1344800	But Selye also said, and I quote him here,
1345360	1347200	what is in us must out?
1347200	1348880	What is in us must out?
1349680	1352560	That we all have to follow our cave urges
1352560	1355280	in a way that nature prepared for us,
1355280	1359040	otherwise we can be hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.
1359600	1361520	I'm paraphrasing it very closely.
1362240	1366720	So we are created in the image of God.
1366720	1370240	I mean, what are your religious views are?
1370240	1373120	But that sense that we're created in the images of God
1373840	1377120	means that we are creators, because the essence of God is creation.
1377840	1382400	In fact, we call God the Creator, and we call the result of that creation.
1383360	1388400	If we're created, and if we're offshoots of that creative dynamic
1388400	1391200	in the universe, then it means that it's in us to create.
1391840	1394880	And whatever form that takes, I mean, you don't want to see me
1396960	1398400	do art unless you...
1400000	1403520	I can do a pretty good stick figure, by merit to a nurse.
1405360	1409680	So that creativity doesn't have to take the form of formal art,
1409680	1413440	but it does have to take some flow of something that's inside you
1413440	1414400	that needs to come out.
1415040	1419840	Otherwise, as Selye says, you get hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.
1419840	1422560	And so in that sense, everybody's got that creative urge,
1422560	1424800	and that may take the form of social intercourse.
1424800	1426320	It might take the form of gardening.
1426320	1431920	I don't care, communion with nature, athletic expression.
1431920	1436320	I don't care what, but there's somebody, everybody's got it.
1436320	1438240	And if people don't realize they have it,
1438240	1440640	it's only because life has hemmed them in and they're too busy.
1441200	1444320	And sometimes they are trying to make a living or trying to survive
1444320	1446000	or to disconnect it from themselves.
1446640	1447760	But it's in all of us.
1447760	1451520	And to the extent that we don't give it expression, we suffer.
1453040	1458160	One of the things that really hems it in is the prospect
1458160	1460080	that we might not be good at it,
1460080	1461920	because we think to express ourselves creatively,
1461920	1463840	we kind of join a competition of sorts.
1464400	1466000	And that's a trap we can fall into.
1466000	1469120	So if I'm going to DJ, I need to become a good DJ,
1469120	1471440	but in social comparison or else I don't want to...
1471440	1473200	But what I've come to learn is, in fact,
1473200	1477520	the act of DJing alone in my kitchen at midnight is the reward.
1478160	1480560	Regardless of outcome or whether there's a crowd there,
1480560	1481840	it's just me and my dog listening.
1482880	1484080	The expression is the reward,
1484080	1486560	not the achievement or the medal that I might get.
1486560	1487840	Yeah, not the external.
1487840	1490560	Well, look, I went through that in the writing of this book.
1490560	1496160	So here I am, this writer who writes about trauma and healing.
1496160	1499120	And all of a sudden I'm in a panic because I'm writing a book.
1499680	1503840	And I realized that the problem was that you talked about identifying with your work.
1503840	1505360	So I had identified with this book.
1506000	1507920	So the problem wasn't the book.
1509040	1511360	Because let's say I write the book and it's not a success.
1511360	1514480	I mean, okay, big headline in the Sunday Times.
1515120	1516480	Book, not a big success.
1517360	1519760	How big a big deal is that in the history of the universe?
1520640	1524480	But if I identify with the book and it's not going well,
1524480	1526960	then if the book fails, then I'm feeling as a person,
1526960	1531200	which then goes back to my very earliest concern about not being worth it.
1532160	1537440	So once I disidentified, once I said, no, this is just a book.
1538080	1540160	It may be a good book, it may be an important book,
1540160	1544080	maybe a book that doesn't hit the mark, but it's only a book.
1544640	1548000	And how it goes says nothing about me or my worth.
1548800	1551920	Once I could decouple that, then I could confidently and much more comfortably
1551920	1553120	go back to the writing of it.
1553120	1554240	But I went through that crisis.
1555200	1560080	It seems like a bit of a paradox that the lack of self-worth would motivate someone
1560560	1562640	to create great things because they want the approval,
1562640	1565200	but at the same time make the process so agonizing
1565200	1567120	because their self-esteem seems to be on the line.
1567840	1569360	All this sense of self-worth is on the line.
1570240	1573840	Well, that dynamic was in me once I realized it, I let go of it.
1573840	1575760	So it didn't dominate me in the end.
1575760	1578400	And then honest to God, by the time I finished the book,
1579120	1580800	I'm not just saying this in retrospect.
1580800	1583120	It's the best seller now in several countries.
1585760	1587520	I actually said to myself and I meant it.
1588240	1589120	Now I've done the book.
1590560	1591360	That's what matters.
1592240	1594000	I've said what was in me to say.
1594960	1598080	How the world reacts, I can't control.
1598080	1600960	And it doesn't actually matter on a fundamental level.
1600960	1602800	It's not that I don't want this book to be accessed.
1602800	1603920	I mean, success.
1603920	1606480	Of course I wanted to sell 10 zillion copies,
1606480	1612160	but that doesn't define myself worth or how I function in the world
1612160	1613760	or how I feel about myself.
1613760	1614720	Honestly, it does not.
1614720	1617920	And I understood that by the time I finished working on it.
1618880	1624480	So once it's done, it's out there doing its work or not doing its work.
1626320	1631440	But I don't have to hang my own sense of self on how the book does.
1632880	1635200	Because at that point, that's an outcome you can't control, right?
1635200	1638080	So trying to control that would be anxiety.
1639200	1639680	Yeah.
1639680	1640160	Oh yeah.
1640160	1641120	Well, you can't control it.
1641120	1641280	No.
1642400	1645360	Ten years this book took you to write.
1645920	1646800	Took me to prepare.
1647600	1649360	Took about three years to write.
1649360	1651280	You describe it as a calling.
1652560	1653920	The myth of normal.
1655600	1659280	Four words to sort of pull people in
1659280	1663200	and to in some way summarize a 550-odd page book.
1663200	1664640	Why those four words?
1664640	1665360	Why that phrase?
1666720	1669040	Can I pass from them to find a code on my cell phone?
1669040	1669760	100%.
1669760	1669920	Yeah.
1672320	1672800	So this is...
1673680	1676000	Are you familiar with the work of Eckhart Tolle?
1676000	1677360	Oh, Eckhart Tolle, yes.
1677360	1678000	Okay, yeah.
1678000	1680000	So Tolle lives in Vancouver like I do.
1680000	1682160	And in one of his books, he says,
1682800	1685440	the normal state of mind of most human beings
1685440	1688080	contains a strong element of what we might call
1688080	1690000	dysfunction or even madness.
1691120	1697600	So in medical parlance, normal means healthy and natural.
1697600	1699520	So there's a normal range of blood pressure,
1700240	1702560	normal temperature.
1703280	1704320	It's a range.
1704320	1705760	Outside that range, there's no life.
1706000	1708640	There's no health, either too high or too low.
1708640	1709120	You're gone.
1710400	1714960	So normal means it's equivalent with,
1714960	1717680	synonymous with, healthy and natural.
1719040	1722880	However, we make that same assumption that
1723920	1725920	out in society, what we used to,
1725920	1728880	what we call normal is also healthy and natural,
1728880	1730080	which is the myth.
1730080	1732000	Because I'm saying that in this society,
1732000	1735280	what we consider to be normal is neither healthy nor natural.
1735280	1737680	In fact, it's hurtful to us,
1737680	1741360	so that we're using the word normal in a way that
1743120	1746720	doesn't apply in a narrow medical sense.
1747600	1749680	It's accurate, but in a broader sense,
1749680	1752160	that which we're used to in this society,
1752160	1755120	we consider normal is just not good for us.
1756000	1757680	And norm is kind of a statistic,
1757680	1760720	or it's a kind of an average.
1760720	1762720	So if everybody, you have a dog,
1762720	1765920	if everybody in London mistreated their dogs,
1766640	1768880	and if you didn't, then you'd be abnormal.
1770880	1774880	So it's a myth to say that what is normal is healthy and natural.
1774880	1776400	That's what I mean by the myth of normal.
1776400	1778000	That's one thing I mean.
1778000	1778880	The other thing I mean is,
1779840	1782800	if we understand the actual science
1782800	1784400	of the unity of everything,
1784400	1786560	I'm not talking about spiritual insight here,
1786560	1789520	I'm talking about physiological science
1789520	1792640	that are physiology and psychology,
1792640	1795120	is very much affected by our life experiences,
1795120	1798640	being in utero, childbirth, early childhood,
1798640	1799760	and throughout the lifetime.
1800560	1802480	It also follows that illness and health
1802480	1804240	are not individual attributes.
1804240	1807120	They are actually manifestations of our relationships
1807120	1810640	and our situation in the world and our history.
1812560	1815040	That also means when these circumstances are abnormal,
1816240	1817760	you expect people to be sick,
1818560	1821520	you know, just as if you gave animals
1821520	1822880	something that wasn't healthy for them,
1822880	1824960	they'd be sick, that'd be what you'd expect.
1826160	1829760	So this idea that the people who are ill,
1829760	1831840	either physically or mentally abnormal,
1831840	1832960	I say no.
1832960	1834560	These are normal responses
1834560	1836560	to an abnormal set of circumstances.
1838000	1841920	And rather than being sort of those abnormal ones
1841920	1844560	and the rest of us, it's really a spectrum
1845280	1847040	that we're all, pretty much all on it.
1847040	1848240	So in those three senses,
1849040	1851840	this idea of normal is a myth,
1852720	1856720	and it's one that keeps us from seeing reality.
1858640	1861840	And we're all abnormal in some way.
1862720	1865280	So if maybe my attention is different,
1865280	1868960	maybe my interpersonal relationships are abnormal,
1868960	1871280	but in some way I'm going to be abnormal.
1871280	1872640	As it relates to treatments,
1872640	1874320	how do you think that the medical profession
1874320	1875920	and the psychological profession
1876000	1878640	would respond differently
1878640	1880960	if we removed this idea that there is a normal?
1882000	1884240	How would our approaches change to treating people?
1886480	1891280	Well, that's a multi-layered answer.
1892240	1895920	First of all, we would recognize that our diagnoses
1895920	1897600	are not explanations for anything.
1898480	1901120	So, you know, I've been diagnosed with ADD,
1901120	1904160	you know, legitimately so, as my first book was on it.
1906800	1909440	But it doesn't explain anything.
1910480	1914400	So I tune out easily, very easily, you know,
1914400	1916960	and sometimes when I don't, often when I don't want to,
1916960	1919920	but, you know, unless I'm highly motivated.
1921600	1924800	So you might say, this person has ADD,
1924800	1926320	how do we know because he tunes out a lot?
1927680	1928880	Why does he tune out a lot?
1928880	1930160	He's got ADD.
1930160	1932320	How do we know he's got ADD because he tunes out a lot?
1932320	1936320	So first of all, we have to understand that our understanding
1936320	1938560	of normal and what's outside the normal,
1938560	1940320	they don't, doesn't explain anything.
1941520	1944400	They can, they can describe,
1944400	1946320	if you describe my mental functioning
1946320	1949040	as that of somebody who's got an automatic tendency to tune out,
1949040	1949840	you'd be accurate.
1951920	1952880	So there's a description.
1953760	1955840	It's helpful as an explanation
1955840	1958640	as to why this person isn't behaving quote unquote normally.
1959760	1961600	It doesn't explain a thing.
1961680	1964640	Now, if you understood that I spent my infancy
1965280	1969200	under very difficult circumstances where I was very stressed
1969200	1971760	because of all the stuff I already talked about
1971760	1974240	and that tuning out was a normal response
1975600	1978880	to, to those circumstances as a way of protecting myself
1978880	1980000	from the stress of it all.
1980720	1982960	And this was happening when my brain was developing.
1983680	1986400	Then you'd understand there's nothing abnormal about my,
1986400	1987200	by tuning out.
1987200	1989600	In fact, it is the normal response
1989680	1991600	to a set of abnormal circumstances.
1992480	1993520	So that's the first point.
1994080	1996320	And I could go through the same kind of
1997040	2000560	dialectic with all manner of physical and mental diseases,
2000560	2001680	by the way, so-called.
2002800	2005760	The second point is-
2005760	2006800	Why do you say so-called?
2011120	2013120	Well, look, the disease model is,
2014320	2017200	as long as we understand it's a model, it's okay.
2017840	2021680	When we think it describes reality fully, it doesn't.
2022320	2030640	So, for example, we talk about mental illnesses.
2032320	2035600	And we're assuming that there's a kind of definite pathology there.
2036160	2037840	Just as in rheumatoid arthritis,
2037840	2040560	you can describe the inflammation of the joints
2040560	2044480	and the blood levels of certain antibodies being abnormal.
2045120	2051520	And hormonal levels being disturbed.
2053520	2055520	We're making the same assumption in mental illness.
2055520	2057440	There's no such evidence in mental illness.
2058000	2059920	There's no physiological parameters
2059920	2061760	that you can say somebody's got mental illness.
2062560	2065360	There's just been a study a few months ago
2065360	2066960	of thousands of brain scans
2068320	2070720	of people with mental illness diagnosis.
2070720	2073440	There's nothing diagnostic about the brain scans.
2074000	2076160	It's not like I can take an X-ray of a lung
2076160	2080320	and say that this lung is what we call consolidation
2080320	2083840	or fluid indicating inflammation.
2084640	2087600	There's nothing like that in mental diagnosis.
2087600	2089440	There's no blood tests you can do and so on.
2089440	2094400	So, illness is a model.
2096400	2101120	Somebody's really depressed, even suicidal perhaps,
2101120	2103200	and then might need pharmacological intervention,
2103200	2104480	which would really save their lives.
2105120	2106000	That may be true.
2108720	2110800	And in that sense, you may say that they're ill
2111680	2113600	as long as we realize that this is a construct
2113600	2114800	that we're applying here.
2114800	2117840	But there's no actual measurement of that.
2118400	2121840	That's at all similar to what we call physical disease.
2122640	2126000	But even in physical disease, we make certain assumptions.
2127680	2130880	For example, somebody has rheumatoid arthritis.
2131440	2135760	No, nothing wrong with that statement on the face of it.
2135760	2137040	But there's an assumption there.
2138240	2139920	The assumption is that there's this thing
2139920	2141120	called rheumatoid arthritis.
2141920	2143920	And there's this person called me.
2144560	2146400	And this person has this thing.
2146400	2148320	No, the example I often give.
2148320	2149200	Here's my cell phone.
2149200	2150240	I'm holding it in my hand.
2150240	2151360	I have a cell phone.
2151360	2152400	It's not part of me.
2152400	2153520	It says nothing about me.
2154160	2155840	It's a discrete object.
2156480	2158400	Its nature doesn't depend on my nature.
2159200	2159600	Nothing.
2161840	2164160	Is that true about rheumatoid arthritis?
2164800	2166800	Or is it more true to say, as I found out,
2167360	2170240	that this is a condition that shows up in people
2170240	2172480	with certain life experiences
2172480	2174320	in certain ways of functioning in the world?
2174960	2178480	And that because of the science documented unity
2178480	2181440	of mind and body and the impossibility
2182000	2184640	of separating the activity over emotional apparatus
2184640	2186000	from same or immune system,
2186000	2189200	because it's all one organismic unit.
2190160	2193760	Therefore, when the immune system turns against the body,
2193760	2195760	as it does in rheumatoid arthritis,
2195760	2197920	the immune system actually attacks the body.
2199200	2201760	Is that a thing that's got a life of its own?
2201760	2204640	Or is there a process that's happening inside that person
2204640	2206800	because of certain aspects of their lives?
2207760	2210320	Now, if I say it's the thing that happens to you,
2210320	2212480	then that thing has got a life of its own.
2212480	2214080	And that's how most doctors see it.
2214080	2215600	They see somebody with rheumatoid arthritis.
2215600	2217840	They say, okay, this is the kind you've got.
2217840	2219280	This is what's going to happen.
2219280	2222800	This is the only thing we can do is to mitigate the symptoms.
2223600	2224640	I find that's not true.
2225360	2228400	I find that the rheumatoid, by the not just I find it,
2228400	2229600	the science finds it.
2230160	2233920	The rheumatoid arthritis is very much related to stress and trauma.
2234640	2235840	And the more stressed there is,
2235840	2237760	the more likely it is to flare up.
2237760	2239680	And if people deal with that stress,
2239680	2242960	if they know how to prevent it, their illness abates.
2244000	2246400	Which means that it's not a thing that's separate.
2246480	2248320	It's a process that happens inside them.
2249200	2250480	This is a subtle concept.
2250480	2251920	I'm wondering if I'm explaining it clearly.
2251920	2252560	No, you are.
2252560	2254720	And it's really making me question
2254720	2257120	how much we misunderstand the relationship
2257120	2258480	between the mind and the immune system.
2259120	2261680	Because that's the real,
2261680	2263200	that's the important connection to understand
2263200	2266480	if you are to accept all the things you've just said.
2266480	2267920	Which we don't understand.
2267920	2269840	I don't think typically we understand
2269840	2271360	that my mind and my immune system
2271360	2273440	have such a close relationship.
2273680	2276320	Well, there's a whole new science
2276320	2277840	that studies those relationships.
2277840	2279440	It's called sacronorminology.
2280000	2282880	Which studies the interlinked unity
2282880	2285360	of the emotional apparatus of our brain and body
2285360	2287360	with the immune system, with the nervous system
2287360	2288800	and with the hormonal apparatus.
2289520	2291040	I mean, it's just so obvious.
2292240	2294240	I could change your hormonal state
2294240	2296080	in a split second right now
2296080	2297520	without touching you.
2297520	2299760	Just by screaming at you and threatening you.
2300720	2302400	That would necessarily create a change.
2302400	2303760	I mean, it's just clear
2303760	2305440	that our emotions are inseparable.
2305440	2307360	You know, and the other funny thing is,
2307360	2308560	well, several funny things.
2309760	2312160	How do we treat most conditions in medicine?
2312160	2313600	By the way, inflammation.
2313600	2315840	If you go to a dermatologist with the inflamed skin.
2316640	2318960	If you go to a rheumatologist with the inflamed joints.
2319520	2320960	If you go to a gastroenterologist
2320960	2322320	with the inflamed intestines.
2323040	2327200	If you go to a respirologist with inflamed lungs.
2328000	2330320	If you go to a neurologist with the inflamed nervous system
2330320	2331840	as in multiples grosses,
2331840	2333760	they're going to give you steroids
2334800	2336320	to settle the inflammation.
2336320	2338000	Now what are steroids?
2338000	2339600	They are stress hormones.
2340400	2342320	And you would think that as physicians,
2342320	2344640	we would ask ourselves, gosh,
2344640	2346720	we're treating everything with stress hormones.
2346720	2349040	Does stress maybe have something to do with this condition?
2349840	2351840	Now when you look at the scientific literature,
2351840	2354480	yes, yes, yes and yes.
2354480	2358240	So there's a great Canadian physician
2358240	2360240	actually united by Queen Victoria.
2360400	2362480	One of the great medical teachers of all kinds,
2362480	2363600	Sir William Osler.
2363600	2364960	And he said in 1890,
2364960	2367920	that rheumatoid arthritis is a stress-driven disease.
2368960	2372000	The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot
2372000	2374320	first described multiples grosses.
2374320	2377200	He said, this is a stress-driven condition.
2378800	2380720	And since then, there's been so much research.
2381440	2385600	So what I'm saying is that this way of looking at
2386320	2388160	what we call disease is a process.
2389120	2391440	It's so much more accurate scientifically, actually,
2391440	2393840	and understanding the mind-body unity.
2393840	2396960	And then naturally, when people are traumatized,
2396960	2399360	that has a huge impact on their physiology.
2399360	2400880	Their psychological trauma
2400880	2402880	has a huge impact on their physiology.
2402880	2403760	It's just science.
2404560	2408240	But it's science that's not taught to medical doctors.
2408240	2410560	It's just for some strange reason.
2410560	2414000	Well, the average physician never hears a single lecture
2414000	2416800	about, say, trauma and his relationship to illness.
2416800	2418960	And yet, there's studies internationally,
2418960	2421760	thousands of them showing those relationships.
2422560	2427680	So there's this strange gap between science and medical practice.
2427680	2430480	But it would change medical practice for the better.
2431520	2434000	Because what would happen if you went to a physician
2434000	2437360	and you presented with your symptom and they'd say,
2437360	2439920	okay, look, we'll give you such as this medication
2439920	2441360	to deal with your symptoms.
2441360	2445360	And then let's look at your life in the context that you live it
2445360	2448720	and see how the stresses that you may be taking on,
2448720	2450560	the traumas you may be carrying,
2450560	2452720	might be affecting the physiology of your body.
2454000	2456880	Now, they don't have to be all trauma therapists to do that.
2456880	2462400	They just have to raise the question and to begin the inquiry.
2462400	2464720	That'll make a huge change to that person's life
2464720	2466160	and to their disease process.
2467680	2469280	And clearly to their kids' lives as well,
2469280	2471280	because I remember reading in your book
2471280	2473520	about the study with the rats.
2474480	2476880	And how they, could you tell me about that study?
2476880	2478320	How the stress study with the rats
2478320	2483680	and how the parents' treatment of a child impacted their stress response?
2483680	2485680	And then also they passed that on, which I think was...
2485680	2486880	Yeah, that was a very interesting study.
2486880	2489280	It was done in Canada at McGill University.
2491120	2495520	I think maybe something in the last 20 years, early 2000s, I think.
2496320	2501360	And they looked at how other rats interacted with their infants,
2501360	2502080	their newborns.
2503760	2505360	This is a process called grooming,
2506160	2508880	in which the mother rat licks the infant
2509440	2514640	or in the perineal area, you know, in the genitalia.
2514640	2516080	This is shortly after birth.
2516080	2518160	These mother rats just started licking their infants.
2519280	2521760	Some of the rats did it in a more efficient
2521760	2524000	and caring kind of way than other mother rats.
2526000	2528800	Those that had the better kind of caring,
2528800	2529920	the better kind of grooming,
2530480	2535920	grow to be calmer and respond to stress in more functional ways,
2535920	2541280	than those little rats who, as neonates,
2541280	2544560	had not been given that same kind of efficient
2544560	2548160	and quite as caring grooming.
2550480	2554800	And what they found out in the brains of those adult rats
2554800	2558320	who had been groomed one way or the other as infants,
2558320	2559920	the stress apparatus was different.
2559920	2562000	Certain receptors were the stress hormones.
2562000	2564560	So one of them could call themselves more easily than the other.
2565840	2567760	What was interesting, as you might say, was so what?
2567760	2568880	That she's genetic.
2568880	2572400	The calmer mothers passed on their genes to their infants.
2572400	2573440	No, they didn't.
2573440	2576640	Because if you took the infants of mothers who groomed beautifully
2577280	2578720	and put them with mothers who didn't,
2579280	2582240	and conversely, you took the infant rats of mothers who
2583920	2586640	didn't groom so well, but you put them with mothers who did,
2589200	2591440	it changed the brain for the adult.
2591440	2592400	It changed the brain.
2592400	2595760	It changed the genetic functioning, not the genes,
2595760	2596960	but the genetic functioning.
2596960	2598240	This is called epigenetics,
2598240	2601040	how genes are turned on and off by the environment.
2601760	2605120	And then those mother and those rats who were groomed well
2605680	2609200	as infants, it doesn't matter what the original mother was,
2609200	2611440	but those rats who were groomed well,
2611440	2613120	they went on to groom their infants
2613840	2615840	in exactly the way they had been groomed.
2615840	2617840	So this is how we pass on our parenting stuff.
2618560	2621680	For one generation to the next, both behaviorally,
2621680	2624800	but also through the turning on or off of certain genes.
2626080	2630080	So in essence, how nurturing our parents were has a big impact
2630080	2634320	on our own ability to handle stress positively or negatively.
2634320	2635120	Oh, absolutely.
2635120	2636320	And then we pass that down to our children.
2636320	2637360	How stressed our parents were,
2638000	2640400	how they reacted to our own stress as as infants.
2641920	2644880	That has everything to do with how our brains handle stress later on.
2645760	2648240	And so some people just don't handle stress very well.
2648240	2649920	They don't handle the frustration very well.
2650640	2652720	You should have seen me this morning at the hotel
2652720	2654240	when the swimming pool didn't open in time.
2656560	2659360	But I was a lot better than I might have been years ago.
2660800	2663200	But yeah, our stress responses are very much programmed
2663200	2665760	by our early developmental experiences.
2667760	2669280	Speaking about our early experiences,
2669280	2671120	the first word in the sort of subtitle of your book
2671120	2672000	is the word trauma.
2672960	2675600	It's a word that I've talked about a lot on this podcast
2675600	2677360	and I've had a lot of people hear that have opened up
2677360	2678320	about their traumas.
2678320	2679840	How do you define trauma?
2679840	2681680	I know society has defined it in its own way,
2681680	2683360	but how do you define it, the word?
2685200	2686640	I define it very specifically.
2687600	2689200	It's not something bad that happens to you.
2692720	2694880	I went to this movie last night and I was traumatized.
2694880	2695440	No, you weren't.
2695440	2698800	You were just sad or you had some emotional pain,
2698800	2699840	but you weren't traumatized.
2701040	2702160	Trauma means a wound.
2702160	2703520	That's the literal meaning of the word.
2703520	2705360	It's a Greek word for wounding.
2705440	2707840	So trauma is a psychological wound that you sustain.
2708640	2711680	And it behaves like a wound.
2711680	2715280	So on the one hand, a wound, if it's very raw,
2715280	2717200	if you touch it, it just really hurts.
2717760	2720560	So if I have a wound around not being wanted,
2721840	2724640	then, or the belief that I'm not,
2725520	2728880	then decades later, if anything reminds me of that,
2728880	2731920	it hurts as much as it did when I originally incurred the wound.
2732560	2735680	So in one sense, trauma is an unhealed wound.
2735680	2737200	That touch, we get triggered.
2737200	2738800	That's what triggering means, by the way.
2738800	2742320	Some old wound gets activated or touched.
2742320	2744240	And the other thing that happens to wounds
2744240	2745520	is that they scar over.
2746240	2748800	And scar tissue has certain characteristics.
2748800	2749600	It's thick.
2750400	2752480	It has no nerve endings, so there's no feeling in it.
2752480	2753680	So people traumatized.
2753680	2755040	Disconnected from their feelings.
2756880	2757920	Scar tissue is rigid.
2757920	2759200	It's not flexible.
2759200	2761440	So we lose kind of response flexibility.
2761440	2765120	So when something happens, we tend to react in typical stereo,
2765120	2770640	typical predictable dysfunctional ways because of the rigidity.
2770640	2774240	And scar tissue doesn't grow like healthy flesh.
2774240	2777040	So people who are traumatized tend to be stuck
2777040	2782000	in emotional states that characterized their development
2782000	2783280	when they were traumatized.
2783280	2786000	So when somebody says to you, don't be such a baby,
2787920	2790480	doesn't sound very pleasant, but there's some truth to it.
2790960	2793920	It means that you're probably reacting according to the lines
2793920	2796240	of some wound that you sustained as an infant.
2796240	2800160	And now you're reacting as if that wound was happening all over again.
2800160	2803280	This is what one of my friends in the trauma world,
2803280	2805200	Peter Levine, calls the tyranny of the past.
2806080	2809360	So something happens in the present and we react
2811360	2813920	as if we're back there in the past when this first happened.
2814640	2816400	And we're not in the present moment at all.
2817360	2819360	And I was trying to figure out how many people,
2820160	2824640	as a percentage of the population, have trauma.
2824640	2827920	But then I read this stat with 60% of adults
2827920	2830240	say that they've had sort of a traumatic early upbringing
2830240	2832480	or whatever or traumatic events from their childhood.
2832480	2834320	But then I thought maybe everybody has trauma.
2835120	2837760	It depends on how we understand trauma.
2838400	2842000	So if we understand trauma, it's only the really terrible things
2842000	2844160	that happen to people, which do happen to people.
2844560	2848480	You know, in the book I talked about a British friend of mine
2848480	2849760	who had no living in Canada.
2850800	2854160	They are a yoga teacher and a meditation teacher
2854720	2857920	and a psychologist and an artist actually.
2858640	2860960	And they grew up in some orphanage here in Britain
2860960	2864640	where they were racially taunted every morning.
2864640	2866560	You know, words that are in the book
2866560	2868880	by her permission, which I'm not going to cite here publicly.
2869920	2871840	And that gave her a sense of deficient,
2871840	2873520	a sense of self that I'm just not good enough,
2873520	2874880	that I don't belong and so on.
2875600	2877360	There's those obvious traumas
2877360	2879680	or the obvious trauma of being sexually abused.
2879680	2883760	So men who are sexually abused according to Canadian study
2883760	2885840	have tripled the rate of heart attacks as adults,
2886480	2888560	you know, and all kinds of physiological reasons.
2889120	2890080	But that should be the case.
2890640	2895840	So there's those self-evident, big T traumas
2895840	2899200	that we call big T trauma, T with a capital T,
2899200	2900240	trauma with a capital T.
2901120	2903120	There's a certain percentage of the population
2903120	2905360	much larger than we think, subject to that.
2905360	2909120	If you include all the known factors
2909120	2912320	such as physical, sexual or emotional abuse,
2912320	2916000	spanking, by the way, has not been shown to be as traumatic
2916000	2919120	as harsher forms of physical abuse.
2919120	2922800	Spanking, which is still recommended by so-called experts
2922800	2925840	who should remain unnamed for the moment.
2926640	2929440	The death of a parent, violence in a family,
2930640	2932080	parental violence against each other.
2933040	2936080	A parent being jailed, a parent being mentally ill.
2937280	2940160	Did I say a parent being addicted, a rancorous divorce?
2940160	2942640	These are the identified big traumas, big T traumas,
2942640	2946480	not to mention poverty, not to mention extreme inequality,
2947600	2948560	war and so on.
2950320	2955200	But then if you remember that trauma is not what happens to you,
2955200	2958960	but what happens inside you is the wound.
2958960	2962400	People can be wounded not just by bad things happening to them,
2962400	2966080	but small children can be wounded in loving families
2967920	2969280	where they don't get their needs met.
2970560	2972400	I mean, that's obvious in the physical sense.
2973040	2974720	If a child doesn't get proper nutrition,
2975760	2978480	their body will suffer, their mind will suffer.
2980480	2982560	We're also creatures with emotional needs
2982560	2984160	as important as our physical needs.
2985040	2986880	So when the child's emotional needs are not met,
2986880	2987920	that child is wounded.
2988640	2990320	That's what we call small T trauma,
2990320	2993680	which is not the big ticket events such as I described.
2994240	2997600	But just the child's need to be loved unconditionally,
2997600	3001120	to be held when distressed, to be responded to,
3001120	3006240	to be seen, to be heard, to be allowed their full range of emotion
3006240	3010800	without them being stamped on in the name of so-called discipline.
3010800	3018880	The right to play creatively, spontaneously, out there in nature,
3018880	3025280	not with these damn digital gadgets that subvert and hijack the child's imagination.
3026320	3029280	But spontaneous play, that's essential for brain development.
3030320	3032880	So what I'm saying is that when these needs are not for the
3033920	3036480	unconditional loving attachment relationship,
3036480	3039440	when those needs are frustrated, children are also hurt.
3039440	3042400	And I call that trauma as well, because it shows up later in life
3042960	3045520	as the impact of painful wounds.
3046560	3050000	So trauma in this society, for all kinds of reasons,
3050000	3051680	is far more common than we imagine.
3052320	3054880	From sitting here and speaking to, I don't know,
3054880	3057520	somewhere over 100 different people that come from all walks of life,
3057520	3060320	but specifically people that are successful in their industries,
3060320	3066000	and you talked about how an anomalous early upbringing
3066000	3068560	can create sort of abnormality in an adult.
3068560	3072480	A lot of the people I sit here are successful because of some kind of abnormality,
3072480	3076080	or at least their interpretation of some kind of early event
3076080	3078880	that caused them to have some sort of abnormal belief about themselves
3078880	3080640	that they're not enough, so they become a billionaire,
3080640	3082160	or a gold medalist, or whatever it might be.
3082880	3089280	One of the things that I thought I could predict is I thought after doing 100 episodes,
3089280	3091600	if they told me the traumatic event they'd been through,
3091600	3097280	I could predict the outcome in them, but there's a disconnect there,
3097280	3099840	because I'd sit here with a guest who went through one of your
3101040	3103680	capital T traumas, like domestic violence,
3104640	3108240	and one of them might become incredibly angry,
3108960	3112160	and one of them might become the most peaceful, loving person I've ever met.
3112960	3116640	And that taught me that there's this thing in between the event,
3116640	3118320	which is what you call interpretation.
3119360	3123280	And I found that as, that kind of makes it really difficult to diagnose.
3123280	3125280	Well, now look, so the two examples you gave,
3127440	3132560	that really peaceful person may be really peaceful for genuinely good reasons,
3132560	3136400	such as they found the milk of human love flowing through their veins,
3136400	3140160	and they've had some spiritual reconciliation with the world,
3140160	3143840	where they may have genuinely learned compassion for themselves and others,
3144320	3148080	but they could also be very nice and peaceful because they're suppressing their healthy anger,
3149040	3152400	because they're actually sitting on their rage unconsciously,
3153040	3156720	which is going to show up in the form of some kind of health manifestation,
3156720	3158240	I guarantee you, later on.
3158240	3162400	So you can't tell from the outside without asking some questions,
3163840	3170240	or I can give you the example of a Donald Trump who had a really traumatic childhood.
3170240	3175280	I mean, his father was a, as described by his psychologist, niece, Mary Trump.
3175840	3182240	His father, Trump's father, who is Mary's grandfather was a psychopath.
3183040	3188320	And who really demeaned and harshly treated their children.
3189200	3194880	So Trump decides unconsciously that, by the way, I'm not talking about his policies here,
3194880	3196400	I'm not, this is not a political debate.
3197120	3200080	And in the book, I point out that his opponent was also traumatized,
3200640	3201360	Hillary Clinton.
3201360	3206560	So this is, this is a ecumenical view of trauma and politics.
3206560	3207680	I'm not choosing sides.
3208240	3211680	I'm just saying that you can see his trauma in every moment he opens his mouth.
3212400	3216000	His grandiosity, his need to make himself bigger, more powerful, aggressive,
3216000	3220480	and eats as much as said in his autobiography that the world is a horrible place,
3220480	3223120	a doggie dog place where everybody was after you.
3223120	3226880	Everybody wants your wife and your house and your wealth.
3226880	3227840	And this is your friends.
3228480	3229760	Never mind your enemies.
3229760	3231200	But that's the world he lives in.
3231200	3233840	Now that world that he lives in reflects his childhood home.
3234400	3235600	He developed that world view.
3236560	3239840	He came to it honestly, you might say, because that's the world that he lives in.
3239840	3244560	And he gets to be really successful in this crazy world.
3245440	3249680	You know, financially, although people question, you know,
3249680	3251920	was he really as big a success as he says he was?
3252480	3254320	But he certainly was successful politically.
3254320	3256560	If by success you mean the attainment of power.
3258080	3261760	His brother on the other hand, Mary Trump's father,
3262400	3266000	Trump's niece's father, drank himself to death.
3266960	3269680	And they were both responses to the same.
3270480	3272800	You can never say it's exactly the same for two kids,
3272800	3275440	but there was a toxic home environment.
3275440	3277760	One ends up dead as an alcoholic.
3278480	3280400	The other ends up at the pinnacle of power.
3283600	3287840	And when I look at them both, I see this function there,
3287840	3289120	significant dysfunction there.
3290240	3293280	So one of the consequences of that early upbringing
3293280	3296080	was it materialized itself as sort of addiction.
3296880	3300400	And the other got the same psychological reinforcement,
3300400	3303840	or the thing missing from power and work and money.
3304560	3307760	Well, Donald Trump learned that the way to survive
3307760	3309840	is to be aggressive and harsh and competitive
3309840	3311520	and to get the other before they get to you,
3312320	3316880	which is a faithful reproduction of his early childhood experiences.
3316880	3321120	So for him, these were not choices so much as survival
3321520	3323200	techniques.
3323200	3329120	And when they talk about his lying,
3330480	3333680	well, I don't know when he's lying or when he's not,
3333680	3336800	but my sense is that often he actually believes what he's saying.
3337760	3340320	And actually he's a biographer or the person who
3341840	3346720	co-wrote his, caused the autobiographical, the out of the deal.
3347280	3350800	This writer says that he's never met anybody
3350800	3353440	who's so capable of believing something that's not true,
3353440	3355280	to be true, if he wants it to be true.
3356240	3358320	But that's the mark of a traumatized child,
3359520	3361440	you know, a denial of reality.
3362400	3364000	It is an inauguration.
3364000	3366000	There was a certain number of people that came to the,
3367840	3371040	he couldn't stand it, that there weren't as many people there
3371040	3374720	as came to Barack Obama's inauguration.
3374720	3376960	There were a much smaller number of people there.
3377760	3380880	He created this reality where many more people came to his inauguration.
3381680	3383280	Now what age behavior is that?
3384800	3388480	That's a four-year-old where more kids came to his party than my party.
3388480	3389360	That can't be true.
3390320	3392560	But that's Donald's way of dealing with reality.
3393680	3396560	It's not a moral failing as such.
3396560	3397680	That's how he survived.
3398720	3403600	And these survival mechanisms then get to former personalities.
3404240	3410480	And again, in this world, sometimes they pay off in certain ways.
3411680	3414960	Is that often the case with pathological lies?
3414960	3416800	They've learned to lie as a way to survive.
3416800	3417920	Oh, absolutely.
3417920	3422080	The German philosopher writer Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche said,
3422080	3425440	people lie their way out of reality who have been hurt by reality.
3426640	3428480	And so I've lied.
3429120	3432400	You know, like when I had my shopping addiction,
3433040	3435840	I lied every day to my wife, you know?
3435840	3438480	And even afterwards, when she tried,
3438480	3440400	when she stopped trying to change my behavior,
3441360	3445040	I said, just tell me if you're going to show up,
3445040	3447360	you're going to spend another $1,000 on music.
3447360	3448080	Just tell me.
3450160	3455200	I still couldn't because I was so ashamed of it.
3455840	3461280	And so the lying became like a way of survival for me.
3461280	3462320	Defense against reality.
3462320	3466080	It's a defense against reality and it's a defense against being judged.
3467440	3467760	You know?
3468320	3471200	Well, that says something well my childhood, you know?
3471200	3472480	Nobody's born a liar.
3472480	3475280	As we say in this book, there are congenital liars,
3475280	3477120	but there are no congenital liars.
3477760	3479680	No one day old baby tells any lies.
3480240	3482080	No one day old baby pretends anything.
3482640	3486720	If we end up pretending in any way at all to the extent that we do,
3486720	3489920	it's because we had to learn that's what we must do to survive.
3491760	3494880	You said something at the start when I gave the example that I have this,
3494880	3498080	I sat with a guest here who went through domestic abuse
3498080	3500080	and they are the calmest person.
3500080	3501600	And then you said, well, maybe they're suppressing it.
3501600	3504240	And in fact, the minute you said that,
3504240	3505760	it reminded me of something they said,
3505760	3512000	which is they said to me on this podcast that they had angry outbursts all the time.
3512800	3514560	So sometimes their child will come up to them
3516240	3519200	and want to play when they're working and they'll snap.
3519840	3522080	And they're trying to, they're trying to deal with that.
3522080	3522560	Yeah.
3522560	3524080	That's what I meant, that they're sitting on this
3526240	3531120	crater of volcanic crater of anger, which sometimes bursts out of them.
3531120	3541200	So their demeanor is like a really developed, suppressed way of handling rage,
3542000	3545440	which rage, when they were children, had they expressed,
3546080	3547840	would have got them into more trouble.
3547840	3552560	So suppressing it, repressing it, became their survival.
3552560	3554240	It's all about survival, you see.
3554240	3556560	So it became their survival mechanism.
3556560	3563360	No, that person, as long as they keep it that way, they're at risk.
3564560	3568000	They're at risk for mental health diagnosis like depression.
3569120	3570800	Because what do we, what is depression?
3570800	3572240	It means you're pushing something down.
3572240	3572960	That's what it means.
3573680	3574640	What do we push down?
3575600	3576800	Our natural emotions.
3576800	3578080	Why do we push them down?
3578080	3579360	Because we had to survive.
3579920	3581920	So that, that person, I don't know.
3581920	3584160	I can't prognosticate what's going to happen to them.
3584160	3586720	But if they don't work it out in general,
3587600	3592160	they're at risk for some kind of mental or physical manifestation.
3592160	3592960	That's my experience.
3594000	3594560	Quick one.
3594560	3597280	Some of you may know we've got a brand new sponsor on this podcast,

3651920	3654800	I can't tell you over the last and say over the last,
3654800	3656080	really it's been about two and a half years.
3656080	3658320	It was really post pandemic,
3658320	3661440	how much my health has become such a huge priority in my life.
3661440	3665760	Huell has been probably the most important partner in my health journey
3665760	3668000	because I've been in the boardrooms.
3668000	3672080	I've been to their offices tens and tens and tens and tens of times.
3672080	3674640	I've seen how they make their decisions on nutrition.
3674640	3677920	And that's why it's such a wonderful thing to be able to talk to this audience
3677920	3681600	about a brand and a product that is so unbelievably linked to my values
3681600	3685040	and the place I am in my life of valuing the gym,
3685120	3688160	exercise, movement, my mind, my breathing and all of those things.
3688160	3690080	And most importantly, my nutrition.
3690080	3691520	That is the role Huell plays.
3691520	3693520	And so every time I get to read these ads out,
3693520	3695040	I do it with such passion,
3695040	3696800	because I really, really believe every word I'm saying.
3696800	3697920	And I absolutely love the brand.
3697920	3699280	So if you haven't already tried Huell
3699280	3702240	and you've been resistant to my pestering,
3702240	3704400	then give it a go and let me know how you get on.
3705040	3707280	You talked about expressing one's emotions
3707280	3708640	and something you've talked about in this book,
3708640	3711680	but also previously is this idea that there is such a thing as healthy anger.
3712560	3716080	It's one of the seven As of healing, as you say.
3716080	3719760	The first being a topic we've talked about already, which is acceptance.
3721680	3722800	The next being awareness.
3723760	3725760	Well, awareness that we should have put into this book,
3725760	3727920	but we didn't, not into this book.
3728880	3732400	In this book, I put four As and I left out awareness
3732400	3734400	and that was an omission on my part.
3734400	3734880	Really?
3734880	3736320	Yeah, I was, I'm sorry, but it was.
3736960	3740400	So in the book, you have authenticity, anger, autonomy.
3740400	3741600	Acceptance.
3742000	3742960	Agency you have.
3742960	3743840	An agency, yeah.
3743840	3745200	Yeah, and acceptance.
3745200	3747760	So awareness, you've said before,
3747760	3749840	before this book that awareness is the starting point.
3751440	3753200	I've found that to be so true in my life,
3753200	3754240	but it's not very easy.
3754240	3758960	I feel like awareness is a luxury or a privilege that is very hard fought.
3759760	3761200	Because you're guessing.
3761200	3763360	You're guessing based on pattern recognition.
3763360	3766000	So I was guessing 25 years old, I can't get into relationship.
3766000	3769600	Any time a girl comes near me, even if I've pursued her, I run off.
3770560	3772240	And to figure out why I was doing that,
3772240	3775040	to even identify the behavior pattern and go, that's not helpful.
3775040	3777200	That's not going to lead me to feeling whole.
3779040	3780480	Where does that come from?
3780480	3783760	Took 25 years and a lot of like introspection.
3784320	3789680	But most people, they're living unaware of the puppet master of trauma
3789680	3791120	that is driving their life.
3791120	3792320	That's a really good analogy.
3792320	3795920	The trauma really is like a puppet master behind the scenes
3795920	3798960	or in the unconscious, pulling your strings and you're not aware of it.
3800160	3801280	Do you remember Pinocchio?
3801280	3802080	Yeah.
3802080	3805200	So you remember what Pinocchio says at the end,
3805200	3807520	the way when he finally becomes a real boy?
3807520	3808240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3808240	3810400	He says how foolish I was when I was a puppet.
3812000	3819360	And to the extent that we're being activated by these unconscious strings
3819360	3823600	that are traumas pulling behind the scenes and we're acting in our lives
3823600	3825600	and we think we're autonomous free beings,
3825600	3828480	but we're actually being controlled by something in the past
3828480	3829600	that we haven't worked out.
3829600	3830240	We're puppets.
3830960	3831840	We're actually puppets.
3832480	3834880	And there's not much freedom in that.
3835840	3837200	There's no freedom in it at all.
3838320	3841520	So I mean, I suppose the opposite of trauma,
3841520	3844400	if you want to revisit that question, is liberation.
3845600	3846160	Interesting.
3848240	3851120	Liberation and by reconnection.
3851920	3856880	By reconnection, but liberation from the inexorable power of the unconscious.
3856880	3859120	Which is like cutting the strings in a way.
3859120	3860800	It kind of brings me to, there's kind of two ways.
3860800	3861360	I want to go with that.
3861360	3865680	The first question I have about trauma and the puppet master analogy is,
3866320	3868640	do we ever really cut the strings?
3868640	3871360	Or do we just kind of learn to pull against them
3871360	3873680	when they try and tell us to do something with more force
3873680	3875520	than they're exerting in the opposite direction?
3877920	3880640	That doesn't work very well pushing against it
3880640	3882000	because they're still reactive.
3882000	3882960	You're still not in charge.
3882960	3886080	You're just in automatic resistance mode to something.
3886080	3887360	There's no freedom in that either.
3889520	3890240	So yeah.
3892720	3896240	But awareness that you mentioned is huge
3896240	3898800	because once you are aware that there's this,
3899440	3902720	see the thing about these strings may not fray right away.
3903760	3907840	But once you wear that, ah, this reaction of mine,
3908880	3910880	it's not about what's going on right now.
3910880	3912960	There's something all being activated here.
3912960	3915360	That awareness alone weakens the,
3915360	3917120	it slackens the strings of it.
3917120	3919280	Now you're no longer, they're no longer is taught.
3919280	3924400	They're no longer is automatically capable of pulling on you.
3925120	3928000	So it does have to begin with awareness of them.
3928720	3935600	Ultimately, if we realize that this puppet master is just a desperate little person
3935600	3940560	trying to get you to survive, the only way he, she, they knew how,
3940560	3942320	when you were small, when they were small,
3942320	3946160	if you make friends with it, but we relieve it of its duties.
3946960	3948640	See, thanks very much, but I can handle it now.
3950400	3955520	It eventually becomes our friend rather than sort of our master.
3956720	3958560	On that first step of just acknowledging,
3958560	3962640	just understanding that there is a puppet master there controlling us
3962640	3967280	and exactly which strings that puppet master is pulling in our lives.
3967280	3971200	How does one go about awareness, the process of awareness?
3971200	3974000	Is that, I mean, is it introspection, keeping a diary therapy?
3974000	3974720	What, what is it?
3974720	3979840	Well, all that, I mean, all or any, but even when you ask how you go about it,
3980720	3981600	what is the it?
3982160	3984400	Well, for you to say how to go about it,
3984400	3986160	you already must have some degree of awareness.
3986160	3988000	If you didn't, you wouldn't even be asking the question.
3988560	3993600	So that's the very first step of realizing that there's something here to work on.
3993600	3995760	There's something here to work through.
3996480	3998240	It does not need to be the way it is.
3998880	4000400	That already is the biggest step.
4000400	4004320	The Buddha said that to recognize the source of your suffering
4004320	4006560	is the first step towards relieving the suffering.
4006560	4010800	And so as soon as you ask how you go about it, you've already taken a huge step.
4010800	4013520	Because a lot of people don't even know that there's an it.
4014320	4016800	They just think this is a reality, that this is life.
4016800	4021200	So realizing that this it doesn't have to be the way it is.
4021760	4023680	That's already a huge step now.
4023680	4029280	Beyond that, yoga, meditation, nature,
4030800	4038080	therapy of all kinds, body work of all kinds, like somatic experiencing,
4040080	4045840	or craniosacral treatments, or even massage therapy.
4046720	4049440	It's incredible what can be revealed just through body work like that.
4050000	4054160	Then all kinds of forms of therapy, the ones I teach, the ones other people teach.
4055120	4061440	Journaling, certain exercises in this book that we recommend.
4062240	4064880	Just ask yourself where you have troubles saying no in life,
4064880	4066720	to things you don't really want to do.
4066720	4068960	And working that through on a regular basis.
4068960	4071440	So there's lots of ways once you open the door.
4073680	4079440	I have a chapter on psychedelics here, which is again, it's not like a panacea or for everyone,
4079440	4082720	but certainly it's a helpful modality for a lot of people.
4083440	4088880	So some people may actually benefit from taking pharmaceutical medications
4089760	4094080	if their situation is dire enough, but not as the final answer,
4094080	4097840	but as a way of getting respite, that allow them to go to work on the real issues
4098400	4103360	that cause them to be depressed, or anxious, or tuning out.
4104320	4106400	So any and all of these things.
4106400	4109440	Well, the people don't even want to open those doors though,
4109520	4114240	because there's so much pain associated with maybe going back or revisiting an early experience
4114240	4119760	that they just think it's better to keep the doors shut, and get to tomorrow.
4120320	4123040	That's true, to which I have two answers.
4124080	4126160	One is, it's true, it's painful.
4127840	4131920	Because all the pain you didn't want to feel, and you've been running away from
4131920	4135200	through your compensatory behaviors, like your addictions,
4135200	4137680	or nothing but an attempt to escape from pain, that's all they are.
4138480	4142320	They're not a disease, they're not a genetic, whatever it is.
4142880	4147520	Addictions are very simply an attempt to escape pain, which create more pain,
4148320	4149200	but that's what they are.
4150080	4154880	And so we get addicted to work, to sex, to pornography, to gambling, to the internet,
4154880	4157280	to shopping, to eating, to power.
4157280	4161760	On that point, I find it so fascinating, when you mentioned in your previous book,
4162320	4169200	that you classified things like food, social media, shopping, porn and work,
4169200	4175120	as types of addiction, that in and of itself was a bit of a revelation for me,
4175120	4177280	because I never saw work as an addiction.
4177280	4182800	The minute you said it was, and I kind of link it to heroin addiction,
4182800	4188080	which is providing a certain psychological, physiological benefit to me.
4188880	4189440	Temporarily.
4189440	4191840	Temporarily, of course it's a fucking addiction.
4191840	4194560	Of course work is an addiction, of course I have that addiction.
4194560	4197600	Well, work can be an addiction, work can also be sacred,
4198240	4201440	it can also be fulfilling in the manifestation of your creative origins.
4204880	4208480	But it's strange to say, not that I recommend it,
4208480	4211520	but it's possible even to use heroin in a non-addictive way.
4212240	4214400	I don't personally get it, and I would never want to,
4215120	4219200	but the addiction is never in the behavior itself,
4219200	4220880	it's in your relationship to the behavior.
4221440	4226480	So if the particular activity gives you temporary relief or pleasure,
4226480	4230400	and therefore you crave it, but it causes harm in the long term,
4230400	4232400	and you can't give it up, you got an addiction.
4232400	4235520	And I don't care what the activity is, it could be drugs,
4235520	4237360	and all the other things that we mentioned.
4237360	4241120	And it employs the same brain circus, by the way.
4241120	4246320	The workaholic is after the same brain chemical that the cocaine addict is after, dopamine.
4248320	4251040	And people can be even addicted to their own stress hormones,
4251040	4254800	like adrenaline, the so-called adrenaline junkies, there's such a thing.
4255520	4258720	So almost anything can be addictive if it serves the purpose
4258720	4262320	of temporarily easing some distress, but causing harm in the long term.
4262320	4265520	Is escapism the right word to use then for it?
4265600	4269280	Because it doesn't sound as much like we're escaping,
4270240	4273200	rather than we are seeking something.
4273200	4276000	We're seeking relief from a certain mental state.
4279280	4280960	I just gave you a definition of addiction,
4280960	4285280	so I don't know what addictions you've had or haven't,
4286320	4288160	but what did that do for you?
4290240	4293120	Temporarily, it gave you something.
4293200	4301040	It made me feel like I was valid and I was pursuing a sense of accomplishment and validation.
4301040	4302160	It gave you a sense of worth.
4302160	4303440	Worth, yeah, it was worthy.
4303440	4305600	No, no, is that something that people need or not?
4306400	4306960	Yes.
4306960	4308080	Yeah, that's a good thing.
4308800	4313840	But the real question is, why did you ever get the idea that you didn't have the worth?
4313840	4315440	Why did I get the idea that I didn't have the worth?
4315440	4316240	That's where trauma comes in.
4316240	4319680	Because I was called the N-word when I was eight by a kid in school.
4319680	4320240	Exactly.
4320240	4321280	And then no one was going to be there.
4321280	4322960	And because your mother screamed at your father.
4323360	4324240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4324240	4327040	And so all that together.
4327040	4330160	And that's emotionally painful.
4330160	4333520	Like, what's it feel like to be not to have a sense of worth?
4333520	4334640	That's painful.
4334640	4339280	And so that's why my mantra is don't ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.
4340000	4342640	And if you want to understand why the pain, you have to look at that person's life.
4344160	4346400	And what the benefit of the addiction is?
4346400	4351600	That's something that you say in previous book that I found it's a flipping of narrative
4351600	4354160	where you say we should be asking what the benefit of the addiction is.
4354160	4354480	Yeah.
4354480	4357120	Well, like in your case, it gives me a sense of worth.
4357120	4362880	Well, okay, I'll say to you, if you come to me because you say like I'm broke all like
4362880	4364400	it's causing some harm in my life.
4364400	4367200	It's keeping me from intimate relationships.
4367200	4369520	It makes me stressed and tired, whatever it is.
4370400	4374160	It's the first thing I would ask you for you of you is what is it doing for you?
4374160	4376800	And you say a sense of worth and I'd say, you know what?
4379760	4381120	You deserve to have a sense of worth.
4381760	4387120	I totally understand why you'd want to engage in an activity that gives it to you.
4388480	4392960	But given that it's causing you harm, let's look at why you don't have a sense of worth
4392960	4397280	and how else you might develop it that isn't harmful to you, you know?
4397840	4400960	So, but you start with what's right about it.
4401520	4402720	What are you looking for?
4402720	4405040	And what you're looking for is always valid.
4405680	4412160	And how would one go about getting that sense of worth I'm asking for a friend?
4414400	4419120	Well, that would be a matter of some form of work.
4420160	4425840	People who meditate often deal with that issue through the meditation, not always.
4426640	4428880	Certainly therapy, you know?
4432880	4437440	By recognizing also that what you're doing to get the sense of worth doesn't really do it for you,
4437440	4439360	just by getting honest about it, you know?
4440240	4443760	So there's all kinds of ways, but the first step is the recognition.
4445040	4449440	That's the first step that you say is missing from the book, which is that sort of awareness.
4449440	4452560	The next thing which I've been, it's been really front of mind in my life recently,
4452560	4455440	because I've been asked this a few times on stage and I've been trying to find the words to
4455520	4460720	really articulate the importance of it is, and this is one of your forays in this book about
4460720	4466080	how to heal is authenticity. Really interesting concept, because I've been trying to articulate
4466080	4470480	why the fact that I've just shared all this stuff with you and the fact that I do this every week,
4471200	4474320	I'm getting closer and closer to that sort of authentic self where there's really,
4474320	4477600	the mask is kind of dropping on me. Why that's been so healing for me.
4477600	4480880	Why is authenticity such a good way, an important way for us to heal?
4482000	4484960	It's much more than a way for us to heal. It's actually who we are.
4484960	4489920	Like what you're really asking is, why is it important for a creature to be true to its own
4489920	4495120	nature? Because that's what we're meant to do. We're meant to be here as ourselves,
4496400	4502880	and when we're not ourselves because we had to abandon ourselves or betray ourselves,
4502880	4509440	disconnect from ourselves in order to survive, we lost connections with our essence.
4510160	4523040	And how does it feel to be a successful CEO and more than realizing your financial dreams,
4524160	4530800	but to be a workaholic and not to be available to yourself in areas of your life that really matter
4530800	4537840	to you, as opposed to being honest about your stuff, sharing it with other people,
4539040	4546080	dropping the veil, dropping the... I mean, to answer your question, what does it feel like?
4546080	4549760	I mean, can you sense the difference in your body? Feel the lighter.
4549760	4555280	Well, yeah. Expansive. Exactly. Well, that's the answer. That's why it's so important.
4555520	4563360	It's so many of us live in authentic lives because, as you said, it's either
4564720	4570240	because from an early age, we were escaping some kind of reality in order to help us to
4570240	4574400	survive, or then the other thing that happens a bit later on in life is we develop an identity
4574400	4581520	which becomes a career, which becomes a social circle, which becomes a prison of our inauthentic
4581520	4587120	selves. We get trapped in there because I was good at something, or because I felt
4587120	4594160	accepted in this job as a lawyer. So I am now living inauthentically as this robot in this prison.
4596960	4605120	And it's a... There's often a real perception of risk and loss and danger of trying to get
4605120	4609680	out of that prison, of trying to get close to our authentic selves. We feel like we'll lose our
4609680	4614400	friendship circle. We'll feel like we'll let our parents down who wanted us to become a lawyer.
4615200	4619280	All of these things, I guess you see that a lot in your work.
4619280	4627040	Well, there's that risk. But here's the issue. As a child, you had no choice but to go for
4628000	4635120	acceptance and being approved of and being received under any conditions.
4635120	4637440	No matter what you had to give up of your authenticity,
4637440	4641840	you had to give up your authenticity. You had no choice in the matter. At a certain point as adults,
4642800	4648160	we learn that this lack of authenticity, this disconnection from ourselves, this separation
4648160	4655360	from our gut feelings is costing us. It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our peace of
4655360	4663760	mind, our relationship, our mental health, and so on. You'll never be as vulnerable again
4663760	4670320	as you were when you were a child. You'll never be as helpless, as dependent, as resourceless.
4671680	4678800	No, it's true that if you develop the whole set of relationships based on your inauthentic persona,
4678800	4687120	some people in your life may not like it if you gradually move towards authenticity. They may
4687120	4691120	not like it. It's not what they wanted from you. You're going to find out who your friends are.
4691920	4695280	You're really going to find, because your real friends will say, oh, I'm so happy for you.
4696160	4699920	People are waiting for this. Other friends will say, it's not what I signed up for.
4702320	4708320	The question is, you still have to decide. As an infant, as a young child, I had no agency
4709600	4715280	in the choice of authenticity and attachment. No, I do. Which one do I want to go with?
4715280	4720000	What is the cost of being inauthentic? I can't make that decision for anybody else.
4720000	4726240	Nobody can make that decision for anybody else. But most people will find that choosing authenticity
4726240	4730720	has benefits way beyond whatever they might lose. That's what I find.
4731920	4736400	And you said the word that agency, which is the second of the four A's on how to heal. Now,
4736400	4740560	agency, when I read that word, I hear like personal responsibility, taking personal
4740560	4746880	responsibility over my life. Exactly. Which also means not letting, you know, you don't use,
4746880	4752160	you don't wear trauma as a badge, you know, or you don't use it as a get out of jail pass in a
4752160	4757120	game of Monopoly. Oh, I was traumatized. So I can't, I can't be any other way. You know, I mean,
4757120	4763440	Giving all the power to the puppet master. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So agency means actually,
4763440	4765920	I take responsibility not for what happened to me,
4769040	4773120	not even how I interpreted the world as a result going backwards,
4773120	4777040	but how I interpret the world from now on. Do I still want to interpret the world
4777040	4780960	and my role in it based on some decision I made when I was a one year old?
4780960	4784640	That's where agency comes in. Agency also means that if I have
4786160	4790640	any kind of dysfunction or illness, it's not just that I put my hands in the hands of a,
4790640	4796720	put my, my fate in the hands of a, a physician or a healer, but I, I have agent, I make the
4796720	4802320	decisions. I listen to your advice. I accept some, I don't accept some, but I'm the one who's making
4802320	4810160	the decisions along with what seems right to me. So agency. It's interesting in your,
4810160	4814400	in your work, throughout your work, you use alliteration as a lot, as a way to kind of
4815040	4820240	summarize and make ideas really memorable. It really helps. It's a little trick.
4820240	4824960	It's a trick. It's a writing trick, right? Well, it's, it also works, you know, before
4824960	4831200	A's or the four of us, but I don't, I don't want to say, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm denigrating
4831200	4834800	my work. If I say it's a trick, no, it's just something, just the way things occur to me.
4834800	4839600	That's all it is. One of the, one of the, um, alliteration devices you use is also
4840320	4845840	relates to limiting beliefs and how we can undo self-limiting beliefs with the five Rs.
4845840	4852640	Yeah. Relabel, reattribute, refocus, re, revalue and recreate. Yeah. Now, from what I
4853600	4855600	understood of those, relabeling is
4858160	4862720	the story and the belief that is limiting to us, um, sort of redefining it. Well,
4863680	4870240	it takes something like, um, your work journalism. Yeah. I need to go to work. I need to do this work.
4870240	4875520	Yeah. Relabeling is, I don't need to do this work. I just have a belief that I need to do this work.
4875520	4880000	Okay. So that real building just takes a degree of separation from the
4880880	4885600	behavior. And, and actually it's true. It's not that you need to do all this work. You have this
4885600	4892160	belief. So relabeling just says it for what it is. By the way, I have to acknowledge that I,
4892160	4897520	these, these five Rs, only one in his mind. I stole the other four from a psychiatrist.
4897520	4898240	That's fine. That's all.
4898240	4902960	Yeah. Just, I, I mentioned that in the book, but I find it very helpful technique, but
4904160	4907760	it was developed for people with obsessive-compulsive tendencies.
4907760	4912320	So the relabel is not that I have to wash my hand a hundred times. I just have a belief that I have
4912320	4916560	to wash my hand a hundred times. That's the context in which it was developed. I think it works for
4916560	4921600	all kinds of, all kinds of, um, dynamics. And then if I, and then so I've relabelled it,
4922640	4926560	I don't have to work to feel a sense of validation, but I have a belief that I do.
4926560	4930160	That's right. And then I reattribute it, which is the second R,
4930160	4932880	which means I get clear on where it's come from.
4932960	4939280	Yeah. So let's say you have the belief that you're not worth it. It's not two that are not worth it.
4939280	4944800	I just have a belief that I'm not worth it. Okay. Or it may not be two that are not worth it,
4944800	4951120	but I do have a belief that I'm not worth it. Re-attribute means this is an old brain circuit
4951120	4955440	sending me an old message. It's got nothing to do with reality. It has to do with some
4955440	4959120	experience that I had a long time ago. That's the reattribute. You just say,
4959120	4963760	where is it actually coming from? There's a circuit in your brain that's wired with the message.
4964640	4967600	You're not worth it. And it's going to keep repeating that message.
4968320	4970160	Well, you say, okay, that's where it's coming from.
4970720	4972480	Until I refocus, which is the third R.
4972480	4979840	Yeah. So refocus is just to give us some space. So if they ever say, I need to go to work,
4980880	4985680	okay, refocus means well, for five minutes, maybe in five minutes I'll go to work,
4985760	4992960	for five minutes I won't. I'm going to put on some piece of music or go for a walk or meditate or
4992960	4999680	whatever. So you refocus, you put the intention somewhere else. Just so that to prove to yourself,
5000400	5004400	but you actually have some agency over your brain. If only for five minutes,
5004960	5010560	if you have this belief that I'm not worth it. Well, you can go back to it in five minutes if
5010560	5015280	you want. Just for five minutes though, consider all the ways that you made a contribution.
5016160	5021680	Consider all the ways that people have acknowledged your benign presence in their lives.
5022400	5026720	The times that people have told you that they've loved you or that you told somebody else,
5026720	5030720	just for five minutes, hang out with that. Five minutes later, if you want to go back to this
5030720	5035600	belief or if you can't help going back to this belief that you're not worth it, well, that's okay.
5035600	5040880	But at least create some space. It's all about creating space between yourself and these beliefs
5040880	5045840	or these behaviors. And in that five minutes, you're basically accepting new evidence to be
5045840	5049520	true or you're proving that other evidence is true. I didn't need to go and work. Well,
5049520	5054080	you're also proving that you don't have to spend all your time subjected to those beliefs.
5054080	5058960	You can take a hiatus from it, at least for a while. And that they are not you. They're not you,
5058960	5068960	yeah. And then revalue. Revalue it really what it should mean or maybe more accurately devalue
5068960	5073840	because you say, what has been the actual value? This believed that I'm not worth it.
5073840	5079440	What has been the actual value of it in my life? Or this tendency of mine to be a workaholic?
5079440	5085840	What has been the actual value? Oh, it made me tired. It made me alienated or it keeps me depressed
5085840	5090000	or it keeps me hopelessly trying to prove something which I can never prove to myself
5090000	5094560	anyway through external activity. So you actually look at what does it mean is actually impact on
5094560	5100480	your life? What has been this real value? Sometimes the value is positive, right? Like I
5100480	5105280	think about my own workaholic workaholism, if that's the term, I think there's some
5105280	5111040	there's some positives here. Yeah, a lot of negatives. Yeah. Well, is the positive due
5111040	5116720	to workaholism? Or is it due to your capacity to work hard and on behalf of a goal? They're not the
5116720	5123600	same. Your capacity to work hard to achieve a certain goal is simply a gift that you have.
5124400	5127440	And something that maybe takes some discipline and application on your part.
5128880	5135520	That's not workaholism. That's just a strong positive work ethic. The workaholism is when
5135520	5141520	you're driven to work, you actually don't need to. It's funny because it reminds me of an analogy
5141520	5145760	I've been talking about in the last couple of episodes of this podcast, the distinction between
5145760	5151600	being driven and being dragged. Yeah. It's like, which side of the lorry am I flying down the
5151600	5155920	motorway? Am I tied to the front and am I running and pulling the lorry? Or am I just like my ankles
5155920	5159520	attached to the back of the lorry as it flies down the motorway because I'm being dragged?
5160080	5163120	But if I may, I would say that neither of those are particularly desirable.
5166880	5170640	But but but it's the distinction that I made before between being driven and being called.
5171280	5176640	Yeah. Because if you're called, you see, if I call you say, Stephen, would you come and have
5176640	5180720	dinner with me? You can say yes, you can say no, I just gave you a call and you can say
5181360	5186080	literally I'm talking about calling a telephone call. You know, you can say yes, you can say no.
5186080	5190160	It's a decision though. But you're the one who's making the decision. Yeah. When you're dragged
5190160	5194240	or pushed or pulled, you're not making the decision. I'm a slave to the decision, to that,
5194240	5199600	to the activity. One of the one of the really interesting things I wanted to talk to you about
5199600	5206560	is ADHD. Yeah. I've had a few of my friends and my close friendship circle diagnosed with ADHD
5206560	5212560	recently. And then I looked into some of the statistics around ADHD. And I found this statistic
5212560	5218640	that said in the 1980s, one in 20 US children were diagnosed with ADHD. Today, the number is roughly
5218640	5226320	one in nine. Yeah. And just generally, you know, around me there's it feels like and this could
5226320	5230640	just be because of my own little narrow circle or it could be because of a wider thing happening
5230640	5235760	in society. It feels like there's been an increase in diagnosis of mental illness and things like
5235760	5243120	ADHD. And the causes when I spoke to my friend about what he believed the cause of his ADHD
5243120	5246080	was and he's posted this on LinkedIn and talks about it very publicly now.
5247840	5254400	It seemed to point to he seemed to believe it was relating to some kind of genetic or
5255280	5262400	heritable factor. Yeah. Now, the issue that I've sort of been contending with myself and why I
5262400	5267440	spoke to Johan Hari about this and others about this is if I if I am to accept that,
5267440	5274240	then I am I feel like I'm accepting that we're being born somewhat broken. And this is almost
5274240	5279040	what Johan Hari talked about in the early stages of his teenage years where he he was made to believe
5279040	5282400	that there was this chemical imbalance in his brain and therefore he was born broken and here's
5282400	5287760	the medication to solve it. Yeah. So but I don't want I don't believe that I don't I don't personally
5287760	5294080	believe that we're we're born broken. Well, anybody in the subject might do what I think Johan
5294080	5299600	and actually there's to read my book on ADHD is called scattered minds. And I was diagnosed
5299600	5304640	within my fifties and so were a couple of my kids. But but I never bought into the idea this is a
5304640	5311040	genetic disease or there's a disease at all genetic or otherwise. Now, as for the rising number of
5312480	5316560	people being diagnosed with it, there could be two reasons at least one is we're better
5316560	5322080	diagnosis or before we wouldn't have noticed it but now we are. Or genuinely, there's more people
5322080	5326960	who are having trouble in certain ways such as with attention and impulse control and so on.
5328880	5332800	But either way, the fact is that many more children are being diagnosed and medicated
5333600	5338240	for this condition, particularly in the US, but also increasingly here in the UK as well,
5338240	5347680	and in China and elsewhere. Now, as I said earlier, if we the fact is here's the actual reality.
5347680	5353360	Nobody's ever found a gene for ADHD. Nobody's ever found a gene that says, if you have this gene,
5353360	5358320	you're going to have ADHD. No such genes have been found. No group of genes have been found that
5358320	5362800	says if you're going to have this gene, you're going to have this condition, nor ever will be.
5362800	5367280	And no such gene or group of genes have ever been found that if you don't have these genes,
5367280	5372480	you will not have the condition. No, there are some diseases that are genetic. One runs in my
5372480	5378000	family, muscular dystrophy. If you have the gene, you're going to have the disease. My mother had it,
5378000	5384000	my aunt had it. That's a genetic condition. And if you have the gene, you'll have the disease.
5385920	5394000	Very rare, those kind of diseases. No, there are some genes that the more of them you have,
5394960	5400000	the more likely you are to have any number of mental health diagnoses, ADHD, depression, anxiety,
5400960	5406880	even psychosis, bipolar illness. But there's no group of genes or set of genes or gene that
5406880	5411840	themselves determine any one condition. As a matter of fact, you can have those same genes
5411840	5417760	and not have any condition whatsoever. So something's being passed on, but it's not
5417760	5423040	any kind of condition that's being passed on. What's being passed on is sensitivity. And the more
5423120	5427840	sensitive you are, the more you're going to feel whatever's going on in the environment.
5427840	5433760	So you take the same sensitive kid with these genes that confer greater sensitivity out of them,
5433760	5440000	and sensitive means to feel, from the Latin word to feel, sincere. The more sensitive you are,
5440000	5444640	the more you're going to feel. The more you feel, the more bad stuff happens, the more pain you're
5444640	5449120	going to be in, and the more compensating you're going to have to do. At the same time, with those
5449120	5453760	same genes, if you treat it well and you grow up in a healthy environment, you just be creative and
5453760	5461200	happy and joyful and a leader and an artist or a shaman or a very creative CEO or whatever you're
5461200	5468080	going to be. So the genes don't determine. They make you more sensitive to their environment. No,
5468080	5473520	if you go back to what I said about the tuning out, it's simply a defense. So the more sensitive you
5473520	5479200	are and the stress in the environment, the more you're going to feel the stress, the more you're
5479200	5486400	going to need to escape from it by tuning out. So it didn't inherit ADHD. You inherited a sensitivity
5486400	5491520	that makes it more likely under stressful circumstances that you revert to tuning out
5491520	5496720	when your brain is developing, which by the way is an organ that develops physiologically
5496720	5502160	under the impact of the emotional environment. So if there's a lot of stress in a child's life,
5502160	5506080	and what I'm saying is in this society is that more and more parents are stressed,
5506080	5510320	not because they don't love their kids, not because they're not doing their very utmost to
5510320	5514400	provide for them, but because they're more stressed through all kinds of social, political,
5514400	5518720	economic reasons than if you look at inflation in Britain, which is a high risk right now,
5519360	5525280	more people are going to be stressed financially. Financial stress on the parents translates into
5525280	5529920	physiological stress in the children. Those children may want to tune out because it's too
5529920	5535600	much to be in the present. Some of them will be diagnosed with ADHD. They didn't inherit anything
5535600	5541040	in terms of a disease. They're just reacting to the environment. So if we're diagnosing more
5541040	5545360	and more kids these days, I think it's because the parenting environment has become much more
5545360	5550320	stressed. And that's backed up in this book where you mentioned that study of 65,000 parents
5551440	5556240	and their children with ADHD, right? There's more trauma in their lives.
5557200	5559760	So the children, they do a study with 65,000?
5559760	5561040	I forget. You're better than I am.
5561040	5563440	It was 65,000. I read it three hours ago.
5564640	5566640	Yeah, but many thousands of kids, yeah.
5566640	5570480	So because I found that to be really, really sort of supportive of what you just said where,
5571200	5576800	again, I'm saying this from memory, but a study of 65,000 children and their parents,
5576800	5582960	and they found that those parents who had more adverse traumatic events in their lives
5583520	5587360	ended up having a higher chance of having a child that had ADHD.
5587360	5590720	Well, look, if you look at the United States at least,
5591520	5597200	poor kids and kids of so-called color are much more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.
5597920	5598640	Interesting.
5598640	5602160	No, why would that be the case? Because they're living with so much more stress.
5602960	5604400	Men as well, right?
5604400	5606320	Men as well. Adults, you mean?
5606320	5609680	Men, yeah. So I read that more men or boys are diagnosed.
5609680	5616640	More men are diagnosed partly because in men, the symptom of hyperactivity seems to be there,
5616640	5620240	more often. So when a kid is sitting in school and the cancer is still,
5620960	5625440	that's obvious. The teacher will notice it. The girl who's kind of dreamy and tunes out
5626480	5630320	kind of fades away at the back of the class. She doesn't create any problems.
5631040	5634240	So that's one of the reasons.
5634240	5643440	But also, funny to say, but young boys, infant boys are more sensitive to environmental pressure
5643440	5648800	than girls are for some strange reason. So they're more likely to be affected by these factors.
5650640	5654320	Seeing a boy like that in the class, that's a fidgety that has a poor attention span,
5654320	5660240	bad response to stress. We medicate. What is the impact of that approach to treatment,
5660240	5665600	medicating super early? I used to, when I worked as a physician, I would certainly prescribe
5665600	5670560	medications sometimes. It's a question of who's prescribing and what intention.
5671600	5676000	If I understand that the real problem in this child is not that there's anything intrinsically
5676000	5681360	wrong with the child, but that they were developed in a stressed environment and no stresses are
5681360	5686720	still acting on them. And one of the stresses is the parents don't understand the kids' behaviors
5686720	5692160	and they tend to react rather harshly. Then if I can help the parent understand
5692160	5697120	the sensitive nature of their child, which also means that when positive changes occur in the
5697120	5702320	environment, the kid will be very responsive to that as well. If the parents can create a positive,
5702320	5707360	accepting, understanding atmosphere in the home and work on their own stresses so they don't
5707360	5713840	unconsciously pass them on to their kids, that kid will change very quickly. And I say, well,
5713840	5718160	if in the short term, the child wants the medication to function better and no child should
5718160	5724080	be forced to take medication and medication are never the final answer that the very most
5724080	5729120	there stop cap. There's no proof whatsoever that medications help anybody heal from ADHD.
5729840	5734560	They simply suppress symptoms, which may be helpful in the short term, but for God's sakes,
5734560	5737760	go to work on the long-term development of that child. And what does that mean?
5738400	5743360	Create the conditions in which healthy development takes place. That child will do very, very well.
5743840	5747760	If you think the problem is a disease, they're just going to medicate away the symptoms of.
5749280	5753840	What about for adults? I'm thinking of my friend there. He's in his 30s and he got the diagnosis
5753840	5758560	of ADHD in his 30s. He's been given this medication, which he presumably has to take for life.
5759120	5764880	He's told me the medication has helped him focus. Has helped him focus. He's been a game changer,
5764880	5770080	Steve. Yeah, I've taken medication myself for ADHD and it helped me focus. It helped me write
5770080	5775840	my first book. I didn't take it for this one. As a matter of fact, more recently, when I was
5775840	5779760	beginning to write the medication, I thought maybe I would take a bit of stimulant like I used to.
5779760	5784720	And just to see if it helps me write the book better, all it did is give me side effects.
5785360	5790800	My brain has changed. I don't need it anymore. So I would say to your friend,
5790800	5794160	if the medication is helping you right now and it's not causing you side effects,
5795120	5801520	I got nothing against it. And you might want to give it a break every weekend.
5801520	5806320	If you don't, you might want to use it for when you're having to work or having to concentrate,
5806320	5811280	but it's up to you. If it helps you function, take it, but go to work on the traumas and
5811280	5818480	stresses driving the ADHD, going back to your childhood. And I may say my book on ADHD,
5818560	5824800	scattered minds does outline some ways to do that. You might find that you don't need the medication
5825840	5831520	so much anymore or not at all, perhaps. Number one, number two, even if you do,
5831520	5837920	your life will be so much fuller and so much more less stressed if you deal with the underlying
5837920	5843600	factors than if you simply medicate the symptom. Is there, I always think in life there's a cost
5843600	5848480	for all these things we use to medicate and stimulate ourselves. And so I always ask myself,
5848480	5853600	like there's got to be a catch here. And even for coffee, I'm like, what's the catch? We can't
5853600	5857520	just be all up and positive. And with my friend, when he said, when he had the conversation with me
5857520	5861680	about being on this medication for life, my first thought is like, okay, what's the cost?
5861680	5866720	It's going to make you really focused and better at work. But what is the long term cost of?
5867600	5873360	I'd have to talk to your friend. Those are good questions to ask. When I took medication,
5874000	5878880	it made me a much more efficient workaholic. It did nothing for my workaholicism,
5878880	5883040	just made me much better at it because I could stay up later now and I was more focused.
5883040	5889280	I could even more things done. So you got to deal with these other issues.
5890160	5890720	Did you?
5891440	5899760	I did. Did I deal with them? Yes, I have. And there's so much more like dealing with the trauma.
5899760	5905120	Like I'm telling you, if your friend's got ADHD, I can tell you he had to stress early for years.
5905680	5911600	And his parents were stressed. His parents were stressed. So deal with that. Deal with what
5911600	5914480	conditions are you creating now in your life that create more stress for you?
5915120	5920480	Are you taking care of your body? Are you exercising? Are you eating well? Do you get out
5920480	5924880	there in nature? Nature has a certain kind of harmony to it, which actually calms the mind.
5925760	5930400	So are you doing all these things? If you're not, all you're doing is medicating a symptom.
5931680	5936560	If you are taking the medication specifically to help you focus, but you're working on his other
5936560	5942080	issues, you live a much full life and you may find you don't need the medication after all.
5942640	5951280	You came off the medication for your ADD. Because I'm just not that medically well versed,
5951280	5957440	what's the difference between ADD and ADHD? It's a kind of confusion. ADHD simply means
5957440	5963040	that the hyperactivity is present. So you can have ADD without hyperactivity. So the actual
5963840	5972400	you know, proper way to divide it is ADD. And in brackets, HD so that indicating that the
5972400	5977680	hyperactivity may or may not be there. Got you. So you, you, you were on medication,
5977680	5983520	you did the work, you know, not on medication. Do you still have the symptoms of ADD?
5984640	5988400	To a certain degree, but not in a way that anyway, blights my life. Like one thing I can
5988400	5992560	pity, be sure that when I go on a speaking trip, I'm going to lose something. I'm going to lose my,
5995120	6001440	my portable electrical tooth cleaner, where I'm going to, in this case, I left my rain jacket
6001440	6007360	in Budapest when I came here on. You can take it for granted that my attention will just not
6007360	6011200	notice something that I haven't packed yet. That's okay. I'm going back to Budapest next week. So
6011200	6016320	I get to get my rain jacket back. But sometimes it's the cost of being me. So what? You know,
6016320	6022160	so no, not in every way, but that's not the point. Nobody's life has to be perfect.
6022160	6025520	It just has to be a life that I want to live and I can enjoy living.
6026640	6032880	That I have, you know, so who cares if sometimes I forget something or I lose something or
6033760	6038560	even if I'm listening to a symphony and I can't keep my attention on it. Okay, so I can't.
6038800	6043120	This, you talk about this some toxic society. Yeah.
6046080	6049520	Do you think society is getting more toxic? And if so, why?
6050080	6056000	What measure shall we use? You know, if we use the measure of a number of kids being medicated,
6057040	6063440	the number of adults having chronic illness or immune disease, number of students,
6064160	6072480	university students being depressed, contemplating suicide, number of children in the United States
6072480	6078880	killing themselves, the number of people on medications of all kinds,
6080480	6086240	the degree of safety that people have in society, the ranker or piece that characterizes
6086240	6093440	political discourse in this world, the intolerable fact that eight people in the world,
6093440	6100480	I think, own as much as the bottom half, as the bottom 3.5 billion. You know, if I look at all
6100480	6106000	those things by those measures, if we look at what's happening to the environment, if I look
6106000	6110400	at the fact that the people who are the worst polluters in the environment also happen to be
6110400	6118640	the most successful people by a certain measure of success. By any number of parameters, if I look at
6120160	6129040	how racism still affects the lives of so many people and not just affects it in an emotional
6129040	6136640	sense, but actually physiologically, you know, then yeah, this is a toxic society and those
6136720	6141520	measures are getting worse, they're not getting better and inequality is getting worse here in the
6141520	6149360	UK and elsewhere. So yeah, I think it's getting more toxic. What's the antidote? Well, how about
6149360	6154080	people back to this word awareness? Like people just have to get that this is how it is. And
6154080	6158560	in the last chapter, I don't lay out a political program, you know, I don't see that as my role
6158560	6163520	to do that. I have my own political ideas and preferences, but I don't want to impose them on
6163520	6169920	the reader. But I do say, first of all, we have to lose our illusions that this is that this
6169920	6176480	normality is actually healthy or natural. You have to just get cognizant that what we consider
6176480	6186720	to be normal is actually bad for us. Number one, number two, just if we introduced the concept
6186720	6193920	of trauma into healthcare, the average doctor again, strange to say, doesn't hear a single
6193920	6198880	lecture in their medical training about the impact of trauma on physical or mental health,
6198880	6204800	which is astonishing. Given that it was a British psychologist, Dr. Richard Bentall,
6204800	6210320	who pointed out not that many years ago, that the evidence linking what we call mental illness and
6210320	6214800	childhood adversity is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.
6215520	6219680	And the average physician doesn't hear a word about that. It's astonishing.
6221040	6224640	Education, teachers, if they understood child development, brain development,
6225760	6232960	the developmental factors that children need, that I cite in this book. And if they understood
6232960	6238320	how trauma affects kids' capacity to learn, to pay attention, and to behave in functional ways,
6239040	6246640	the Daily Telegraph here in London, not that long ago, was bemoaning the fact that kids
6246640	6253760	aren't caned anymore in schools. I mean, what they were moaning about is that we no longer
6253760	6260320	traumatize kids quite as harshly as we used to. That's all it does, caning. So if teachers
6260320	6265120	understood that the behaviors on the part of children are actually manifestations of
6265200	6271760	emotional dynamics of frustration and needs not being met, and very often of trauma,
6271760	6275840	that would change the educational system. If the legal system understood it,
6277520	6282640	that most people facing the criminal justice system are actually traumatized people.
6282640	6289280	They could actually be rehabilitated and healed if we understood that, instead of just
6289840	6293680	exposing them to harsh punishments, we actually treated them like human beings
6293680	6299600	who may have done things that are unacceptable, but that came from traumas they couldn't have helped,
6299600	6305040	and that they can be helped back to healthy functioning, as we know from lots of experience.
6306160	6313920	Just that little trauma information would change society. So that's what I can offer as a physician.
6314480	6317040	What about parents? What do they need to know?
6317040	6322880	Yeah, well, if parents actually understood, first of all, that the first three years are
6322880	6329200	everything, that if they get the template right in the first three years, they can hardly set a foot
6329200	6334800	wrong afterwards. But on the other hand, if we're not present for our kids emotionally,
6334800	6341440	if we don't understand them, if we don't see them, if we don't attune to their emotional states,
6342080	6345600	we're going to hurt them. And if they understood what the needs of children are,
6346160	6351760	when I mentioned some of them, for play, for experience of all emotions, for
6353600	6359840	unconditional loving attachment, for the child being able to rest from having to work
6359840	6364880	to make the relationship work. So the child doesn't have to be good or nice or beautiful or
6366480	6372960	successful. They just have to be. So we don't impose conditions on our approval and acceptance
6372960	6378720	on them. If parents just understood that, and if they understood how important it is that they
6378720	6383440	take care of their own emotional needs so that a child doesn't have to take responsibility,
6384240	6389680	like perhaps you did for the parents stresses. If parents understood all that, and if society
6389680	6395680	actually understood how important parenting was, and it supported parents who needed the support
6395680	6402480	to be there for their kids, wouldn't be financially costly, it would save us a lot of money.
6403040	6408480	Not to mention, we'd have a lot more happier kids who don't need to be on medications. So, yeah.
6409040	6414080	And lastly, schools. Schools? Well, again, like I said about educators, if educators, well, here's
6414080	6420480	the thing. If you look at how does the human brain develop? I quote an article from the Harvard
6420480	6425760	Center on the Developing Child that appeared in a journal, Pediatrics, official journal of the
6425760	6434560	American Pediatric Academy in 2012, February. The article said that the human brain develops
6434560	6441360	through a complex process that begins before birth and continues into adulthood. Okay. Now,
6441360	6447200	that means A, we take care of the emotional needs of pregnant women. Number one. Number two, if it
6447200	6452320	continues into adulthood, continues into adulthood, then the job of the schools, if they understand
6452400	6461120	it right, is not to teach kids what year the Battle of Austerlitz took place, or the Battle of Waterloo,
6462800	6469840	or algebra, any of that stuff. The most important job of the schools is to promote
6469840	6475520	healthy brain development. With a child whose healthy brain development will actually be naturally
6475520	6482160	curious, they'll want to know about history. They'll be keen to absorb the skills of algebra.
6482400	6489280	They'll want to know how to use a computer, and they'll want to know how to write properly. The
6489280	6495840	kids will want to do that spontaneously, because mastery and learning, these are human hungers,
6495840	6502880	they're human needs. So, in other words, the most important job of the schools is not to
6502880	6508720	cram the kids full of information, but to help them develop healthy brains. What does that require?
6509520	6515760	Safety, above all. Lack of pressure. Healthy relationship with nurturing adults.
6516640	6520720	And if the kids are not going to spend their time with the adult, with the parents,
6520720	6524800	which they can't in this society, like they used to throughout human evolution, let them
6524800	6530080	spend their time with adults who are emotionally nurturing and emotionally penetrating the
6530080	6534800	attentive to the child's needs. Now you're going to have schools that are going to really teach
6534880	6540720	kids something and where kids will want to learn. And it's very simple. It doesn't take more training
6540720	6545840	and it doesn't take more. Well, it takes some training, perhaps, but not more than what teachers
6545840	6552240	are getting now. So that's sort of a take in education. I was thinking there about the importance
6552240	6557760	of doing certain psychological tests on certain teachers, because if they are also passing on a
6557760	6562480	generational cycle of their own at a time when my brain is still being developed, they can have a
6562480	6568000	huge impact positively or negatively on my life in the same way that my parents could. Absolutely.
6569200	6573040	It's quite remarkable. Teachers don't know how much power they have because of the vulnerability
6573040	6579440	of the young brain. And well-meaning teachers will sometimes behave in ways that are really
6579440	6584240	hurtful to kids, just because they don't get it, not because they don't mean well. So I've had many
6584240	6590000	adults sit in my office say, with tears in their eyes, it was something a teacher said to them
6590000	6599280	three decades before. The class will continue and Johnny comes back to earth. This kind of sarcastic
6599280	6606320	little dig can undermine a child's dignity and sense of self so easily. So if teachers just
6606320	6610880	understood how powerful they are and how important they are in helping to promote healthy brain
6610880	6615200	development, I think their profession will take on a whole new meaning that will be much more
6615200	6620640	satisfying than it is right now. It's not the fault of individual teachers. We're talking about a
6620640	6630640	system that is toxic. Gabor, we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the previous
6630640	6637680	guest asks a question for the next guest. I didn't get to see it until I open the book. So
6637680	6640800	there's a question written here for you. Before I ask you this question, I did have a question of
6640800	6648160	my own, which was you're in your 70s now. What are you still working on in terms of your own
6648160	6652880	traumas? Is there anything, even though you're in a later stage of your own life, that you're still
6653680	6656960	sort of struggling with as it relates to that puppet master pulling on the strings and
6657760	6667280	that kind of analogy that we gave earlier? Yeah. It's a sense of peace when I'm not doing anything.
6667840	6680960	Just being the capacity just to be. That's something I'm still looking for. Not
6680960	6686000	looking for like, I was looking for a lost puppy, but I'm still searching myself for it.
6687680	6690640	And where exactly does that come from in your own diagnosis?
6690640	6697600	How about if I tell you when I find out? I mean, I can give you a textbook answer,
6698240	6702080	but it wouldn't be authentic. Okay. So you don't know?
6703200	6718960	Entirely? I have some senses. I have some ideas. And then it really means being okay with my mind
6718960	6724000	the way it is and not needing it to be any different. That's what it would mean,
6725040	6730240	which means if I'm sitting there for five minutes, I don't have to reach for the cell phone to occupy
6730240	6738560	my mind. Now, in the midst of this busy book tour and all the speaking I do, I don't do enough to
6738560	6745920	take care of that quiet little voice inside myself. I don't. I think it would take some attention.
6746880	6751520	I can't either though. I can't sit for five minutes. I couldn't sit for five seconds without
6751520	6755680	grabbing my phone. It's weird. I noticed the other day that I was like going to the toilet,
6755680	6760640	and I had no intention of using my phone in the toilet, but I went to get my phone to go to the
6760640	6764320	toilet. But you can't be alone with yourself. Yeah, I can't be alone with myself. I can't,
6765520	6770320	sitting for 30 seconds, you know, my brain, is that because they've built these algorithms to
6770320	6774080	stimulate my dopamine? Or is it because there's something in me? I guess it goes back to a
6774080	6778640	point of addiction. Well, it's both. I mean, they certainly create algorithms to stimulate
6778640	6783200	your brain and get you hooked on a dopamine hit. They're sure for sure. They call that neural
6783200	6787760	marketing. Neural marketing. Can you get that? Neural marketing. They work on your brain to get,
6787760	6792800	you know, to get you addicted. But it also comes from an earlier discomfort with the self that predates
6794240	6799200	any cell phone use. It goes back to earliest childhood, where it couldn't have been comfortable
6799200	6810560	to be just with yourself because of circumstances. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah, because I've got
6810560	6816400	friends that don't have the same addiction with their cell phones that I do. They can take it
6816400	6819200	or leave it. They put it outside their bedroom when they go to bed charging in the kitchen. I'm
6819200	6824880	like, I have to hold mine like my pillow. Yeah, exactly. Well, like your little safety pillow.
6824880	6828480	And what's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? I grab it with one eye open,
6828480	6832800	and all that gunk in my eye. I'm like trying to just, you know. Yeah. Well, how do both of you
6832800	6838160	and I work on not doing that so much? Okay. I'll give you my number. We shouldn't discuss why I
6838160	6841680	phone how we're getting on with this. That's just another reason to use my phone. But next time I
6841680	6848000	speak to you in person, you can update me on how you're getting on with that. I am working on it.
6848000	6853600	I'm working on it. I think I've got to become more cognizant of the cost of that addiction.
6853600	6859600	Well, exactly. To really, I know one of the costs is meaningful connections and presence with
6860800	6865760	and the cost to interpersonal relationships. But maybe I haven't had the cost
6867280	6871600	impact me enough yet, maybe. The question left for you,
6873920	6876640	but I don't know the signature, so I'll have to figure that out later, but is
6876640	6880080	what's your selfish dream?
6884880	6888800	You know what? I'm not sure how to sit with that question, because I'm not trying to get out of
6888800	6898960	it, but I'm just looking at my own reaction to it. At this point, I don't have too many,
6899760	6903440	what does it mean selfish, by the way? Let me ask you that. What does that mean?
6904240	6910080	Something that is for me at the expense of others? I don't think I have any dreams like that left.
6910640	6915440	I might have, not might have, I did have at some point. But if I have a dream
6917200	6923200	for myself in that sense of self-enhancing dreams, something that enhances my ego or something,
6923200	6928640	well, if this book sold a billion copies, well, that would be a nice selfish dream, you know?
6929600	6934720	But I don't know how else to answer that. I do have dreams, but they're more about
6936400	6942960	the state of the world that I'd like to see, the world I'd like to see, future generations inherit.
6942960	6947520	Selfless dreams. Yeah. Well, I don't have to self-less, because it certainly involves
6948320	6953520	my own history and certainly would make me feel better. So in that sense, it's selfish, you might
6953520	6961440	say. But they don't have to do with personal, I have enough. I've done enough and I have enough.
6961440	6966320	So I don't have anything lacking that I need to dream about.
6967280	6971760	All of our self-less dreams are also very much selfish in that regard as well.
6971760	6974240	They're going to help us. It's selfish in a different sense. I mean,
6974960	6980720	any dreams I have about a better world certainly have the function of making me feel better,
6981680	6988400	of maybe even the stuff that happened to me or the stuff that happened to you,
6989200	6992800	it would mean a lot to me if they didn't happen to any more children, you know?
6993440	6997600	So in the sense that it would mean a lot to me, you might say it's selfish,
6997600	7002480	but it's not purely about me. It's about something larger. I'm not trying to paint myself as a kind
7002480	7007920	of a altruistic saint. I'm just saying that would make me feel better. If I really knew
7008000	7013600	that kids in Gaza didn't have to face any more bombings, if kids in Israel didn't have to face
7013600	7020960	any more danger of terrorist attacks, if not that I see inequality there, but I'd like that for
7020960	7028080	both of them. If kids in Ukraine didn't have to live under the threat of missiles falling,
7029040	7035440	if people in Russia didn't have to live with the fear of perhaps a nuclear conflict or the
7035520	7043040	young man being conscripted into a war, if kids in Britain didn't have to live in poverty,
7043760	7047280	would that make you feel better? So to the extent that it makes us feel better,
7047280	7050080	you might say it's selfish, but is it?
7053520	7057280	Gabel, thank you. Well, my pleasure. Thank you so much.
7057280	7062160	Thank you so much for writing such an important book. I think my only wish is that I discovered
7062800	7068160	this book sooner, because I think so many of my, I think it would have liberated,
7068160	7072240	that's a good word, liberated me from a series of things that would have helped me to live a
7072240	7076560	much better life and to understand myself. That's the point of awareness that we talked about.
7076560	7078560	I know that your advanced age is over, isn't it?
7080560	7084480	I think we all want the answers even sooner, because we reflect on some of the consequences
7084480	7089760	or the mistakes that we made. Not that I'm imprisoned by any of those, but it's so
7089760	7095440	wonderful that this book now exists. You're a name that I started to be peppered with by my
7095440	7100480	audience over and over again, specifically in the last 12 months. People, really, really young
7100480	7104080	people were messaging me and asking me to have a conversation with you about the topics we've
7104080	7110000	talked about today, things like ADHD and their trauma and so much. And I sit here every day
7110000	7118880	talking to a lot of people on this podcast. And I think my understanding of trauma has forever been
7119760	7125680	redefined by both this conversation today, but also by your book. And I really, I'm so thankful
7125680	7129680	to you because I think that'll help me speak on the topic with more accuracy and therefore,
7130320	7136880	hopefully, help other people understand their own trauma in a more meaningful way. It's just such
7136880	7142080	an important book. Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to talk
7142080	7147040	about my work and just the opportunity to meet you. Thanks a lot. And it's written in such an
7147120	7151040	accessible way, which is so important because that means it can reach even more people.
7151040	7153040	Thank you so much. Okay, thank you.
7177040	7178420	you
