1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
The most resilient parasite is not a bacteria, it's not a virus, it is a thought, and it

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
shapes everything.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,040
He is an expert on the topic of happiness.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,600
Google made him the head of Google X, the return of a mobile browser.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,040
I know people will hate me when I say this, dating is an entirely an economics problem.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,000
When you don't know what you're looking for, then you're advertising wrong.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
How do you find out what you're looking for though?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,120
If you want to find love, it's very straightforward.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,200
In the last line in your book, you say, please find the compassion in your heart to want

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,120
happiness for my wonderful son, Ali.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
Why did you bring that up?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,280
We were having an easy conversation.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,800
I wrote Soul for Happy at a time where Ali had just left our world and he helped me really,

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,680
really figure things out.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,400
We think that this brain is supposed to be there to make us successful.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,880
Your brain is supposed to make you happy.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,960
I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world are...

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,400
Without further ado, I'm Stephen Bartlett, and this is The Diary of a CEO.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,400
I hope nobody's listening, but if you are, then please keep this to yourself.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,400
The Return of Mo Gouda

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh man, no pressure.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,040
I mean, I don't really know what to say.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,920
Our first conversation, as you'll know, as I've said many times to my audience, is still

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,160
to this day my favorite podcast episode of all time for so many reasons.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,040
It had everything that I've ever wanted from a conversation.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,280
It had the personal story delivered in a way with immense honesty and vulnerability and

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
wisdom.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
I learnt so much from that conversation, and of all the conversations I've had, whenever

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm asked wherever I go, I said that that conversation is the conversation that's had

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,360
the most profound impact on the real fundamentals of my life than any other.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,800
The words that you said then still show up at pivotal moments in my life when I'm feeling

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,440
a certain way or I'm letting something get the best of me, and it's really, really liberated

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
me of so many things.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,000
So when I heard you were back in London, I had to have another conversation with you.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's an honour.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Honestly, thanks for asking.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
I have to ask, since we spoke, what's changed in your life?

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,760
And how does your life look now?

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,360
Ever-changing, interestingly.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,040
I'm on, you know, 2020 was my year of silence and space.

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,560
2021 was my year of flow.

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,520
And then at the beginning of 2022, I asked myself, what will this year be about?

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,800
I take a theme for every year because it's sort of an interesting way to guide your life

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
in terms of where you want to go.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't like targets.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,240
It's too businessy when it comes to your own connection to yourself.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,000
And 2022, I decided it will also be a year of flow, but I called it the year of joy

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
in flow, which is really interesting.

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,640
So to me, believe it or not, as I worked through the years on empowering more of my

50
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,840
feminine side and, you know, creativity, paradoxical thinking, flow, all of those

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,440
sometimes appearingly not so disciplined traits are hyper feminine and they're very

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,080
valuable in terms of enjoying life, but also seeing the full reality of life, if you want.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,800
I did very well in 2020 with my approach to flow.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,600
I went wherever life wanted me to go, but I was still the same mo, you know, very

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,080
targeted, very focused, very able to get the maximum out of everything.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Around that, of course, there has been a lot of interesting repercussions of our

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,560
conversation that basically allowed me to write more, to connect more.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,000
I tend to be very personal when it comes to my presence on social media.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,120
So got in touch with so many wonderful people.

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,480
And I think that's created waves of flow, if you want, in my life, whereby by end of

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,800
April, I packed everything up that I had in Dubai, put it in a tiny little storage

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,640
space. I've always been a minimalist anyway, so it wasn't much.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,200
And now I have no idea where I'm going from here, completely in flow.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,160
What does that mean?

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,880
You have no idea where you're going from here.

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm in London because of my book publication until end of the month.

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,560
And then.

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,560
We'll find out.

69
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,920
There's something quite curious about that, because I think we tend to believe

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,560
that we need stability or a home or, I don't know, those home

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,040
comforts to make ourselves happy.

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,880
So I think about sometimes in my life where I, where I was a freelancer,

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
kind of like drifting through the world, I could do it for a short period of time.

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,400
But in the long term, I ultimately craved that sense of home again.

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,720
So I think we need both, right?

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,200
I think we need the balance.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,800
I think the story that most of us don't realize is that every one of us

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,320
wants an adventure and every one of us wants stability.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,960
Every one of us wants, at the point in time, a long term committed,

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,160
wonderful, connected relationship and a little and at other times,

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,400
once the parties and the fun and, you know, Russian experience and so on.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
And I think context is a big part of what we miss as humans,

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,440
that through life, context changes.

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,720
OK, and I've been on an interesting journey because, of course,

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,880
you can imagine, I have always been extreme in whichever stage

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,760
I had been in my life when I, when I became, you know, a business executive.

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,480
I was a very serious business executive, you know, the 12, 14 hour days,

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,440
the, you know, the constant hopping around the world and so on and so forth.

89
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,760
And when I became an author, I became a very serious author.

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,200
You know, I started to really, really spend a lot of hours

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,280
not writing and, you know, documenting my, my thoughts.

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,200
And I write two or three books at the same time.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,920
When you're extreme in those things, you tend to be quite a bit

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,600
blinded, if you want, by the pace, by the detail you're swamped into it.

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,720
And it does take does take challenging yourself, if you want,

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,920
to get to a point where you say, perhaps, perhaps this was wonderful

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,000
for my last seven years of my life, but perhaps, you know, context has changed.

98
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Perhaps I need to explore another part of my life to reach that point

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
where I feel complete.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,000
And was there something that some kind of signal that life gave you

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,080
that said it's time to pack up and flow?

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
What was that?

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,560
For most of us who rush really fast in life, we don't even recognize what we feel.

104
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,520
We don't even even recognize what our hearts, what our souls,

105
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
what our bodies are signaling to us.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,200
And and I think there has been a very strong longing in my life

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,560
to live that idea of, I call it half monk,

108
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,960
which, you know, it's interesting.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Again, the way we stack life is quite strange.

110
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,800
So you you you we work really, really, really hard for the first 30 or 40 years

111
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,680
of our lives, and then we retire when we can't really enjoy life.

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,560
You know, it's like when you retire, you're basically taking your stick

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,640
and going to whatever Florida or whatever.

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,720
When it's actually the way life should be, is that you probably should

115
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,520
take the 10 years of retirement, divide them across the 40 years

116
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,400
and perhaps take three months off every year.

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,760
If if we were to redesign life, you know, it would be wonderful

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,200
to work seven months of every year and take three or nine months of every year

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,880
and take three months off.

120
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Similarly, you know, if you look even at the spiritual path

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,480
of some some of the most renowned monks in the world,

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,560
you go through a certain path through life and then you stop completely

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,640
and then you call become a monk, you know, for for for a for a while.

124
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,880
And then, you know, you may come back to life or become something else.

125
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,240
And I decided there would be an interesting ambition to

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,960
to to investigate the possibility of maybe 50 percent of your life

127
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,120
as a monk and 50 percent as a modern day warrior, as I call it.

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,760
Right. And I took the number 50 because that's how mathematicians will work.

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,400
I'll start from the midpoint and then, you know, irritate around it.

130
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Maybe I'll end at 60 or whatever.

131
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,840
OK. And it's actually interestingly possible.

132
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,040
It's interestingly possible to spend 50 percent of your days

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,920
in in monklike activities, which would be connection, reflection,

134
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,920
you know, some some stillness and silence, some service to the world

135
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,120
and 50 percent completely engaged in, you know, writing, writing,

136
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,720
I consider is a service, but, you know, like business and business

137
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,960
conversations and, you know, coaching and whatever it is else that I do,

138
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
being stuck in traffic and so on and so forth. OK.

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,080
And it was a stupid ambition, but then it started to become a lot more

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,440
viable in my mind that actually I could do that 50 percent of every day,

141
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,520
50 percent of every week, 50 percent of every year

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,560
could actually be spent that way.

143
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,080
And then and the thing you need to to make that happen is to step out

144
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
of the mainstream of your steady life. OK.

145
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,440
So I had a wonderful conversation with my manager, Munir, who,

146
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,320
you know, really wants our success and the success of the mission.

147
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,000
But that sometimes makes him push me very hard to add stuff in my calendar.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,160
And I said, can you allow me the life of a creative?

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,520
So can you cram my Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the point where I start hating you

150
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,000
but then leave my rest of the week free with one day

151
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
that is negotiable between us. OK.

152
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
And that basically is even better than 50 50.

153
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,320
So in those two days, I'm completely a modern day warrior,

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
completely engaged in, you know, whatever the modern world wants from me.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,840
But then that allows me the rest of the week, if you want,

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,560
to do the other things that may allow me to find and reflect and maybe

157
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,120
maybe figure something out that is so much better for the days where I get

158
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,760
engaged. Right. So if my if my work is to spread some ideas,

159
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,880
then silence to find those ideas is actually useful for it.

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,560
And so that was the feeling you said.

161
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,400
What what what was the the signal, the feeling has been there for quite a bit

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,680
of time. And then when the landlord said, hey, by the way,

163
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,880
want the apartment back, I was like, great, let's do this.

164
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,160
Let's leave the mainstream. OK.

165
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,880
Let's go somewhere and see where that takes us.

166
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,320
See where where serendipity will will show us.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,280
I think that's an interesting place to be. Are you single?

168
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,160
I am single and not single.

169
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,920
I think I know how that that may get a lot of people judging me.

170
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,680
So I again, in an interesting way,

171
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
found that my current lifestyle does not qualify me,

172
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,520
if you want, for a committed relationship.

173
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,320
OK. But that a committed relationship is one specific definition

174
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,760
of relationships that I think our world has stuck to for a period of time

175
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
that evolved. OK. There are multiple, multiple,

176
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,440
multiple definitions of relationships today.

177
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,840
I think if you if you look back 20 years, 30 years at most,

178
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,280
you'd realize that that singular traditional model

179
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,760
excluded all same sex relationships, all bisexual relationships,

180
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,560
all this and all of that. It also included it also excluded

181
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,800
relationships that were not till death do us part and so on and so forth.

182
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,240
I found and I say that with.

183
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,120
Worry that people will judge me.

184
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,920
I found that what I'm doing is more important to me at the moment

185
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
than a traditional committed relationship.

186
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,520
OK. Simply because I feel that an hour spent

187
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,880
with one person could also be an hour that I spend helping a thousand people.

188
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,080
OK. And even though that hour for me

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,360
is definitely enriching and fulfilling and so on and so forth,

190
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,720
it becomes sometimes

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,520
the commitment associated with it doesn't make it an hour.

192
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Normally makes it several hours, makes it a big chunk of your life

193
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
that I lived for 27 years and loved.

194
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,560
And I would say it's the absolute best way to live all together, right?

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,880
But it's definitely not something that from a current phase of my life

196
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,640
where the focus of where I want to put my chips, if you want,

197
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,320
my hours of my life is where I want to be.

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And so I end up when in very, very connected, very deep,

199
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
very wonderful and loving relationships

200
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,280
that are super honest, but not lasting.

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,560
You know, if my life will take me from here to somewhere else,

202
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,880
I will not consider sticking around here as a prerequisite to find

203
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,440
or, you know, being a prerequisite to find a relationship

204
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,800
more important than my journey of finding where I need to be.

205
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,560
I learned that interestingly when I spoke to my dear friend, Matthew Ricard

206
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,160
on Slow Mo. So Matthew is probably one of the most renowned monks in the world.

207
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,120
He was a PhD in molecular biology, if I remember.

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,960
And he quit his life and went and became a monk.

209
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,760
And he had 60,000 hours of lifetime meditation,

210
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,360
which reconfigured his brain in a way that that was publicly

211
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
a very, very interesting science study.

212
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,120
He was called the happiest man in the world because of that.

213
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,320
And I asked him and I said, why, Matthew, why, why would you leave your life

214
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
and your girlfriend and your, you know, your he was French living in Paris

215
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,800
and your PhD and go and become a monk?

216
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,080
And he he said it would be very unfair

217
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,480
to have someone in my life expect me to be there all the time.

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,440
When what I wanted was my pilgrimages and to be next to my teachers

219
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,120
and my time of isolation and my alone time in my hermitage and so on and so forth.

220
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,960
He basically said it's not a promise I can make if I make it, I would be lying.

221
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,680
And I think that probably was a very enlightening moment for me

222
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,920
because there are many things I give up on in my life that would make my life richer.

223
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,000
But they're perhaps not on my path, at least not for the time being.

224
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Is this a do you view that as a phase in your life?

225
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,360
Would you view that as definitely everything is a phase in your life?

226
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
Definitely, definitely.

227
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,520
I think that's the changing context.

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,400
Steve is probably the biggest failure of humanity.

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,640
The changing context is we have a tendency

230
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:40,720
because we are designed as survival machines to want things to remain exactly the same.

231
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,680
If it's comfortable, if it's safe, let's keep it.

232
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,800
I want my same coffee machine every day because I know that machine.

233
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,320
I know it's really where I can make amazing coffee with it.

234
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,800
And so, of course, when it's time to pack things,

235
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,400
I need it to hug that machine and say, OK, baby, I'm not going to see you for a few months.

236
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
But the truth is there are many places all over the world

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,480
that will make an amazing coffee, too, right?

238
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,040
That attachment is one of the biggest reasons for unhappiness in life.

239
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,760
It's the idea of I want my glass of water.

240
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,240
I don't want a glass of water.

241
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
I want my mug.

242
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
I want my glass of water.

243
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,520
I want my streets.

244
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,040
I want my commute every day.

245
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,760
I want my job security and so on and so forth, which is beautiful.

246
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,280
And by the way, every single one of us needs to live that for a phase of our life

247
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,320
for a season, if you want.

248
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
OK.

249
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,880
But the failure to recognize the changing seasons

250
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,040
sometimes results in a narrowness of our life that makes us stick to one path.

251
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,400
When we spoke about you, you started as a CEO of a marketing

252
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,760
very successful business, and now you're a podcast host,

253
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,640
you're an author, you're on Dragonsden and so on and so forth.

254
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,600
That's a recognition within you that this phase

255
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,040
has served its purpose and there is something else I need to do with my life.

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,080
And by the way, you could go back to that same phase, right?

257
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,800
You could become a CEO again at a point in time.

258
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,760
And it's that seasonal view of life.

259
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,040
And a big part of flow, you know, where I'm trying to live my life now

260
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,160
is to recognize those seasons, is to say, look,

261
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,040
I had an amazing, amazing woman for 27 years, right?

262
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
And I had a family.

263
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,040
I have been there.

264
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,880
I have done that.

265
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
I've enjoyed it tremendously.

266
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,880
It enriched my life, but it left gaps behind that need to be fulfilled

267
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,920
or completed with other phases and other seasons.

268
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,680
And I think the game here is to be able to allow yourself

269
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,320
to rather than plan and say my safety, my security, my everything

270
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,240
to allow yourself to sit back and say, where is what's life saying?

271
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,760
Is life hinting that I should be in London?

272
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,640
I can be in London.

273
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Let me be in London.

274
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
Right? Let's see.

275
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,120
Maybe at the end of that season, nothing's going to happen.

276
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,400
You're going to go like, oh, it was just very good coffee

277
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,560
and a conversation with Steven, right?

278
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,520
And and it could be that, you know, oh, my God, it was the best coffee

279
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
of my life and the best conversation I ever had, right?

280
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,800
And and I think that wisdom, if you want,

281
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,240
it depends on if you're spiritual or not.

282
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,120
If if you believe that there is a part to you that is not physical,

283
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,240
call it consciousness or call it a soul, if you're spiritual.

284
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,600
That part is senses, things that are a little bit beyond the limitations

285
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,080
of the physical day, it might sense, you know, a need for the rest of being

286
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,000
someone else somewhere that may benefit from my presence in London

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,560
or maybe a need in within me to get a little bit of rain,

288
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
which I hadn't seen for a while.

289
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,960
I don't know, right?

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,920
And if the way the way that other part of you communicates to you

291
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,440
is through intuition, it cannot plant a text message in your head

292
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,560
and say, by the way, by the four teens, you need to be in London.

293
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,800
It just gets you gives you that feeling of something is missing from here

294
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
and something needs to be attended to there.

295
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Do you want to investigate?

296
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,240
And I found from the spiritual teachers and happiness teachers

297
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,200
and actually business teachers that I worked with in my life

298
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,400
that those who are able who are able to go like, let me find out.

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,400
OK, let me find out.

300
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
Let me check this out.

301
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,400
Normally, stumble upon some of the biggest changes to our lives,

302
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,440
all of us, not just their lives.

303
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,960
And, you know, and it's it's quite interesting because

304
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,840
if you really look back at your life, really,

305
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,440
most of the events that actually shaped you,

306
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,560
that actually changed your lives were not planned at all.

307
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,200
You know, there probably were always those surprises

308
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,560
and often were the surprises you didn't want. OK.

309
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,440
And then somehow you go through with them and you end up in a place

310
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,240
that suddenly you recognize and go like, ah,

311
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
that's why I've been walking for the last 14 days.

312
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,640
And by the way, the game in my view, I say life is a quest.

313
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,280
It's not a journey. OK.

314
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,480
And the difference between a journey and a quest

315
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,840
is when you're on a journey, you've sort of plotted your path.

316
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
OK, I'm going to take that flight.

317
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
I'm going to go to this place.

318
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,160
I'm going to stay in that hotel.

319
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
It's a journey. Right.

320
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,920
And it will eventually end up in a destination. Right.

321
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,440
A quest is very different.

322
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,880
A quest is Christopher Columbus taking a crew on a ship

323
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,440
and in the middle of the, you know, fog,

324
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,800
not knowing where the new world really is. OK.

325
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
That's a quest.

326
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,440
You know, you don't really know where the destination is.

327
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
You're basically taking a couple of steps forward

328
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,520
and then stopping and then looking at the fog

329
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,040
and then assessing and then reflecting and then saying,

330
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
maybe I should take a step left and then you take one step left.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
And then you say, OK, how does it feel now?

332
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,160
Do I want to go forward again or do I want to go one step back?

333
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,640
And by the way, there's absolutely nothing wrong

334
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,400
with taking two steps forward, assessing going to the left.

335
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,640
And then saying, left wasn't what I was supposed to do.

336
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,480
I'll go back and take a step to the right and see what happens.

337
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,280
But like Christopher Columbus, you you set off on your quest.

338
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm sure as Christopher Columbus did for a reason,

339
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
you wouldn't load up the ship and put all those men on the ship

340
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,160
and get a boat.

341
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,680
And there has to be some kind of inspiration

342
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,440
or some kind of reason why you set off.

343
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,520
That's the question I want to ask, but I was also compelled by

344
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
you said you were in the relationship for twenty eight years

345
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,120
and eventually there's something missing.

346
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah, there's always there is always something missing.

347
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
What was what was missing?

348
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,520
So let's talk about the big picture first,

349
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,040
because I think people need to understand that there's nothing

350
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,800
wrong with having anything missing.

351
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,040
OK, but we are a very complex being

352
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,280
that is made up of so many emotions and so many reflections

353
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,160
and so many traumas and so many stories and backgrounds and desires.

354
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,960
And we live in a very, very, very, very unsimplifiable world.

355
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,560
OK, and yet we try to simplify it rather than try to enjoy it fully.

356
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,280
OK, when you when they tell you sweet and sour chicken in a Chinese restaurant,

357
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,960
it's not just a little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour.

358
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,080
There is a ton of flavor happening within all of this.

359
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,040
OK, there is there are layers of complexity

360
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,920
that creates a life that's worth living.

361
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,400
And for all for every one of us, it's that attachment.

362
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,640
It's the attachment of but I like this.

363
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't want to change this that deprives us of all of the other flavors, right?

364
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,480
Nibel and I, I believe Nibel made me my my ex-wife.

365
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,680
She we met when she was 18 in university.

366
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,480
We fell in love madly.

367
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,040
We got married the day she finished university.

368
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,840
You know, we spent 22 years together with our beautiful children.

369
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,680
And then life changed context.

370
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,760
The context changed.

371
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,960
Ali left our world, my son.

372
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,480
And when Ali left our world, I hit the pedals and went double speed.

373
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,400
When Ali left our left our world, Nibel, on the other hand, looked at her life

374
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,920
and said, for the first time, I can now focus on me.

375
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,720
My my children left one went to university in Canada, and Ali left the world

376
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,200
to his next journey.

377
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,840
And, you know, simply she she looked at herself and said, OK, it's my time.

378
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm not going to define my life by you anymore.

379
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,360
I can't travel the world with you because of your passion

380
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,640
and your mission and what you've now assigned yourself as the new task.

381
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,480
I'm going to find what I want to do with my life.

382
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,280
And I think that's wonderful.

383
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,720
If you if you ask me, that's definitely what everyone should do.

384
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,480
Now, with that contradiction, we became further and further apart.

385
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Remember, love and relationships are not ever taken for granted.

386
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,240
I always say this openly.

387
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
I fell in love with Nibel six times.

388
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,640
OK, I fell in love with that cute girl that I met in university.

389
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,800
Then I fell in love again when she became my wife, because when you're

390
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,040
your girlfriend and your wife, you're two different people.

391
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,640
And by the way, I was her boyfriend and her husband.

392
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
These are two different people, too.

393
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,400
And now suddenly we're left with those boyfriend, girlfriend gone

394
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,280
and the husband and wife looking at each other and saying, where's my sweetheart?

395
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,640
Right. And then suddenly, you know, most people would get into that stage

396
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,040
in one of those constant changes and and say, hey, you know, I don't like this.

397
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,960
I want my sweetheart back, you know, it's an attachment.

398
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,720
Or you can go like, OK, the sweetheart is gone, but oh, my God, this one is so cute.

399
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,360
Right. And when when you actually see it that way, you fall in love again

400
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,880
with a totally different person.

401
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,880
And then again and then again, I believe I counted six times.

402
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,840
OK. And then eventually, when we wanted to to have our different

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,080
focuses in life, I would call that falling in love again, but slightly differently

404
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,400
because you see that the thing that we mess in life is we define love.

405
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,680
Love is too big, if you ask me, as a concept to fit within romance.

406
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,040
OK, we've we've narrowed love down to that story that Hollywood told us,

407
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,640
which is love is just romance.

408
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,600
OK, it's a it's a romantic relationship between two people.

409
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,960
It has intimacy in it and it has to be this and that.

410
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,040
And they have to live that way. OK.

411
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,880
The truth is, no, I believe there are 20 ways two partners can enjoy

412
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,840
and benefit from the company of each other and grow together,

413
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,720
two of which are sex and intimacy.

414
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,560
And we've defined love

415
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,320
per as per sex and intimacy. OK.

416
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,080
So if she if she's not your woman, as in as in your sleeping together,

417
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,720
does that end the love in any way? OK.

418
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,120
You know, as a matter of fact, if if it ends the love,

419
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,040
then it was never love if you really think about it.

420
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,520
And so we we define our our relationships that way.

421
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,280
And I think that's a recipe for disappointment,

422
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,800
because in reality, every every relationship will always go through those changes.

423
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,600
There will be times where sex won't be great and there will be other times

424
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
when your spiritual connection is at its best.

425
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,720
And, you know, it really is entirely around again, the layers and the flavors

426
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,720
and how you can choose each one of those and embrace it and grow it

427
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,800
and and and make it a prominent and live it as much as you can with that person.

428
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,600
And yeah, if if one of them ends,

429
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,520
my feeling is that the rest should not end, the rest should grow.

430
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,240
You more than anyone now, after those 20 plus years of being

431
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,880
in a committed relationship will understand the value of that committed relationship

432
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,920
and the place that it would I'm presuming add value to your life now.

433
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,680
But I guess there's an equation you're doing about what you would

434
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,280
what would come at the expense of that.

435
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,720
And it sounds like from my perspective,

436
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,440
the thing that would come at the expense of that is your mission,

437
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,160
your freedom, which you are also spending some time to really indulge in.

438
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,640
No, I'm as I think I think we all make those choices all the time.

439
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,320
It just suddenly becomes quite contentious when it's about love and relationship.

440
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,400
OK, but you know what?

441
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,240
You know, I left an apartment that I enjoyed

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,680
because I needed to do something else, right?

443
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,320
I am here in London, where when I could be in Silicon Valley, for example,

444
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,840
because they wanted me to talk about innovation there,

445
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,520
because I need to be in London because I want my next book to succeed, right?

446
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,440
So so we we all make those, you know, choices all the time.

447
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,040
And and life, sadly, is a question of compromise,

448
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,360
because, you know, you you you often say that the best of both worlds doesn't happen.

449
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,600
You can't you cannot have best of both worlds.

450
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,760
You can you can either say I'm living fully as my number one priority to achieve a

451
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,880
and I'll achieve as much as I can of B, as long as it doesn't contradict A.

452
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,560
Or you can say I'll go for B and, you know, I'll sacrifice a bit of A for that.

453
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,560
Right. And and it's interesting because most people,

454
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,600
especially the romantics, will say, how can you sacrifice love?

455
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,640
You know, love is the most important.

456
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,800
No, a billion happy is more important than love,

457
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,840
in all honesty, for me, in my to my personal love.

458
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,600
OK, because in my capacity to to feel love for a billion people,

459
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,600
OK, and and actually try and dedicate my life to as many as I can reach with that.

460
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,800
I tend to believe that's that prioritizing my own comforts and my own life

461
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,360
and my own settlement, if you want, being settled is selfish, to be honest.

462
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,800
It's it's a different phase.

463
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,200
It hopefully will happen in two, three years time, but it's not the phase now.

464
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,800
It's not the right time for it at all. OK.

465
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,120
And yes, I wish I could get get get A and B.

466
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,120
And maybe I'll stumble upon that wonderful woman

467
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,880
that is completely aligned and, you know, spends that that my trips with me

468
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,320
and, you know, supports this.

469
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
And if I do, that's amazing.

470
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,480
But if I don't, what would I prioritize?

471
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,440
It's life is a question of choices.

472
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,920
You could be doing anything with your time, you know, you're you're clearly

473
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,840
someone that is being very intentional about the use of your time

474
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,480
and making sure that every hour of your time is allocated towards

475
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,800
what you want, whether that is playing video games, whether it is writing a book.

476
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,760
So why did you choose to write a book called That Little Voice in Your Head?

477
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,080
I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world

478
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,040
without competition beyond that, like they are by far bigger than all of the others are

479
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,640
ego, lack of self-love.

480
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,000
And actually, in order, it would be lack of self-love, ego and that little voice

481
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
in your head. OK.

482
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,640
And the little voice in your head, as I as I say at the beginning of the book,

483
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,520
that I would dare say that there has never been a moment in your life

484
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,840
where any event had the power to make you unhappy

485
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,560
until you turned it into a thought. OK.

486
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,880
So so anything could happen.

487
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,520
It's the story you tell yourself about it that makes you unhappy.

488
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,120
It's not the event. It's the story. Right.

489
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,440
And so if my if I'm true to my commitment to try and make the world happier,

490
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,600
then I need to talk about those three topics in three different books

491
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
if you if you want, or maybe some content of some form.

492
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,720
But but that's not the point.

493
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,640
The point is what's tagged, what's what struck me and really, really puzzled me

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,640
was that I realized when I wrote Scary Smart

495
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,680
and, you know, Scary Smart was entirely about technology

496
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,840
and where technology is going and so on.

497
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,280
I realized that we humans have the ultimate technology in our heads,

498
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,200
a brain that is so sophisticated, so capable of doing things that are

499
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,400
really, really beyond the capacity of any supercomputer still today.

500
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,360
And yet we know how to use our smartphones and our devices

501
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,680
better than we know how to use that brain.

502
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,560
Most people get trained on how to use Excel,

503
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,800
but they never really get trained on how to streamline the thoughts in their head.

504
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,520
OK. And and that appeared to me to be a very interesting

505
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
engineering problem.

506
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,960
And so the idea was to create that analogy between neuroscience and computer science.

507
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,600
So the book in my mind was if I can show people that those brains,

508
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,640
the neuroscience of them is is actually similar, very analogous

509
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,280
to computer science and the devices you have in your hand,

510
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,160
because people already know how to use those devices,

511
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,800
then that knowledge would allow them to use the brain as good as they use the devices.

512
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,160
The basics here, which is the title of the first chapter of your book.

513
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,320
And it feels like the first chapter really kind of introduces some of the

514
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
inspiration behind why you wrote the book.

515
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,800
You talk a lot about your wife and the illusions that you live under.

516
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,360
What are the illusions that you you live under?

517
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,080
Or you lived under?

518
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,000
Again, let's think about the bigger picture first.

519
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,720
Everything that we have, you haven't visited and investigated

520
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,840
and arrived at a competent, confident

521
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,160
conviction that this is your own view.

522
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,800
Is probably an illusion, OK, which is quite striking

523
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,080
because for a man like me, who spends a lot of his time reflecting,

524
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,840
we're surrounded, we're submerged in illusions.

525
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,720
OK, everything from the value of, you know, a branded bag

526
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,520
all the way to, you know, what the TV is telling us,

527
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,280
what the government is supposed to do and all of that stuff.

528
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,160
Unless you've reflected on it and said, OK, I'm being told this,

529
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm, you know, behaving this way, which might be contradicting

530
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,800
what I've been told, but I'm feeling that way, which might be a third contradiction.

531
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
And where is my reality?

532
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,440
It's safe to assume that this was an illusion.

533
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,800
So a big part of that little voice in your head is an admission

534
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,240
of all of the mistakes I made using that machine in my life.

535
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,320
Or not all, but many, not even many, but many mistakes

536
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,800
that I've made using this machine, not all of them.

537
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,120
There are many more mistakes.

538
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,640
One, I think the biggest of them was a conviction in my early years

539
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,680
that my kids were a burden.

540
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,240
My family was a responsibility, OK, which does happen when they come

541
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,560
to life when you're very young.

542
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,080
I mean, I had Ali when I was 25.

543
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:36,440
I was just turned 26 and and and you know, I got married when I was 25.

544
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,400
So basically you start to feel responsible.

545
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,600
You start to prioritize work.

546
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,800
You start to go out in that treadmill, you know, the hedonic treadmill

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,160
and just run, run, run, run, run, run, OK.

548
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,560
And the pressure that you that you put on yourself when you do that

549
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,200
makes you start to think, OK, they are the reason why I'm working so hard.

550
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,080
They are the reason why I'm stressed. OK.

551
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,120
When in reality, if you had asked them, they would have said,

552
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,320
Papa, just come play with us, right?

553
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
We don't want more than what we have.

554
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,000
It's me losing context and running like crazy that made me think that way.

555
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,640
And the basics of the challenges we have with our brains

556
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,800
is that we believe what our brains tell us. OK.

557
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,640
So when my brain tell me they are the the the burden, they are the challenge.

558
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,880
My whole being responds to that.

559
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,600
My whole being starts to behave that way. OK.

560
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,000
And and I think what the reality that we miss when we do those things

561
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,160
becomes what you have seen in that.

562
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,040
If you if you like the movie Inception,

563
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,080
you know, when she when his wife had that

564
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,320
thought, you know, we're waiting for a train or train, you know,

565
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,320
basically that kept playing in her head over and over and over

566
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,280
that convinced her that this is not the real world, that they are in a dream

567
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,200
and that the way to go out of it is to die.

568
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,920
That actually led her to committing suicide.

569
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,280
And and and, you know, big opening of the movie that my favorite movie line

570
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,560
of all time is what is the most resilient parasite.

571
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,760
OK. And the most resilient parasite is not a bacteria.

572
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,320
It's not a virus.

573
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,000
It is a thought that you implant deep in your brain

574
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,440
and believe in it over and over and over through your life.

575
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,000
And it shapes everything, shapes everything.

576
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,520
Interestingly, without you even knowing why you're doing what you're doing

577
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,640
is because because of that thought, because of that belief,

578
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,160
because of that ideology and people do the weirdest things.

579
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,880
I have a very, very dear friend who's a brilliant engineer,

580
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,600
brilliant engineer who had that thought in his head.

581
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,560
He's now in his early 60s, but that's if I tell my ideas to a businessman,

582
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
he's going to steal it.

583
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,160
So every startup he ever attempted, he wanted to be the engineer and the CEO.

584
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,520
OK. And as a result, everything he started failed,

585
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,120
even though the ideas and the engineering, the the rigor was incredible.

586
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,360
But he just couldn't get that idea out of his mind.

587
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,080
And you can go all the way to people who have ideas that lead to wars

588
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,800
or to destruction or to terrorist acts or whatever.

589
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,520
It's just one idea seeded deep enough in our head

590
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,400
that really leads us to become who we are and digging out that idea and finding it.

591
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,000
That's the basic.

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,360
The basic is to find those thoughts and how you can deal with them

593
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,360
so that you eradicate them so that you can actually live through to who you are,

594
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,720
not the thoughts that have been implanted in your brain.

595
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,200
And how does one go about even knowing

596
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,840
where to start that search for those sort of limiting or imprisoning thoughts

597
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,640
that have become the satellite navigation of our lives?

598
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,720
It is it's a moment of truth.

599
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,160
It's a moment of honesty.

600
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,800
You know, I think you started with that very.

601
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,400
I can't believe I spoke about that about the very personal question

602
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,840
about my relationship choices, right?

603
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,640
But that's a moment of truth.

604
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,120
It's not that I don't want someone in my life,

605
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,280
but it's that if that's someone contradicts priority A,

606
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,400
then priority A is actually what I stand for, right?

607
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,600
And you get those by comparing what you're thinking.

608
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,840
To what you actually do and what you actually feel.

609
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
And it's a very interesting exercise if you're coherent in something.

610
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,560
If you say I am vegan, for example, OK,

611
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
if if you identify yourself as vegan,

612
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,200
but you crave eating animal protein

613
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,920
and you feel that you're pressured, then you're not a vegan.

614
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,800
OK, you could be a striving vegan.

615
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,080
You're trying to be vegan.

616
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,160
You could be an ideologist vegan.

617
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,040
You want you believe in the ideology of veganism,

618
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,200
but you're not don't call yourself I am a vegan.

619
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,640
OK, you can then change that thought and say, I want to be vegan.

620
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,800
OK, that's a different thought than I am vegan.

621
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
And you can apply that to everything, to every part of your life.

622
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,160
I am in that partnership.

623
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,360
I love her and I want to stay with her forever.

624
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,680
But I'm looking at every other woman and I feel that I am in jail.

625
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,800
OK, great. Have that conversation with yourself.

626
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,760
Have that conversation with yourself

627
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,000
because what you're feeling is contradicting.

628
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,120
What you're doing is contradicting what you're thinking.

629
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
So much of my life is filled with contradicting.

630
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,840
Absolutely.

631
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,800
What does that say?

632
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,480
So I'm thinking about, you know, I say that I want to be in a committed relationship,

633
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,640
but then I what I do is work all the time

634
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,160
and want to work all the time and choose work all the time.

635
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,920
So what does that mean?

636
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
What does that mean?

637
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,520
You can tell me on camera.

638
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,840
I'm not going to cry.

639
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,360
It is. It's it's really it is look, you're not alone.

640
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
All of us are and it's not one topic.

641
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,760
It's on every topic. OK.

642
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,520
So so there are, as I always talk about, there are three compartments in our brains.

643
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,720
OK, one compartment is what I call compartment one,

644
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,400
which are things that are true and we know are true. OK.

645
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,440
The other is compartment three, which are things that are that are not true

646
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,720
and we know they're not true.

647
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,560
OK, and the majority of what's happening inside us

648
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,400
is what I call compartment two, which are things that are undecided.

649
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,080
We either don't know them or we know that they're not aligned,

650
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,320
but we can live with them for now. We don't prioritize them.

651
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,920
What matters is not solving them.

652
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,080
What matters is marking them as compartment two.

653
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,000
If you mark them as compartment two in your head, you go like, OK, hold on.

654
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,040
This topic is unresolved.

655
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,040
It's not within my priority today, but I need to come back to that topic

656
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,640
just as just like my choice of relationships. Right.

657
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,280
You know, it takes a long time and a lot of experimenting

658
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,320
after my separation with my with my wife to try and get to a point

659
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,400
where I actually know that I'm going to put in the time

660
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,000
and investigate where I am in life.

661
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,840
During throughout that time, I acknowledge to myself and I say,

662
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,680
this is compartment two. I don't know what I want. I don't.

663
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,280
Right. And the point is so many of those exist.

664
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,000
If you live assuming that it's compartment one, you're completely messed up.

665
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,040
Right. Because your actions are not matching your your your feelings

666
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,240
and your feelings are not matching your thoughts.

667
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
OK, you're not you're not complete.

668
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,160
You're not full. You're not settled.

669
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,720
You know, we, you know, that that idea of equilibrium.

670
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Most people, the easiest way to imagine it

671
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,040
visually is to imagine a pendulum. Right.

672
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,920
If your life is in equilibrium, it's in total balance.

673
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,160
That total balance is the point at which

674
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,720
minimal effort is needed to live.

675
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,560
If you're in balance, you're not struggling.

676
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,000
OK, just like the pendulum, the pendulum, when it's at

677
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,840
at its equilibrium point, you literally need zero force

678
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,960
to keep it in the equilibrium point forever.

679
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,680
You don't have to apply any force to it.

680
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,960
You want to push it a little bit to the right.

681
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,520
You have to apply a force and keep that force for as long as you

682
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,480
you wanted to stay within that place.

683
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,760
And that's what we do with our lives all the time, that our nature,

684
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,080
our balance, our equilibrium is not exactly how we're living.

685
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,280
And so we're constantly applying effort, constantly trying to be in a place

686
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,680
that is not our natural place to be.

687
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,080
We want to be there, so we apply the effort.

688
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,760
Is there anything wrong with that?

689
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,280
Absolutely not, because life is cyclical. OK.

690
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,720
And life is all compromises as we start.

691
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,520
But the trick is to say, when I am in that place,

692
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,920
I am aware that this place is not my natural tendency.

693
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,920
And I am OK with that because that place gives me a B and C.

694
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,000
There is a utility to that place.

695
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,200
At the same time, I want to tell myself openly

696
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
that I'm heading from that place to that point of equilibrium.

697
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
Could that could be by saying, in the next seven years,

698
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,640
I'm not going to do anything about it, but in seven years time,

699
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm going to start to head in that equilibrium.

700
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,520
Or you could say, I'm going to take a step every day

701
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,480
and for the next seven years, whichever way you want.

702
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,920
And or you, by the way, or you can also tell yourself, I don't care.

703
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,480
I know it's not my equilibrium, but I'm going to do it anyway,

704
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,920
because that's what I believe in.

705
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,160
I think that's very much at the state I'm in.

706
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,840
If you ask me, I'd like to be in, you know,

707
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,080
50 percent of the year doing absolutely nothing, OK,

708
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,160
with someone I absolutely love with a very simple life.

709
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,280
But that's not my life every day.

710
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,080
And I know that to be true, and I will do it for a while to go.

711
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,280
You know, because I have, I have assigned myself something

712
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,280
that I believe requires that effort.

713
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,760
OK, the other thing that humans do, most of us,

714
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,360
is we leave a lot of pendulums out of equilibrium.

715
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,640
So so it's actually quite easy to tell yourself, look,

716
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,320
my number one pendulum is my work.

717
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,800
OK, I'm going to put that in equilibrium.

718
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,400
Then my second, you know,

719
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,520
pendulum in importance is relationship or reverse them if you want.

720
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,240
The third is my impact.

721
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,080
The fourth is my friendships.

722
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,120
The fifth is my health and so on.

723
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,360
And then the game is if you want your work to actually benefit,

724
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,680
put the others in equilibrium, OK, or acknowledge to yourself

725
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
that they're not, but don't complain about it.

726
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,560
Don't feel bad about it. OK.

727
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,400
And if you do that, you manage to then simply focus yourself

728
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,120
on the one that is your most priority.

729
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,400
And then life is in an interesting way, linear that way in physics.

730
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,880
It's basically it's instead of the parallel processing

731
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,040
of trying to fix all of them at the same time.

732
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,520
You're simply saying, I'm going to process them in series.

733
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm going to fix this work element pendulum first.

734
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,520
And when it's done, I'll fix the next one.

735
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
And then when it's done, I'll fix the next one.

736
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,520
And it's a constant journey.

737
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,760
So you're not alone.

738
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,720
I'm exactly like you constantly, constantly searching

739
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,920
and constantly reflecting and investigating and finding that equilibrium.

740
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,800
Just going back to something you said there about what you'd probably want.

741
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,560
Is it a case that you don't believe you could live a life

742
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,400
where you have priority of your mission, one one billion happy?

743
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,320
And a partner who is is not impeding on the mission?

744
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,400
No, absolutely not. I believe it's 100 percent possible.

745
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,680
Just not met the person yet. Absolutely. OK.

746
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,360
OK. The economics of love and romance are quite shocking.

747
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,640
Most people don't understand how that works.

748
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,160
You know, if you have if you have one requirement in the if you have zero

749
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,440
requirements in the person that you need in your life,

750
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,440
walk out of your door.

751
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,040
The first person that you meet is that person, right?

752
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,000
Because you have zero of anything that this person is is OK for you.

753
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,800
If you have one requirement and and say one of every ten people

754
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,960
in the world has that requirement, OK, bring that. Yeah.

755
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,480
Yeah, or something deeper, you know, let's start, you know, I am straight.

756
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,640
So I need a woman, OK, that by definition removes 50 percent of the population.

757
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,040
Yeah. OK.

758
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,200
I am, you know, I need a certain age bracket in my life that by by by itself

759
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,000
removes maybe 70 percent of the remaining population and so on.

760
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,040
So every layer that you add to your requirements,

761
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,400
sadly, follows the n squared problem. OK.

762
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,080
So the n squared problem is if you're looking for a person with one criteria

763
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,440
and one in every 10 persons have that.

764
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,320
If you add another layer of criteria, it's not one in 20.

765
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,920
It's one in 100.

766
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,360
If you add a third criteria, it's one in a thousand.

767
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,600
If you add a third or fourth criteria, it's one in 10,000.

768
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,040
Right. So it's it's constantly 10 to the power of. Right.

769
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,600
Now, if if you take anything that you want, I'm I'm looking for someone,

770
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,600
for example, supportive of my mission and free to travel.

771
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:08,080
Whatever that is, if if that person is, you know, is described by six criteria,

772
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,560
you're now talking about one in 100,000.

773
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,760
Do they exist? Absolutely.

774
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,920
Absolutely. 100 percent.

775
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,680
Do I have the time to spend looking for one in 100,000?

776
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,040
I don't. I do.

777
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,720
But it's not my priority.

778
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,000
Do you understand? And we do that with everything in life.

779
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,640
You you invest in your six pack.

780
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,120
I invest in my little belly, right?

781
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,160
Why? Because for you, the ability to prioritize the six pack at your age

782
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,960
with your current, you know, lifestyle and so on is actually

783
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,640
taking a certain amount of investment from you that's justifiable by the ROI.

784
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,360
OK. For me, if I wanted to achieve your six pack,

785
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,360
I'd probably take double the time, maybe double the effort, right?

786
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,880
And at the same time, I would require a lifetime that has a lifestyle

787
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,360
that has a consistency in it, that I may not be able to to achieve now.

788
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,400
And you look at it and you go like, damn you, Steve, I want a six pack.

789
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,520
But then at the same time, I tell myself, but damn, you know,

790
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,640
you're traveling everywhere and you're really, really, really being true to yourself.

791
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,160
That's fine. It's a reasonable compromise.

792
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,160
So the question just to be very specific, everything exists.

793
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,600
But the probabilities of them happening, if I'm the luckiest

794
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,560
person on earth, OK, I would walk out of here and she's the first person I meet,

795
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,040
right? But if you count that and say, no, reasonable probability,

796
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,160
you will say you'd have to encounter 50,000 encounters for that person to show up.

797
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,600
If you're unlucky, not unlucky and not lucky, right?

798
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,840
Suddenly, it starts to become interesting.

799
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,240
You tell yourself, and I know this sounds really weird for the romantics.

800
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,600
By the way, I am completely a love, you know, junkie.

801
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,840
But but there is a reality to life that sometimes gets you to prioritize things

802
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,680
differently. It's really interesting, because I've never had anybody describe it

803
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,160
in like a mathematical way before.

804
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,600
Yeah, so there is mathematics underlying everything.

805
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,600
I mean, think about that idea of one in a hundred thousand, right?

806
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,000
The mathematics of that, it's true.

807
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,440
When you see the mathematics, it doesn't mean that you have to act in a way

808
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,280
that's not human, but it just allows you to understand how the system is working

809
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,360
so that you can fit in.

810
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,080
So the example I gave is if you're into Shelby Cobra's, right?

811
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,080
If you want to sell that one car among a million other cars on a site,

812
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,480
that million other that car will have very little chance of being found on a

813
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,040
general site. But for the fans of a Shelby Cobra, if you go to a show

814
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,600
of Shelby Cobra's, everyone there, 100 percent of the people there are interested

815
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,640
in it. OK, so the interesting bit is that you can actually increase your

816
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,280
probability of being found quite a lot if you're true to yourself.

817
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,560
If you start to advertise yourself exactly who you as who you are and mix

818
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,600
with the people that you believe are the people that you want to be with, right?

819
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,880
That's the changes the probability drastically.

820
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,600
That's so very, very true.

821
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,800
That's very, very true.

822
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,680
Kind of goes back to what I was saying when I did your podcast about my hairdresser,

823
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,600
who was dripping head to toe in material possessions, jewelry.

824
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,720
He's advertising himself to a certain audience that he doesn't actually want

825
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,320
to attract. And if he is successful in that advertisement,

826
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,480
he'd attract something that makes him unhappy and gives him shitty relationships.

827
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,040
So you get exactly what you advertise.

828
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,200
And that's the interesting thing.

829
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,520
You know, if a young lady wants to to find a committed partner,

830
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,080
but goes to the pub every Friday evening or the or the club every Friday evening

831
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,800
to find that partner, you know, dressed in a certain way, acting in a certain way,

832
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,920
she's going to get the person because people are, you know,

833
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,240
we don't see beyond what you're advertising.

834
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,040
So if that's what you're advertising, the person who's interested in this will show up, right?

835
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,960
If you're into tango dancing and you show and you go to a tango class,

836
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,240
the people there will be interested in tango.

837
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,960
And those people will be the ones that you want to create that relationship with.

838
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,680
And yeah, of course, there are not a million people in the city that are interested in tango,

839
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,240
but a hundred percent of the people that are in that class are.

840
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,280
So I guess you get what your advertisement attracts to be careful, what you advertise.

841
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,640
Absolutely. And to advertise correctly,

842
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,080
the one thing you need most is to know actually who you are.

843
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,520
What are you as a product?

844
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,840
Right. Most people don't know that.

845
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,400
Absolutely. They don't know who they are.

846
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,760
Absolutely. You don't you don't know what who you are.

847
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,040
It's multiple rates, multiple, multiple layers of confusion.

848
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,240
You don't know who you are.

849
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,440
You don't love who you are.

850
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,680
You know or love who you are, but you're advertising differently

851
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,840
because you think others are more interesting, OK?

852
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,040
Or by the way, you don't know what you want.

853
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,200
So one of the most eyeopening, one of the chapters.

854
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,240
So I'm writing all of this in a book called Finding Love.

855
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,160
One of the most interesting chapters is all the models of love, OK?

856
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,520
And it's so eyeopening today.

857
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,640
Someone in my generation only believed that the only way to be with someone

858
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,600
is to have a traditional relationship.

859
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,200
Look at all of the models that are available in today's world, you know,

860
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,960
all the way from hookups to a lifetime commitment.

861
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,280
Everything's available, you know.

862
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,000
And and and when you when you when you don't know what you're looking for,

863
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,520
then you're advertising wrong.

864
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,440
How do you find out what you're looking for, though?

865
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,600
Again, it's the triangle.

866
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,240
What is what am I thinking?

867
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,600
What am I feeling?

868
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
And what am I doing? OK?

869
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,840
So openly, some of us will say, especially if you say, say, for example,

870
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,200
you're a woman in her thirties, OK?

871
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,880
And you want a child, you want a child, you feel it in you.

872
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,920
But you're so, you know, so when you look at the triangle,

873
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,240
what you feel is I want a child.

874
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,280
But your actions are you're dating people without talking about the topic.

875
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,360
OK. And then what you're thinking is maybe

876
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,400
if I if I tell them I want a child, they will not want to be with me,

877
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,280
which is quite interesting because, yes, if they don't want to be with you

878
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,840
when you don't want a child, you don't want to be with them either.

879
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,280
Right. And and and accordingly, there is a contradiction.

880
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,360
If you want a child, you want to advertise to the world openly to say

881
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,200
when you meet someone before you get too involved,

882
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,360
you say, what's your position on the topic?

883
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,080
Isn't it so funny that our strategy tends to be the total opposite?

884
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,520
It's false advertising till we get them

885
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,120
because the false advertisement is going to get more people.

886
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,680
And then once we've got them, switch up gradually.

887
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,720
Well, I don't even know if it's a conscious decision to switch up gradually,

888
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,680
but it's an inevitable inevitability.

889
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
You can't act for years.

890
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,360
So eventually, once we've got them on the false advertisement

891
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,600
of who we think they wanted us to be, then we'll change.

892
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,080
And that's when all the conflict and relationships happen is when

893
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,640
absolutely you realize this is not what you wanted at all.

894
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,120
Yeah. And you've attracted your.

895
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,160
You attracted the wrong person and you're stuck by acting.

896
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,560
Yeah. But the more the more interesting part of this is

897
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,360
we were prioritizing for the wrong target.

898
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,720
So remember, if you really sit with yourself and you say,

899
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,680
what do I want from a relationship?

900
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,280
I want a committed partner that wants to have a family with me.

901
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,000
If you if you come to that choice,

902
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,840
you would behave very differently, but interestingly,

903
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,680
you have this other conflicting thing of I want reassurance that I'm

904
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,560
interested, interesting and people are still, you know, men are still attracted to me.

905
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,800
So I'm going to go out dating others who are not just to make sure that when I

906
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,880
find this guy, I'll be, I'll be, you know, still, still ready to grab.

907
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,800
Right. That doesn't make any sense at all, because by the way,

908
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,520
the ones that you're attracting are not a resembling

909
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
sample to what you're actually looking for.

910
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,560
And I know it sounds really weird when you talk about those things in mathematics

911
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,720
and probabilities and sets and subsets and so on.

912
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,600
But believe it or not, it's entirely.

913
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,480
And I know people will hate me when I say this.

914
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,480
Dating is an entirely an economics problem.

915
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,040
It is economics, economics, meaning

916
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,080
that in my days when I met Nibel, she was one of 14

917
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,520
friends I knew, OK, economics were very straightforward.

918
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,520
Of the 14, Nibel was the one that matched my soul.

919
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,800
Most she was the most beautiful woman on the planet for those 14 and everyone else.

920
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,560
And so I said, I'm after this one, right?

921
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,200
Today, from a supply and demand point of view, you're talking about 14 million

922
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,640
people at any point in time that are in a market that is so complex,

923
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,800
it's like the Nasdaq market, OK?

924
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,680
Literally, products are on the market instantly all the time.

925
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,600
And the game is a game of economics.

926
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,720
Sadly, the more supply there is, the less the value of a product.

927
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,920
Right? So if you simply said to yourself, you know,

928
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,720
this camera is now going to be we're going to make 14 million copies

929
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,120
of it because it's easier for the factory to make 14 million copies than to make

930
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,000
4,000, every one of those copies to manage to sell 14 has to go down in price.

931
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,760
OK, because otherwise people only people who can afford the 4,000 would buy

932
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,880
and then you'll be left with the other 10.

933
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,000
And that's what's happening in the dating and romance market is that there is so

934
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,960
much supply out there that nobody values that relationship anymore.

935
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,320
Everyone is like, OK, I'll try anyway.

936
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,640
You know, it's going to what is it going to take a couple of dates?

937
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,160
But then that's not what happened.

938
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,280
You go on a couple of dates and then it's a nice case and then you stay a little

939
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,520
longer and then you're right.

940
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,600
And all of that basically you realize that you've spent seven months of your

941
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,760
life to figure out that this person is not interested in children.

942
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,440
For example, if we take that example.

943
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,240
So what does that mean in real terms for say that I was single and I was looking,

944
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,640
right? I'm someone, you know what I'm like.

945
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,520
I'm someone that's deeply interested in ideas and thoughts and, you know,

946
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,320
self-development and all of these things.

947
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,240
You know what I'm interested in.

948
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,960
We've talked long enough for you to have at least a gauge of that.

949
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,160
Where would I go?

950
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,160
Is it a place?

951
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,000
And where would I not go?

952
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,520
It could be. I mean, if you want to find love, do what you love.

953
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,160
Yeah, very straightforward.

954
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,600
If you're into reflection and personal development,

955
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,840
go to personal development conferences, sit with personal development.

956
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,000
People like me, I'll buy you coffee anytime, you know.

957
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,280
And or, or, or, you know, go to a retreat, for example,

958
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,040
the people that will go to the retreat will be the type of person that you're

959
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,920
looking for. I gave that advice to one of my dear friends and colleagues.

960
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,640
When I worked at Google, she was part of Google in Poland.

961
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,240
And I told her that I said, if you want to find love, do what you love.

962
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,760
So she went and asked herself, what do I love?

963
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,120
I love tango went and started that, you know, attended the tango class,

964
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,560
ended up marrying the the the instructor, right?

965
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,600
It's simply you want someone that matches you.

966
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,440
Go to the places where those things happen.

967
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Those places could be physical places.

968
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,200
They could be online. OK, they could be serendipitous

969
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,760
because you're searching for those things.

970
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,320
But just know what you stand for.

971
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,080
I'm, you know, not a party animal.

972
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,520
I'm never going to find my match in a party.

973
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,600
So so do I go to parties? No, I don't really.

974
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,560
I mean, I go sometimes when there is a reason to go.

975
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,920
But otherwise, no, that's not how I spend my time.

976
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,920
Quick one, we bring in eight people a month to watch these conversations live

977
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,280
here in the studio when we're here in the UK and when we're in LA.

978
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,680
If you want to be one of those people, all you've got to do is hit subscribe.

979
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,920
You asked me a question about money, and then you said, you know,

980
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,080
what does money mean to me?

981
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,360
And then when I asked you, you said you think you've come to learn

982
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,400
that you think money is one of your illusions.

983
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
What did you mean by that?

984
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,240
Money is an illusion at every, every level.

985
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,520
Money doesn't exist.

986
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,000
You and I know that anyone who understands fractional reserve

987
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,080
and how money is printed and generated money does not even exist.

988
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,040
You walk into a bank and you ask for a 50,000 pounds loan for a car.

989
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,640
And they literally write the numbers five, zero, zero, zero, zero in a spreadsheet

990
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,760
and money comes out of nowhere that money never existed before you borrowed it.

991
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,760
OK, and will only exist when you work your backside off to pay it back.

992
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,600
Right. And interestingly, that in that illusion was created to make our

993
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,040
lives easier, and then it ended up making our life a lot more difficult.

994
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Now, why?

995
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,200
Because most of us are so chasing the revenue side of money without

996
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,320
a full understanding of the cost side of money.

997
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:11,400
Let me try to explain for you to get a job in London that pays

998
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,800
you 100,000 pounds just for simplification of the mathematics.

999
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,640
You have to live in London, which costs you 70,000 pounds.

1000
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,680
For example, I don't know London very well, but let's say these are the numbers.

1001
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,600
But on top of the 70,000 pounds, it also causes costs you stress, your stress.

1002
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,000
It also costs you being far away from your mom if your mom lives elsewhere.

1003
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,240
It costs you, you know, your time, which is your most valuable resource.

1004
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,240
The only thing you really have in your life is your time, and it costs you

1005
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,960
so many other things, right?

1006
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:53,000
And so most people don't understand the cost benefit relationship to start.

1007
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Now, you take that and then you add a Louis Vuitton bag or a fancy car.

1008
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,160
And suddenly your money is not even going as far as it could, because you

1009
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,680
could get yourself a bag that is beautiful and everything for 100 pounds.

1010
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,880
But then you choose to buy one for several thousand pounds, and then you

1011
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,280
have to work harder, which makes you may pay more costs and that and the cycle

1012
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,160
becomes even more vicious, right?

1013
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,360
You continue further than that.

1014
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,920
And you start to say, so I save some of that, some of my money in the future,

1015
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,880
but your savings are suffering inflation.

1016
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,720
So you save a thousand pounds, they become 900, they become 800.

1017
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,480
When in reality, by the way, you've saved the thousand pounds, when you could

1018
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,360
have borrowed them by entering some numbers in a spreadsheet.

1019
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,960
The entire recipe around that story is wrong.

1020
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,760
Everything around money is not what we believe it is, which basically makes

1021
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,680
it an illusion.

1022
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,240
Now, the biggest part of that illusion, believe it or not, is, and I know you

1023
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,880
have money in the bank, is that you have nothing.

1024
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,640
I don't know if you realize that.

1025
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,600
Most people don't understand that if I have 100 pounds in the bank, I literally

1026
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,440
have nothing.

1027
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,360
I have nothing.

1028
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,960
The bank has my 100 pounds and the bank can decide whatever they want to do if

1029
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,640
they wanted to take it away from me.

1030
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,240
Okay.

1031
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,640
And it is only my money when I choose to buy an iPhone or something with it.

1032
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,480
For that one instant, that money is mine.

1033
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,360
And then once I get the iPhone, it's not mine anymore.

1034
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,880
I now have the iPhone, right?

1035
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,520
You basically assign that money that is never yours.

1036
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,920
It's the banks until the minute you spend it to spending it on things that most

1037
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,600
of us don't ever, ever interact with.

1038
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,840
I mean, look at your own home, anyone listening to us and how many things you

1039
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,880
have in that home that you've not ever used ever.

1040
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,880
You know, you, you saw that pair of shoes in the window and you were like, oh,

1041
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,160
my God, I have to have them spent several hundred pounds on them or several

1042
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,440
tens of pounds on them and then ended up taking them home, never, ever putting

1043
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,680
them on, right?

1044
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,840
Now, all of that waste along the way, the cost of earning the money, the things

1045
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,720
that you spend it on, the actual value of the thing, the things that you spend

1046
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:12,280
it on, basically tells you that there is one truth to money, which is I have

1047
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,840
basic needs, I have basic needs and my basic needs are to be reasonably

1048
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,800
covered, reasonably fed, reasonably safe and so on and so forth.

1049
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,200
And in, in, in, in the Islamic culture, we call this risk, which is different

1050
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:27,800
than income.

1051
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Risk is not what, how much money you earn.

1052
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,000
It's the good that that money brings you.

1053
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,920
It's, did you eat a meal today?

1054
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,400
That is actually what you're looking for in life.

1055
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,080
It's not the money that gets you the meal.

1056
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:41,920
Okay.

1057
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,200
What you're looking for is the meal.

1058
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,080
Could you actually buy something for your daughter today?

1059
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,840
The thing is what you're looking for.

1060
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,960
It's not, it's not the money that got the thing.

1061
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,480
And if you start to chase that, something very different happens, right?

1062
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:04,000
Some, suddenly you start to ask yourself, hmm, is buying that thing worth the 17

1063
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,560
hours of work I'm going to put in them, right?

1064
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,400
Is it, which of those, which would I prefer if I gave you the two choices and

1065
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,560
said, buy this bag or spend 17 hours with your friends.

1066
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,760
If you see it that way, you may make very different decisions.

1067
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,560
It leaves us with the very big other illusion, which is, but money is safety.

1068
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,320
Moe, you know, it's not like I want money because I want more fancy things.

1069
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,240
I just want to feel safe because the world is unpredictable.

1070
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,360
Sadly, when the world is unpredictable, money's not going to save you.

1071
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,040
Okay.

1072
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,200
And I think my story's been very, very, very big.

1073
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,160
I open, I had enough money.

1074
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,080
I, you know, I had enough connections and enough influence.

1075
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,600
And I, you know, failed to protect my child's life when it was time for him to go.

1076
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,240
Right.

1077
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,440
I, you know, I think we know many stories of someone that maybe falls and

1078
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,640
breaks your back.

1079
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,080
What will your money do for you?

1080
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,360
Safety is a much bigger thing than just a little bit of money in the bank.

1081
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,640
And by the way, safety is an attitude, is an idea to tell yourself, when I need it,

1082
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,400
I will make it.

1083
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,320
When I need it, I will have it.

1084
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,160
Perhaps the answer is I don't need so much of it anyway.

1085
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:20,280
And I think, you know, again, like everything in life, you, you want to, to have

1086
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,720
the skill of making money.

1087
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,760
Money is, is power, you know, again, when you were speaking on slow mo, you basically

1088
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:33,080
said, I love the idea of being able to build this setup for the podcast of spending on

1089
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,200
my show and so on.

1090
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,000
That's wonderful.

1091
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:35,560
Okay.

1092
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:41,680
Money is power, but it's power as long as you own it and it doesn't own you.

1093
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,160
The minute money owns you and lack of it starts to distract you and looking at how

1094
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,280
much your, your other friend has and he has a little more than you, you know, hurts your

1095
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:52,760
ego.

1096
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,720
Once it gets into that realm, then money works against you.

1097
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,440
It doesn't work for you.

1098
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,480
Do you think it's a noble cause that when I answered that question and I said, for me,

1099
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,040
money is basically the fuel of my mission.

1100
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,960
It enables me to, I said, I put on my, my Diary of a Sea Alive tour, it cost me about

1101
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,360
600,000 pounds to book these 10 venues, to book the London Playdian for three nights,

1102
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,280
to book this massive choir of, you know, 40 people, to book this big musical.

1103
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,720
There was about a hundred of us, a hundred people I had to book and pay for to put on

1104
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,200
that show.

1105
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:28,200
At the end of the show, I break even, but without the, that tour, you know, reaches almost

1106
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:34,280
20,000 people, it's the most thrilling, fulfilling, biggest honor that I've ever had to be able

1107
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,040
to do that in front of all of those people and to share that message, which is very much

1108
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,000
in line with my mission.

1109
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,480
And I look at money and say, if I, if I didn't have the money, it would have been much,

1110
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,720
much harder, not impossible, but much, much, much harder to do that.

1111
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:48,840
Absolutely.

1112
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,400
So do you feel like that is a noble relationship with money?

1113
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:01,240
Look, we agree on this. Nothing is good or bad, nothing is right or wrong.

1114
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,400
Everything is both right and wrong and everything is, can be both good and bad.

1115
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,560
It depends on what you want to do with it.

1116
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,280
And one of the messages I constantly tell everyone in the world is absolutely become

1117
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:18,200
successful, become powerful, become rich, because the biggest problem with our world

1118
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,440
is that the most successful, most powerful and the richest are the worst of us.

1119
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,200
Okay. And I don't generalize and say that's the truth, but it's actually easier to make

1120
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,880
money if you break some rules than if it, then it is, if you're ethical.

1121
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:38,920
And so as a result of that, a good chunk of the big money in the world is not super ethical.

1122
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,280
Right. And if, if I have more money, I can fuel my one billion happy mission.

1123
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,960
And that's a good thing for the world.

1124
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,640
That's by the way, owning money, not letting it own you. Right.

1125
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:54,680
So if I, if I can get to the point where I make it and actually give it to one billion happy,

1126
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,040
then that's amazing. If I get to the point where I make it and then suddenly go like,

1127
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:02,920
oh, let's wait a little bit, grow it a tiny bit and then give it to one billion happy,

1128
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:07,080
then I'm not doing the right thing. Having said that, you know, of course,

1129
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:15,800
you know how I admire you and respect you. This is your zoom lens of the world. Okay.

1130
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:22,600
For someone else, four pounds, some sticky paper and a couple of scissors and spending an hour

1131
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:29,080
with her daughter doing something beautiful. Okay. Is as impactful, maybe even more impactful than

1132
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:35,080
the entire show, because that one daughter with the sticky paper and scissors might end up becoming

1133
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:41,640
one of the most pronounced artists in the world, prominent enough to change the world with four,

1134
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:48,440
four pounds, scissors and a piece of paper. Right. Now we, we somehow, especially those of us like

1135
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:55,480
you and I, who, who had experiences in life where they put effort and the effort rewarded them. Okay.

1136
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:02,360
We think that we are the ones that are changing the world or making a difference or no, we're not.

1137
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:09,080
Okay. The reality is we need, we need to understand that again, I, you know, I admire you and I know

1138
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,280
you'll, you'll not feel upset, but half of what you know is wrong. Half of what I know is wrong.

1139
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,480
Absolutely. Right. And it's, it's just an attempt. It's just an attempt with, you know,

1140
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:27,640
whether that attempt, Steve is, is, is an attempt because of money or is it, it's an attempt

1141
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:34,760
because you just spend time with your driver talking about something or, you know, you were

1142
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:42,760
telling the story, all of those things. I think the game is I'm going to do the best that I can

1143
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:52,120
to acquire the resources that I'm good at acquiring to direct them in the investments that I have

1144
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:59,960
accessible to me. Okay. If, if you are a cashier, you know, at a supermarket and you're making enough

1145
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:07,080
money to spend wonderful time with your daughter to, you know, to, to do a bit of art, then that in

1146
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:13,480
itself is a form of contribution that changes the world. And you'll never know that one daughter

1147
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:21,000
might cure cancer. It's interesting. I was, I was bouncing around in my head back and forward

1148
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,360
about like, about the role that a lot of my, I don't know, maybe my traumas and securities are

1149
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,440
playing in driving my decision making around these things. Obviously, putting on a big show,

1150
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,680
you have lots of people there that are clapping for you. There's lots of admiration. It's very like,

1151
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,320
it's very massaging of the ego. So one might say to themselves, well, I'm serving the world when,

1152
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,400
in fact, it's more of a selfish thing. And you're like, you know what I mean? It's that, that constant

1153
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:50,360
battle I find in my life where the greatest service that I do to others is also woven in there with

1154
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,080
loads of like, absolutely insecurities. So even this podcast, like, I'm sure the people listening,

1155
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,840
enjoy listening, I'm sure they get a tremendous amount of value from it. But there is still

1156
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:05,160
this guy in me that is so desperate to be number one and to win, right? And it's almost, I'm almost

1157
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:11,800
at peace with the conflicting forces because I know, I think as we sit here, the podcast is

1158
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,360
number one in the Apple store, pretty sure of that. And I know it wouldn't have been and it

1159
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:21,320
wouldn't have reached as many people if I wasn't someone who was desperate to be the best.

1160
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,360
But I also know that this is, that pursuit of being the best is also quite an ugly one,

1161
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,440
because it comes, means you end up sacrificing a bunch of things in the pursuit of being the best

1162
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:35,560
that might make you more fulfilled. So it's this weird, it's this weird balancing act of

1163
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,520
contradiction and confusion and not really knowing why, why I'm doing what I'm doing at like the

1164
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,400
real fundamental level. You can broadcast what people want you to hear. Oh, I'm doing it because

1165
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,320
I want to help others. But I actually know that there's, it's a recipe, a concoction of many

1166
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:57,320
conflicting forces and pretty much all my success has been this sort of recipe of conflicting forces.

1167
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:06,200
Well, I mean, what I admire most about you is you're able to see and say this, okay? If you're,

1168
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:12,680
you know, if you've achieved total enlightenment, you'll be gone, okay? None of us is ever there.

1169
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:18,600
The challenge is this. Some people are completely egocentric and not even aware.

1170
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:28,760
Yeah. Okay. Some people are struggling, okay? And some people are, you know, doing the best they

1171
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,960
can, understanding, as I say, that in compartment two, there is something and they're okay with it,

1172
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:41,000
okay? And the trick is you're always trying to move a little bit higher. And that higher,

1173
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,640
you know, and that little voice in your head, I follow that model. And it sounds simple,

1174
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:50,680
but it's actually quite interesting. I call it be learned do, right? Be learned do is

1175
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:56,840
most of us in our life, we look at problems and we say, here's the solution, right? That's,

1176
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:03,640
we're mostly almost anchored in doing. Doing again is a very masculine trait, okay?

1177
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:10,600
Interestingly, a lot of doing is as harmful as it is, as it is beneficial.

1178
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:18,280
You know, the good doing is a doing that is informed by a form of being and by a certain

1179
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,200
level of skill that comes from learning. Okay? So when I, what I normally try to follow in the

1180
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,640
entire manual to your brain is to say, okay, for everything that we will find, we will have to be,

1181
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:36,840
then learned and do, okay? So you're very good. One of the people I respect most about that idea

1182
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,120
of being, you look at yourself and you say, oh, I am doing that because of that insecurity that

1183
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,520
happened when I was this. That's an amazing achievement in itself. That's a third of the way,

1184
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,640
right? I know what's what I need to work on. And I think it's the challenging third of the way,

1185
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:56,920
believe it or not, because we humans are very good at solving the problems when they're defined.

1186
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,680
If you make it your priority, you're going to learn the skill. Everyone is capable of doing

1187
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:06,840
that. Again, I speak a lot about neuroplasticity and how learning works. But once you've learned,

1188
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,960
once you've realized what it is, is that you need to work on, you're going to learn the skill and

1189
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,800
then you're going to start practicing and doing it the right way. The challenge is when you don't

1190
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,800
know what you're working on. Now I'll say this openly. What you're doing to the world with your

1191
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:26,440
awareness that part of it is ego driven, of course, part of what I do is ego driven. I tell the whole

1192
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:32,520
world that I'm an engineer. Being an engineer is an ego. Why do I tell the whole world that there

1193
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,480
is a utility to that ego? The utility is, by the way, guys, if you want to read my work or listen

1194
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:42,200
to my analysis, it's going to appear a little over engineered, even when I talk about something as

1195
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:48,280
beautiful as love and relationships. It will have that engineering element to it, which is not entirely

1196
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,200
myself, by the way. It's just the way I present myself to the world, because others don't present

1197
01:14:54,280 --> 01:15:00,440
themselves that way. So I'm differentiating. Yeah, I wish I didn't have to use that ego.

1198
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,960
You may wish that you stood on stage and didn't feel the rush of people clapping and saying,

1199
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:12,280
well done, you're amazing. But by the way, if you're delivering to thousands and hundreds of

1200
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,080
thousands of people on your podcast, great, you're so much better than those who are not.

1201
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,200
And now the fact that you have your awareness makes you even better than those who are,

1202
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,960
but are not aware of their parts that they need to work on.

1203
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,400
Yeah, it's challenging. I was bouncing around in my head on that, because if I cared a ton about

1204
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:41,080
the clapping part, I probably would be trying to convince everybody that I'm perfect a bit more

1205
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:46,200
than I do. It's just an interesting battle of ego. But I also think that, I think I said this

1206
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:52,040
on your podcast, is it's okay to be a contradiction. And I think in all facets of my life, when I look

1207
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:57,240
at my decisions, what I want, what I say, what I do, and there's so many interwoven contradictions,

1208
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:03,480
and it's so remarkable that the contradictions often lead me to success in the things that

1209
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,600
I'm aiming for. It's not making sense. I think the whole idea is that we're all contradictions.

1210
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,960
The only difference is you're aware. Yeah. Do you realize that? So the thing, I think you

1211
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:20,200
should be the example for everyone to recognize that we're all contradictions. It's everyone,

1212
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:25,560
every single one listening to us. Life is a contradiction. This is why one of my favorite

1213
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:31,960
feminine qualities is the ability to embrace paradoxes. And the reality is, the only way you

1214
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:38,120
can almost like at a quantum level, solve life better, is if you're able to embrace two extremes

1215
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:42,360
and say, both are true, and I'm going to include both of them in my lifestyle, both of them in my

1216
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:47,480
decision making, because both of them are me. It goes back to your point about the equilibrium

1217
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:52,440
as well, that the reason why the pendulum sits in the middle is because it's at balance with

1218
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,440
two opposing forces. Gravity has balanced it on that particular point, but when you apply one

1219
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,200
force to either side, it will swing into a direction. Maybe balance is being a perfect

1220
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:08,120
contradiction. Absolutely. Balance is always a contradiction. Balance is that ability to take

1221
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:13,640
all of those forces. Now, you have to imagine, I separated them into six forces and said your

1222
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,360
health, six pendulums, that your health is one and your love is one and this is one,

1223
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:24,200
but the reality is you're one pendulum. So many forces are applying from so many directions.

1224
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,920
And the contradiction is not just, if I work harder, I'll make more money or less money.

1225
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,160
If I work harder, I will also be a little more stressed. If I work harder, my relationships

1226
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:38,280
will be affected. And each of those, eventually you're ending up in one place that is very,

1227
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:46,120
very complex. We're a very complex being as a human and we're dealing with an even more complex

1228
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:52,760
life. And the thing is we need to take it easy on ourselves and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure

1229
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:58,600
out my relationship bit in a while. I now need to figure out my one billion mission and a little

1230
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,240
more or I need to figure out this more or I need to do that more. And it's okay to say it's never

1231
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:09,880
perfect. It's absolutely never perfect. The game is if I told myself, no, no, hold on. I've done the

1232
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:16,440
thinking and this situation is my perfect situation. I'm doomed because I'm basically telling myself,

1233
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,880
keep that pendulum in this place and defend it with your life. Okay. Put all of the effort in the

1234
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,440
world when that pendulum is in the wrong place. It's not in balance. In your book as well,

1235
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,960
that little voice in your head, you describe how like all thoughts aren't really made equally and

1236
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,760
that there's different sort of categories of thoughts and some of them like observation are

1237
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,200
closer to the truth than others. What are the different categories of thoughts that we have in

1238
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:49,960
our head? The first challenge with thought is that we create our thoughts from the wrong ingredients.

1239
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:57,720
So if I gave you bad vegetables and told you to make the best salad recipe on the planet,

1240
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:06,440
it's still going to taste bad. And the reality is we have only one proper ingredient

1241
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,840
that we should allow into our brain so that we create proper accurate thoughts. And that

1242
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:20,840
that one ingredient is actual observation. Okay. Observation is I look at this glass and I say

1243
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:29,720
this glass is 37% full. Okay. That is an observation. Yeah, you can, we can debate in physics if it is

1244
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:36,760
or if it isn't and so on. But in, you know, the typical way we look at life, this is 37% full.

1245
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:45,000
Right. My brain would then tell me, if I used that information, I may ask someone in the team

1246
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,880
and say, guys, can I please another have another a little bit more water? My brain would then tell

1247
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:56,360
me, no, no, hold on, it's tapered. Okay. It is not, you know, the same from the top as it is

1248
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,160
in the from the bottom. No, you've calculated wrong. No, you're getting old and your mathematics

1249
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:08,200
are not accurate anymore. You're, you know, you can go into so many different inputs into your

1250
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:15,880
thoughts that would debate that fact that it is more empty than it is full. Okay. You take that

1251
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,840
and you find you can find them in categories. One of them is conditioning. Believe it or not,

1252
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:27,960
one of the most frequently used sources for creating your thoughts is not what's happening

1253
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:34,040
in the world at all. It's your conditioning and your conditioning creates thoughts within you

1254
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:40,120
that are not, not at all a reality. I speak about any experience where I was dating a

1255
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:45,560
Buddhist girl who was very calm and wonderful in every possible way. And, you know, two of our

1256
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:52,360
best friends were a couple and they had a big fight before coming to our place. And so anyway,

1257
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:57,000
the, the girl basically said, no, I need to talk to you about something and, you know,

1258
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,560
want to ask your view. And she sat next to me, very, very, very good friends, all the four of

1259
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,280
us for a very long time. And so she hugged me. She sat on, you know, put her head on my shoulder

1260
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:13,320
and cried. Okay. My girlfriend came in and said, excuse my English. She said, take your hands off

1261
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:22,360
my man, you be. Okay. And, you know, I was like, whoa, she's one of the calmest people I know.

1262
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:29,480
What happened here? And what happened was she had been cheated on before. Right. By the best,

1263
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:35,960
by her best girlfriend and, you know, a friend of the person she was dating at the time.

1264
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:42,200
And the input into her head that said, this girl was sort of doing something inappropriate with

1265
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,720
me was coming from the fact that she had that conditioning in her. It wasn't the event itself,

1266
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:55,000
the event was highly exaggerated by the conditioning. So we're unable to find that when we, when we

1267
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,400
look at our, at the makeup of our thoughts. The second, I, and the third are recycled emotions

1268
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:07,800
and recycled thoughts. Okay. So we recycle so much of what our parents told us. Recycling

1269
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,680
of a memory or the recycling of a thought, you know, your, your friend tells you, Hey,

1270
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:17,560
by the way, all men are cheats. And you recycle that thought. Okay. All men are cheats. All men

1271
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:24,120
are cheats. And then, you know, you end up making decisions based on that. The fourth, and I think

1272
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:30,520
the most, the biggest challenge we have in the modern world is the mainstream media, basically,

1273
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:37,640
the, the, the, the large advertising media story that we're told that is a ton of input,

1274
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:43,240
whether it's movies, it's social media, it's, you know, tweets or, or reels or, or, or if,

1275
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:49,880
or if it's the BBC or channel for playing the news. And the, the, the reality of what we're

1276
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:57,880
getting is we're getting a highly biased section of life. Why? Because of the human

1277
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:03,400
nature, which is around negativity bias, humans are only paying attention most of the time to

1278
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:09,320
the negative side of life. Those all, all of those outlets are constantly using that negativity

1279
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,960
bias to broadcast to you. Well, it's actually not the full truth, but the negative side of the truth.

1280
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:20,760
So, you know, the, the channel will not talk about a child that went out with his mother and

1281
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,280
played on the swings. They'll talk about a child that fell in a well and we have that disaster.

1282
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:31,640
And, and, you know, a social media person, I always say, you're a balanced one, but a social

1283
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,160
media influencer will always show this, the pictures that appear to be more than what they're

1284
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,880
living and there will be filters and so on. And that negativity that you feel as a result

1285
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:48,120
is not a reflection of the actual truth of life. It's a reflection of the subset of knowledge that

1286
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:54,120
you get from life. Now, what does that mean? I mean, I'm trying to say, if I give you your phone

1287
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:00,920
and your phone has a perfect phone app on it, if you type the wrong number, you're going to call

1288
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:06,280
the wrong person. Nothing wrong with the phone, nothing wrong with the app. Okay. In your brain,

1289
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:11,000
if you put in the wrong data all the time, if you allow all of that negativity coming from the media

1290
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,960
and the news, if you allow the conditioning to be part of your, of your decision making criteria,

1291
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:20,680
the recycled thoughts and emotions, then you're eventually going to end up calling the wrong

1292
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:27,240
action. Okay. And I think the reality is that at that very fundamental level, unless you start to

1293
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:34,440
really iron out all of the wrong inputs, there is very little possibility that you're actually

1294
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,920
going to get to the accurate output. You were talking about all these types and categories

1295
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,000
of thoughts and all of these inputs. One of the inputs is the mainstream media. Some of the

1296
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,040
inputs come from, I guess, our conditioning and experiences. And when you talked about the glass

1297
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:54,440
and your observation that the glass is 37% full, how do you know that that's not your conditioning

1298
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,880
speaking? How do you know that that's not the influence of the mainstream media? How do you

1299
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,880
know that there's not a second layer that's running over your, what you're seeing called your

1300
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:06,920
perception that is influencing that. I'm trying to figure out for people listening how they can

1301
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:12,760
distinguish between a thought that is truth and observation and worth pursuing and incredible

1302
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:22,120
and one that is conditioned or your spot on. Okay. This is 37% full is my brain's calculation.

1303
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:27,880
Let's use a simpler example. You have an argument with your partner. The next morning you wake up

1304
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:33,400
and say, doesn't love me or she doesn't love me anymore. Right. The argument is what you observed

1305
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:39,000
that there was a bit of attention that those specific words were said. That's observation.

1306
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,480
Right. Observation is literally like narration of the situation. That's it. And if you can stick

1307
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:51,640
down, you can take yourself all the way down to narration, you're done. Okay. I observe that you're

1308
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:58,200
sitting cross hand, you know, crossing your arms. That's an observation. My brain could take that

1309
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:05,560
observation and say he's bored. He's protective. He is angry with me. We've been talking too much,

1310
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,640
whatever. Okay. I can translate it into a million things in my head. None of them is true.

1311
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,760
The only truth is Steven's sitting in front of me and he's crossing his arms. If I accept

1312
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:24,440
that to be the truth, then my brain suggests those other things. I can then ask and I say,

1313
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:28,360
have we been talking too long, Steve? Do you want, should we take a break? Can we do this?

1314
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:33,560
Can we do that? Right. And then you would say something and that would be my next observation.

1315
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:39,720
I can include that in my analysis as another fact. Okay. Without those facts, sadly, what

1316
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:47,800
happens to us in life is that we're completely absorbed and consumed by stories that we've built.

1317
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,840
The story is this is 37% full. That's a story. Believe it or not, even so though it appears to

1318
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:00,440
be very accurate, it's a story that includes, hey, by the way, Moe, you're good in geography.

1319
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:04,600
You've done your mathematics really well. You've looked at those two. It looks as if you,

1320
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:12,520
and you know, it's a big story. And I would tend to tell myself, hey, it's 37. If I complimented

1321
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,400
this with, you know, I think it's 37. It could be a little more or a little less. That's a much

1322
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:23,400
better observation. Right. If I tell myself the story and believe it and start acting upon it,

1323
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:29,960
then I'm in a very deep trouble because, because basically my input into my brain

1324
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:33,240
is leading me to confusion, certain confusion, because I'm not using the truth.

1325
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,360
It's that kind of like requirement of having like a looseness of our beliefs as well, isn't it?

1326
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:43,400
That just the, that old adage of strong, strong beliefs, but held loosely, whatever it's,

1327
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,680
that phrase is, I think is the most beautiful thing ever. Yeah. Because what are your beliefs?

1328
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:54,360
The beliefs are built within context. Again, I write about this. You know, there was a proverb

1329
01:27:54,360 --> 01:28:03,000
in Egypt that was developed in the times of poverty and famine. People couldn't have enough. And it

1330
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:10,920
was a difficult time. And it basically said, as far as your, extend your legs as far as your

1331
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:18,040
blanket goes. Okay. Interesting. When you know, it's basically within context, it invites people

1332
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,760
to say, Hey, within your, live within your resources, live within your means. It's not an easy time.

1333
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:29,080
You take that and take it out of context. And it's widely, widely used in Egypt.

1334
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,680
You put it out of context and it becomes, you know, a bit of complacence. It's like,

1335
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:40,680
don't try to buy a bigger blanket. Just live within your blanket. Okay. And that's a very,

1336
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:45,480
very, very different view of looking at something that was meant to be correct.

1337
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,480
And if you take, when I talk about conditioning, you have so many of those in you.

1338
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,400
So many, something that your mom said at the point in time, something that your,

1339
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,320
you know, teacher said at the point in time, something that you did and your friends in

1340
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:02,360
school reacted in a way that you didn't want and so on. And all of that is embedded within us.

1341
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,200
How do I get rid of it? Again, it's very simple. It's that contradiction.

1342
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,480
It's a very simple contradiction of something is not in balance. I say that I want a Rolls-Royce,

1343
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:20,920
but I actually go, you know, go to the Rolls-Royce and then feel that maybe people will think this

1344
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:26,840
way about me, maybe, you know, it's going to cost me that much, maybe, right? And, and, and suddenly

1345
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,440
you go like, okay, so I'm not in balance. Because what I think we're talking about here is like

1346
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:35,560
really self-awareness. It's becoming really. But also self-reflection, self-introspection.

1347
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:40,280
And that's, that's what I was going to say is I think for most of my life, because of my conditioning,

1348
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:45,640
I'm essentially this puppet to my conditioning with all these pieces of string hanging off my

1349
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:50,520
limbs. And self-awareness is the process of gradually cutting one of these strings at a time

1350
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,960
and taking back more control of why I'm doing what I do in my behavior. So that like journaling

1351
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:00,920
or producing content, that, that introspection and self-reflection is, has been the cutting of

1352
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,560
these strings one by one, or you could view it as the, like the turning on of lights in a room.

1353
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,800
So you can kind of navigate better the world. But until you do that, the lights really are off.

1354
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:15,720
And I think that's kind of central term to what we were discussing about how to distinguish conditioning,

1355
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:19,960
media influence from truth and your own thoughts.

1356
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:25,480
Quick one, as you might know, Crafted are one of the sponsors of this podcast and Crafted are a

1357
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:30,280
jewelry brand and they make really meaningful pieces of jewelry. The really wonderful thing

1358
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:35,720
about Crafted jewelry is it's super affordable. It looks amazing. The pieces hold tremendous meaning

1359
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:42,200
and they are really well made. I think I've worn this piece for almost a year. It hasn't broken,

1360
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:47,000
hasn't changed color because it's really, really good quality and it costs roughly

1361
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,760
50 quid. People will be surprised when they hear that. They'd probably assume that all of my

1362
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,920
jewelry is like solid gold and costs thousands and thousands of pounds. But what's the point

1363
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,960
when you can achieve the exact same effect from a piece of jewelry that's high quality and costs

1364
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:05,240
50 quid? That's why by Crafted. The other thing that you mentioned in your, in your book, that

1365
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:09,480
little voice in your head is this concept of neuroplasticity. It says it on the back of the

1366
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:16,600
book. It says, retrain your brain for maximum happiness. This concept that we can retrain

1367
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:24,520
our brain physiologically seems like nonsense. I can't change my arm. So when someone, you know,

1368
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:30,360
asserts that you can actually change your brain. You can change your arm. I can change my arm?

1369
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:36,040
Of course. What, tattoo? No, you work out. That's true. When you work out, you're building

1370
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:41,560
muscles in your arms and that same exact process is exactly what happens inside our brains and

1371
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:46,200
it's called neuroplasticity. The only difference is that you don't see it. You don't see it visibly.

1372
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,520
You can see your muscles growing because that's the function that they need, you know, they need

1373
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:56,280
to grow to perform. But in your brain, what actually happens again, like computers, it's almost as if

1374
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:03,800
you loaded a new piece of software, a new piece of operating system on your brain, literally for

1375
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:09,960
every one of us listening, everyone listening to us right now, at the end of this conversation,

1376
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:16,520
their brain will be wired differently than when it started. Every single instance of anything that

1377
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:22,520
you do literally rewires the hardware itself, the neurons that fire together, wire together.

1378
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:30,920
Okay. So imagine the old days of the switchboard. Okay. And, you know, Steve wants to call his mom,

1379
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:37,000
so you, you know, crank your phone and the operator says, you know, hi, how can I help you? And you

1380
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,560
say, can you please connect me to that number? And she would literally take a wire and patch

1381
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:48,440
you and your mom's phones together. Okay. After a while, the operator constantly, every time you

1382
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:52,680
call you want to, you ask for your mom. So the operator goes like, why am I even wasting my time

1383
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,880
on this? Let me just patch that wire to his mom all the time. Okay. So that's exactly what happens

1384
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:03,080
in our brains. If you, if you perform a single, a certain function, your brain starts to build

1385
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:07,640
networks that make that function easier to perform in the future. If you do it one time,

1386
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:12,440
it becomes a little easier. If you do it 20 times, it becomes permanent. Okay. And there are, there

1387
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,800
are tons of studies. If you, if you take a simple task like tapping your finger on the table, okay,

1388
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:24,120
and you're requested to do that, say 20 times every hour, after a few days, you'll find that you're

1389
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,200
so much better at tapping your finger on the table, and you can do it much faster and you can do it

1390
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:33,000
consistently and you can do it in the background. Gamers know that for certain. Okay. The problem

1391
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:40,280
with neuroplasticity is if you tell your brain to wire for tapping your finger, it will. If you

1392
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:45,480
tell it to wire for solving complex mathematical equations, it may take a little longer, but it

1393
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:51,160
will. If you tell it to wire for hating people, it will become very good at hating. If you tell it

1394
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:55,400
to wire for fearing the end of the world because of what the media is telling you, it's going to

1395
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:00,040
become very good at fearing the world. I know some of these people. I know, absolutely. And you

1396
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:05,080
don't want them in your life. The challenge of our modern world is that we think that this brain

1397
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:10,680
is supposed to be there to make us successful. Yeah. Okay. First of all, it's not the primary

1398
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:15,480
function of the brain. The primary function of the brain is to make you safe. Okay. And then

1399
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:21,400
the secondary function that we push human as humans to, that brain to do is to invent iPhones and

1400
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:26,120
create podcasts and have amazing things. Right. That's a secondary function. But believe it or

1401
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:32,680
not, before that secondary function, your, your brain is supposed to make you happy because happy

1402
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:37,960
is the ultimate form for you to perform in life. If you're not happy, you're not as effective as

1403
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:44,200
you could be at achieving survival. Think about it. If you're grumpy all the time at work,

1404
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:49,400
people don't like you. You're not focused. No one wants to help you. You're wasting most of your

1405
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:55,160
time, your brain cycles, you know, thinking about the negative. And so you're not innovative or

1406
01:34:55,160 --> 01:35:00,920
creative and so on and so forth. It degrades your performance. Happy is a better place for

1407
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:05,000
you to be at work because it will make your customers want to do business with you. It will

1408
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,560
make your colleagues want to, you know, to help you out. It will make your boss welcome you in

1409
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:16,040
their team and so on and so forth. We are social animals by definition. And we want to have that

1410
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:21,240
in our life. And the easiest way to connect and to open up and to discover the world is to be in a

1411
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:26,360
happy place. That's a primary function of your brain. It's hard for some people, you know,

1412
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:33,480
because we can all think of someone in our lives who has certain wiring, very stubborn wiring,

1413
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,760
that almost seems impossible to unwire. And I think we all have that ourselves as well,

1414
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,560
certain wiring in our brains where something happens and our reaction to that thing might be,

1415
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,680
you know, to catastrophize. It's the end of the world. That's like a, it feels like it's a

1416
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:53,960
certain set of wiring where trigger and then the brain goes through the circuitry and it goes

1417
01:35:53,960 --> 01:36:01,160
catastrophe panic. Yeah. And the answer to that I found was to actually guide that person or yourself,

1418
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:07,240
if that's yourself, to the opposite of your wiring. So if my wiring is to look at everything and see

1419
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,760
what's wrong with it, I should deliberately force my brain to look for what's right with it. So,

1420
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,360
you know, I, when I was, when I was coming here, it was very busy in the morning. And so I came

1421
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:24,280
late, if you remember, and my brain's immediate reaction is, Oh, what's going to happen? I'm

1422
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:30,200
going to be late for Steve, right? That's the immediate reaction of a brain because something

1423
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:38,040
is wrong. So it looks for what's wrong. I could also say, and what is good about that? What is

1424
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:42,600
good about being a little late? You know, he's been recording for the last few days. So it may

1425
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:47,000
give him a little bit of extra time. Do you want to know the truth? I was so happy you were late

1426
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,680
because I was late. Right. So I was doing upstairs reading that I was reading the book and I was

1427
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:56,120
thinking, I just hope he's like 15 minutes late. And then I'm like, I really, he's not coming at

1428
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:59,400
perfect. So I carried on going and carrying on going and carrying on going. And I just finished

1429
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:04,760
as you arrived. Yeah. So it's perfect. You see, that, that is the truth. That's the truth that

1430
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:11,000
your brain tries to deny you from seeing. And interestingly, you can't train your brain. So,

1431
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,560
so basically what you can do is for every thought, for every negative thought that your brain gives

1432
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:21,880
you, task it with the task of giving you a positive one or two positive ones, nine, I say, nine.

1433
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:26,840
Yeah. Because in reality, if you look at life around you, more than 90% of life is okay for

1434
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:32,920
your brain to contribute more than that as negative is not fair. Right. So if literally if your brain

1435
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:39,160
says, Hey, by the way, this studio is a little warm. What else is about this to do? My friend,

1436
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:45,160
Steve is there. The lighting is perfect. The crew is amazing. You know, the coffee is not that bad.

1437
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:52,280
You guys got me honey. I can go on for hours. Right. And the idea is by training your brain

1438
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:57,480
to look for that. What are you actually doing? You're firing the neurons together.

1439
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:04,360
Gratitude. And exactly your, your, your book basically says it is the answer. The answer is

1440
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:09,400
when you find gratitude, what that gratitude journal that you keep that you kept for years

1441
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:14,600
every day, what was it telling you? It was training your brain to look for what's right.

1442
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:20,120
That your brain every night that you did it was like, okay, it seems he's going to be asking to

1443
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:24,840
call his mom a lot more often. It seems he's going to be asking for good things a lot more often.

1444
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:30,200
I might as well observe them. I might as well find them. And so yes, you said some people are

1445
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,080
impossible to rewire. They're impossible to rewire. If they've been practicing a certain

1446
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:40,280
wiring for 21 years, it's not going to take 21 seconds to rewire anyone, including me and you.

1447
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:47,000
It will take 21 days, let's say, for your brain to recognize I need different wire.

1448
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,120
And it will take maybe 21 months for your brain to say, and I don't need the old wiring anymore.

1449
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:57,720
And the game here is, can you actually keep doing that? Can you keep tapping your finger

1450
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:01,160
in a way that trains your brain that this is the wiring that you need?

1451
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,480
Like, can I keep going to the gym and working on my guns?

1452
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:12,840
Believe it or not, the research will tell you that a big part of being athletic is wiring

1453
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:18,280
of your brain, not your muscles. For your brain to be able to say, I will go, even if I feel a

1454
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:24,440
little tired, I will go, even if I feel a little busy, I will go and I will do the right exercises,

1455
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:29,080
even if the last push is a little painful. A lot of people will hear that and go, what's

1456
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:33,240
the evidence for this? What's the evidence for neuroplasticity? Is there science? Oh,

1457
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:37,960
there is a ton of science behind neuroplasticity. Anything from between neuroplasticity and

1458
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:45,880
neurogenesis is when neuroplasticity is to rewire the connections between the neurons.

1459
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:50,840
And neurogenesis is to actually create new neurons when, if you're hit with a ball,

1460
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:56,360
for example, and part of your brain is damaged, how we can recreate that, right? If you have a stroke

1461
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:02,440
and how you recreate that. And ample evidence, one of the very famous stories is Matthew Ricard,

1462
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:07,880
when we spoke about him in the beginning. Matthew's brain looks different than the average human

1463
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:14,680
brain. His insula is much bigger in relative comparison. His prefrontal cortex is bigger.

1464
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:22,360
And it fires more often. It's simply because of the constant neuroplasticity of,

1465
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:28,840
I need you to meditate. I need you to stay quiet. I need you. I mean, some of Matthew's journeys

1466
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:32,120
would last four years in isolation. You would meditate for four years?

1467
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:39,640
Be in isolation in hermitage for four years. And so at that level, your brain starts to do

1468
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:44,040
very different things. And by the way, that's not unusual. Many farmers around the world

1469
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:51,480
live in isolation for a very long time. Believe it or not, you and I, when we spend a long time

1470
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:57,400
on airplanes, I chose a long time ago to not watch a lot of stuff. I maybe watch one movie,

1471
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:03,000
but not the entire trip. The other bits of silence, that's actually a form of meditation.

1472
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:09,960
And my absolute wonderful friend, Jamie Nelson, the photographer, if you know him,

1473
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:17,400
he photographs indigenous tribes. And the way he does it is he would go and spend a few months

1474
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:23,800
outside their premises, their village, if you want, in silence. Camping out there,

1475
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,800
he doesn't speak their language. He's just sitting there waiting for them to accept him.

1476
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,920
And then he would start to communicate to them in sign language because he doesn't speak their

1477
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:38,760
language. And he's one of the wisest people I know. And I said, how did you become this wise?

1478
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:43,480
He never studied any of those things. And the reality is, is because he's in constant reflection

1479
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:49,240
and meditation. He's sitting out there. And he's spending hours and days in reflection and meditation,

1480
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:54,760
right? Because you're sitting alone. All of those things are our habits. And all of us have the

1481
01:41:54,760 --> 01:42:02,040
chance to do it. You could be on the tube for a commute of 40 minutes a day. And you could be in

1482
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:08,680
that commute cursing life. And that's a very good 40 minute exercise to work and another 40

1483
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:14,120
minute going back. Or you could be spending the 40 minutes in gratitude. You could be first for,

1484
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:18,440
you know, for spending the 40 minutes listening to music, could be doing whatever

1485
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:22,600
what you will do for 40 minutes a day will rewire your brain.

1486
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,560
It really is like a paradigm shifting thought that our brains are in this constant

1487
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,760
growth and evolution. But when we look at, as you said, my muscles are,

1488
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:35,320
my muscles are changing state size, growing more fibers to achieve their objective in a

1489
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:40,120
different way. And of course, my brain is as well. And when you think about that, it's really

1490
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:44,040
liberating because you realize that you're not stuck with who you are. Absolutely not.

1491
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:48,920
It's my friend, Ro, she's, she's got a podcast as well. She, um, one of the smartest people I've

1492
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,320
ever met. And she, she worked in my company for many years and she got a brain tumor. And

1493
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:58,520
she showed me the scan of her brain. They found this golf ball in the middle of her brain.

1494
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:06,360
And they removed it. And she showed me those brain scans. And then just months later,

1495
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:13,800
the hole is gone. And her brain has regrown that part. And there's no longer a hole in her brain.

1496
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,840
And that was one of those moments when I go, Oh my God, the brain, like,

1497
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,960
like everything around us is a living organism that is shaping and evolving based on the

1498
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,320
inputs and what's happening to it. So let's choose what, which parts of it are we going to

1499
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:31,240
grow? I think that's the whole point. And we grow it with our actions and our thoughts.

1500
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,760
Repetitive actions, thoughts and memories, believe it or not, one of the interesting

1501
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:41,000
things is if you take a memory in the past and you think about it over and over and over,

1502
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,960
it's as if you're hap, it's happening over and over. And you're growing the neurons that are

1503
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:50,280
needed or you're growing the connections between the neurons that are needed to trigger that memory.

1504
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:56,920
Think happy memories. Okay. If you sit next to your partner and focus on one thing that they

1505
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,520
do and go like, they say, do this, they do this, they do this, they do this and forget

1506
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,720
that they do a hundred other things that you love and appreciate,

1507
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,880
your neuroplasticity is making you completely obsessed about that one thing.

1508
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:12,600
And you can only see that one thing. And eventually, you know, some of my friends

1509
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,480
after a breakup, I go like, what happened then? They'll say one thing.

1510
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:20,120
It's like just, they obsess about it over and over because your brain is growing to say,

1511
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,160
he needs to think about this, right? I'm going to make it easier to think about this.

1512
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:30,680
I'm going to make it faster, more accessible. And you'll see it more often, like the red cars.

1513
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:34,920
You know, the whole thing about when you, if you buy like a red car, if you buy like a green car,

1514
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,000
then every car you see will appear to be green. If you buy a Range Rover, every car you see is a

1515
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Range Rover. Well, this other thing that's really intriguing topic from our last conversation that

1516
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,640
you mentioned and you mentioned in your new book is this idea of masculinity and femininity.

1517
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:52,760
I don't really hear many people talking about this. Yeah. Believe it or not, my, my publisher

1518
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:59,560
really was asking, should we include this? It's a contested topic that we want to,

1519
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:05,480
but I think it's very important for people to understand. We've mixed up again, a few definitions.

1520
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:13,320
Like I said, we mix love and romance, for example, with mixed biology, with gender identity,

1521
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:18,440
with sexual preferences, with the reality of what the feminine and the masculine is.

1522
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:26,520
The feminine and the masculine in my definition are approaches to life. Okay.

1523
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:35,240
Some basic, basically, some people will want to hold their mug this way and others will want to

1524
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:40,120
hold it that way. It's an approach to life. No way is right and no way is wrong. Okay.

1525
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:45,400
Some of us will want to go through life with creativity and playfulness and,

1526
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:51,800
and, you know, intuition. And some of us will want to go with analysis and discipline and

1527
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:55,880
linear thinking. It's an approach to life. Neither is right and neither is wrong.

1528
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,400
There is a high correlation between those who are, I archetypically feminine, if you want,

1529
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:10,360
between certain of those qualities, certain, some of those qualities. And, you know, those who are

1530
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:16,920
masculine. Again, there is a correlation with some other qualities. So you'd find that a person

1531
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:22,520
who's masculine, whether that's a man or a woman, straight or gay, it doesn't matter if, if a person

1532
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:28,440
acts in their masculine, they'll tend to be a little more forceful if you think about it. You

1533
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:33,720
know, we, the masculine, one of the masculine qualities is strength. Okay. Strength is a,

1534
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:38,520
is a quality, whether it's strength in mental strength or physical strength. You want to,

1535
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,200
you want to use your strengths to move things. Okay. If you're dependent on your masculine side

1536
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:49,960
or more associating with your masculine side, you're going to show that. And as I said, statistically

1537
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:55,880
correlated, those who have male body parts tend to use that a little more. Reasoning doesn't matter.

1538
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:05,400
The problem with our world at the global level and the problem at us, about us as individuals

1539
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:11,480
is we've decided that some of those properties or qualities are more valuable to our world than

1540
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:17,240
others. Okay. If, if you live in a capitalist world and the capitalist world is entirely about

1541
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:23,320
let's produce more, let's make more, let's, you know, do more, we're going to have to borrow more

1542
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:30,680
from the doing qualities, which are mostly masculine. Okay. This leads to a world where

1543
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:36,520
there is a lot of doing with little being, which basically means it's a world where we do a lot

1544
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:41,640
of what we haven't really properly thought about with what, what is not really informed

1545
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:49,000
by the realities of who we are being, being that beautiful. Some of the feminine is being

1546
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:56,440
the feminine is the masculine does. There is a difference between them. And if you continue

1547
01:47:56,440 --> 01:48:02,760
to do without actually asking yourself that awareness question of what should I do? You end

1548
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:08,680
up doing things like building technologies that make our life slightly better and destroy the

1549
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:14,680
planet in the process. Why? Because you haven't really internalized some of the most beautiful

1550
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:22,600
feminine qualities of intuition, of creative thinking to look for alternatives, of sensuality

1551
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:28,280
to actually sense what is actually happening in the world as a result of your doing of inclusion,

1552
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,080
you know, to connect to the rest of being to understand that this is not just about us,

1553
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:38,360
it's also about the bees and the, and the bears and everyone else and so on. So that world that

1554
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:44,120
we've created being hypermasculine is I think the biggest mistake humanity's ever done. And I think

1555
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:50,360
humanity's paying for that mistake and will pay more in the future. The savior is for us to stop

1556
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:55,960
doing this and to start waking up and saying, hold on, hold on, we need a lot of being before you

1557
01:48:55,960 --> 01:49:03,720
continue to do. So interesting. It's particularly tricky to understand for men, of course, because

1558
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:07,960
men, I mean, there'll be a lot of men again, you know, listening to this podcast now that hear

1559
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:14,280
the idea that they need to embrace their feminine, that go, oh gosh, no, it will scare them, it will

1560
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:26,760
it will appear to hurt their identity, their sense of self, it'll make them feel weaker,

1561
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,080
maybe it'll make them feel like they have, they lack purpose if they're not that masculine,

1562
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:35,720
because a lot of, a lot of us as men, a lot of our sense of purpose comes from being

1563
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:41,240
competitive, from winning, from being strong, apparently, that's how it feels anyway.

1564
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:48,360
But what is masculine? I mean, if masculine is to protect, for example, because we have the strength

1565
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:55,800
or the masculine has the strength, can that protection happen without empathy?

1566
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:02,840
How can you protect if you don't have empathy? You need the feminine empathy to be able to protect.

1567
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:11,240
If the masculine is to solve a problem, can you solve the problem without actually identifying

1568
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:17,800
the problem? You need intuition and sensuality, and right, if the masculine is about safety and

1569
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:28,040
survival, how can you do that without living, without beauty, without, you know, art, all of

1570
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:32,360
that is in the feminine. Your comment is right, by the way, but it is not because of any difference

1571
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:37,400
between the masculine and the feminine. Men will, will feel less comfortable with this,

1572
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:43,160
because women have been sadly pushed to live in their masculine, to survive in this hyper masculine

1573
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:50,920
world. I will tell you honestly, and I say that with 100% honesty, you know, honesty of that view,

1574
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:57,400
I thought to myself that I was intelligent. Until four and a half years ago, I started to

1575
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:04,120
empower my feminine. And I promise you, I'm 10 times more intelligent. I was in my left brain

1576
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:09,800
doing all of the analysis, thinking I'm a smart person. But I was doing all of the analysis,

1577
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,920
all of the wrong inputs. The feminine gives you the inputs. The feminine gives you the,

1578
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:20,440
the picture of the reality, the, the inclusion, the big, the big view of life. You can't see that

1579
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:28,120
with your narrow-minded, linear brain. And I think the reality is that men who are most successful

1580
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:34,760
ever in changing the world, believe it or not, are more in their masculine, feminine than their

1581
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,720
masculine. Anyone has that, has ever changed the world, has been more in their feminine than

1582
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:45,640
your masculine. The example I gave when we spoke about this Steve Jobs. Most people think that

1583
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:51,320
Steve Jobs was an amazing successful CEO because he was pushy. He was, you know, a bit obnoxious

1584
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:56,440
actually sometimes. Not at all. The reason Steve Jobs was Steve Jobs is because of his feminine

1585
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:03,000
qualities, his appreciation of beauty, his appreciation of his creativity, his art, his

1586
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:09,400
appreciation of color and shape, his empathy to his user's needs. All of these are what made

1587
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:14,520
Steve Jobs that amazing visionary that he was. Obnoxious, by the way, pulled it back a little

1588
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:21,720
bit. Gandhi, even though sometimes Gandhi is contested, but Gandhi's success is not in saving

1589
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:26,360
his nation through the masculine qualities. If it was the masculine qualities, he would have

1590
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:35,560
rallied a billion people to kill the Brits. No, he went into a peaceful, nonviolent, an empathy,

1591
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:40,920
an attempt to make things work through communication. All of these are feminine qualities.

1592
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:47,240
And somehow we forget in our narrow-minded, hypermasculine world, because we've narrowed

1593
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:52,760
everything to dollar signs. So productivity and profit and all of that is dollar signs.

1594
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:58,440
And so if that's the target, yes, doing more, producing more, selling more is a good way to

1595
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:05,240
go. But the reality is anyone who's ever made the world better, not richer, did it by living in

1596
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:09,880
their feminine first. How does one tap into their feminine side? Because I think it's important to

1597
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:15,560
also say, because these words have been associated with genders for so long, but a woman or someone

1598
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:20,840
that's trans can also be too much in their masculine side and vice versa. A man or someone

1599
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,840
that's trans would identify as whatever gender can also be too much in their feminine side.

1600
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,480
But so how does someone tap in more to their feminine self? Is there an activity? Is it just

1601
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:37,720
a choice we make? So I think it first requires an exercise of awareness. And actually,

1602
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:43,240
in that little voice in your head, in that chapter specifically, I have quite a few

1603
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:49,640
awareness exercises. Those awareness exercises start by recognizing what's the feminine.

1604
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:56,200
And that's a beautiful exercise, a beautiful exercise that you can actually experience if you

1605
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:04,440
invited a couple of friends over that are feminine in their actions most of the time,

1606
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:07,960
and a couple of friends that are masculine in their actions all of the time,

1607
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:15,560
and allocated proper time for each of them to solve a problem. And observe the behavior. You

1608
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:22,600
will find incredible differences between the masculine side, man or woman, it doesn't matter,

1609
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,840
which will jump in and say, okay, we're going to carry this and then take it 10 steps away from

1610
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:32,760
here and then we're going to do this and lift it on the shelf right away. When the feminine will say

1611
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:40,920
things like, I feel that this might be a little heavier for John than it is for Jack. And I sense

1612
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:47,400
that if we can collaborate around it as one being, we can do this slightly different. Sometimes they'll

1613
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:54,680
say things like, why do we have to do this at all? Isn't there a bigger world where maybe we could

1614
01:54:54,680 --> 01:55:02,200
just keep it here? And by that observation, you'll start to identify the qualities.

1615
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,400
That's number one. Number two is what I call the appreciation exercise. The appreciation

1616
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:14,440
exercise is to flip roles. It's to sit in front of you and say, Steve, how would you solve that

1617
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:20,760
problem? And then wait and then tell you, how would you solve it if you were Jackie? And that

1618
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:25,640
appreciation exercise basically starts to get you to say, oh my God, there is another way,

1619
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,280
and that other way is not really me. It's Jackie's way, but it's interesting. And then the third is

1620
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:35,240
practice, practice, practice, practice. I tell you openly, I've been empowering my feminine for

1621
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:40,520
the last four and a half years, now probably five years. And my biggest exercise for the last two

1622
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:45,000
years has been an exercise of flow. We spoke about that at the beginning. The idea of flow

1623
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:53,800
is the truth of the feminine. The feminine is life itself. It's flowing, it's gushing across

1624
01:55:53,800 --> 01:56:02,120
life, across the world, across territories, across times and stories. And we, if we live

1625
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:07,720
in our masculine, we go like, nope, not going there. This is not my place. This is my place. I'm

1626
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:14,920
going there. And I liken it always with a river, a raging whitewater river. If you put the masculine

1627
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:20,920
in the boat, the masculine will take the water, the push it because they want to go there. They

1628
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:26,600
want to be right there. The feminine will just hold the arm and basically say, okay,

1629
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:32,840
the river is going. I just need to balance it every now and then with one strike, just to

1630
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:38,760
stay on track. But it's okay to take a little longer with the river to get to where I want to be.

1631
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:46,360
And that massive difference, I'm sorry to say, and I'm someone who associated with the masculine

1632
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:52,840
for a very long time is stupid, honestly stupid, because suddenly somehow you realize that life

1633
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:59,640
itself is talking to you through your feminine. Life itself is saying, let go. I'll do things.

1634
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:07,480
Okay. I'm much more powerful, mighty wheels. I can do stuff. Just let go a little. Just flow with

1635
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:15,240
me a little. And if you manage to do that, I chose flow. I think there are several other major

1636
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:19,960
pillars of the feminine. One of them is inclusion, as I say. So relating to others, choose that if

1637
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:26,040
you want to. One of them is temporal. The masculine is very linear. We associate with the arrow of

1638
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:32,440
time where the feminine is very rhythmic. We associate with cycles. And so if you can actually

1639
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:37,720
see the difference between them, that's a very interesting exercise. I think creativity and

1640
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:44,440
playfulness and breaking the rules sort of, I think paradoxical thinking. To me, these are the

1641
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:52,440
big five pillars. Paradoxical thinking is to be able to be humble enough to embrace that two

1642
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:57,640
opposing stories are true. Two opposing facts can actually exist together.

1643
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:04,840
Interesting. And the role of the masculine. Amazing. The role of the masculine energy.

1644
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:10,920
So that's a beautiful question. So the problem we had with the movement of feminism,

1645
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:15,080
and I say that with love and respect, is that it demonized the masculine.

1646
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:21,400
Now, what needs to be demonized is overdoing the masculine. So strength is good.

1647
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:25,880
That is me sometimes, by the way, I have to admit. I definitely overdo the masculine. My

1648
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:28,680
girlfriend tells me as well, she goes, she'll literally say it like that though, because she's

1649
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:36,440
very in touch with her feminine masculine energy, you'll say you're being too in the masculine

1650
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:43,800
right now. Yeah, you know what's one of the most common things I'm told by a woman who's

1651
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:51,240
uncomfortable with how her boyfriend's behaving is he's unable to be available emotionally.

1652
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:57,400
Yeah, of course, we suffer from that. That's a consequence of toxic. Absolutely. So let's talk

1653
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:02,920
about this concept because it's very important. There is no demonizing of a quality. Linear

1654
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:08,440
thinking is a wonderful quality. If you can think about a problem linearly, that's a wonderful

1655
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:13,720
quality. Overdoing it makes you stubborn. You understand it's the overdoing that's the problem.

1656
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:20,120
It's strength. Wonderful. You overdo strength, you become violent. We don't want the overdoing.

1657
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:26,600
And what should be demonized is overdoing that. It's overdoing anything, including, by the way,

1658
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:35,640
overdoing the feminine. So if you're intuitive, it's a wonderful quality. But if you're too

1659
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:43,720
much intuition, you're ignoring linear facts and analysis. If you're, let's say, paradoxical,

1660
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:49,720
one of my favorites, as I always say, if you can embrace paradoxes, it's a wonderful quality.

1661
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:54,680
It gives you double the amount of information to analyze if you want to do analytical thinking.

1662
01:59:55,320 --> 02:00:00,920
But if you overdo it, you become a little irrational. If you're disciplined as a masculine

1663
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:08,520
quality or not disciplined at all, you become irrational. So overdoing something or underdoing

1664
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:14,040
something is not good for any of us. What is the right amount of doing something, by the way?

1665
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:22,120
It's how you are configured. So I am much more empathetic and maybe creative

1666
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:34,360
and maybe playful than I am paradoxical. I am much more in linear thinking and control

1667
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:41,880
than I am in flow. This is why I work on my flow, believe it or not, through neuroplasticity.

1668
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:45,960
So what I'm doing with my life now for the last two years is I'm living a life of flow.

1669
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,520
I'm allowing life to tell me what to do. And instead of my hyper-engineered mathematical

1670
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:55,800
brain saying, nope, that's not the way it should be done. I've done my analysis. It's 37%. I'm going

1671
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:02,360
to do this. I start to listen and say, hey, I'm going to make the decision of it's 37 or not.

1672
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:06,680
In a couple of weeks' time, no harm done if I was wrong, but intuition is beautiful.

1673
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:14,200
It's hard to uncondition oneself, but it goes back to this point about rewiring our brains

1674
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:21,000
by repetition. And when I think about being more in my feminine energy and my feminine

1675
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:31,960
qualities and characteristics, it is achieved by repetition, by opening up to that side of me

1676
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:38,520
and spending more time wiring myself to in that way.

1677
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,800
Which I think is so important. It's funny because I know there'll be a lot of people

1678
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:46,040
listening to this that either don't understand or have kind of misunderstood because we're

1679
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:49,400
using terms that come with like stigma. When we think of femininity or when we think of

1680
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:55,400
masculinity, there's connotations with that. But it's so unbelievably true. And if people

1681
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,800
have listened to this podcast, they'll know it's true. We had Terry Cruz on here who talked about

1682
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:05,160
his masculinity and how that became incredibly harmful to him and destructive and risked his

1683
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,920
relationships and everything that mattered to him. We had Patrice ever talk about how

1684
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:14,440
early experiences that made him lean towards masculinity to help him survive,

1685
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:18,600
being abused by his head teacher and watching his brothers and sisters die because of drug

1686
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:25,000
addiction on the streets of France, made him turn more to that masculinity as a tool for survival.

1687
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,920
But then that cost him so dearly because he lived out of balance to one day sat with his partner,

1688
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:33,880
she said, there's something not right with you. There's something not right with you.

1689
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:40,120
He resisted, he resisted, he resisted, then boom, burst into tears. And that's the moment where he

1690
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:46,200
opened up. You see it, you see it and you know it. And by the way, I think in reality,

1691
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:53,800
what I'm asking for is now that the world has finally accepted gender diversity and fluidity

1692
02:02:53,800 --> 02:03:00,840
and so on. I'm asking us not to be more categorized. I'm asking us to stop saying,

1693
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:05,400
so I'm category A, category B, category D, because we've just moved from man,

1694
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:12,520
woman to more categories now. I'm asking us to say that Moe is unlike anyone else in his mix

1695
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:17,720
of masculinity and femininity. I'm 58 percent in certain qualities of the feminine, I'm more than

1696
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:23,000
others. And you could be 42 percent in other qualities of the feminine and more than others.

1697
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,640
And I think the idea is to say each and every one of us is an individual, each and every one of us

1698
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:35,960
is a category of their own. Everyone, the only category I fit in is I'm a Moe. That's it. That's

1699
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:41,880
my category. And that category includes a beautiful blend of qualities that I can use that are not

1700
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:49,080
any better or any worse than anyone else. Those qualities that I blend together might be amazing

1701
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:55,160
for this podcast conversation, but horrible at making pizza. I don't know. And I think the

1702
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:01,560
reality is if you can become true to that reality of who you are, you'll become the best at that

1703
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:06,840
that you're supposed to do in life. And without that balance, you will always, always feel incomplete.

1704
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:16,120
Moe, you've written what is another legendary book on a very related but incredibly foundational

1705
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:22,360
topic, which is our thoughts and that little voice in our heads. And I think if this conversation is

1706
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:27,640
a flavor of the book, then it is, I think in everyone's view that's listening, a must read.

1707
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:32,840
You know, it's funny that we, I talk about time being the single currency that we can allocate to

1708
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:39,080
determine the outcomes of our lives, but thoughts are the... Interesting. The other thing that is

1709
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:45,320
determining how we spend that currency. Yeah, I think, I think time is the rhythm of your song,

1710
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:50,280
the song of your life. And thoughts really are the lyrics that you put on top of it. They are the

1711
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:59,560
melody. They are, they are, as we spend a minute of our life thinking a certain thought, that minute

1712
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:05,480
completely shapes how the song of your life is going to be. It's quite interesting how we ignore that.

1713
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:11,320
And so maybe, maybe thoughts are the most important thing. And what this book does is it

1714
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:19,960
helps us to adjust the code that runs our brains. At the last line in your book, you say

1715
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:25,640
I have one last selfish request. Please find the compassion in your heart to want happiness for

1716
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:32,280
my wonderful son, Ali and wise teacher. Send him a prayer, a generous wish that he is happy

1717
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:38,760
wherever he is right now. He started it all and he truly was the kindest, happiest human I have

1718
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:46,200
ever known. I'll keep working on mine for Ali. Why did you bring that up? We were having an easy

1719
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:57,640
conversation. Yeah. So yeah, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for what he taught me. And I wouldn't

1720
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:02,280
be here if it wasn't for the example he set. And I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for him

1721
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:12,600
leaving us. And, and I, it's interesting that I told, I may have told you this once before that

1722
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,440
I write the last sentence of every book before I write the rest of the book.

1723
02:06:18,520 --> 02:06:21,560
Yeah. And I, I have to say I have been

1724
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:30,920
blessed with so many people that send me messages that say I love Ali. And yeah, I feel that

1725
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:38,600
if it was that, only that, that I got from the work I've done, then I've lived. It's,

1726
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:43,720
there is nothing worse more. And, and, and, but I'm getting so much more. I'm getting so much

1727
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:51,960
purpose if you want, but I don't want to be forgetting him in that purpose. I think that's

1728
02:06:51,960 --> 02:07:01,160
where I stand today that I'm so driven by what I'm trying to achieve. And he's been away for

1729
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:07,960
seven years, almost eight years now. So I once again need him to be part of our journey to

1730
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:16,200
so yes, please send him a happy wish. The work he's done through you is truly magical.

1731
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:17,800
Through you is the exact right word.

1732
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:27,720
It's funny when, when we spoke about the idea of control being a masculine quality. Only when I

1733
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:35,560
let go, only when I let go that life, whether with him or through him, or maybe he's the boss,

1734
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:41,480
I have no idea, but what I've, what I've accomplished was so much more than what I did

1735
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:47,000
when I was trying to control everything. And it's because of how he showed me to do, to do this.

1736
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:55,640
As you know, we have a closing tradition on this podcast.

1737
02:07:55,640 --> 02:08:00,280
Oh, I should have prepared for that. Oh my God, I didn't think about this.

1738
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:05,000
It doesn't matter. Sometimes, you know, a lack of preparation leads to the best

1739
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,200
outcomes. Okay, question is,

1740
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:15,400
oh, that's not encouraging, Steve.

1741
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,480
Oh, so I really like this question. It's very fitting, I think.

1742
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:24,280
The previous guest wrote for you, what is the greatest wealth in your life?

1743
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:31,800
What was not the greatest wealth was all of the money, all of the cars, all of the

1744
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:39,320
things. It was a waste of life, I promise you. And I know most people will say, yeah,

1745
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:44,200
you say that because you had it. When you have it too, you will feel the same. It was a total

1746
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:53,560
waste of life. When you wrote in your book that we come to this life with 500,000 chips, you said,

1747
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:59,720
remember, you wrote 80 hour, if you live 80 years, you will have 500,000 hours of active life or

1748
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:05,640
something like that. And that this is your wealth. This is what you come to the, to the world with

1749
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:11,880
and you place those chips hour by hour. The thought that came to my head was I was born a millionaire.

1750
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:19,720
500,000 hours is a lot of hours. But then you turn, you take that cash and you turn it to equity.

1751
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:24,280
It's really interesting how you take those hours and by placing those chips,

1752
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:32,200
you turn one chip into equity, into something that lasts. And the things that I know last are

1753
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:39,320
experiences, knowledge, and love. And I promise you, we will never acquire anything more important

1754
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:46,360
than any of those three. In an interesting order, actually, they are love, knowledge, and experiences.

1755
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:54,520
So, so what we, what we, what we go through in all of our life is we do tons of things

1756
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:02,200
that we think are going to acquire us, one of those three, you know, unhappiness, of course.

1757
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:09,320
But, but in reality, it's so much easier to acquire those three directly. The biggest wealth you

1758
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:16,440
will ever have are a set of experiences that can't be repeated, some knowledge that can be

1759
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:23,640
beneficial for yourself and those around you. And the feeling of love, which I have been overwhelmed

1760
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:30,360
with. I mean, I can tell you, I'm the richest man I know by far from the number of kind messages that

1761
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:36,360
I get from people saying, you know, we love what you do, we appreciate your, your, your attempt to

1762
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:42,040
make the world better. That love, I think, is the biggest wealth I have ever acquired. And I

1763
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:49,000
always say, Ali and I am my daughter, definitely have been the biggest love of my life, for sure.

1764
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:57,160
And when Ali left to take that life away, I feel that the fairness of life replaced it with the

1765
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:02,920
life, with the love of hundreds of thousands of people. Which interestingly, I'm so grateful for,

1766
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:08,680
but it's almost exactly barely enough to balance the love that I have for him.

1767
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:14,200
And so, yeah, maybe, maybe we should spend our life acquiring more of these.

1768
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:17,560
Thank you.

1769
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:25,320
I had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast. For many years, people have been

1770
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:31,320
asking for a coffee-flavored hul. And quite recently, hul released the iced coffee caramel

1771
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:36,440
flavor of their ready-to-drink huls. And I've just become hooked on it over the last couple

1772
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:41,240
of weeks. And now I'm drinking that as well as the protein. Make sure you try the new ready-to-drink

1773
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:46,680
flavors. The caramel flavor is amazing. The new banana flavor as well as amazing. And obviously,

1774
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:51,640
as I said, the iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real smash hit. So check it out.

1775
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:55,240
Let me know what you think on social media. I see all of your tags and Instagram posts and

1776
02:11:55,240 --> 02:12:11,160
tweets about hul. Back to the podcast.
