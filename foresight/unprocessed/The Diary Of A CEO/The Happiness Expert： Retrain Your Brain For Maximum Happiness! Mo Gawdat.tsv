0	5040	The most resilient parasite is not a bacteria, it's not a virus, it is a thought, and it
5040	6040	shapes everything.
6040	9040	He is an expert on the topic of happiness.
9040	13600	Google made him the head of Google X, the return of a mobile browser.
13600	19040	I know people will hate me when I say this, dating is an entirely an economics problem.
19040	22000	When you don't know what you're looking for, then you're advertising wrong.
22000	23800	How do you find out what you're looking for though?
23800	27120	If you want to find love, it's very straightforward.
27120	31200	In the last line in your book, you say, please find the compassion in your heart to want
31200	33120	happiness for my wonderful son, Ali.
33120	34800	Why did you bring that up?
34800	40280	We were having an easy conversation.
40280	45800	I wrote Soul for Happy at a time where Ali had just left our world and he helped me really,
45800	47680	really figure things out.
47680	51400	We think that this brain is supposed to be there to make us successful.
51400	53880	Your brain is supposed to make you happy.
53880	59960	I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world are...
59960	63400	Without further ado, I'm Stephen Bartlett, and this is The Diary of a CEO.
63400	67400	I hope nobody's listening, but if you are, then please keep this to yourself.
67400	77400	The Return of Mo Gouda
77400	81560	Oh man, no pressure.
81560	83040	I mean, I don't really know what to say.
83400	87920	Our first conversation, as you'll know, as I've said many times to my audience, is still
87920	93160	to this day my favorite podcast episode of all time for so many reasons.
93160	97040	It had everything that I've ever wanted from a conversation.
97040	104280	It had the personal story delivered in a way with immense honesty and vulnerability and
104280	105280	wisdom.
105280	109040	I learnt so much from that conversation, and of all the conversations I've had, whenever
109040	112680	I'm asked wherever I go, I said that that conversation is the conversation that's had
112680	118360	the most profound impact on the real fundamentals of my life than any other.
118360	123800	The words that you said then still show up at pivotal moments in my life when I'm feeling
123800	128440	a certain way or I'm letting something get the best of me, and it's really, really liberated
128440	129440	me of so many things.
129440	136000	So when I heard you were back in London, I had to have another conversation with you.
136000	137000	It's an honour.
137000	138000	Honestly, thanks for asking.
138000	142160	I have to ask, since we spoke, what's changed in your life?
142640	144760	And how does your life look now?
147480	149360	Ever-changing, interestingly.
149360	156040	I'm on, you know, 2020 was my year of silence and space.
156040	158560	2021 was my year of flow.
159160	164520	And then at the beginning of 2022, I asked myself, what will this year be about?
164520	170800	I take a theme for every year because it's sort of an interesting way to guide your life
170800	172240	in terms of where you want to go.
172240	173600	I don't like targets.
173600	178240	It's too businessy when it comes to your own connection to yourself.
178240	184000	And 2022, I decided it will also be a year of flow, but I called it the year of joy
184000	186080	in flow, which is really interesting.
186080	191640	So to me, believe it or not, as I worked through the years on empowering more of my
191640	197840	feminine side and, you know, creativity, paradoxical thinking, flow, all of those
197840	204440	sometimes appearingly not so disciplined traits are hyper feminine and they're very
204440	210080	valuable in terms of enjoying life, but also seeing the full reality of life, if you want.
211000	214800	I did very well in 2020 with my approach to flow.
214800	221600	I went wherever life wanted me to go, but I was still the same mo, you know, very
221600	227080	targeted, very focused, very able to get the maximum out of everything.
227560	233440	Around that, of course, there has been a lot of interesting repercussions of our
233440	239560	conversation that basically allowed me to write more, to connect more.
239560	243000	I tend to be very personal when it comes to my presence on social media.
243000	246120	So got in touch with so many wonderful people.
246120	253480	And I think that's created waves of flow, if you want, in my life, whereby by end of
253480	258800	April, I packed everything up that I had in Dubai, put it in a tiny little storage
258800	262640	space. I've always been a minimalist anyway, so it wasn't much.
263040	267200	And now I have no idea where I'm going from here, completely in flow.
268640	269160	What does that mean?
269160	270880	You have no idea where you're going from here.
270880	276520	I'm in London because of my book publication until end of the month.
276800	277560	And then.
279800	281560	We'll find out.
281600	284920	There's something quite curious about that, because I think we tend to believe
284920	290560	that we need stability or a home or, I don't know, those home
290560	292040	comforts to make ourselves happy.
292040	296880	So I think about sometimes in my life where I, where I was a freelancer,
296880	299880	kind of like drifting through the world, I could do it for a short period of time.
300240	303400	But in the long term, I ultimately craved that sense of home again.
304320	306720	So I think we need both, right?
306720	308200	I think we need the balance.
308440	311800	I think the story that most of us don't realize is that every one of us
311800	314320	wants an adventure and every one of us wants stability.
314320	317960	Every one of us wants, at the point in time, a long term committed,
317960	322160	wonderful, connected relationship and a little and at other times,
322360	328400	once the parties and the fun and, you know, Russian experience and so on.
328800	332560	And I think context is a big part of what we miss as humans,
332600	335440	that through life, context changes.
335840	339720	OK, and I've been on an interesting journey because, of course,
340040	343880	you can imagine, I have always been extreme in whichever stage
343880	348760	I had been in my life when I, when I became, you know, a business executive.
348760	353480	I was a very serious business executive, you know, the 12, 14 hour days,
353480	358440	the, you know, the constant hopping around the world and so on and so forth.
358840	361760	And when I became an author, I became a very serious author.
361760	365200	You know, I started to really, really spend a lot of hours
365200	368280	not writing and, you know, documenting my, my thoughts.
368280	370200	And I write two or three books at the same time.
370760	375920	When you're extreme in those things, you tend to be quite a bit
376760	382600	blinded, if you want, by the pace, by the detail you're swamped into it.
383080	389720	And it does take does take challenging yourself, if you want,
390160	394920	to get to a point where you say, perhaps, perhaps this was wonderful
394920	400000	for my last seven years of my life, but perhaps, you know, context has changed.
400200	404400	Perhaps I need to explore another part of my life to reach that point
404400	405680	where I feel complete.
405680	409000	And was there something that some kind of signal that life gave you
409000	411080	that said it's time to pack up and flow?
411880	413440	What was that?
413440	418560	For most of us who rush really fast in life, we don't even recognize what we feel.
418560	422520	We don't even even recognize what our hearts, what our souls,
422520	424400	what our bodies are signaling to us.
425000	429200	And and I think there has been a very strong longing in my life
430480	433560	to live that idea of, I call it half monk,
435320	437960	which, you know, it's interesting.
438400	440800	Again, the way we stack life is quite strange.
440920	446800	So you you you we work really, really, really hard for the first 30 or 40 years
446800	450680	of our lives, and then we retire when we can't really enjoy life.
450720	453560	You know, it's like when you retire, you're basically taking your stick
453560	456640	and going to whatever Florida or whatever.
457400	460720	When it's actually the way life should be, is that you probably should
461240	464520	take the 10 years of retirement, divide them across the 40 years
464520	466400	and perhaps take three months off every year.
466400	469760	If if we were to redesign life, you know, it would be wonderful
469760	473200	to work seven months of every year and take three or nine months of every year
473200	474880	and take three months off.
474920	479120	Similarly, you know, if you look even at the spiritual path
479120	484480	of some some of the most renowned monks in the world,
484920	488560	you go through a certain path through life and then you stop completely
488560	493640	and then you call become a monk, you know, for for for a for a while.
493640	496880	And then, you know, you may come back to life or become something else.
497320	501240	And I decided there would be an interesting ambition to
502160	505960	to to investigate the possibility of maybe 50 percent of your life
506040	510120	as a monk and 50 percent as a modern day warrior, as I call it.
510200	514760	Right. And I took the number 50 because that's how mathematicians will work.
514760	518400	I'll start from the midpoint and then, you know, irritate around it.
518400	520280	Maybe I'll end at 60 or whatever.
520280	522840	OK. And it's actually interestingly possible.
522920	528040	It's interestingly possible to spend 50 percent of your days
529040	533920	in in monklike activities, which would be connection, reflection,
534720	539920	you know, some some stillness and silence, some service to the world
540320	546120	and 50 percent completely engaged in, you know, writing, writing,
546120	549720	I consider is a service, but, you know, like business and business
549720	553960	conversations and, you know, coaching and whatever it is else that I do,
554200	557000	being stuck in traffic and so on and so forth. OK.
557400	561080	And it was a stupid ambition, but then it started to become a lot more
561480	565440	viable in my mind that actually I could do that 50 percent of every day,
565440	568520	50 percent of every week, 50 percent of every year
569000	570560	could actually be spent that way.
570560	575080	And then and the thing you need to to make that happen is to step out
575080	578080	of the mainstream of your steady life. OK.
578560	582440	So I had a wonderful conversation with my manager, Munir, who,
583160	586320	you know, really wants our success and the success of the mission.
586320	591000	But that sometimes makes him push me very hard to add stuff in my calendar.
591000	594160	And I said, can you allow me the life of a creative?
594720	599520	So can you cram my Tuesdays and Wednesdays to the point where I start hating you
599960	604000	but then leave my rest of the week free with one day
604320	606760	that is negotiable between us. OK.
607040	609680	And that basically is even better than 50 50.
609960	613320	So in those two days, I'm completely a modern day warrior,
613680	617760	completely engaged in, you know, whatever the modern world wants from me.
618000	620840	But then that allows me the rest of the week, if you want,
621000	625560	to do the other things that may allow me to find and reflect and maybe
625760	630120	maybe figure something out that is so much better for the days where I get
630760	634760	engaged. Right. So if my if my work is to spread some ideas,
635080	638880	then silence to find those ideas is actually useful for it.
639480	641560	And so that was the feeling you said.
641560	646400	What what what was the the signal, the feeling has been there for quite a bit
646400	648680	of time. And then when the landlord said, hey, by the way,
648880	651880	want the apartment back, I was like, great, let's do this.
651880	654160	Let's leave the mainstream. OK.
654360	657880	Let's go somewhere and see where that takes us.
657880	661320	See where where serendipity will will show us.
661320	664280	I think that's an interesting place to be. Are you single?
664560	668160	I am single and not single.
668160	674920	I think I know how that that may get a lot of people judging me.
674920	678680	So I again, in an interesting way,
680200	684800	found that my current lifestyle does not qualify me,
685240	687520	if you want, for a committed relationship.
687920	693320	OK. But that a committed relationship is one specific definition
693840	699760	of relationships that I think our world has stuck to for a period of time
699760	703320	that evolved. OK. There are multiple, multiple,
703320	705440	multiple definitions of relationships today.
705440	710840	I think if you if you look back 20 years, 30 years at most,
711240	715280	you'd realize that that singular traditional model
715600	720760	excluded all same sex relationships, all bisexual relationships,
720760	725560	all this and all of that. It also included it also excluded
725560	730800	relationships that were not till death do us part and so on and so forth.
731640	734240	I found and I say that with.
735480	737120	Worry that people will judge me.
737120	740920	I found that what I'm doing is more important to me at the moment
741760	745440	than a traditional committed relationship.
745800	750520	OK. Simply because I feel that an hour spent
751080	757880	with one person could also be an hour that I spend helping a thousand people.
758320	761080	OK. And even though that hour for me
762440	766360	is definitely enriching and fulfilling and so on and so forth,
766840	768720	it becomes sometimes
770320	773520	the commitment associated with it doesn't make it an hour.
773520	777680	Normally makes it several hours, makes it a big chunk of your life
777680	781040	that I lived for 27 years and loved.
781040	785560	And I would say it's the absolute best way to live all together, right?
786000	790880	But it's definitely not something that from a current phase of my life
790880	795640	where the focus of where I want to put my chips, if you want,
795640	798320	my hours of my life is where I want to be.
799000	803000	And so I end up when in very, very connected, very deep,
803040	806000	very wonderful and loving relationships
806440	810280	that are super honest, but not lasting.
811360	815560	You know, if my life will take me from here to somewhere else,
816120	821880	I will not consider sticking around here as a prerequisite to find
821880	825440	or, you know, being a prerequisite to find a relationship
825680	828800	more important than my journey of finding where I need to be.
828800	833560	I learned that interestingly when I spoke to my dear friend, Matthew Ricard
833560	839160	on Slow Mo. So Matthew is probably one of the most renowned monks in the world.
839160	844120	He was a PhD in molecular biology, if I remember.
844520	847960	And he quit his life and went and became a monk.
847960	851760	And he had 60,000 hours of lifetime meditation,
851760	856360	which reconfigured his brain in a way that that was publicly
856880	858960	a very, very interesting science study.
858960	862120	He was called the happiest man in the world because of that.
862600	866320	And I asked him and I said, why, Matthew, why, why would you leave your life
866320	870560	and your girlfriend and your, you know, your he was French living in Paris
870560	873800	and your PhD and go and become a monk?
873800	877080	And he he said it would be very unfair
878360	883480	to have someone in my life expect me to be there all the time.
884000	888440	When what I wanted was my pilgrimages and to be next to my teachers
888440	894120	and my time of isolation and my alone time in my hermitage and so on and so forth.
894520	898960	He basically said it's not a promise I can make if I make it, I would be lying.
899720	903680	And I think that probably was a very enlightening moment for me
903680	908920	because there are many things I give up on in my life that would make my life richer.
909880	914000	But they're perhaps not on my path, at least not for the time being.
915760	917920	Is this a do you view that as a phase in your life?
917920	920360	Would you view that as definitely everything is a phase in your life?
920880	922720	Definitely, definitely.
922720	925520	I think that's the changing context.
925720	928400	Steve is probably the biggest failure of humanity.
929200	933640	The changing context is we have a tendency
933640	940720	because we are designed as survival machines to want things to remain exactly the same.
940720	944680	If it's comfortable, if it's safe, let's keep it.
945560	949800	I want my same coffee machine every day because I know that machine.
949800	952320	I know it's really where I can make amazing coffee with it.
953040	955800	And so, of course, when it's time to pack things,
956280	960400	I need it to hug that machine and say, OK, baby, I'm not going to see you for a few months.
961120	964000	But the truth is there are many places all over the world
964000	966480	that will make an amazing coffee, too, right?
967040	971040	That attachment is one of the biggest reasons for unhappiness in life.
971760	975760	It's the idea of I want my glass of water.
976040	977240	I don't want a glass of water.
977240	978480	I want my mug.
978480	980160	I want my glass of water.
980160	981520	I want my streets.
981520	984040	I want my commute every day.
984040	988760	I want my job security and so on and so forth, which is beautiful.
988760	994280	And by the way, every single one of us needs to live that for a phase of our life
994280	996320	for a season, if you want.
996560	997560	OK.
997600	1001880	But the failure to recognize the changing seasons
1002720	1009040	sometimes results in a narrowness of our life that makes us stick to one path.
1009800	1016400	When we spoke about you, you started as a CEO of a marketing
1016400	1019760	very successful business, and now you're a podcast host,
1019760	1022640	you're an author, you're on Dragonsden and so on and so forth.
1022920	1026600	That's a recognition within you that this phase
1026600	1030040	has served its purpose and there is something else I need to do with my life.
1030400	1033080	And by the way, you could go back to that same phase, right?
1033240	1035800	You could become a CEO again at a point in time.
1036320	1038760	And it's that seasonal view of life.
1039120	1044040	And a big part of flow, you know, where I'm trying to live my life now
1044280	1047160	is to recognize those seasons, is to say, look,
1047800	1052040	I had an amazing, amazing woman for 27 years, right?
1052320	1054160	And I had a family.
1054160	1055040	I have been there.
1055040	1055880	I have done that.
1055880	1057200	I've enjoyed it tremendously.
1057200	1061880	It enriched my life, but it left gaps behind that need to be fulfilled
1061880	1064920	or completed with other phases and other seasons.
1065800	1070680	And I think the game here is to be able to allow yourself
1071320	1075320	to rather than plan and say my safety, my security, my everything
1075560	1079240	to allow yourself to sit back and say, where is what's life saying?
1079720	1081760	Is life hinting that I should be in London?
1082440	1083640	I can be in London.
1083640	1084920	Let me be in London.
1084920	1086120	Right? Let's see.
1086120	1089120	Maybe at the end of that season, nothing's going to happen.
1089120	1091400	You're going to go like, oh, it was just very good coffee
1091400	1093560	and a conversation with Steven, right?
1094040	1097520	And and it could be that, you know, oh, my God, it was the best coffee
1097520	1100720	of my life and the best conversation I ever had, right?
1101080	1104800	And and I think that wisdom, if you want,
1106280	1108240	it depends on if you're spiritual or not.
1108240	1112120	If if you believe that there is a part to you that is not physical,
1112560	1116240	call it consciousness or call it a soul, if you're spiritual.
1117080	1122600	That part is senses, things that are a little bit beyond the limitations
1122600	1127080	of the physical day, it might sense, you know, a need for the rest of being
1127080	1131000	someone else somewhere that may benefit from my presence in London
1131000	1135560	or maybe a need in within me to get a little bit of rain,
1135560	1136760	which I hadn't seen for a while.
1136760	1137960	I don't know, right?
1138000	1142920	And if the way the way that other part of you communicates to you
1142920	1148440	is through intuition, it cannot plant a text message in your head
1148440	1151560	and say, by the way, by the four teens, you need to be in London.
1151880	1157800	It just gets you gives you that feeling of something is missing from here
1157800	1160800	and something needs to be attended to there.
1161200	1163200	Do you want to investigate?
1163200	1167240	And I found from the spiritual teachers and happiness teachers
1167240	1170200	and actually business teachers that I worked with in my life
1170840	1174400	that those who are able who are able to go like, let me find out.
1175000	1176400	OK, let me find out.
1176400	1178440	Let me check this out.
1178440	1184400	Normally, stumble upon some of the biggest changes to our lives,
1184400	1186440	all of us, not just their lives.
1187040	1189960	And, you know, and it's it's quite interesting because
1191080	1193840	if you really look back at your life, really,
1194320	1197440	most of the events that actually shaped you,
1197440	1200560	that actually changed your lives were not planned at all.
1201120	1204200	You know, there probably were always those surprises
1204200	1207560	and often were the surprises you didn't want. OK.
1207760	1211440	And then somehow you go through with them and you end up in a place
1211440	1214240	that suddenly you recognize and go like, ah,
1214880	1217280	that's why I've been walking for the last 14 days.
1217720	1221640	And by the way, the game in my view, I say life is a quest.
1221640	1223280	It's not a journey. OK.
1223280	1225480	And the difference between a journey and a quest
1225480	1228840	is when you're on a journey, you've sort of plotted your path.
1229120	1230640	OK, I'm going to take that flight.
1230640	1231680	I'm going to go to this place.
1231680	1233160	I'm going to stay in that hotel.
1233160	1234360	It's a journey. Right.
1234360	1236920	And it will eventually end up in a destination. Right.
1237280	1238440	A quest is very different.
1238440	1241880	A quest is Christopher Columbus taking a crew on a ship
1242200	1245440	and in the middle of the, you know, fog,
1246320	1249800	not knowing where the new world really is. OK.
1250080	1251080	That's a quest.
1251080	1253440	You know, you don't really know where the destination is.
1254080	1256720	You're basically taking a couple of steps forward
1257080	1259520	and then stopping and then looking at the fog
1259520	1262040	and then assessing and then reflecting and then saying,
1262640	1266000	maybe I should take a step left and then you take one step left.
1266000	1268240	And then you say, OK, how does it feel now?
1268240	1271160	Do I want to go forward again or do I want to go one step back?
1271480	1273640	And by the way, there's absolutely nothing wrong
1273640	1276400	with taking two steps forward, assessing going to the left.
1276400	1279640	And then saying, left wasn't what I was supposed to do.
1279920	1283480	I'll go back and take a step to the right and see what happens.
1284640	1288280	But like Christopher Columbus, you you set off on your quest.
1288720	1293120	I'm sure as Christopher Columbus did for a reason,
1293440	1296400	you wouldn't load up the ship and put all those men on the ship
1296400	1297160	and get a boat.
1297160	1299680	And there has to be some kind of inspiration
1299680	1301440	or some kind of reason why you set off.
1301960	1304520	That's the question I want to ask, but I was also compelled by
1304520	1306440	you said you were in the relationship for twenty eight years
1306440	1309120	and eventually there's something missing.
1310240	1313840	Yeah, there's always there is always something missing.
1314240	1316080	What was what was missing?
1316080	1318520	So let's talk about the big picture first,
1318520	1321040	because I think people need to understand that there's nothing
1321040	1322800	wrong with having anything missing.
1322800	1326040	OK, but we are a very complex being
1327040	1331280	that is made up of so many emotions and so many reflections
1331280	1336160	and so many traumas and so many stories and backgrounds and desires.
1336880	1342960	And we live in a very, very, very, very unsimplifiable world.
1343400	1348560	OK, and yet we try to simplify it rather than try to enjoy it fully.
1349360	1354280	OK, when you when they tell you sweet and sour chicken in a Chinese restaurant,
1355400	1357960	it's not just a little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour.
1357960	1361080	There is a ton of flavor happening within all of this.
1361120	1364040	OK, there is there are layers of complexity
1364040	1365920	that creates a life that's worth living.
1366640	1369400	And for all for every one of us, it's that attachment.
1370240	1372640	It's the attachment of but I like this.
1372640	1377400	I don't want to change this that deprives us of all of the other flavors, right?
1377680	1381480	Nibel and I, I believe Nibel made me my my ex-wife.
1381480	1385680	She we met when she was 18 in university.
1386200	1387480	We fell in love madly.
1387480	1391040	We got married the day she finished university.
1392040	1397840	You know, we spent 22 years together with our beautiful children.
1397840	1400680	And then life changed context.
1400880	1402760	The context changed.
1402760	1404960	Ali left our world, my son.
1404960	1409480	And when Ali left our world, I hit the pedals and went double speed.
1410040	1414400	When Ali left our left our world, Nibel, on the other hand, looked at her life
1414400	1417920	and said, for the first time, I can now focus on me.
1418560	1424720	My my children left one went to university in Canada, and Ali left the world
1424720	1426200	to his next journey.
1426200	1430840	And, you know, simply she she looked at herself and said, OK, it's my time.
1431640	1434560	I'm not going to define my life by you anymore.
1434560	1438360	I can't travel the world with you because of your passion
1438360	1443640	and your mission and what you've now assigned yourself as the new task.
1443880	1447480	I'm going to find what I want to do with my life.
1447520	1449280	And I think that's wonderful.
1449280	1452720	If you if you ask me, that's definitely what everyone should do.
1453240	1457480	Now, with that contradiction, we became further and further apart.
1457480	1463040	Remember, love and relationships are not ever taken for granted.
1463040	1465240	I always say this openly.
1465240	1467240	I fell in love with Nibel six times.
1467880	1471640	OK, I fell in love with that cute girl that I met in university.
1471880	1475800	Then I fell in love again when she became my wife, because when you're
1476480	1479040	your girlfriend and your wife, you're two different people.
1479040	1481640	And by the way, I was her boyfriend and her husband.
1481840	1483800	These are two different people, too.
1483800	1487400	And now suddenly we're left with those boyfriend, girlfriend gone
1487600	1491280	and the husband and wife looking at each other and saying, where's my sweetheart?
1491840	1495640	Right. And then suddenly, you know, most people would get into that stage
1495640	1501040	in one of those constant changes and and say, hey, you know, I don't like this.
1501240	1503960	I want my sweetheart back, you know, it's an attachment.
1504840	1509720	Or you can go like, OK, the sweetheart is gone, but oh, my God, this one is so cute.
1510240	1514360	Right. And when when you actually see it that way, you fall in love again
1514360	1515880	with a totally different person.
1515880	1519880	And then again and then again, I believe I counted six times.
1520120	1524840	OK. And then eventually, when we wanted to to have our different
1525760	1531080	focuses in life, I would call that falling in love again, but slightly differently
1531520	1538400	because you see that the thing that we mess in life is we define love.
1540080	1544680	Love is too big, if you ask me, as a concept to fit within romance.
1545240	1550040	OK, we've we've narrowed love down to that story that Hollywood told us,
1550520	1552640	which is love is just romance.
1552720	1556600	OK, it's a it's a romantic relationship between two people.
1556840	1559960	It has intimacy in it and it has to be this and that.
1559960	1562040	And they have to live that way. OK.
1562520	1566880	The truth is, no, I believe there are 20 ways two partners can enjoy
1566880	1569840	and benefit from the company of each other and grow together,
1570800	1572720	two of which are sex and intimacy.
1572720	1575560	And we've defined love
1575560	1578320	per as per sex and intimacy. OK.
1578560	1583080	So if she if she's not your woman, as in as in your sleeping together,
1583400	1585720	does that end the love in any way? OK.
1586520	1589120	You know, as a matter of fact, if if it ends the love,
1589120	1592040	then it was never love if you really think about it.
1592640	1598520	And so we we define our our relationships that way.
1598520	1601280	And I think that's a recipe for disappointment,
1601320	1606800	because in reality, every every relationship will always go through those changes.
1606800	1610600	There will be times where sex won't be great and there will be other times
1610600	1612600	when your spiritual connection is at its best.
1612600	1617720	And, you know, it really is entirely around again, the layers and the flavors
1617720	1621720	and how you can choose each one of those and embrace it and grow it
1621720	1627800	and and and make it a prominent and live it as much as you can with that person.
1628480	1631600	And yeah, if if one of them ends,
1632000	1635520	my feeling is that the rest should not end, the rest should grow.
1636280	1639240	You more than anyone now, after those 20 plus years of being
1639240	1642880	in a committed relationship will understand the value of that committed relationship
1642880	1647920	and the place that it would I'm presuming add value to your life now.
1647960	1651680	But I guess there's an equation you're doing about what you would
1651880	1653280	what would come at the expense of that.
1653280	1655720	And it sounds like from my perspective,
1655720	1658440	the thing that would come at the expense of that is your mission,
1658680	1664160	your freedom, which you are also spending some time to really indulge in.
1665240	1668640	No, I'm as I think I think we all make those choices all the time.
1668640	1673320	It just suddenly becomes quite contentious when it's about love and relationship.
1673600	1675400	OK, but you know what?
1675400	1678240	You know, I left an apartment that I enjoyed
1679000	1681680	because I needed to do something else, right?
1681880	1687320	I am here in London, where when I could be in Silicon Valley, for example,
1687320	1689840	because they wanted me to talk about innovation there,
1689840	1694520	because I need to be in London because I want my next book to succeed, right?
1694800	1700440	So so we we all make those, you know, choices all the time.
1701120	1706040	And and life, sadly, is a question of compromise,
1706520	1712360	because, you know, you you you often say that the best of both worlds doesn't happen.
1712440	1714600	You can't you cannot have best of both worlds.
1714600	1720760	You can you can either say I'm living fully as my number one priority to achieve a
1720760	1724880	and I'll achieve as much as I can of B, as long as it doesn't contradict A.
1725200	1729560	Or you can say I'll go for B and, you know, I'll sacrifice a bit of A for that.
1729880	1733560	Right. And and it's interesting because most people,
1733560	1737600	especially the romantics, will say, how can you sacrifice love?
1738040	1739640	You know, love is the most important.
1739640	1741800	No, a billion happy is more important than love,
1742520	1744840	in all honesty, for me, in my to my personal love.
1745120	1750600	OK, because in my capacity to to feel love for a billion people,
1750920	1757600	OK, and and actually try and dedicate my life to as many as I can reach with that.
1758240	1763800	I tend to believe that's that prioritizing my own comforts and my own life
1763800	1770360	and my own settlement, if you want, being settled is selfish, to be honest.
1770520	1771800	It's it's a different phase.
1771800	1776200	It hopefully will happen in two, three years time, but it's not the phase now.
1776520	1778800	It's not the right time for it at all. OK.
1778960	1782120	And yes, I wish I could get get get A and B.
1782280	1785120	And maybe I'll stumble upon that wonderful woman
1785480	1789880	that is completely aligned and, you know, spends that that my trips with me
1789880	1792320	and, you know, supports this.
1792320	1794080	And if I do, that's amazing.
1794080	1796480	But if I don't, what would I prioritize?
1796480	1798440	It's life is a question of choices.
1799400	1803920	You could be doing anything with your time, you know, you're you're clearly
1803920	1806840	someone that is being very intentional about the use of your time
1806840	1811480	and making sure that every hour of your time is allocated towards
1811960	1815800	what you want, whether that is playing video games, whether it is writing a book.
1816320	1819760	So why did you choose to write a book called That Little Voice in Your Head?
1821160	1825080	I feel that the top three reasons for unhappiness in the world
1826280	1832040	without competition beyond that, like they are by far bigger than all of the others are
1832560	1835640	ego, lack of self-love.
1835640	1840000	And actually, in order, it would be lack of self-love, ego and that little voice
1840000	1841840	in your head. OK.
1841840	1846640	And the little voice in your head, as I as I say at the beginning of the book,
1847000	1852520	that I would dare say that there has never been a moment in your life
1852880	1857840	where any event had the power to make you unhappy
1858200	1860560	until you turned it into a thought. OK.
1860800	1862880	So so anything could happen.
1863320	1866520	It's the story you tell yourself about it that makes you unhappy.
1866520	1869120	It's not the event. It's the story. Right.
1869560	1875440	And so if my if I'm true to my commitment to try and make the world happier,
1875680	1879600	then I need to talk about those three topics in three different books
1879600	1882240	if you if you want, or maybe some content of some form.
1882560	1883720	But but that's not the point.
1883720	1887640	The point is what's tagged, what's what struck me and really, really puzzled me
1888000	1891640	was that I realized when I wrote Scary Smart
1892080	1894680	and, you know, Scary Smart was entirely about technology
1894680	1896840	and where technology is going and so on.
1896840	1902280	I realized that we humans have the ultimate technology in our heads,
1902560	1907200	a brain that is so sophisticated, so capable of doing things that are
1907560	1911400	really, really beyond the capacity of any supercomputer still today.
1912120	1916360	And yet we know how to use our smartphones and our devices
1916360	1918680	better than we know how to use that brain.
1918680	1921560	Most people get trained on how to use Excel,
1921920	1926800	but they never really get trained on how to streamline the thoughts in their head.
1927280	1931520	OK. And and that appeared to me to be a very interesting
1931760	1933360	engineering problem.
1933360	1937960	And so the idea was to create that analogy between neuroscience and computer science.
1938320	1942600	So the book in my mind was if I can show people that those brains,
1942600	1946640	the neuroscience of them is is actually similar, very analogous
1946640	1949280	to computer science and the devices you have in your hand,
1949720	1952160	because people already know how to use those devices,
1952160	1956800	then that knowledge would allow them to use the brain as good as they use the devices.
1957760	1962160	The basics here, which is the title of the first chapter of your book.
1962760	1966320	And it feels like the first chapter really kind of introduces some of the
1966600	1969400	inspiration behind why you wrote the book.
1969400	1972800	You talk a lot about your wife and the illusions that you live under.
1974000	1976360	What are the illusions that you you live under?
1977320	1979080	Or you lived under?
1979080	1982000	Again, let's think about the bigger picture first.
1982000	1985720	Everything that we have, you haven't visited and investigated
1986520	1989840	and arrived at a competent, confident
1991080	1993160	conviction that this is your own view.
1994200	1997800	Is probably an illusion, OK, which is quite striking
1998200	2003080	because for a man like me, who spends a lot of his time reflecting,
2004040	2006840	we're surrounded, we're submerged in illusions.
2007120	2011720	OK, everything from the value of, you know, a branded bag
2011720	2015520	all the way to, you know, what the TV is telling us,
2015520	2018280	what the government is supposed to do and all of that stuff.
2019880	2024160	Unless you've reflected on it and said, OK, I'm being told this,
2024480	2028640	I'm, you know, behaving this way, which might be contradicting
2028760	2032800	what I've been told, but I'm feeling that way, which might be a third contradiction.
2032800	2034560	And where is my reality?
2034560	2036440	It's safe to assume that this was an illusion.
2036440	2040800	So a big part of that little voice in your head is an admission
2040800	2044240	of all of the mistakes I made using that machine in my life.
2044240	2048320	Or not all, but many, not even many, but many mistakes
2048320	2050800	that I've made using this machine, not all of them.
2050800	2053120	There are many more mistakes.
2053120	2057640	One, I think the biggest of them was a conviction in my early years
2057920	2059680	that my kids were a burden.
2059680	2065240	My family was a responsibility, OK, which does happen when they come
2065240	2066560	to life when you're very young.
2066560	2069080	I mean, I had Ali when I was 25.
2069080	2076440	I was just turned 26 and and and you know, I got married when I was 25.
2076440	2080400	So basically you start to feel responsible.
2080440	2082600	You start to prioritize work.
2082600	2086800	You start to go out in that treadmill, you know, the hedonic treadmill
2086800	2089160	and just run, run, run, run, run, run, OK.
2089440	2093560	And the pressure that you that you put on yourself when you do that
2094000	2099200	makes you start to think, OK, they are the reason why I'm working so hard.
2099520	2102080	They are the reason why I'm stressed. OK.
2102400	2105120	When in reality, if you had asked them, they would have said,
2105120	2107320	Papa, just come play with us, right?
2107480	2109760	We don't want more than what we have.
2110120	2115000	It's me losing context and running like crazy that made me think that way.
2115400	2118640	And the basics of the challenges we have with our brains
2119360	2122800	is that we believe what our brains tell us. OK.
2122960	2127640	So when my brain tell me they are the the the burden, they are the challenge.
2127640	2129880	My whole being responds to that.
2129920	2132600	My whole being starts to behave that way. OK.
2133200	2138000	And and I think what the reality that we miss when we do those things
2138320	2141160	becomes what you have seen in that.
2141160	2143040	If you if you like the movie Inception,
2144160	2148080	you know, when she when his wife had that
2149520	2153320	thought, you know, we're waiting for a train or train, you know,
2153320	2157320	basically that kept playing in her head over and over and over
2157560	2161280	that convinced her that this is not the real world, that they are in a dream
2161280	2163200	and that the way to go out of it is to die.
2163600	2165920	That actually led her to committing suicide.
2166280	2170280	And and and, you know, big opening of the movie that my favorite movie line
2170280	2173560	of all time is what is the most resilient parasite.
2173920	2176760	OK. And the most resilient parasite is not a bacteria.
2176760	2178320	It's not a virus.
2178320	2182000	It is a thought that you implant deep in your brain
2182320	2185440	and believe in it over and over and over through your life.
2186360	2189000	And it shapes everything, shapes everything.
2189000	2193520	Interestingly, without you even knowing why you're doing what you're doing
2193520	2196640	is because because of that thought, because of that belief,
2196640	2201160	because of that ideology and people do the weirdest things.
2201160	2204880	I have a very, very dear friend who's a brilliant engineer,
2204880	2208600	brilliant engineer who had that thought in his head.
2209720	2215560	He's now in his early 60s, but that's if I tell my ideas to a businessman,
2216160	2217760	he's going to steal it.
2217760	2222160	So every startup he ever attempted, he wanted to be the engineer and the CEO.
2222760	2225520	OK. And as a result, everything he started failed,
2225920	2230120	even though the ideas and the engineering, the the rigor was incredible.
2230760	2233360	But he just couldn't get that idea out of his mind.
2233520	2238080	And you can go all the way to people who have ideas that lead to wars
2238080	2240800	or to destruction or to terrorist acts or whatever.
2241040	2244520	It's just one idea seeded deep enough in our head
2244880	2251400	that really leads us to become who we are and digging out that idea and finding it.
2251440	2253000	That's the basic.
2253000	2257360	The basic is to find those thoughts and how you can deal with them
2257360	2261360	so that you eradicate them so that you can actually live through to who you are,
2261680	2263720	not the thoughts that have been implanted in your brain.
2264400	2266200	And how does one go about even knowing
2267240	2270840	where to start that search for those sort of limiting or imprisoning thoughts
2270840	2274640	that have become the satellite navigation of our lives?
2275040	2277720	It is it's a moment of truth.
2277720	2279160	It's a moment of honesty.
2279200	2281800	You know, I think you started with that very.
2282680	2286400	I can't believe I spoke about that about the very personal question
2286400	2288840	about my relationship choices, right?
2289160	2290640	But that's a moment of truth.
2290640	2293120	It's not that I don't want someone in my life,
2293400	2296280	but it's that if that's someone contradicts priority A,
2296640	2299400	then priority A is actually what I stand for, right?
2299720	2303600	And you get those by comparing what you're thinking.
2304880	2307840	To what you actually do and what you actually feel.
2308480	2312440	And it's a very interesting exercise if you're coherent in something.
2312440	2315560	If you say I am vegan, for example, OK,
2315920	2318640	if if you identify yourself as vegan,
2319240	2322200	but you crave eating animal protein
2322760	2326920	and you feel that you're pressured, then you're not a vegan.
2327520	2329800	OK, you could be a striving vegan.
2329800	2331080	You're trying to be vegan.
2331080	2333160	You could be an ideologist vegan.
2333160	2336040	You want you believe in the ideology of veganism,
2336040	2339200	but you're not don't call yourself I am a vegan.
2339320	2343640	OK, you can then change that thought and say, I want to be vegan.
2344440	2346800	OK, that's a different thought than I am vegan.
2347440	2350800	And you can apply that to everything, to every part of your life.
2351040	2353160	I am in that partnership.
2353160	2355360	I love her and I want to stay with her forever.
2356080	2360680	But I'm looking at every other woman and I feel that I am in jail.
2361080	2364800	OK, great. Have that conversation with yourself.
2365040	2366760	Have that conversation with yourself
2366760	2369000	because what you're feeling is contradicting.
2369280	2372120	What you're doing is contradicting what you're thinking.
2372440	2374440	So much of my life is filled with contradicting.
2374600	2375840	Absolutely.
2375840	2376800	What does that say?
2376800	2380480	So I'm thinking about, you know, I say that I want to be in a committed relationship,
2380840	2386640	but then I what I do is work all the time
2386840	2390160	and want to work all the time and choose work all the time.
2391720	2393920	So what does that mean?
2393920	2394920	What does that mean?
2394920	2396520	You can tell me on camera.
2396520	2397840	I'm not going to cry.
2397840	2401360	It is. It's it's really it is look, you're not alone.
2401360	2403160	All of us are and it's not one topic.
2403160	2404760	It's on every topic. OK.
2404760	2408520	So so there are, as I always talk about, there are three compartments in our brains.
2408880	2411720	OK, one compartment is what I call compartment one,
2411720	2414400	which are things that are true and we know are true. OK.
2415040	2418440	The other is compartment three, which are things that are that are not true
2418440	2419720	and we know they're not true.
2419720	2422560	OK, and the majority of what's happening inside us
2423040	2426400	is what I call compartment two, which are things that are undecided.
2426800	2430080	We either don't know them or we know that they're not aligned,
2430080	2432320	but we can live with them for now. We don't prioritize them.
2433560	2435920	What matters is not solving them.
2435920	2438080	What matters is marking them as compartment two.
2438600	2442000	If you mark them as compartment two in your head, you go like, OK, hold on.
2442320	2444040	This topic is unresolved.
2444040	2447040	It's not within my priority today, but I need to come back to that topic
2447320	2450640	just as just like my choice of relationships. Right.
2451080	2454280	You know, it takes a long time and a lot of experimenting
2454280	2458320	after my separation with my with my wife to try and get to a point
2458320	2462400	where I actually know that I'm going to put in the time
2462400	2465000	and investigate where I am in life.
2465000	2468840	During throughout that time, I acknowledge to myself and I say,
2468840	2471680	this is compartment two. I don't know what I want. I don't.
2472040	2475280	Right. And the point is so many of those exist.
2475680	2480000	If you live assuming that it's compartment one, you're completely messed up.
2480640	2484040	Right. Because your actions are not matching your your your feelings
2484040	2486240	and your feelings are not matching your thoughts.
2486240	2488240	OK, you're not you're not complete.
2488360	2491160	You're not full. You're not settled.
2491160	2495720	You know, we, you know, that that idea of equilibrium.
2496520	2498640	Most people, the easiest way to imagine it
2499520	2502040	visually is to imagine a pendulum. Right.
2502440	2505920	If your life is in equilibrium, it's in total balance.
2506760	2509160	That total balance is the point at which
2510760	2512720	minimal effort is needed to live.
2513600	2515560	If you're in balance, you're not struggling.
2515560	2518000	OK, just like the pendulum, the pendulum, when it's at
2518000	2521840	at its equilibrium point, you literally need zero force
2521840	2523960	to keep it in the equilibrium point forever.
2523960	2525680	You don't have to apply any force to it.
2525680	2527960	You want to push it a little bit to the right.
2527960	2531520	You have to apply a force and keep that force for as long as you
2531520	2533480	you wanted to stay within that place.
2533480	2536760	And that's what we do with our lives all the time, that our nature,
2536760	2541080	our balance, our equilibrium is not exactly how we're living.
2541320	2545280	And so we're constantly applying effort, constantly trying to be in a place
2546000	2548680	that is not our natural place to be.
2549000	2551080	We want to be there, so we apply the effort.
2551200	2552760	Is there anything wrong with that?
2552760	2555280	Absolutely not, because life is cyclical. OK.
2555480	2557720	And life is all compromises as we start.
2557720	2562520	But the trick is to say, when I am in that place,
2563480	2566920	I am aware that this place is not my natural tendency.
2567200	2571920	And I am OK with that because that place gives me a B and C.
2571920	2574000	There is a utility to that place.
2574000	2578200	At the same time, I want to tell myself openly
2578400	2581400	that I'm heading from that place to that point of equilibrium.
2582480	2585280	Could that could be by saying, in the next seven years,
2585280	2587640	I'm not going to do anything about it, but in seven years time,
2587800	2589600	I'm going to start to head in that equilibrium.
2589600	2591520	Or you could say, I'm going to take a step every day
2591520	2593480	and for the next seven years, whichever way you want.
2593960	2597920	And or you, by the way, or you can also tell yourself, I don't care.
2598520	2601480	I know it's not my equilibrium, but I'm going to do it anyway,
2601480	2602920	because that's what I believe in.
2602920	2605160	I think that's very much at the state I'm in.
2605960	2608840	If you ask me, I'd like to be in, you know,
2609000	2612080	50 percent of the year doing absolutely nothing, OK,
2612240	2616160	with someone I absolutely love with a very simple life.
2616400	2618280	But that's not my life every day.
2618280	2621080	And I know that to be true, and I will do it for a while to go.
2621600	2625280	You know, because I have, I have assigned myself something
2625280	2628280	that I believe requires that effort.
2628920	2631760	OK, the other thing that humans do, most of us,
2632120	2636360	is we leave a lot of pendulums out of equilibrium.
2636520	2639640	So so it's actually quite easy to tell yourself, look,
2639640	2642320	my number one pendulum is my work.
2642680	2644800	OK, I'm going to put that in equilibrium.
2645480	2648400	Then my second, you know,
2649280	2652520	pendulum in importance is relationship or reverse them if you want.
2652840	2654240	The third is my impact.
2654240	2656080	The fourth is my friendships.
2656080	2658120	The fifth is my health and so on.
2658120	2662360	And then the game is if you want your work to actually benefit,
2662760	2666680	put the others in equilibrium, OK, or acknowledge to yourself
2666680	2668680	that they're not, but don't complain about it.
2668680	2670560	Don't feel bad about it. OK.
2670560	2674400	And if you do that, you manage to then simply focus yourself
2674400	2676120	on the one that is your most priority.
2676120	2680400	And then life is in an interesting way, linear that way in physics.
2680400	2682880	It's basically it's instead of the parallel processing
2682880	2685040	of trying to fix all of them at the same time.
2685280	2688520	You're simply saying, I'm going to process them in series.
2688520	2691440	I'm going to fix this work element pendulum first.
2691920	2693520	And when it's done, I'll fix the next one.
2693520	2695200	And then when it's done, I'll fix the next one.
2695200	2696520	And it's a constant journey.
2696520	2697760	So you're not alone.
2697760	2700720	I'm exactly like you constantly, constantly searching
2700720	2704920	and constantly reflecting and investigating and finding that equilibrium.
2705600	2708800	Just going back to something you said there about what you'd probably want.
2709000	2711560	Is it a case that you don't believe you could live a life
2711560	2716400	where you have priority of your mission, one one billion happy?
2717600	2723320	And a partner who is is not impeding on the mission?
2723800	2726400	No, absolutely not. I believe it's 100 percent possible.
2726400	2728680	Just not met the person yet. Absolutely. OK.
2728680	2732360	OK. The economics of love and romance are quite shocking.
2732360	2734640	Most people don't understand how that works.
2734640	2738160	You know, if you have if you have one requirement in the if you have zero
2738160	2740440	requirements in the person that you need in your life,
2741720	2743440	walk out of your door.
2743440	2746040	The first person that you meet is that person, right?
2746040	2751000	Because you have zero of anything that this person is is OK for you.
2751480	2755800	If you have one requirement and and say one of every ten people
2755960	2759960	in the world has that requirement, OK, bring that. Yeah.
2760560	2764480	Yeah, or something deeper, you know, let's start, you know, I am straight.
2764480	2768640	So I need a woman, OK, that by definition removes 50 percent of the population.
2768720	2770040	Yeah. OK.
2770040	2775200	I am, you know, I need a certain age bracket in my life that by by by itself
2775440	2779000	removes maybe 70 percent of the remaining population and so on.
2779240	2782040	So every layer that you add to your requirements,
2782560	2785400	sadly, follows the n squared problem. OK.
2785600	2791080	So the n squared problem is if you're looking for a person with one criteria
2792080	2794440	and one in every 10 persons have that.
2796160	2800320	If you add another layer of criteria, it's not one in 20.
2800560	2801920	It's one in 100.
2801920	2804360	If you add a third criteria, it's one in a thousand.
2804760	2807600	If you add a third or fourth criteria, it's one in 10,000.
2807960	2811040	Right. So it's it's constantly 10 to the power of. Right.
2811440	2816600	Now, if if you take anything that you want, I'm I'm looking for someone,
2816600	2819600	for example, supportive of my mission and free to travel.
2820400	2828080	Whatever that is, if if that person is, you know, is described by six criteria,
2828520	2831560	you're now talking about one in 100,000.
2831720	2833760	Do they exist? Absolutely.
2833760	2835920	Absolutely. 100 percent.
2835920	2839680	Do I have the time to spend looking for one in 100,000?
2840320	2842040	I don't. I do.
2842040	2843720	But it's not my priority.
2843720	2846000	Do you understand? And we do that with everything in life.
2846160	2848640	You you invest in your six pack.
2849120	2851120	I invest in my little belly, right?
2851520	2858160	Why? Because for you, the ability to prioritize the six pack at your age
2858160	2861960	with your current, you know, lifestyle and so on is actually
2862120	2866640	taking a certain amount of investment from you that's justifiable by the ROI.
2867320	2870360	OK. For me, if I wanted to achieve your six pack,
2870760	2874360	I'd probably take double the time, maybe double the effort, right?
2874560	2877880	And at the same time, I would require a lifetime that has a lifestyle
2877880	2882360	that has a consistency in it, that I may not be able to to achieve now.
2883080	2887400	And you look at it and you go like, damn you, Steve, I want a six pack.
2887720	2891520	But then at the same time, I tell myself, but damn, you know,
2891560	2895640	you're traveling everywhere and you're really, really, really being true to yourself.
2896080	2898160	That's fine. It's a reasonable compromise.
2898800	2903160	So the question just to be very specific, everything exists.
2903720	2907600	But the probabilities of them happening, if I'm the luckiest
2907600	2912560	person on earth, OK, I would walk out of here and she's the first person I meet,
2912840	2917040	right? But if you count that and say, no, reasonable probability,
2917040	2922160	you will say you'd have to encounter 50,000 encounters for that person to show up.
2922400	2925600	If you're unlucky, not unlucky and not lucky, right?
2925720	2927840	Suddenly, it starts to become interesting.
2927840	2931240	You tell yourself, and I know this sounds really weird for the romantics.
2931240	2936600	By the way, I am completely a love, you know, junkie.
2937440	2941840	But but there is a reality to life that sometimes gets you to prioritize things
2941840	2944680	differently. It's really interesting, because I've never had anybody describe it
2944680	2947160	in like a mathematical way before.
2949360	2951600	Yeah, so there is mathematics underlying everything.
2951600	2955600	I mean, think about that idea of one in a hundred thousand, right?
2955640	2958000	The mathematics of that, it's true.
2958040	2962440	When you see the mathematics, it doesn't mean that you have to act in a way
2962440	2966280	that's not human, but it just allows you to understand how the system is working
2966280	2967360	so that you can fit in.
2967360	2971080	So the example I gave is if you're into Shelby Cobra's, right?
2971280	2976080	If you want to sell that one car among a million other cars on a site,
2977120	2981480	that million other that car will have very little chance of being found on a
2981480	2986040	general site. But for the fans of a Shelby Cobra, if you go to a show
2986040	2990600	of Shelby Cobra's, everyone there, 100 percent of the people there are interested
2990600	2994640	in it. OK, so the interesting bit is that you can actually increase your
2994640	2998280	probability of being found quite a lot if you're true to yourself.
2998880	3002560	If you start to advertise yourself exactly who you as who you are and mix
3002560	3006600	with the people that you believe are the people that you want to be with, right?
3007000	3009880	That's the changes the probability drastically.
3010880	3012600	That's so very, very true.
3012600	3013800	That's very, very true.
3013800	3017680	Kind of goes back to what I was saying when I did your podcast about my hairdresser,
3017680	3021600	who was dripping head to toe in material possessions, jewelry.
3021840	3025720	He's advertising himself to a certain audience that he doesn't actually want
3025720	3029320	to attract. And if he is successful in that advertisement,
3029520	3032480	he'd attract something that makes him unhappy and gives him shitty relationships.
3032480	3035040	So you get exactly what you advertise.
3035040	3036200	And that's the interesting thing.
3036200	3040520	You know, if a young lady wants to to find a committed partner,
3040800	3045080	but goes to the pub every Friday evening or the or the club every Friday evening
3045080	3049800	to find that partner, you know, dressed in a certain way, acting in a certain way,
3049920	3052920	she's going to get the person because people are, you know,
3053120	3055240	we don't see beyond what you're advertising.
3055240	3059040	So if that's what you're advertising, the person who's interested in this will show up, right?
3059200	3063960	If you're into tango dancing and you show and you go to a tango class,
3064320	3066240	the people there will be interested in tango.
3066880	3070960	And those people will be the ones that you want to create that relationship with.
3071400	3076680	And yeah, of course, there are not a million people in the city that are interested in tango,
3077040	3080240	but a hundred percent of the people that are in that class are.
3081520	3086280	So I guess you get what your advertisement attracts to be careful, what you advertise.
3086280	3088640	Absolutely. And to advertise correctly,
3088960	3092080	the one thing you need most is to know actually who you are.
3092760	3094520	What are you as a product?
3094520	3095840	Right. Most people don't know that.
3095840	3097400	Absolutely. They don't know who they are.
3097400	3099760	Absolutely. You don't you don't know what who you are.
3100000	3104040	It's multiple rates, multiple, multiple layers of confusion.
3104240	3106240	You don't know who you are.
3106280	3108440	You don't love who you are.
3108440	3112680	You know or love who you are, but you're advertising differently
3112680	3115840	because you think others are more interesting, OK?
3116760	3119040	Or by the way, you don't know what you want.
3119440	3123200	So one of the most eyeopening, one of the chapters.
3123400	3126240	So I'm writing all of this in a book called Finding Love.
3126680	3130160	One of the most interesting chapters is all the models of love, OK?
3130480	3132520	And it's so eyeopening today.
3132520	3136640	Someone in my generation only believed that the only way to be with someone
3136640	3138600	is to have a traditional relationship.
3138600	3142200	Look at all of the models that are available in today's world, you know,
3143440	3145960	all the way from hookups to a lifetime commitment.
3146160	3148280	Everything's available, you know.
3148280	3152000	And and and when you when you when you don't know what you're looking for,
3152000	3153520	then you're advertising wrong.
3153520	3155440	How do you find out what you're looking for, though?
3155440	3157600	Again, it's the triangle.
3157600	3159240	What is what am I thinking?
3159240	3160600	What am I feeling?
3160640	3162720	And what am I doing? OK?
3162880	3168840	So openly, some of us will say, especially if you say, say, for example,
3168840	3172200	you're a woman in her thirties, OK?
3172920	3176880	And you want a child, you want a child, you feel it in you.
3177520	3180920	But you're so, you know, so when you look at the triangle,
3180920	3183240	what you feel is I want a child.
3183240	3187280	But your actions are you're dating people without talking about the topic.
3188000	3190360	OK. And then what you're thinking is maybe
3190360	3194400	if I if I tell them I want a child, they will not want to be with me,
3195080	3198280	which is quite interesting because, yes, if they don't want to be with you
3198280	3200840	when you don't want a child, you don't want to be with them either.
3201360	3204280	Right. And and and accordingly, there is a contradiction.
3204760	3209360	If you want a child, you want to advertise to the world openly to say
3209480	3212200	when you meet someone before you get too involved,
3212440	3214360	you say, what's your position on the topic?
3214960	3218080	Isn't it so funny that our strategy tends to be the total opposite?
3218120	3220520	It's false advertising till we get them
3220520	3223120	because the false advertisement is going to get more people.
3223520	3227680	And then once we've got them, switch up gradually.
3229160	3231720	Well, I don't even know if it's a conscious decision to switch up gradually,
3231720	3233680	but it's an inevitable inevitability.
3233800	3235800	You can't act for years.
3236120	3239360	So eventually, once we've got them on the false advertisement
3239360	3242600	of who we think they wanted us to be, then we'll change.
3242600	3245080	And that's when all the conflict and relationships happen is when
3245200	3247640	absolutely you realize this is not what you wanted at all.
3247720	3250120	Yeah. And you've attracted your.
3251400	3254160	You attracted the wrong person and you're stuck by acting.
3254240	3257560	Yeah. But the more the more interesting part of this is
3258720	3262360	we were prioritizing for the wrong target.
3262640	3265720	So remember, if you really sit with yourself and you say,
3266000	3267680	what do I want from a relationship?
3267680	3271280	I want a committed partner that wants to have a family with me.
3271280	3273000	If you if you come to that choice,
3273960	3276840	you would behave very differently, but interestingly,
3277040	3281680	you have this other conflicting thing of I want reassurance that I'm
3281680	3285560	interested, interesting and people are still, you know, men are still attracted to me.
3285800	3289800	So I'm going to go out dating others who are not just to make sure that when I
3289800	3294880	find this guy, I'll be, I'll be, you know, still, still ready to grab.
3294880	3297800	Right. That doesn't make any sense at all, because by the way,
3297960	3300520	the ones that you're attracting are not a resembling
3301240	3303240	sample to what you're actually looking for.
3304240	3307560	And I know it sounds really weird when you talk about those things in mathematics
3307560	3310720	and probabilities and sets and subsets and so on.
3310960	3313600	But believe it or not, it's entirely.
3314040	3316480	And I know people will hate me when I say this.
3316680	3319480	Dating is an entirely an economics problem.
3319960	3322040	It is economics, economics, meaning
3323080	3328080	that in my days when I met Nibel, she was one of 14
3329080	3332520	friends I knew, OK, economics were very straightforward.
3332520	3335520	Of the 14, Nibel was the one that matched my soul.
3335520	3339800	Most she was the most beautiful woman on the planet for those 14 and everyone else.
3339960	3342560	And so I said, I'm after this one, right?
3343880	3349200	Today, from a supply and demand point of view, you're talking about 14 million
3349200	3353640	people at any point in time that are in a market that is so complex,
3353640	3355800	it's like the Nasdaq market, OK?
3356160	3360680	Literally, products are on the market instantly all the time.
3361480	3363600	And the game is a game of economics.
3363920	3368720	Sadly, the more supply there is, the less the value of a product.
3369960	3373920	Right? So if you simply said to yourself, you know,
3375360	3380720	this camera is now going to be we're going to make 14 million copies
3380720	3384120	of it because it's easier for the factory to make 14 million copies than to make
3384120	3389000	4,000, every one of those copies to manage to sell 14 has to go down in price.
3389720	3394760	OK, because otherwise people only people who can afford the 4,000 would buy
3394760	3396880	and then you'll be left with the other 10.
3396880	3401000	And that's what's happening in the dating and romance market is that there is so
3401000	3405960	much supply out there that nobody values that relationship anymore.
3405960	3408320	Everyone is like, OK, I'll try anyway.
3408320	3411640	You know, it's going to what is it going to take a couple of dates?
3411640	3413160	But then that's not what happened.
3413200	3416280	You go on a couple of dates and then it's a nice case and then you stay a little
3416280	3417520	longer and then you're right.
3417520	3420600	And all of that basically you realize that you've spent seven months of your
3420600	3423760	life to figure out that this person is not interested in children.
3423760	3425440	For example, if we take that example.
3425880	3431240	So what does that mean in real terms for say that I was single and I was looking,
3431920	3434640	right? I'm someone, you know what I'm like.
3434640	3438520	I'm someone that's deeply interested in ideas and thoughts and, you know,
3438960	3441320	self-development and all of these things.
3441320	3442240	You know what I'm interested in.
3442240	3444960	We've talked long enough for you to have at least a gauge of that.
3445360	3448160	Where would I go?
3448560	3450160	Is it a place?
3451360	3453000	And where would I not go?
3453000	3456520	It could be. I mean, if you want to find love, do what you love.
3456960	3458160	Yeah, very straightforward.
3458160	3461600	If you're into reflection and personal development,
3461600	3464840	go to personal development conferences, sit with personal development.
3465200	3468000	People like me, I'll buy you coffee anytime, you know.
3468000	3472280	And or, or, or, you know, go to a retreat, for example,
3472280	3475040	the people that will go to the retreat will be the type of person that you're
3475040	3478920	looking for. I gave that advice to one of my dear friends and colleagues.
3478920	3482640	When I worked at Google, she was part of Google in Poland.
3482880	3486240	And I told her that I said, if you want to find love, do what you love.
3486240	3488760	So she went and asked herself, what do I love?
3488760	3493120	I love tango went and started that, you know, attended the tango class,
3493400	3496560	ended up marrying the the the instructor, right?
3496840	3499600	It's simply you want someone that matches you.
3499720	3502440	Go to the places where those things happen.
3502440	3504440	Those places could be physical places.
3504440	3508200	They could be online. OK, they could be serendipitous
3508200	3509760	because you're searching for those things.
3509760	3512320	But just know what you stand for.
3513120	3516080	I'm, you know, not a party animal.
3516400	3519520	I'm never going to find my match in a party.
3520640	3523600	So so do I go to parties? No, I don't really.
3523640	3526560	I mean, I go sometimes when there is a reason to go.
3526560	3528920	But otherwise, no, that's not how I spend my time.
3529520	3533920	Quick one, we bring in eight people a month to watch these conversations live
3534000	3537280	here in the studio when we're here in the UK and when we're in LA.
3537760	3540680	If you want to be one of those people, all you've got to do is hit subscribe.
3541240	3545920	You asked me a question about money, and then you said, you know,
3545920	3547080	what does money mean to me?
3547080	3549360	And then when I asked you, you said you think you've come to learn
3549360	3551400	that you think money is one of your illusions.
3552200	3553200	What did you mean by that?
3553680	3556240	Money is an illusion at every, every level.
3557680	3558520	Money doesn't exist.
3558520	3562000	You and I know that anyone who understands fractional reserve
3562000	3566080	and how money is printed and generated money does not even exist.
3566080	3570040	You walk into a bank and you ask for a 50,000 pounds loan for a car.
3570160	3574640	And they literally write the numbers five, zero, zero, zero, zero in a spreadsheet
3574640	3578760	and money comes out of nowhere that money never existed before you borrowed it.
3579160	3582760	OK, and will only exist when you work your backside off to pay it back.
3583200	3589600	Right. And interestingly, that in that illusion was created to make our
3589600	3594040	lives easier, and then it ended up making our life a lot more difficult.
3594360	3596360	Now, why?
3596520	3602200	Because most of us are so chasing the revenue side of money without
3602200	3604320	a full understanding of the cost side of money.
3605800	3611400	Let me try to explain for you to get a job in London that pays
3611400	3616800	you 100,000 pounds just for simplification of the mathematics.
3617120	3621640	You have to live in London, which costs you 70,000 pounds.
3622000	3625680	For example, I don't know London very well, but let's say these are the numbers.
3626240	3630600	But on top of the 70,000 pounds, it also causes costs you stress, your stress.
3631160	3635000	It also costs you being far away from your mom if your mom lives elsewhere.
3635360	3639240	It costs you, you know, your time, which is your most valuable resource.
3639280	3643240	The only thing you really have in your life is your time, and it costs you
3643240	3644960	so many other things, right?
3645240	3653000	And so most people don't understand the cost benefit relationship to start.
3653280	3658280	Now, you take that and then you add a Louis Vuitton bag or a fancy car.
3658600	3663160	And suddenly your money is not even going as far as it could, because you
3663160	3667680	could get yourself a bag that is beautiful and everything for 100 pounds.
3667680	3671880	But then you choose to buy one for several thousand pounds, and then you
3671880	3676280	have to work harder, which makes you may pay more costs and that and the cycle
3676280	3678160	becomes even more vicious, right?
3678560	3680360	You continue further than that.
3680360	3685920	And you start to say, so I save some of that, some of my money in the future,
3685920	3687880	but your savings are suffering inflation.
3688200	3691720	So you save a thousand pounds, they become 900, they become 800.
3691960	3695480	When in reality, by the way, you've saved the thousand pounds, when you could
3695480	3699360	have borrowed them by entering some numbers in a spreadsheet.
3699560	3701960	The entire recipe around that story is wrong.
3702160	3707760	Everything around money is not what we believe it is, which basically makes
3707760	3708680	it an illusion.
3708920	3713240	Now, the biggest part of that illusion, believe it or not, is, and I know you
3713240	3715880	have money in the bank, is that you have nothing.
3716360	3717640	I don't know if you realize that.
3717640	3722600	Most people don't understand that if I have 100 pounds in the bank, I literally
3722600	3723440	have nothing.
3723720	3724360	I have nothing.
3724360	3728960	The bank has my 100 pounds and the bank can decide whatever they want to do if
3728960	3730640	they wanted to take it away from me.
3730920	3731240	Okay.
3731520	3736640	And it is only my money when I choose to buy an iPhone or something with it.
3737520	3740480	For that one instant, that money is mine.
3741120	3743360	And then once I get the iPhone, it's not mine anymore.
3743360	3745880	I now have the iPhone, right?
3746240	3750520	You basically assign that money that is never yours.
3750520	3754920	It's the banks until the minute you spend it to spending it on things that most
3754920	3756600	of us don't ever, ever interact with.
3756880	3760840	I mean, look at your own home, anyone listening to us and how many things you
3760840	3763880	have in that home that you've not ever used ever.
3764400	3767880	You know, you, you saw that pair of shoes in the window and you were like, oh,
3767880	3772160	my God, I have to have them spent several hundred pounds on them or several
3772160	3776440	tens of pounds on them and then ended up taking them home, never, ever putting
3776440	3777680	them on, right?
3777960	3782840	Now, all of that waste along the way, the cost of earning the money, the things
3782840	3786720	that you spend it on, the actual value of the thing, the things that you spend
3786720	3792280	it on, basically tells you that there is one truth to money, which is I have
3792280	3796840	basic needs, I have basic needs and my basic needs are to be reasonably
3796840	3801800	covered, reasonably fed, reasonably safe and so on and so forth.
3802680	3807200	And in, in, in, in the Islamic culture, we call this risk, which is different
3807200	3807800	than income.
3808400	3811400	Risk is not what, how much money you earn.
3811880	3814000	It's the good that that money brings you.
3814600	3816920	It's, did you eat a meal today?
3817000	3819400	That is actually what you're looking for in life.
3819400	3821080	It's not the money that gets you the meal.
3821600	3821920	Okay.
3822040	3823200	What you're looking for is the meal.
3823720	3826080	Could you actually buy something for your daughter today?
3826240	3827840	The thing is what you're looking for.
3828360	3830960	It's not, it's not the money that got the thing.
3831560	3836480	And if you start to chase that, something very different happens, right?
3836600	3844000	Some, suddenly you start to ask yourself, hmm, is buying that thing worth the 17
3844000	3846560	hours of work I'm going to put in them, right?
3846680	3850400	Is it, which of those, which would I prefer if I gave you the two choices and
3850400	3854560	said, buy this bag or spend 17 hours with your friends.
3855120	3858760	If you see it that way, you may make very different decisions.
3858920	3863560	It leaves us with the very big other illusion, which is, but money is safety.
3863640	3868320	Moe, you know, it's not like I want money because I want more fancy things.
3868480	3871240	I just want to feel safe because the world is unpredictable.
3871720	3875360	Sadly, when the world is unpredictable, money's not going to save you.
3875760	3876040	Okay.
3876240	3879200	And I think my story's been very, very, very big.
3879200	3881160	I open, I had enough money.
3881480	3886080	I, you know, I had enough connections and enough influence.
3886080	3890600	And I, you know, failed to protect my child's life when it was time for him to go.
3891000	3891240	Right.
3891520	3895440	I, you know, I think we know many stories of someone that maybe falls and
3895800	3896640	breaks your back.
3896640	3898080	What will your money do for you?
3898360	3902360	Safety is a much bigger thing than just a little bit of money in the bank.
3902360	3907640	And by the way, safety is an attitude, is an idea to tell yourself, when I need it,
3907640	3908400	I will make it.
3908800	3910320	When I need it, I will have it.
3910680	3914160	Perhaps the answer is I don't need so much of it anyway.
3914440	3920280	And I think, you know, again, like everything in life, you, you want to, to have
3920280	3921720	the skill of making money.
3921720	3926760	Money is, is power, you know, again, when you were speaking on slow mo, you basically
3926760	3933080	said, I love the idea of being able to build this setup for the podcast of spending on
3933080	3934200	my show and so on.
3934200	3935000	That's wonderful.
3935240	3935560	Okay.
3935720	3941680	Money is power, but it's power as long as you own it and it doesn't own you.
3942440	3947160	The minute money owns you and lack of it starts to distract you and looking at how
3947160	3952280	much your, your other friend has and he has a little more than you, you know, hurts your
3952280	3952760	ego.
3952840	3957720	Once it gets into that realm, then money works against you.
3957720	3958440	It doesn't work for you.
3958840	3963480	Do you think it's a noble cause that when I answered that question and I said, for me,
3963480	3966040	money is basically the fuel of my mission.
3966120	3969960	It enables me to, I said, I put on my, my Diary of a Sea Alive tour, it cost me about
3969960	3974360	600,000 pounds to book these 10 venues, to book the London Playdian for three nights,
3974440	3978280	to book this massive choir of, you know, 40 people, to book this big musical.
3978280	3981720	There was about a hundred of us, a hundred people I had to book and pay for to put on
3981720	3982200	that show.
3983080	3988200	At the end of the show, I break even, but without the, that tour, you know, reaches almost
3988200	3994280	20,000 people, it's the most thrilling, fulfilling, biggest honor that I've ever had to be able
3994280	3998040	to do that in front of all of those people and to share that message, which is very much
3998040	3999000	in line with my mission.
4000040	4003480	And I look at money and say, if I, if I didn't have the money, it would have been much,
4003480	4007720	much harder, not impossible, but much, much, much harder to do that.
4008360	4008840	Absolutely.
4009400	4013400	So do you feel like that is a noble relationship with money?
4014840	4021240	Look, we agree on this. Nothing is good or bad, nothing is right or wrong.
4021240	4025400	Everything is both right and wrong and everything is, can be both good and bad.
4025400	4027560	It depends on what you want to do with it.
4027560	4032280	And one of the messages I constantly tell everyone in the world is absolutely become
4032280	4038200	successful, become powerful, become rich, because the biggest problem with our world
4038200	4042440	is that the most successful, most powerful and the richest are the worst of us.
4043080	4048200	Okay. And I don't generalize and say that's the truth, but it's actually easier to make
4048200	4051880	money if you break some rules than if it, then it is, if you're ethical.
4051880	4058920	And so as a result of that, a good chunk of the big money in the world is not super ethical.
4058920	4064280	Right. And if, if I have more money, I can fuel my one billion happy mission.
4064280	4065960	And that's a good thing for the world.
4065960	4069640	That's by the way, owning money, not letting it own you. Right.
4069640	4074680	So if I, if I can get to the point where I make it and actually give it to one billion happy,
4074680	4078040	then that's amazing. If I get to the point where I make it and then suddenly go like,
4078040	4082920	oh, let's wait a little bit, grow it a tiny bit and then give it to one billion happy,
4082920	4087080	then I'm not doing the right thing. Having said that, you know, of course,
4087160	4095800	you know how I admire you and respect you. This is your zoom lens of the world. Okay.
4095800	4102600	For someone else, four pounds, some sticky paper and a couple of scissors and spending an hour
4102600	4109080	with her daughter doing something beautiful. Okay. Is as impactful, maybe even more impactful than
4109080	4115080	the entire show, because that one daughter with the sticky paper and scissors might end up becoming
4115080	4121640	one of the most pronounced artists in the world, prominent enough to change the world with four,
4121640	4128440	four pounds, scissors and a piece of paper. Right. Now we, we somehow, especially those of us like
4128440	4135480	you and I, who, who had experiences in life where they put effort and the effort rewarded them. Okay.
4135480	4142360	We think that we are the ones that are changing the world or making a difference or no, we're not.
4142360	4149080	Okay. The reality is we need, we need to understand that again, I, you know, I admire you and I know
4149080	4154280	you'll, you'll not feel upset, but half of what you know is wrong. Half of what I know is wrong.
4155000	4159480	Absolutely. Right. And it's, it's just an attempt. It's just an attempt with, you know,
4160440	4167640	whether that attempt, Steve is, is, is an attempt because of money or is it, it's an attempt
4167640	4174760	because you just spend time with your driver talking about something or, you know, you were
4174760	4182760	telling the story, all of those things. I think the game is I'm going to do the best that I can
4184200	4192120	to acquire the resources that I'm good at acquiring to direct them in the investments that I have
4192120	4199960	accessible to me. Okay. If, if you are a cashier, you know, at a supermarket and you're making enough
4199960	4207080	money to spend wonderful time with your daughter to, you know, to, to do a bit of art, then that in
4207080	4213480	itself is a form of contribution that changes the world. And you'll never know that one daughter
4213480	4221000	might cure cancer. It's interesting. I was, I was bouncing around in my head back and forward
4221000	4228360	about like, about the role that a lot of my, I don't know, maybe my traumas and securities are
4228360	4232440	playing in driving my decision making around these things. Obviously, putting on a big show,
4232440	4236680	you have lots of people there that are clapping for you. There's lots of admiration. It's very like,
4236680	4241320	it's very massaging of the ego. So one might say to themselves, well, I'm serving the world when,
4241320	4245400	in fact, it's more of a selfish thing. And you're like, you know what I mean? It's that, that constant
4245400	4250360	battle I find in my life where the greatest service that I do to others is also woven in there with
4250360	4255080	loads of like, absolutely insecurities. So even this podcast, like, I'm sure the people listening,
4255080	4258840	enjoy listening, I'm sure they get a tremendous amount of value from it. But there is still
4258840	4265160	this guy in me that is so desperate to be number one and to win, right? And it's almost, I'm almost
4265160	4271800	at peace with the conflicting forces because I know, I think as we sit here, the podcast is
4271800	4276360	number one in the Apple store, pretty sure of that. And I know it wouldn't have been and it
4276360	4281320	wouldn't have reached as many people if I wasn't someone who was desperate to be the best.
4281880	4286360	But I also know that this is, that pursuit of being the best is also quite an ugly one,
4286360	4290440	because it comes, means you end up sacrificing a bunch of things in the pursuit of being the best
4290440	4295560	that might make you more fulfilled. So it's this weird, it's this weird balancing act of
4295560	4300520	contradiction and confusion and not really knowing why, why I'm doing what I'm doing at like the
4300520	4305400	real fundamental level. You can broadcast what people want you to hear. Oh, I'm doing it because
4305400	4311320	I want to help others. But I actually know that there's, it's a recipe, a concoction of many
4311320	4317320	conflicting forces and pretty much all my success has been this sort of recipe of conflicting forces.
4318280	4326200	Well, I mean, what I admire most about you is you're able to see and say this, okay? If you're,
4326200	4332680	you know, if you've achieved total enlightenment, you'll be gone, okay? None of us is ever there.
4332680	4338600	The challenge is this. Some people are completely egocentric and not even aware.
4339240	4348760	Yeah. Okay. Some people are struggling, okay? And some people are, you know, doing the best they
4348760	4353960	can, understanding, as I say, that in compartment two, there is something and they're okay with it,
4353960	4361000	okay? And the trick is you're always trying to move a little bit higher. And that higher,
4361000	4365640	you know, and that little voice in your head, I follow that model. And it sounds simple,
4365640	4370680	but it's actually quite interesting. I call it be learned do, right? Be learned do is
4370680	4376840	most of us in our life, we look at problems and we say, here's the solution, right? That's,
4376840	4383640	we're mostly almost anchored in doing. Doing again is a very masculine trait, okay?
4384520	4390600	Interestingly, a lot of doing is as harmful as it is, as it is beneficial.
4391880	4398280	You know, the good doing is a doing that is informed by a form of being and by a certain
4398280	4404200	level of skill that comes from learning. Okay? So when I, what I normally try to follow in the
4404200	4409640	entire manual to your brain is to say, okay, for everything that we will find, we will have to be,
4409640	4416840	then learned and do, okay? So you're very good. One of the people I respect most about that idea
4416840	4422120	of being, you look at yourself and you say, oh, I am doing that because of that insecurity that
4422120	4426520	happened when I was this. That's an amazing achievement in itself. That's a third of the way,
4426520	4431640	right? I know what's what I need to work on. And I think it's the challenging third of the way,
4431640	4436920	believe it or not, because we humans are very good at solving the problems when they're defined.
4436920	4440680	If you make it your priority, you're going to learn the skill. Everyone is capable of doing
4440680	4446840	that. Again, I speak a lot about neuroplasticity and how learning works. But once you've learned,
4446840	4451960	once you've realized what it is, is that you need to work on, you're going to learn the skill and
4451960	4455800	then you're going to start practicing and doing it the right way. The challenge is when you don't
4455800	4461800	know what you're working on. Now I'll say this openly. What you're doing to the world with your
4461800	4466440	awareness that part of it is ego driven, of course, part of what I do is ego driven. I tell the whole
4466440	4472520	world that I'm an engineer. Being an engineer is an ego. Why do I tell the whole world that there
4472520	4477480	is a utility to that ego? The utility is, by the way, guys, if you want to read my work or listen
4477480	4482200	to my analysis, it's going to appear a little over engineered, even when I talk about something as
4482200	4488280	beautiful as love and relationships. It will have that engineering element to it, which is not entirely
4488280	4494200	myself, by the way. It's just the way I present myself to the world, because others don't present
4494280	4500440	themselves that way. So I'm differentiating. Yeah, I wish I didn't have to use that ego.
4500440	4505960	You may wish that you stood on stage and didn't feel the rush of people clapping and saying,
4505960	4512280	well done, you're amazing. But by the way, if you're delivering to thousands and hundreds of
4512280	4517080	thousands of people on your podcast, great, you're so much better than those who are not.
4517640	4522200	And now the fact that you have your awareness makes you even better than those who are,
4522200	4525960	but are not aware of their parts that they need to work on.
4527000	4533400	Yeah, it's challenging. I was bouncing around in my head on that, because if I cared a ton about
4534600	4541080	the clapping part, I probably would be trying to convince everybody that I'm perfect a bit more
4541080	4546200	than I do. It's just an interesting battle of ego. But I also think that, I think I said this
4546200	4552040	on your podcast, is it's okay to be a contradiction. And I think in all facets of my life, when I look
4552120	4557240	at my decisions, what I want, what I say, what I do, and there's so many interwoven contradictions,
4557240	4563480	and it's so remarkable that the contradictions often lead me to success in the things that
4563480	4568600	I'm aiming for. It's not making sense. I think the whole idea is that we're all contradictions.
4568600	4573960	The only difference is you're aware. Yeah. Do you realize that? So the thing, I think you
4573960	4580200	should be the example for everyone to recognize that we're all contradictions. It's everyone,
4580200	4585560	every single one listening to us. Life is a contradiction. This is why one of my favorite
4585560	4591960	feminine qualities is the ability to embrace paradoxes. And the reality is, the only way you
4591960	4598120	can almost like at a quantum level, solve life better, is if you're able to embrace two extremes
4598120	4602360	and say, both are true, and I'm going to include both of them in my lifestyle, both of them in my
4602360	4607480	decision making, because both of them are me. It goes back to your point about the equilibrium
4607480	4612440	as well, that the reason why the pendulum sits in the middle is because it's at balance with
4612440	4618440	two opposing forces. Gravity has balanced it on that particular point, but when you apply one
4618440	4622200	force to either side, it will swing into a direction. Maybe balance is being a perfect
4622200	4628120	contradiction. Absolutely. Balance is always a contradiction. Balance is that ability to take
4628120	4633640	all of those forces. Now, you have to imagine, I separated them into six forces and said your
4633640	4638360	health, six pendulums, that your health is one and your love is one and this is one,
4638360	4644200	but the reality is you're one pendulum. So many forces are applying from so many directions.
4644200	4648920	And the contradiction is not just, if I work harder, I'll make more money or less money.
4648920	4653160	If I work harder, I will also be a little more stressed. If I work harder, my relationships
4653160	4658280	will be affected. And each of those, eventually you're ending up in one place that is very,
4658280	4666120	very complex. We're a very complex being as a human and we're dealing with an even more complex
4666120	4672760	life. And the thing is we need to take it easy on ourselves and say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure
4672760	4678600	out my relationship bit in a while. I now need to figure out my one billion mission and a little
4678600	4683240	more or I need to figure out this more or I need to do that more. And it's okay to say it's never
4683240	4689880	perfect. It's absolutely never perfect. The game is if I told myself, no, no, hold on. I've done the
4689880	4696440	thinking and this situation is my perfect situation. I'm doomed because I'm basically telling myself,
4696440	4701880	keep that pendulum in this place and defend it with your life. Okay. Put all of the effort in the
4701880	4706440	world when that pendulum is in the wrong place. It's not in balance. In your book as well,
4706440	4709960	that little voice in your head, you describe how like all thoughts aren't really made equally and
4709960	4714760	that there's different sort of categories of thoughts and some of them like observation are
4715880	4720200	closer to the truth than others. What are the different categories of thoughts that we have in
4720200	4729960	our head? The first challenge with thought is that we create our thoughts from the wrong ingredients.
4730840	4737720	So if I gave you bad vegetables and told you to make the best salad recipe on the planet,
4737720	4746440	it's still going to taste bad. And the reality is we have only one proper ingredient
4747400	4752840	that we should allow into our brain so that we create proper accurate thoughts. And that
4752840	4760840	that one ingredient is actual observation. Okay. Observation is I look at this glass and I say
4760920	4769720	this glass is 37% full. Okay. That is an observation. Yeah, you can, we can debate in physics if it is
4769720	4776760	or if it isn't and so on. But in, you know, the typical way we look at life, this is 37% full.
4777320	4785000	Right. My brain would then tell me, if I used that information, I may ask someone in the team
4785000	4789880	and say, guys, can I please another have another a little bit more water? My brain would then tell
4789880	4796360	me, no, no, hold on, it's tapered. Okay. It is not, you know, the same from the top as it is
4796360	4801160	in the from the bottom. No, you've calculated wrong. No, you're getting old and your mathematics
4801160	4808200	are not accurate anymore. You're, you know, you can go into so many different inputs into your
4808200	4815880	thoughts that would debate that fact that it is more empty than it is full. Okay. You take that
4815880	4820840	and you find you can find them in categories. One of them is conditioning. Believe it or not,
4821480	4827960	one of the most frequently used sources for creating your thoughts is not what's happening
4827960	4834040	in the world at all. It's your conditioning and your conditioning creates thoughts within you
4834040	4840120	that are not, not at all a reality. I speak about any experience where I was dating a
4840120	4845560	Buddhist girl who was very calm and wonderful in every possible way. And, you know, two of our
4845560	4852360	best friends were a couple and they had a big fight before coming to our place. And so anyway,
4852360	4857000	the, the girl basically said, no, I need to talk to you about something and, you know,
4857000	4861560	want to ask your view. And she sat next to me, very, very, very good friends, all the four of
4861560	4866280	us for a very long time. And so she hugged me. She sat on, you know, put her head on my shoulder
4866280	4873320	and cried. Okay. My girlfriend came in and said, excuse my English. She said, take your hands off
4873320	4882360	my man, you be. Okay. And, you know, I was like, whoa, she's one of the calmest people I know.
4882360	4889480	What happened here? And what happened was she had been cheated on before. Right. By the best,
4889480	4895960	by her best girlfriend and, you know, a friend of the person she was dating at the time.
4896520	4902200	And the input into her head that said, this girl was sort of doing something inappropriate with
4902200	4907720	me was coming from the fact that she had that conditioning in her. It wasn't the event itself,
4907720	4915000	the event was highly exaggerated by the conditioning. So we're unable to find that when we, when we
4915000	4921400	look at our, at the makeup of our thoughts. The second, I, and the third are recycled emotions
4921400	4927800	and recycled thoughts. Okay. So we recycle so much of what our parents told us. Recycling
4927800	4932680	of a memory or the recycling of a thought, you know, your, your friend tells you, Hey,
4932680	4937560	by the way, all men are cheats. And you recycle that thought. Okay. All men are cheats. All men
4937560	4944120	are cheats. And then, you know, you end up making decisions based on that. The fourth, and I think
4944120	4950520	the most, the biggest challenge we have in the modern world is the mainstream media, basically,
4950520	4957640	the, the, the, the large advertising media story that we're told that is a ton of input,
4957640	4963240	whether it's movies, it's social media, it's, you know, tweets or, or reels or, or, or if,
4963240	4969880	or if it's the BBC or channel for playing the news. And the, the, the reality of what we're
4969880	4977880	getting is we're getting a highly biased section of life. Why? Because of the human
4977960	4983400	nature, which is around negativity bias, humans are only paying attention most of the time to
4983400	4989320	the negative side of life. Those all, all of those outlets are constantly using that negativity
4989320	4993960	bias to broadcast to you. Well, it's actually not the full truth, but the negative side of the truth.
4994520	5000760	So, you know, the, the channel will not talk about a child that went out with his mother and
5000760	5006280	played on the swings. They'll talk about a child that fell in a well and we have that disaster.
5006280	5011640	And, and, you know, a social media person, I always say, you're a balanced one, but a social
5011640	5017160	media influencer will always show this, the pictures that appear to be more than what they're
5017160	5021880	living and there will be filters and so on. And that negativity that you feel as a result
5021880	5028120	is not a reflection of the actual truth of life. It's a reflection of the subset of knowledge that
5028120	5034120	you get from life. Now, what does that mean? I mean, I'm trying to say, if I give you your phone
5034200	5040920	and your phone has a perfect phone app on it, if you type the wrong number, you're going to call
5040920	5046280	the wrong person. Nothing wrong with the phone, nothing wrong with the app. Okay. In your brain,
5046280	5051000	if you put in the wrong data all the time, if you allow all of that negativity coming from the media
5051000	5055960	and the news, if you allow the conditioning to be part of your, of your decision making criteria,
5055960	5060680	the recycled thoughts and emotions, then you're eventually going to end up calling the wrong
5060680	5067240	action. Okay. And I think the reality is that at that very fundamental level, unless you start to
5067240	5074440	really iron out all of the wrong inputs, there is very little possibility that you're actually
5074440	5078920	going to get to the accurate output. You were talking about all these types and categories
5078920	5083000	of thoughts and all of these inputs. One of the inputs is the mainstream media. Some of the
5083000	5088040	inputs come from, I guess, our conditioning and experiences. And when you talked about the glass
5088040	5094440	and your observation that the glass is 37% full, how do you know that that's not your conditioning
5094440	5097880	speaking? How do you know that that's not the influence of the mainstream media? How do you
5097880	5101880	know that there's not a second layer that's running over your, what you're seeing called your
5101880	5106920	perception that is influencing that. I'm trying to figure out for people listening how they can
5106920	5112760	distinguish between a thought that is truth and observation and worth pursuing and incredible
5112760	5122120	and one that is conditioned or your spot on. Okay. This is 37% full is my brain's calculation.
5122120	5127880	Let's use a simpler example. You have an argument with your partner. The next morning you wake up
5127880	5133400	and say, doesn't love me or she doesn't love me anymore. Right. The argument is what you observed
5133400	5139000	that there was a bit of attention that those specific words were said. That's observation.
5139000	5145480	Right. Observation is literally like narration of the situation. That's it. And if you can stick
5145480	5151640	down, you can take yourself all the way down to narration, you're done. Okay. I observe that you're
5151640	5158200	sitting cross hand, you know, crossing your arms. That's an observation. My brain could take that
5158200	5165560	observation and say he's bored. He's protective. He is angry with me. We've been talking too much,
5165560	5171640	whatever. Okay. I can translate it into a million things in my head. None of them is true.
5172840	5178760	The only truth is Steven's sitting in front of me and he's crossing his arms. If I accept
5178760	5184440	that to be the truth, then my brain suggests those other things. I can then ask and I say,
5184440	5188360	have we been talking too long, Steve? Do you want, should we take a break? Can we do this?
5188360	5193560	Can we do that? Right. And then you would say something and that would be my next observation.
5193560	5199720	I can include that in my analysis as another fact. Okay. Without those facts, sadly, what
5199720	5207800	happens to us in life is that we're completely absorbed and consumed by stories that we've built.
5208920	5214840	The story is this is 37% full. That's a story. Believe it or not, even so though it appears to
5214840	5220440	be very accurate, it's a story that includes, hey, by the way, Moe, you're good in geography.
5220440	5224600	You've done your mathematics really well. You've looked at those two. It looks as if you,
5225160	5232520	and you know, it's a big story. And I would tend to tell myself, hey, it's 37. If I complimented
5232520	5237400	this with, you know, I think it's 37. It could be a little more or a little less. That's a much
5237400	5243400	better observation. Right. If I tell myself the story and believe it and start acting upon it,
5244120	5249960	then I'm in a very deep trouble because, because basically my input into my brain
5249960	5253240	is leading me to confusion, certain confusion, because I'm not using the truth.
5254440	5258360	It's that kind of like requirement of having like a looseness of our beliefs as well, isn't it?
5258360	5263400	That just the, that old adage of strong, strong beliefs, but held loosely, whatever it's,
5263400	5268680	that phrase is, I think is the most beautiful thing ever. Yeah. Because what are your beliefs?
5269320	5274360	The beliefs are built within context. Again, I write about this. You know, there was a proverb
5274360	5283000	in Egypt that was developed in the times of poverty and famine. People couldn't have enough. And it
5283000	5290920	was a difficult time. And it basically said, as far as your, extend your legs as far as your
5290920	5298040	blanket goes. Okay. Interesting. When you know, it's basically within context, it invites people
5298040	5302760	to say, Hey, within your, live within your resources, live within your means. It's not an easy time.
5303400	5309080	You take that and take it out of context. And it's widely, widely used in Egypt.
5310200	5314680	You put it out of context and it becomes, you know, a bit of complacence. It's like,
5314680	5320680	don't try to buy a bigger blanket. Just live within your blanket. Okay. And that's a very,
5320680	5325480	very, very different view of looking at something that was meant to be correct.
5325480	5329480	And if you take, when I talk about conditioning, you have so many of those in you.
5330040	5333400	So many, something that your mom said at the point in time, something that your,
5333400	5337320	you know, teacher said at the point in time, something that you did and your friends in
5337320	5342360	school reacted in a way that you didn't want and so on. And all of that is embedded within us.
5342920	5346200	How do I get rid of it? Again, it's very simple. It's that contradiction.
5347000	5353480	It's a very simple contradiction of something is not in balance. I say that I want a Rolls-Royce,
5353480	5360920	but I actually go, you know, go to the Rolls-Royce and then feel that maybe people will think this
5360920	5366840	way about me, maybe, you know, it's going to cost me that much, maybe, right? And, and, and suddenly
5366840	5370440	you go like, okay, so I'm not in balance. Because what I think we're talking about here is like
5370440	5375560	really self-awareness. It's becoming really. But also self-reflection, self-introspection.
5375560	5380280	And that's, that's what I was going to say is I think for most of my life, because of my conditioning,
5380280	5385640	I'm essentially this puppet to my conditioning with all these pieces of string hanging off my
5385640	5390520	limbs. And self-awareness is the process of gradually cutting one of these strings at a time
5390520	5395960	and taking back more control of why I'm doing what I do in my behavior. So that like journaling
5395960	5400920	or producing content, that, that introspection and self-reflection is, has been the cutting of
5400920	5405560	these strings one by one, or you could view it as the, like the turning on of lights in a room.
5405560	5409800	So you can kind of navigate better the world. But until you do that, the lights really are off.
5409800	5415720	And I think that's kind of central term to what we were discussing about how to distinguish conditioning,
5415720	5419960	media influence from truth and your own thoughts.
5420520	5425480	Quick one, as you might know, Crafted are one of the sponsors of this podcast and Crafted are a
5425480	5430280	jewelry brand and they make really meaningful pieces of jewelry. The really wonderful thing
5430280	5435720	about Crafted jewelry is it's super affordable. It looks amazing. The pieces hold tremendous meaning
5435720	5442200	and they are really well made. I think I've worn this piece for almost a year. It hasn't broken,
5442200	5447000	hasn't changed color because it's really, really good quality and it costs roughly
5447080	5450760	50 quid. People will be surprised when they hear that. They'd probably assume that all of my
5450760	5454920	jewelry is like solid gold and costs thousands and thousands of pounds. But what's the point
5454920	5459960	when you can achieve the exact same effect from a piece of jewelry that's high quality and costs
5459960	5465240	50 quid? That's why by Crafted. The other thing that you mentioned in your, in your book, that
5465240	5469480	little voice in your head is this concept of neuroplasticity. It says it on the back of the
5469480	5476600	book. It says, retrain your brain for maximum happiness. This concept that we can retrain
5476600	5484520	our brain physiologically seems like nonsense. I can't change my arm. So when someone, you know,
5484520	5490360	asserts that you can actually change your brain. You can change your arm. I can change my arm?
5490360	5496040	Of course. What, tattoo? No, you work out. That's true. When you work out, you're building
5496040	5501560	muscles in your arms and that same exact process is exactly what happens inside our brains and
5501560	5506200	it's called neuroplasticity. The only difference is that you don't see it. You don't see it visibly.
5506200	5510520	You can see your muscles growing because that's the function that they need, you know, they need
5510520	5516280	to grow to perform. But in your brain, what actually happens again, like computers, it's almost as if
5516280	5523800	you loaded a new piece of software, a new piece of operating system on your brain, literally for
5523800	5529960	every one of us listening, everyone listening to us right now, at the end of this conversation,
5529960	5536520	their brain will be wired differently than when it started. Every single instance of anything that
5536520	5542520	you do literally rewires the hardware itself, the neurons that fire together, wire together.
5542520	5550920	Okay. So imagine the old days of the switchboard. Okay. And, you know, Steve wants to call his mom,
5550920	5557000	so you, you know, crank your phone and the operator says, you know, hi, how can I help you? And you
5557000	5561560	say, can you please connect me to that number? And she would literally take a wire and patch
5561560	5568440	you and your mom's phones together. Okay. After a while, the operator constantly, every time you
5568440	5572680	call you want to, you ask for your mom. So the operator goes like, why am I even wasting my time
5572680	5577880	on this? Let me just patch that wire to his mom all the time. Okay. So that's exactly what happens
5577880	5583080	in our brains. If you, if you perform a single, a certain function, your brain starts to build
5583160	5587640	networks that make that function easier to perform in the future. If you do it one time,
5587640	5592440	it becomes a little easier. If you do it 20 times, it becomes permanent. Okay. And there are, there
5592440	5597800	are tons of studies. If you, if you take a simple task like tapping your finger on the table, okay,
5597800	5604120	and you're requested to do that, say 20 times every hour, after a few days, you'll find that you're
5604120	5608200	so much better at tapping your finger on the table, and you can do it much faster and you can do it
5608200	5613000	consistently and you can do it in the background. Gamers know that for certain. Okay. The problem
5613160	5620280	with neuroplasticity is if you tell your brain to wire for tapping your finger, it will. If you
5620280	5625480	tell it to wire for solving complex mathematical equations, it may take a little longer, but it
5625480	5631160	will. If you tell it to wire for hating people, it will become very good at hating. If you tell it
5631160	5635400	to wire for fearing the end of the world because of what the media is telling you, it's going to
5635400	5640040	become very good at fearing the world. I know some of these people. I know, absolutely. And you
5640040	5645080	don't want them in your life. The challenge of our modern world is that we think that this brain
5645080	5650680	is supposed to be there to make us successful. Yeah. Okay. First of all, it's not the primary
5650680	5655480	function of the brain. The primary function of the brain is to make you safe. Okay. And then
5655480	5661400	the secondary function that we push human as humans to, that brain to do is to invent iPhones and
5661400	5666120	create podcasts and have amazing things. Right. That's a secondary function. But believe it or
5666120	5672680	not, before that secondary function, your, your brain is supposed to make you happy because happy
5672680	5677960	is the ultimate form for you to perform in life. If you're not happy, you're not as effective as
5677960	5684200	you could be at achieving survival. Think about it. If you're grumpy all the time at work,
5684200	5689400	people don't like you. You're not focused. No one wants to help you. You're wasting most of your
5689400	5695160	time, your brain cycles, you know, thinking about the negative. And so you're not innovative or
5695160	5700920	creative and so on and so forth. It degrades your performance. Happy is a better place for
5700920	5705000	you to be at work because it will make your customers want to do business with you. It will
5705000	5709560	make your colleagues want to, you know, to help you out. It will make your boss welcome you in
5709560	5716040	their team and so on and so forth. We are social animals by definition. And we want to have that
5716040	5721240	in our life. And the easiest way to connect and to open up and to discover the world is to be in a
5721240	5726360	happy place. That's a primary function of your brain. It's hard for some people, you know,
5726360	5733480	because we can all think of someone in our lives who has certain wiring, very stubborn wiring,
5734600	5738760	that almost seems impossible to unwire. And I think we all have that ourselves as well,
5738760	5743560	certain wiring in our brains where something happens and our reaction to that thing might be,
5744760	5748680	you know, to catastrophize. It's the end of the world. That's like a, it feels like it's a
5748680	5753960	certain set of wiring where trigger and then the brain goes through the circuitry and it goes
5753960	5761160	catastrophe panic. Yeah. And the answer to that I found was to actually guide that person or yourself,
5761160	5767240	if that's yourself, to the opposite of your wiring. So if my wiring is to look at everything and see
5767240	5772760	what's wrong with it, I should deliberately force my brain to look for what's right with it. So,
5773480	5778360	you know, I, when I was, when I was coming here, it was very busy in the morning. And so I came
5778360	5784280	late, if you remember, and my brain's immediate reaction is, Oh, what's going to happen? I'm
5784280	5790200	going to be late for Steve, right? That's the immediate reaction of a brain because something
5790200	5798040	is wrong. So it looks for what's wrong. I could also say, and what is good about that? What is
5798040	5802600	good about being a little late? You know, he's been recording for the last few days. So it may
5802600	5807000	give him a little bit of extra time. Do you want to know the truth? I was so happy you were late
5807000	5810680	because I was late. Right. So I was doing upstairs reading that I was reading the book and I was
5810680	5816120	thinking, I just hope he's like 15 minutes late. And then I'm like, I really, he's not coming at
5816120	5819400	perfect. So I carried on going and carrying on going and carrying on going. And I just finished
5819400	5824760	as you arrived. Yeah. So it's perfect. You see, that, that is the truth. That's the truth that
5824760	5831000	your brain tries to deny you from seeing. And interestingly, you can't train your brain. So,
5831000	5835560	so basically what you can do is for every thought, for every negative thought that your brain gives
5835560	5841880	you, task it with the task of giving you a positive one or two positive ones, nine, I say, nine.
5841880	5846840	Yeah. Because in reality, if you look at life around you, more than 90% of life is okay for
5846840	5852920	your brain to contribute more than that as negative is not fair. Right. So if literally if your brain
5852920	5859160	says, Hey, by the way, this studio is a little warm. What else is about this to do? My friend,
5859160	5865160	Steve is there. The lighting is perfect. The crew is amazing. You know, the coffee is not that bad.
5865160	5872280	You guys got me honey. I can go on for hours. Right. And the idea is by training your brain
5872280	5877480	to look for that. What are you actually doing? You're firing the neurons together.
5878120	5884360	Gratitude. And exactly your, your, your book basically says it is the answer. The answer is
5884360	5889400	when you find gratitude, what that gratitude journal that you keep that you kept for years
5889400	5894600	every day, what was it telling you? It was training your brain to look for what's right.
5895320	5900120	That your brain every night that you did it was like, okay, it seems he's going to be asking to
5900120	5904840	call his mom a lot more often. It seems he's going to be asking for good things a lot more often.
5904840	5910200	I might as well observe them. I might as well find them. And so yes, you said some people are
5910200	5915080	impossible to rewire. They're impossible to rewire. If they've been practicing a certain
5915080	5920280	wiring for 21 years, it's not going to take 21 seconds to rewire anyone, including me and you.
5921080	5927000	It will take 21 days, let's say, for your brain to recognize I need different wire.
5927000	5932120	And it will take maybe 21 months for your brain to say, and I don't need the old wiring anymore.
5933080	5937720	And the game here is, can you actually keep doing that? Can you keep tapping your finger
5938360	5941160	in a way that trains your brain that this is the wiring that you need?
5942440	5945480	Like, can I keep going to the gym and working on my guns?
5946440	5952840	Believe it or not, the research will tell you that a big part of being athletic is wiring
5952840	5958280	of your brain, not your muscles. For your brain to be able to say, I will go, even if I feel a
5958280	5964440	little tired, I will go, even if I feel a little busy, I will go and I will do the right exercises,
5964440	5969080	even if the last push is a little painful. A lot of people will hear that and go, what's
5969080	5973240	the evidence for this? What's the evidence for neuroplasticity? Is there science? Oh,
5973240	5977960	there is a ton of science behind neuroplasticity. Anything from between neuroplasticity and
5977960	5985880	neurogenesis is when neuroplasticity is to rewire the connections between the neurons.
5985880	5990840	And neurogenesis is to actually create new neurons when, if you're hit with a ball,
5990840	5996360	for example, and part of your brain is damaged, how we can recreate that, right? If you have a stroke
5996360	6002440	and how you recreate that. And ample evidence, one of the very famous stories is Matthew Ricard,
6002440	6007880	when we spoke about him in the beginning. Matthew's brain looks different than the average human
6007880	6014680	brain. His insula is much bigger in relative comparison. His prefrontal cortex is bigger.
6014680	6022360	And it fires more often. It's simply because of the constant neuroplasticity of,
6022360	6028840	I need you to meditate. I need you to stay quiet. I need you. I mean, some of Matthew's journeys
6028840	6032120	would last four years in isolation. You would meditate for four years?
6033240	6039640	Be in isolation in hermitage for four years. And so at that level, your brain starts to do
6039640	6044040	very different things. And by the way, that's not unusual. Many farmers around the world
6044760	6051480	live in isolation for a very long time. Believe it or not, you and I, when we spend a long time
6051480	6057400	on airplanes, I chose a long time ago to not watch a lot of stuff. I maybe watch one movie,
6057400	6063000	but not the entire trip. The other bits of silence, that's actually a form of meditation.
6063720	6069960	And my absolute wonderful friend, Jamie Nelson, the photographer, if you know him,
6069960	6077400	he photographs indigenous tribes. And the way he does it is he would go and spend a few months
6077400	6083800	outside their premises, their village, if you want, in silence. Camping out there,
6083800	6087800	he doesn't speak their language. He's just sitting there waiting for them to accept him.
6087800	6092920	And then he would start to communicate to them in sign language because he doesn't speak their
6092920	6098760	language. And he's one of the wisest people I know. And I said, how did you become this wise?
6098760	6103480	He never studied any of those things. And the reality is, is because he's in constant reflection
6103480	6109240	and meditation. He's sitting out there. And he's spending hours and days in reflection and meditation,
6109240	6114760	right? Because you're sitting alone. All of those things are our habits. And all of us have the
6114760	6122040	chance to do it. You could be on the tube for a commute of 40 minutes a day. And you could be in
6122040	6128680	that commute cursing life. And that's a very good 40 minute exercise to work and another 40
6128680	6134120	minute going back. Or you could be spending the 40 minutes in gratitude. You could be first for,
6134120	6138440	you know, for spending the 40 minutes listening to music, could be doing whatever
6139320	6142600	what you will do for 40 minutes a day will rewire your brain.
6143560	6147560	It really is like a paradigm shifting thought that our brains are in this constant
6147560	6150760	growth and evolution. But when we look at, as you said, my muscles are,
6150760	6155320	my muscles are changing state size, growing more fibers to achieve their objective in a
6155320	6160120	different way. And of course, my brain is as well. And when you think about that, it's really
6160120	6164040	liberating because you realize that you're not stuck with who you are. Absolutely not.
6164040	6168920	It's my friend, Ro, she's, she's got a podcast as well. She, um, one of the smartest people I've
6168920	6173320	ever met. And she, she worked in my company for many years and she got a brain tumor. And
6174120	6178520	she showed me the scan of her brain. They found this golf ball in the middle of her brain.
6179240	6186360	And they removed it. And she showed me those brain scans. And then just months later,
6186360	6193800	the hole is gone. And her brain has regrown that part. And there's no longer a hole in her brain.
6193800	6196840	And that was one of those moments when I go, Oh my God, the brain, like,
6196840	6201960	like everything around us is a living organism that is shaping and evolving based on the
6201960	6207320	inputs and what's happening to it. So let's choose what, which parts of it are we going to
6207320	6211240	grow? I think that's the whole point. And we grow it with our actions and our thoughts.
6211240	6214760	Repetitive actions, thoughts and memories, believe it or not, one of the interesting
6214760	6221000	things is if you take a memory in the past and you think about it over and over and over,
6221000	6225960	it's as if you're hap, it's happening over and over. And you're growing the neurons that are
6225960	6230280	needed or you're growing the connections between the neurons that are needed to trigger that memory.
6231480	6236920	Think happy memories. Okay. If you sit next to your partner and focus on one thing that they
6236920	6240520	do and go like, they say, do this, they do this, they do this, they do this and forget
6240520	6243720	that they do a hundred other things that you love and appreciate,
6244360	6247880	your neuroplasticity is making you completely obsessed about that one thing.
6248520	6252600	And you can only see that one thing. And eventually, you know, some of my friends
6252600	6255480	after a breakup, I go like, what happened then? They'll say one thing.
6256120	6260120	It's like just, they obsess about it over and over because your brain is growing to say,
6260680	6265160	he needs to think about this, right? I'm going to make it easier to think about this.
6265160	6270680	I'm going to make it faster, more accessible. And you'll see it more often, like the red cars.
6271720	6274920	You know, the whole thing about when you, if you buy like a red car, if you buy like a green car,
6274920	6279000	then every car you see will appear to be green. If you buy a Range Rover, every car you see is a
6279000	6283000	Range Rover. Well, this other thing that's really intriguing topic from our last conversation that
6283000	6287640	you mentioned and you mentioned in your new book is this idea of masculinity and femininity.
6287640	6292760	I don't really hear many people talking about this. Yeah. Believe it or not, my, my publisher
6292760	6299560	really was asking, should we include this? It's a contested topic that we want to,
6299560	6305480	but I think it's very important for people to understand. We've mixed up again, a few definitions.
6306120	6313320	Like I said, we mix love and romance, for example, with mixed biology, with gender identity,
6313320	6318440	with sexual preferences, with the reality of what the feminine and the masculine is.
6319080	6326520	The feminine and the masculine in my definition are approaches to life. Okay.
6327480	6335240	Some basic, basically, some people will want to hold their mug this way and others will want to
6335240	6340120	hold it that way. It's an approach to life. No way is right and no way is wrong. Okay.
6341160	6345400	Some of us will want to go through life with creativity and playfulness and,
6345400	6351800	and, you know, intuition. And some of us will want to go with analysis and discipline and
6351800	6355880	linear thinking. It's an approach to life. Neither is right and neither is wrong.
6357000	6363400	There is a high correlation between those who are, I archetypically feminine, if you want,
6364600	6370360	between certain of those qualities, certain, some of those qualities. And, you know, those who are
6370440	6376920	masculine. Again, there is a correlation with some other qualities. So you'd find that a person
6376920	6382520	who's masculine, whether that's a man or a woman, straight or gay, it doesn't matter if, if a person
6382520	6388440	acts in their masculine, they'll tend to be a little more forceful if you think about it. You
6388440	6393720	know, we, the masculine, one of the masculine qualities is strength. Okay. Strength is a,
6393720	6398520	is a quality, whether it's strength in mental strength or physical strength. You want to,
6398520	6404200	you want to use your strengths to move things. Okay. If you're dependent on your masculine side
6404200	6409960	or more associating with your masculine side, you're going to show that. And as I said, statistically
6409960	6415880	correlated, those who have male body parts tend to use that a little more. Reasoning doesn't matter.
6417560	6425400	The problem with our world at the global level and the problem at us, about us as individuals
6425480	6431480	is we've decided that some of those properties or qualities are more valuable to our world than
6431480	6437240	others. Okay. If, if you live in a capitalist world and the capitalist world is entirely about
6437240	6443320	let's produce more, let's make more, let's, you know, do more, we're going to have to borrow more
6443320	6450680	from the doing qualities, which are mostly masculine. Okay. This leads to a world where
6450680	6456520	there is a lot of doing with little being, which basically means it's a world where we do a lot
6456520	6461640	of what we haven't really properly thought about with what, what is not really informed
6461640	6469000	by the realities of who we are being, being that beautiful. Some of the feminine is being
6469000	6476440	the feminine is the masculine does. There is a difference between them. And if you continue
6476440	6482760	to do without actually asking yourself that awareness question of what should I do? You end
6482760	6488680	up doing things like building technologies that make our life slightly better and destroy the
6488680	6494680	planet in the process. Why? Because you haven't really internalized some of the most beautiful
6494680	6502600	feminine qualities of intuition, of creative thinking to look for alternatives, of sensuality
6502600	6508280	to actually sense what is actually happening in the world as a result of your doing of inclusion,
6508840	6513080	you know, to connect to the rest of being to understand that this is not just about us,
6513080	6518360	it's also about the bees and the, and the bears and everyone else and so on. So that world that
6518360	6524120	we've created being hypermasculine is I think the biggest mistake humanity's ever done. And I think
6524120	6530360	humanity's paying for that mistake and will pay more in the future. The savior is for us to stop
6530360	6535960	doing this and to start waking up and saying, hold on, hold on, we need a lot of being before you
6535960	6543720	continue to do. So interesting. It's particularly tricky to understand for men, of course, because
6543720	6547960	men, I mean, there'll be a lot of men again, you know, listening to this podcast now that hear
6547960	6554280	the idea that they need to embrace their feminine, that go, oh gosh, no, it will scare them, it will
6554600	6566760	it will appear to hurt their identity, their sense of self, it'll make them feel weaker,
6566760	6571080	maybe it'll make them feel like they have, they lack purpose if they're not that masculine,
6571080	6575720	because a lot of, a lot of us as men, a lot of our sense of purpose comes from being
6575720	6581240	competitive, from winning, from being strong, apparently, that's how it feels anyway.
6581320	6588360	But what is masculine? I mean, if masculine is to protect, for example, because we have the strength
6590440	6595800	or the masculine has the strength, can that protection happen without empathy?
6597080	6602840	How can you protect if you don't have empathy? You need the feminine empathy to be able to protect.
6603800	6611240	If the masculine is to solve a problem, can you solve the problem without actually identifying
6611240	6617800	the problem? You need intuition and sensuality, and right, if the masculine is about safety and
6617800	6628040	survival, how can you do that without living, without beauty, without, you know, art, all of
6628040	6632360	that is in the feminine. Your comment is right, by the way, but it is not because of any difference
6632360	6637400	between the masculine and the feminine. Men will, will feel less comfortable with this,
6637400	6643160	because women have been sadly pushed to live in their masculine, to survive in this hyper masculine
6643160	6650920	world. I will tell you honestly, and I say that with 100% honesty, you know, honesty of that view,
6650920	6657400	I thought to myself that I was intelligent. Until four and a half years ago, I started to
6657400	6664120	empower my feminine. And I promise you, I'm 10 times more intelligent. I was in my left brain
6664120	6669800	doing all of the analysis, thinking I'm a smart person. But I was doing all of the analysis,
6669800	6674920	all of the wrong inputs. The feminine gives you the inputs. The feminine gives you the,
6674920	6680440	the picture of the reality, the, the inclusion, the big, the big view of life. You can't see that
6680440	6688120	with your narrow-minded, linear brain. And I think the reality is that men who are most successful
6688920	6694760	ever in changing the world, believe it or not, are more in their masculine, feminine than their
6694760	6699720	masculine. Anyone has that, has ever changed the world, has been more in their feminine than
6699720	6705640	your masculine. The example I gave when we spoke about this Steve Jobs. Most people think that
6705640	6711320	Steve Jobs was an amazing successful CEO because he was pushy. He was, you know, a bit obnoxious
6711320	6716440	actually sometimes. Not at all. The reason Steve Jobs was Steve Jobs is because of his feminine
6716440	6723000	qualities, his appreciation of beauty, his appreciation of his creativity, his art, his
6723000	6729400	appreciation of color and shape, his empathy to his user's needs. All of these are what made
6729400	6734520	Steve Jobs that amazing visionary that he was. Obnoxious, by the way, pulled it back a little
6734520	6741720	bit. Gandhi, even though sometimes Gandhi is contested, but Gandhi's success is not in saving
6741720	6746360	his nation through the masculine qualities. If it was the masculine qualities, he would have
6746360	6755560	rallied a billion people to kill the Brits. No, he went into a peaceful, nonviolent, an empathy,
6755560	6760920	an attempt to make things work through communication. All of these are feminine qualities.
6760920	6767240	And somehow we forget in our narrow-minded, hypermasculine world, because we've narrowed
6767240	6772760	everything to dollar signs. So productivity and profit and all of that is dollar signs.
6773320	6778440	And so if that's the target, yes, doing more, producing more, selling more is a good way to
6778440	6785240	go. But the reality is anyone who's ever made the world better, not richer, did it by living in
6785240	6789880	their feminine first. How does one tap into their feminine side? Because I think it's important to
6789880	6795560	also say, because these words have been associated with genders for so long, but a woman or someone
6795560	6800840	that's trans can also be too much in their masculine side and vice versa. A man or someone
6800840	6804840	that's trans would identify as whatever gender can also be too much in their feminine side.
6804840	6811480	But so how does someone tap in more to their feminine self? Is there an activity? Is it just
6811480	6817720	a choice we make? So I think it first requires an exercise of awareness. And actually,
6818520	6823240	in that little voice in your head, in that chapter specifically, I have quite a few
6823240	6829640	awareness exercises. Those awareness exercises start by recognizing what's the feminine.
6829640	6836200	And that's a beautiful exercise, a beautiful exercise that you can actually experience if you
6836920	6844440	invited a couple of friends over that are feminine in their actions most of the time,
6844520	6847960	and a couple of friends that are masculine in their actions all of the time,
6847960	6855560	and allocated proper time for each of them to solve a problem. And observe the behavior. You
6855560	6862600	will find incredible differences between the masculine side, man or woman, it doesn't matter,
6862600	6866840	which will jump in and say, okay, we're going to carry this and then take it 10 steps away from
6866840	6872760	here and then we're going to do this and lift it on the shelf right away. When the feminine will say
6872760	6880920	things like, I feel that this might be a little heavier for John than it is for Jack. And I sense
6880920	6887400	that if we can collaborate around it as one being, we can do this slightly different. Sometimes they'll
6887400	6894680	say things like, why do we have to do this at all? Isn't there a bigger world where maybe we could
6894680	6902200	just keep it here? And by that observation, you'll start to identify the qualities.
6903000	6907400	That's number one. Number two is what I call the appreciation exercise. The appreciation
6907400	6914440	exercise is to flip roles. It's to sit in front of you and say, Steve, how would you solve that
6914440	6920760	problem? And then wait and then tell you, how would you solve it if you were Jackie? And that
6920760	6925640	appreciation exercise basically starts to get you to say, oh my God, there is another way,
6925640	6930280	and that other way is not really me. It's Jackie's way, but it's interesting. And then the third is
6930280	6935240	practice, practice, practice, practice. I tell you openly, I've been empowering my feminine for
6935240	6940520	the last four and a half years, now probably five years. And my biggest exercise for the last two
6940520	6945000	years has been an exercise of flow. We spoke about that at the beginning. The idea of flow
6946040	6953800	is the truth of the feminine. The feminine is life itself. It's flowing, it's gushing across
6953800	6962120	life, across the world, across territories, across times and stories. And we, if we live
6962120	6967720	in our masculine, we go like, nope, not going there. This is not my place. This is my place. I'm
6967720	6974920	going there. And I liken it always with a river, a raging whitewater river. If you put the masculine
6974920	6980920	in the boat, the masculine will take the water, the push it because they want to go there. They
6980920	6986600	want to be right there. The feminine will just hold the arm and basically say, okay,
6987240	6992840	the river is going. I just need to balance it every now and then with one strike, just to
6992840	6998760	stay on track. But it's okay to take a little longer with the river to get to where I want to be.
6999880	7006360	And that massive difference, I'm sorry to say, and I'm someone who associated with the masculine
7006360	7012840	for a very long time is stupid, honestly stupid, because suddenly somehow you realize that life
7012840	7019640	itself is talking to you through your feminine. Life itself is saying, let go. I'll do things.
7020280	7027480	Okay. I'm much more powerful, mighty wheels. I can do stuff. Just let go a little. Just flow with
7027480	7035240	me a little. And if you manage to do that, I chose flow. I think there are several other major
7035240	7039960	pillars of the feminine. One of them is inclusion, as I say. So relating to others, choose that if
7039960	7046040	you want to. One of them is temporal. The masculine is very linear. We associate with the arrow of
7046040	7052440	time where the feminine is very rhythmic. We associate with cycles. And so if you can actually
7052440	7057720	see the difference between them, that's a very interesting exercise. I think creativity and
7057720	7064440	playfulness and breaking the rules sort of, I think paradoxical thinking. To me, these are the
7064440	7072440	big five pillars. Paradoxical thinking is to be able to be humble enough to embrace that two
7072440	7077640	opposing stories are true. Two opposing facts can actually exist together.
7077640	7084840	Interesting. And the role of the masculine. Amazing. The role of the masculine energy.
7085400	7090920	So that's a beautiful question. So the problem we had with the movement of feminism,
7090920	7095080	and I say that with love and respect, is that it demonized the masculine.
7095800	7101400	Now, what needs to be demonized is overdoing the masculine. So strength is good.
7101400	7105880	That is me sometimes, by the way, I have to admit. I definitely overdo the masculine. My
7105880	7108680	girlfriend tells me as well, she goes, she'll literally say it like that though, because she's
7108760	7116440	very in touch with her feminine masculine energy, you'll say you're being too in the masculine
7116440	7123800	right now. Yeah, you know what's one of the most common things I'm told by a woman who's
7124440	7131240	uncomfortable with how her boyfriend's behaving is he's unable to be available emotionally.
7131240	7137400	Yeah, of course, we suffer from that. That's a consequence of toxic. Absolutely. So let's talk
7137400	7142920	about this concept because it's very important. There is no demonizing of a quality. Linear
7142920	7148440	thinking is a wonderful quality. If you can think about a problem linearly, that's a wonderful
7148440	7153720	quality. Overdoing it makes you stubborn. You understand it's the overdoing that's the problem.
7154280	7160120	It's strength. Wonderful. You overdo strength, you become violent. We don't want the overdoing.
7160120	7166600	And what should be demonized is overdoing that. It's overdoing anything, including, by the way,
7166680	7175640	overdoing the feminine. So if you're intuitive, it's a wonderful quality. But if you're too
7175640	7183720	much intuition, you're ignoring linear facts and analysis. If you're, let's say, paradoxical,
7183720	7189720	one of my favorites, as I always say, if you can embrace paradoxes, it's a wonderful quality.
7189720	7194680	It gives you double the amount of information to analyze if you want to do analytical thinking.
7195320	7200920	But if you overdo it, you become a little irrational. If you're disciplined as a masculine
7200920	7208520	quality or not disciplined at all, you become irrational. So overdoing something or underdoing
7208520	7214040	something is not good for any of us. What is the right amount of doing something, by the way?
7214840	7222120	It's how you are configured. So I am much more empathetic and maybe creative
7223000	7234360	and maybe playful than I am paradoxical. I am much more in linear thinking and control
7234360	7241880	than I am in flow. This is why I work on my flow, believe it or not, through neuroplasticity.
7241880	7245960	So what I'm doing with my life now for the last two years is I'm living a life of flow.
7245960	7250520	I'm allowing life to tell me what to do. And instead of my hyper-engineered mathematical
7250520	7255800	brain saying, nope, that's not the way it should be done. I've done my analysis. It's 37%. I'm going
7255800	7262360	to do this. I start to listen and say, hey, I'm going to make the decision of it's 37 or not.
7262360	7266680	In a couple of weeks' time, no harm done if I was wrong, but intuition is beautiful.
7267480	7274200	It's hard to uncondition oneself, but it goes back to this point about rewiring our brains
7274280	7281000	by repetition. And when I think about being more in my feminine energy and my feminine
7281000	7291960	qualities and characteristics, it is achieved by repetition, by opening up to that side of me
7291960	7298520	and spending more time wiring myself to in that way.
7299080	7301800	Which I think is so important. It's funny because I know there'll be a lot of people
7301800	7306040	listening to this that either don't understand or have kind of misunderstood because we're
7306040	7309400	using terms that come with like stigma. When we think of femininity or when we think of
7309400	7315400	masculinity, there's connotations with that. But it's so unbelievably true. And if people
7315400	7319800	have listened to this podcast, they'll know it's true. We had Terry Cruz on here who talked about
7319800	7325160	his masculinity and how that became incredibly harmful to him and destructive and risked his
7325160	7328920	relationships and everything that mattered to him. We had Patrice ever talk about how
7329480	7334440	early experiences that made him lean towards masculinity to help him survive,
7334440	7338600	being abused by his head teacher and watching his brothers and sisters die because of drug
7338600	7345000	addiction on the streets of France, made him turn more to that masculinity as a tool for survival.
7345000	7350920	But then that cost him so dearly because he lived out of balance to one day sat with his partner,
7350920	7353880	she said, there's something not right with you. There's something not right with you.
7353880	7360120	He resisted, he resisted, he resisted, then boom, burst into tears. And that's the moment where he
7360120	7366200	opened up. You see it, you see it and you know it. And by the way, I think in reality,
7366840	7373800	what I'm asking for is now that the world has finally accepted gender diversity and fluidity
7373800	7380840	and so on. I'm asking us not to be more categorized. I'm asking us to stop saying,
7380840	7385400	so I'm category A, category B, category D, because we've just moved from man,
7385400	7392520	woman to more categories now. I'm asking us to say that Moe is unlike anyone else in his mix
7392520	7397720	of masculinity and femininity. I'm 58 percent in certain qualities of the feminine, I'm more than
7397720	7403000	others. And you could be 42 percent in other qualities of the feminine and more than others.
7403000	7407640	And I think the idea is to say each and every one of us is an individual, each and every one of us
7408200	7415960	is a category of their own. Everyone, the only category I fit in is I'm a Moe. That's it. That's
7415960	7421880	my category. And that category includes a beautiful blend of qualities that I can use that are not
7421880	7429080	any better or any worse than anyone else. Those qualities that I blend together might be amazing
7429080	7435160	for this podcast conversation, but horrible at making pizza. I don't know. And I think the
7435160	7441560	reality is if you can become true to that reality of who you are, you'll become the best at that
7441560	7446840	that you're supposed to do in life. And without that balance, you will always, always feel incomplete.
7448440	7456120	Moe, you've written what is another legendary book on a very related but incredibly foundational
7456120	7462360	topic, which is our thoughts and that little voice in our heads. And I think if this conversation is
7462360	7467640	a flavor of the book, then it is, I think in everyone's view that's listening, a must read.
7467640	7472840	You know, it's funny that we, I talk about time being the single currency that we can allocate to
7472840	7479080	determine the outcomes of our lives, but thoughts are the... Interesting. The other thing that is
7479080	7485320	determining how we spend that currency. Yeah, I think, I think time is the rhythm of your song,
7485320	7490280	the song of your life. And thoughts really are the lyrics that you put on top of it. They are the
7490280	7499560	melody. They are, they are, as we spend a minute of our life thinking a certain thought, that minute
7499560	7505480	completely shapes how the song of your life is going to be. It's quite interesting how we ignore that.
7506280	7511320	And so maybe, maybe thoughts are the most important thing. And what this book does is it
7511320	7519960	helps us to adjust the code that runs our brains. At the last line in your book, you say
7520280	7525640	I have one last selfish request. Please find the compassion in your heart to want happiness for
7525640	7532280	my wonderful son, Ali and wise teacher. Send him a prayer, a generous wish that he is happy
7532280	7538760	wherever he is right now. He started it all and he truly was the kindest, happiest human I have
7538760	7546200	ever known. I'll keep working on mine for Ali. Why did you bring that up? We were having an easy
7546200	7557640	conversation. Yeah. So yeah, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for what he taught me. And I wouldn't
7557640	7562280	be here if it wasn't for the example he set. And I wouldn't be here if it hadn't been for him
7563320	7572600	leaving us. And, and I, it's interesting that I told, I may have told you this once before that
7572600	7576440	I write the last sentence of every book before I write the rest of the book.
7578520	7581560	Yeah. And I, I have to say I have been
7582760	7590920	blessed with so many people that send me messages that say I love Ali. And yeah, I feel that
7591880	7598600	if it was that, only that, that I got from the work I've done, then I've lived. It's,
7598600	7603720	there is nothing worse more. And, and, and, but I'm getting so much more. I'm getting so much
7606280	7611960	purpose if you want, but I don't want to be forgetting him in that purpose. I think that's
7611960	7621160	where I stand today that I'm so driven by what I'm trying to achieve. And he's been away for
7621160	7627960	seven years, almost eight years now. So I once again need him to be part of our journey to
7628600	7636200	so yes, please send him a happy wish. The work he's done through you is truly magical.
7636200	7637800	Through you is the exact right word.
7641400	7647720	It's funny when, when we spoke about the idea of control being a masculine quality. Only when I
7647720	7655560	let go, only when I let go that life, whether with him or through him, or maybe he's the boss,
7655560	7661480	I have no idea, but what I've, what I've accomplished was so much more than what I did
7661480	7667000	when I was trying to control everything. And it's because of how he showed me to do, to do this.
7672520	7675640	As you know, we have a closing tradition on this podcast.
7675640	7680280	Oh, I should have prepared for that. Oh my God, I didn't think about this.
7680280	7685000	It doesn't matter. Sometimes, you know, a lack of preparation leads to the best
7685000	7688200	outcomes. Okay, question is,
7691320	7695400	oh, that's not encouraging, Steve.
7695400	7697480	Oh, so I really like this question. It's very fitting, I think.
7698840	7704280	The previous guest wrote for you, what is the greatest wealth in your life?
7706680	7711800	What was not the greatest wealth was all of the money, all of the cars, all of the
7712040	7719320	things. It was a waste of life, I promise you. And I know most people will say, yeah,
7719880	7724200	you say that because you had it. When you have it too, you will feel the same. It was a total
7724200	7733560	waste of life. When you wrote in your book that we come to this life with 500,000 chips, you said,
7733560	7739720	remember, you wrote 80 hour, if you live 80 years, you will have 500,000 hours of active life or
7739720	7745640	something like that. And that this is your wealth. This is what you come to the, to the world with
7745640	7751880	and you place those chips hour by hour. The thought that came to my head was I was born a millionaire.
7751880	7759720	500,000 hours is a lot of hours. But then you turn, you take that cash and you turn it to equity.
7759720	7764280	It's really interesting how you take those hours and by placing those chips,
7765240	7772200	you turn one chip into equity, into something that lasts. And the things that I know last are
7772200	7779320	experiences, knowledge, and love. And I promise you, we will never acquire anything more important
7779320	7786360	than any of those three. In an interesting order, actually, they are love, knowledge, and experiences.
7786600	7794520	So, so what we, what we, what we go through in all of our life is we do tons of things
7795800	7802200	that we think are going to acquire us, one of those three, you know, unhappiness, of course.
7802840	7809320	But, but in reality, it's so much easier to acquire those three directly. The biggest wealth you
7809320	7816440	will ever have are a set of experiences that can't be repeated, some knowledge that can be
7816440	7823640	beneficial for yourself and those around you. And the feeling of love, which I have been overwhelmed
7823640	7830360	with. I mean, I can tell you, I'm the richest man I know by far from the number of kind messages that
7830360	7836360	I get from people saying, you know, we love what you do, we appreciate your, your, your attempt to
7836440	7842040	make the world better. That love, I think, is the biggest wealth I have ever acquired. And I
7842040	7849000	always say, Ali and I am my daughter, definitely have been the biggest love of my life, for sure.
7849000	7857160	And when Ali left to take that life away, I feel that the fairness of life replaced it with the
7857160	7862920	life, with the love of hundreds of thousands of people. Which interestingly, I'm so grateful for,
7862920	7868680	but it's almost exactly barely enough to balance the love that I have for him.
7869640	7874200	And so, yeah, maybe, maybe we should spend our life acquiring more of these.
7877160	7877560	Thank you.
7880360	7885320	I had a few words to say about one of my sponsors on this podcast. For many years, people have been
7885320	7891320	asking for a coffee-flavored hul. And quite recently, hul released the iced coffee caramel
7891320	7896440	flavor of their ready-to-drink huls. And I've just become hooked on it over the last couple
7896440	7901240	of weeks. And now I'm drinking that as well as the protein. Make sure you try the new ready-to-drink
7901240	7906680	flavors. The caramel flavor is amazing. The new banana flavor as well as amazing. And obviously,
7906680	7911640	as I said, the iced coffee caramel flavor has been a real smash hit. So check it out.
7911640	7915240	Let me know what you think on social media. I see all of your tags and Instagram posts and
7915240	7931160	tweets about hul. Back to the podcast.
