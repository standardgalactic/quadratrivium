00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Financial stress on the parents translates into physiological stress in the children.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.360
They didn't inherit anything in terms of a disease.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.040
They're just reacting to the environment.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.560
People call Dr. Gabomate the people whisperer.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.720
Legendary thinker and bestselling author.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.680
He's highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.120
The evidence linking mental illness and childhood adversity

00:23.120 --> 00:26.640
is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.520
Any average physician doesn't hear a word about that.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.480
It's astonishing.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.880
I can give you the example of Donald Trump.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.400
I mean, his father was a psychopath.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.400
You are the enemy of the people.

00:36.400 --> 00:36.880
Go ahead.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.960
For him, these were not choices so much as survival techniques.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.160
And that's the mark of a traumatized child, a denial of reality.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.160
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?

00:49.600 --> 00:51.360
My grandparents were killed in Auschwitz.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.280
And my mother and I barely survived.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.040
And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.120
The sense, I guess, that I'm being rejected and abandoned because I'm not good enough.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.920
How did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.520
Any number of ways.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.320
See, trauma, as I define it, is not about what happens to us.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.680
It's about what happens inside of us as a result of what happens to us.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.400
It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our relationship, our mental health, and so on.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.960
How does one go about correcting that?

01:18.960 --> 01:20.480
It's a multi-layered answer.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.040
First of all.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.520
Before this episode begins, I just want to say a huge thank you to all of our new subscribers.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.000
74% of you that watch this channel didn't subscribe before.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.320
And we're now down to about 71%.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.440
So that helps us in a number of ways that are quite hard to explain.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.720
But simply, the bigger the channel gets, the bigger the guests get.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.640
So if you haven't yet subscribed to The Diary of a CEO,

01:42.640 --> 01:46.320
if I could have any favors from you, if you've ever watched this show and enjoyed it,

01:46.320 --> 01:48.400
it's just to please hit the subscribe button.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.120
Without further ado, I'm Stephen Butler.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.960
And this is The Diary of a CEO.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.560
I hope nobody's listening.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.880
But if you are, then please keep this to yourself.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.840
My dear little man.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.640
Only after many long months do I take it in hand, the pen,

02:11.200 --> 02:15.840
so that I may briefly sketch for you the unspeakable horrors of those times,

02:16.400 --> 02:19.600
the details of which I do not wish you to know.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.960
Those are words that your mother wrote into her diary

02:22.960 --> 02:26.800
in the 1940s during the Holocaust.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.480
She wrote those words in April of 1945,

02:30.480 --> 02:36.640
three months after the Soviet Army expelled the Nazis from Budapest,

02:36.640 --> 02:37.840
which is where we live.

02:37.840 --> 02:42.640
So she's referring to the previous year and the beginning of that year,

02:42.640 --> 02:45.520
late 1944 and early 1945.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.960
And in those diary entries,

02:47.120 --> 02:51.520
she's addressing many of them to you directly as a baby.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.120
She wrote a diary to me directly,

02:54.240 --> 02:58.720
as if it was like a count of my life addressed to me.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.000
You talk so much in all your books and much of your work

03:04.000 --> 03:06.800
about the importance of that early context.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.400
It's really been the centre point of all the writing that I've read recently.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.080
And I know because it's so evident in everything that you've done

03:14.080 --> 03:17.200
that that's been a key, your own early context has been a key inspiration

03:17.200 --> 03:20.320
for why you've taken such an interest in these topics.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.320
What was your early context?

03:22.320 --> 03:25.040
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?

03:26.480 --> 03:32.800
So it's just a fact about human beings that the template that forms us

03:32.800 --> 03:36.160
will affect how we see the world, how we understand ourselves,

03:36.720 --> 03:38.720
how we relate to other people.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.760
And that really template is our earliest months, even in Utah,

03:43.760 --> 03:47.120
already in the womb, we're being affected by the environment,

03:47.120 --> 03:49.920
but certainly in the early years when our brain is being formed

03:49.920 --> 03:52.000
and our personality is taking shape.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.600
And so that forms our worldview.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.920
My worldview was, in my sense of self,

03:59.920 --> 04:03.680
was shaped by the fact that at two months of age,

04:03.680 --> 04:07.040
when I was two months of age, the German army occupied Hungary.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.360
Hungary was the last country in Eastern Europe

04:09.360 --> 04:12.160
where the Jewish population had not been exterminated.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.120
And that was our turn.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.000
The day after the German army marched into Budapest,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.360
which was March the 19th, 1944,

04:19.360 --> 04:23.200
the day after my mother called the pediatrician to say,

04:23.200 --> 04:25.120
would you please come and see Gabor?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.640
Because he's crying all the time.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.240
And the doctor said, of course I'll come,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.400
but all my Jewish babies are crying.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.880
And so that the fact is that when mothers are stressed or in pain,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.280
the infant feels all that and takes it personally,

04:37.280 --> 04:40.720
and it becomes part of their template for how they view the world.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.680
So that was that year, that's when that year began

04:43.680 --> 04:45.520
in which my grandparents were killed in Auschwitz

04:45.520 --> 04:47.600
and my father was away in forced labor.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.280
And my mother and I barely survived.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.520
And it's a story I've told many times,

04:51.520 --> 04:54.560
but that's when my brain is developing

04:54.560 --> 04:56.720
and that's when I'm forming my sense of myself.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.160
And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger

05:02.160 --> 05:04.320
and I don't see her for six weeks.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.280
The sense I get is that I'm not wanted

05:07.280 --> 05:09.280
and I'm being rejected and abandoned

05:09.280 --> 05:10.320
because I'm not good enough.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.440
That's how my life began.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.160
So your mother gives you away for five to six weeks

05:18.800 --> 05:21.040
in order to sort of save you from starvation

05:21.040 --> 05:24.560
in a ghetto that she was going to, right?

05:24.560 --> 05:25.040
That's right.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.440
After your grandparents were killed in Auschwitz by the Nazis,

05:32.400 --> 05:35.200
how do you know in hindsight that that moment

05:35.200 --> 05:38.320
of those six weeks created that sense of abandonment in you?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.440
I wouldn't say just at that one moment.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.160
The children very much view themselves

05:44.880 --> 05:47.600
through their interaction with their parents.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.040
First of all, I had no father because he was gone.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.040
I hadn't seen him, except very briefly

05:55.040 --> 05:57.600
when I was a month old, but there was no father in the picture.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.960
My mother was grief-stricken and terrorized

06:01.600 --> 06:04.880
and full of war and worry about what's going to happen to us

06:04.880 --> 06:08.720
and just the task of surviving each day.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.800
She's not playful with me.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.480
She's not smiling at me very much.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.600
She's worried-looking.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.640
She's stressed-looking.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.560
The infant takes everything personally.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.400
That's just the nature of the infant.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.000
As infants, we're a narcissist.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.360
We think it's all about us.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.800
So when things are great, hey, we're great,

06:28.800 --> 06:30.160
but my mother is unhappy.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.040
It's because she doesn't want me

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
or I can't make her happy or I'm inadequate.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.960
So that separation from my mother certainly set a template

06:40.960 --> 06:44.240
for some of my relationship interactions with my spouse

06:44.880 --> 06:46.080
decades later.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.800
But the sense of not being good enough and being responsible,

06:52.320 --> 06:55.680
that was inculcated in me throughout that whole first year of life.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.040
So much so that in this book, The Myth of Normal,

06:59.040 --> 07:02.560
I actually talk about an experience with the psychedelic mushrooms

07:04.080 --> 07:05.360
with the therapist.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.600
This is not that long ago, seven years ago, maybe,

07:09.600 --> 07:11.280
when I'm at least 70 years old.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.040
I'm in this therapeutic session with the cytocybin, the medicine,

07:17.920 --> 07:18.720
and the therapist.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.560
And I know that I'm 70 years old

07:22.560 --> 07:24.400
and I know this is a therapy session

07:24.400 --> 07:28.080
and I know her name and I know who I am in the world.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.240
But at the same time, I'm experiencing myself

07:30.240 --> 07:32.880
as a one-year-old baby and she's my mother.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.960
And I start crying tears come down on my face

07:36.960 --> 07:39.680
and I say, I'm so sorry I made your life so difficult.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.680
Now that was an unconscious memory

07:43.680 --> 07:46.560
of my sense of myself as a one-year-old

07:46.560 --> 07:49.040
that I made my mother's life so difficult

07:49.040 --> 07:51.120
because that's the way the baby interprets it.

07:52.080 --> 07:56.480
So even if your mother loves you, which mind did, infinitely,

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
not that she always treated me the best way possible,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
but she did love me.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.920
And can you imagine what a great act of love

08:03.920 --> 08:05.680
even giving me to a stranger in the street

08:05.680 --> 08:07.440
would have been for her, you know?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.400
But because of her own unhappiness,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.160
I can only conclude that I'm not good enough.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.560
And it's my fault.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.920
70 years old, having that cytocybin experience

08:20.000 --> 08:21.920
coming to that realization or having that sort of,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.280
having that response to your therapist

08:25.280 --> 08:27.040
where they take the role of your mother

08:27.040 --> 08:28.240
and you're a one-year-old,

08:28.240 --> 08:32.000
how does somebody at 70 years old go about correcting that,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.040
that sort of interpretation you had

08:35.040 --> 08:36.800
of that traumatic early event?

08:38.160 --> 08:40.960
Well, by bringing up to the conscious level,

08:42.640 --> 08:45.600
then when I noticed that sense of guilt or responsibility

08:45.600 --> 08:48.560
in me, I say, oh, that's what it's about.

08:48.640 --> 08:53.120
So it's a meaning to trauma as I define it.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.480
It's not about what happens to us.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.160
It's about what happens inside of us

08:56.160 --> 08:57.600
as a result of what happens to us.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.400
And so the wound in trauma means wound.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.200
So the wound in this case is my sense of deficiency

09:03.200 --> 09:05.600
or not being good enough, not being worthy enough.

09:05.600 --> 09:10.000
Once I realize that, oh, this has got nothing to do with anything,

09:10.640 --> 09:14.800
except this interpretation that I made with my own experience

09:14.800 --> 09:17.280
all those years ago, then when I noticed it,

09:17.280 --> 09:18.640
I can no longer believe it.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.840
I don't have to any longer be a subject

09:22.640 --> 09:25.040
to that interpretation of myself in the world.

09:25.040 --> 09:30.000
So awareness is one step, it's not adequate,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.720
but it's an essential step towards letting go.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.400
That one belief that you weren't good enough,

09:36.400 --> 09:40.480
how did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?

09:41.840 --> 09:46.080
It made me a workaholic physician

09:46.080 --> 09:47.600
because I had to keep proving my worth.

09:48.160 --> 09:48.880
And it doesn't matter.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.600
I don't know if you ever had an addiction,

09:51.600 --> 09:54.800
but the nature of it is that we're trying to get from the outside

09:54.800 --> 09:59.200
something that only can arise and fulfill us from the inside.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.280
So when you're looking at it from the outside,

10:03.280 --> 10:05.600
it's addictive because you get it temporarily,

10:05.600 --> 10:10.720
but then that internal emptiness, that hole, never goes away.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.720
So it has to be filled over and over and over again.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.200
It can only be done so temporarily.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.520
So it becomes runaway addictive.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.440
So then work becomes an addiction

10:19.440 --> 10:21.040
because I keep trying to prove my worth.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.560
And it doesn't matter how many times I may show up

10:26.560 --> 10:29.440
in a positive way at the beginning of someone's life,

10:29.440 --> 10:32.400
at the end of somebody else's life, or anytime in between.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.880
It never fills that emptiness

10:34.880 --> 10:38.000
that my sense of lack of worthiness creates.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.000
So that's one way it shows up.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.400
Another way it shows up is if in my relationship

10:46.160 --> 10:48.720
I don't feel as satisfied,

10:50.240 --> 10:53.600
my wife doesn't please me the way I like her too,

10:56.560 --> 10:57.520
then I get angry.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.360
But why am I getting angry?

11:00.960 --> 11:04.240
I'm getting angry because it's my sense of not being good enough

11:04.240 --> 11:05.760
that's being now revealed.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.640
That it gets uncovered, this self-acquisition.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.920
But I get angry at her because her job

11:14.080 --> 11:15.200
is to make me not feel that.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.840
We're getting into this relationship for all kinds of reasons.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.000
Some of them are conscious, some are not,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.040
some are positive, some are come out of trauma.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.880
And in my case, I want that relationship to prove to me how good I am.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.040
So when it isn't proving that, then I get upset with my partner.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.600
Except the gap is inside me, not inside.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.640
It's not coming from her.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.800
So it shows up, it showed up in my parenting.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.000
It shows up all over the place.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.240
I mean, I think both of those examples sound a lot like me,

11:48.240 --> 11:50.960
especially the first one, the second one as well.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.240
In what sense?

11:52.240 --> 11:55.040
In the sense that I'm definitely a workaholic

11:55.040 --> 11:57.920
and I thought, I think in the earlier phases of my life,

11:57.920 --> 12:01.200
I sacrificed everything in this pursuit of becoming a millionaire

12:01.200 --> 12:04.080
and having all this stuff and really getting this validation

12:04.080 --> 12:06.160
sacrificed meaningful connections,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.080
everything in the pursuit of this one thing.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.920
Well, part of the toxicity of the culture

12:09.920 --> 12:14.160
that I talk about in this book is that it actually rewards

12:14.160 --> 12:22.480
that kind of emptiness or that desperate seeking to fill that emptiness.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.560
Because you know, you get rewarded.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.760
You make a lot of money.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.960
A lot of people admire you.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.160
You get to feel good about yourself.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.600
Mind you, my guess is that good feeling is only temporary.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.120
At least if my example is any guided,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.080
feeling good because somebody from the outside values you

12:40.080 --> 12:43.680
is only a temporary self for the wound that's inside.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.400
But the world actually rewards it.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.560
You know, so your workaholic doctor, great,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.880
you make more money and all these people respect you.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.160
Meanwhile, you're hollowing yourself from the inside

12:54.160 --> 12:55.840
and you're not available for your family.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.040
You know, so that's part of the craziness of this culture.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.000
And it's like the hedonistic treadmill in a sense,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.920
because you just never, enough is never enough, as you say.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.520
So the last achievement needs to be surpassed

13:09.520 --> 13:13.120
by a greater achievement for me to get an applaud or a clap.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.400
I've never really made the connection

13:14.400 --> 13:16.320
that the reason why I'm a workaholic is because

13:16.960 --> 13:19.040
I am trying to prove to the world that I'm enough,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.200
but I think that it's entirely true.

13:21.200 --> 13:21.840
Yeah.

13:21.840 --> 13:27.680
So in your case, like race and class in this society of inequality

13:27.680 --> 13:30.720
are certainly traumatic, potentially traumatic inputs,

13:30.720 --> 13:32.000
as I pointed in this book.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.880
And to the degree that it affects people's physiology.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.960
But also then, I don't know your family version

13:40.960 --> 13:43.040
or what kind of relationship you have with your parents,

13:43.040 --> 13:44.400
but there also may have been a sense,

13:45.360 --> 13:47.600
like I got with my mom for reasons

13:47.600 --> 13:50.480
and for whatever might have happened in your family.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.840
Maybe you got the sense as well

13:51.840 --> 13:55.600
that even in your family version, you weren't good enough somehow.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.360
So my mom would scream at my dad for like seven hours a day.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.640
And my dad would just sit there.

14:00.640 --> 14:00.960
Okay.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.000
And so my early memories of like looking at my mom and dad

14:04.000 --> 14:08.480
are this kind of violent verbally, not like physically,

14:09.120 --> 14:11.360
this incredibly stressful screaming,

14:11.360 --> 14:13.040
one person screaming at the other.

14:13.040 --> 14:13.920
That's what I remember.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.080
But from reading what you've written in this book

14:16.080 --> 14:17.120
and from what you've said now,

14:18.240 --> 14:21.040
I actually might have learned sort of learned

14:21.040 --> 14:23.840
to that I was the problem to some degree.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.000
Children interpret it that way.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.960
That's just the whole point.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.640
That's what I mean about kids being narcissists.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.360
I don't mean that in the negative sense.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.640
I just mean, actually, they think it's all about them.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.080
So if your mother is unhappy, it's your fault.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.400
And you're not good enough.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.440
So then you have to go out there and work to prove yourself,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.520
to prove to the world and to yourself that you're good enough.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.920
So that going back to your first question

14:47.920 --> 14:50.320
about how these things show up in our lives,

14:50.960 --> 14:51.920
that's how they show up.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.600
And so 12 years old, you emigrate to Vancouver.

14:57.600 --> 14:57.840
Yeah.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.760
By 28, you joined the medical profession.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.480
Yeah.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.320
And you spend the next 32 years, roughly, working in medical degrees.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.920
At 28, I went back to medical school.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.680
Actually, I took a detour.

15:09.680 --> 15:10.880
I was a high school teacher for a while.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.160
And then I was 27, 28 when I started medical school.

15:16.160 --> 15:22.080
At age 33, I think I began my medical career of 32 years.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.120
And in those 33 years, what was your practice?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.160
What did you specialize in?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.440
What did you focus on?

15:28.400 --> 15:33.520
So I was a family physician, which meant I delivered a lot of babies

15:33.520 --> 15:36.240
and I looked after people's problems from beginning to the end of life.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.640
I also worked in palliative care.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.080
I was the director of a unit at the hospital,

15:42.080 --> 15:44.800
which looked after people with terminal disease.

15:46.240 --> 15:52.400
And I did, that was 22 years or so of my practice, 20, 22 years.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.320
And then I switched gears altogether.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.400
And I went to work in the downtown east side of Vancouver, British Columbia,

16:00.400 --> 16:03.760
which is North America's most concentrated area of drug use.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.080
We have more people coming from anywhere in the world are shocked

16:08.080 --> 16:08.720
by what they see.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.560
There are thousands of people in the streets,

16:10.560 --> 16:17.440
injecting, selling, using, inhaling, ingesting drugs of all kinds.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.400
And people are suffered the consequences of drug use in a society

16:22.400 --> 16:23.840
that doesn't understand drug use.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.960
So it punishes it, excludes it, ostracizes it.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.960
So people get HIV from dirty needles and hepatitis C.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.680
So this is the population, often they're homeless.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.200
So that's the population I worked with for 12 years

16:37.200 --> 16:39.360
to the end of my medical work.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.360
That experience working with patients that were in palliative care.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.440
So that's for anybody that doesn't know,

16:45.440 --> 16:47.600
that's patients that are approaching the end of their life

16:47.600 --> 16:51.280
that have terminal illnesses and that are aware that they're going to die.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.000
What did that experience teach you?

16:55.440 --> 17:03.760
It took an acceptance of one's lack of lack of omnipotence as a physician

17:03.760 --> 17:06.880
because you go into the, you want to cure people, you want people to heal.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.760
And now it takes the tremendous acceptance to say,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.920
you know, we've reached the limit of our knowledge.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.040
And that doesn't mean we can't help people,

17:15.040 --> 17:18.240
but we certainly can't cure them, you know.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.760
And so it taught me how to be with the inevitable.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.600
And you're working with people who are in the process of dying.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.560
I mean, by the way, who isn't in the process of dying, you know,

17:30.560 --> 17:34.320
but people whose time is more limited than the rest of us.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.960
Acceptance, you learn all of acceptance.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.760
It challenges you to do your best

17:40.080 --> 17:44.400
when you know your best isn't going to be saving anybody's lives,

17:44.400 --> 17:50.160
but it's to help people live a life of as little suffering as possible

17:50.160 --> 17:51.920
and as much dignity as possible.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.440
So it really challenges the best parts of you to show up.

17:56.080 --> 18:02.880
Patience, acceptance, intuition, personally taught me a lot to listen to people.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.280
Interesting enough, people really want to be heard when they're dying.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.600
They want to make sense of their lives.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.720
They want to tell their stories, then I want their stories to be heard.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And so I listened a lot.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.760
I just sat by the bedside and I listened, all that.

18:20.400 --> 18:25.280
When you listened, did you hear any themes relating to regret

18:25.280 --> 18:28.000
or things that actually mattered?

18:28.000 --> 18:31.360
Because I always imagine if I was given such news

18:31.360 --> 18:34.800
that my life was coming to an end and there was an approximate date,

18:34.800 --> 18:38.160
it would be quite a powerful way of finally realizing

18:38.160 --> 18:40.080
what truly matters and what never did.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.760
People react to their impending death in different ways.

18:43.760 --> 18:48.080
So there were some people who just fought it to the end.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.920
They didn't really want to accept it.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.720
But most people were more along the lines that you describe,

18:54.720 --> 18:56.720
where they really get to see what's important.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.280
And so I mentioned this a number of times.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.320
It sounds strange and I don't recommend it.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.320
But I've had patients say to me,

19:04.320 --> 19:07.600
doctor, I don't know how to tell you this and I can't even explain it perhaps.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.320
But this illness that's going to take my life

19:10.320 --> 19:12.320
is the best thing that I've happened to me.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.040
And they meant a couple of things about it.

19:15.040 --> 19:19.600
They meant what you just said, about finding out what's really important in life.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.840
In this book, The Myth of Normal, I enter you a young man called Will Pye,

19:23.840 --> 19:26.320
who wrote a book called, Blessed with a Brain Tumor.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.600
What kind of a blessing is that?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.760
What kind of a blessing is that?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.960
So I asked Will, what's the blessing?

19:34.960 --> 19:37.680
And he said, it made me appreciate every moment.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.400
It meant every time I talked to somebody,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.680
I knew this might be the last conversation I'm going to have with them.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.800
So it better be a human, genuine interaction.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.520
So that was that aspect of it.

19:50.080 --> 19:54.400
The other aspect of it was that, again, my view is,

19:54.400 --> 19:56.880
as I pointed in this book and in previous works,

19:56.880 --> 20:00.400
who gets sick and who isn't exactly accidental?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.480
There are certainly, personally, patterns

20:02.480 --> 20:06.640
based on traumatic experiences in childhood that make disease more likely.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.560
And people very often realize that throughout their lives,

20:11.280 --> 20:12.640
they had abandoned who they were.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.720
They lived a life that wasn't meaningful for them.

20:15.760 --> 20:20.480
And on death, they reconnected with themselves in an authentic way.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.560
And that seemed to be worth a lot to people.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.800
Again, I don't recommend that way of going to reconnect with yourself,

20:27.360 --> 20:30.640
but people have certainly, I certainly saw it.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.640
So those are the two big lessons.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.520
After your 33 years in medical practice,

20:38.960 --> 20:41.520
you described that you had a bit of a,

20:41.520 --> 20:45.120
you kind of tuned into a creative calling, which was writing.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.280
Well, I began to write when I was a physician.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.920
So my first book on ADHD after I was diagnosed with it

20:52.000 --> 20:54.800
was published in 1999 now.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.720
So that was 23 years ago now.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.960
So I began to write, and even before then,

20:58.960 --> 21:01.680
I wrote because I wrote columns for newspapers.

21:03.280 --> 21:07.360
But yes, there was a time in my life where the writing impulse,

21:07.360 --> 21:12.880
which had been with me all my life, was stifled and stymied.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.240
And so was I, because I had this frustration.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.680
In fact, I had the sense that there's something I needed to express.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.920
But I didn't know what, and they didn't know how.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.640
And at some point I realized, oh yeah, I need to write.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.760
So that began before I finished medical practice,

21:29.760 --> 21:37.040
but it certainly has been essential to my ongoing unfolding as a human being.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.160
I was so compelled by that when I read about that,

21:40.160 --> 21:45.040
because I've started to really understand the value of creativity

21:45.040 --> 21:48.240
in all of our lives, regardless of whether we have the luxury

21:48.400 --> 21:50.560
of being called an artist or not.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.720
And so what, in your view, is the importance of?

21:53.840 --> 21:56.960
Well, you're singing my tune here, if I may say it that way,

21:56.960 --> 22:02.160
because I code in this book, there's a great Hungarian Canadian

22:02.160 --> 22:06.080
stress researcher called Yanush Selye, S-E-L-Y-E.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.360
And Selye is the one who actually coined the word stress

22:09.360 --> 22:10.800
in the sense that we use it today.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.040
And he's the one that showed in the laboratory

22:13.040 --> 22:15.120
how stress diminishes the immune system,

22:15.120 --> 22:20.080
and this organizes the hormones and also rates the stomach

22:20.080 --> 22:21.280
and all this kind of stuff.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.800
But Selye also said, and I quote him here,

22:25.360 --> 22:27.200
what is in us must out?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.880
What is in us must out?

22:29.680 --> 22:32.560
That we all have to follow our cave urges

22:32.560 --> 22:35.280
in a way that nature prepared for us,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.040
otherwise we can be hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.520
I'm paraphrasing it very closely.

22:42.240 --> 22:46.720
So we are created in the image of God.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.240
I mean, what are your religious views are?

22:50.240 --> 22:53.120
But that sense that we're created in the images of God

22:53.840 --> 22:57.120
means that we are creators, because the essence of God is creation.

22:57.840 --> 23:02.400
In fact, we call God the Creator, and we call the result of that creation.

23:03.360 --> 23:08.400
If we're created, and if we're offshoots of that creative dynamic

23:08.400 --> 23:11.200
in the universe, then it means that it's in us to create.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.880
And whatever form that takes, I mean, you don't want to see me

23:16.960 --> 23:18.400
do art unless you...

23:20.000 --> 23:23.520
I can do a pretty good stick figure, by merit to a nurse.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.680
So that creativity doesn't have to take the form of formal art,

23:29.680 --> 23:33.440
but it does have to take some flow of something that's inside you

23:33.440 --> 23:34.400
that needs to come out.

23:35.040 --> 23:39.840
Otherwise, as Selye says, you get hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.560
And so in that sense, everybody's got that creative urge,

23:42.560 --> 23:44.800
and that may take the form of social intercourse.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.320
It might take the form of gardening.

23:46.320 --> 23:51.920
I don't care, communion with nature, athletic expression.

23:51.920 --> 23:56.320
I don't care what, but there's somebody, everybody's got it.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.240
And if people don't realize they have it,

23:58.240 --> 24:00.640
it's only because life has hemmed them in and they're too busy.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.320
And sometimes they are trying to make a living or trying to survive

24:04.320 --> 24:06.000
or to disconnect it from themselves.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.760
But it's in all of us.

24:07.760 --> 24:11.520
And to the extent that we don't give it expression, we suffer.

24:13.040 --> 24:18.160
One of the things that really hems it in is the prospect

24:18.160 --> 24:20.080
that we might not be good at it,

24:20.080 --> 24:21.920
because we think to express ourselves creatively,

24:21.920 --> 24:23.840
we kind of join a competition of sorts.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.000
And that's a trap we can fall into.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.120
So if I'm going to DJ, I need to become a good DJ,

24:29.120 --> 24:31.440
but in social comparison or else I don't want to...

24:31.440 --> 24:33.200
But what I've come to learn is, in fact,

24:33.200 --> 24:37.520
the act of DJing alone in my kitchen at midnight is the reward.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.560
Regardless of outcome or whether there's a crowd there,

24:40.560 --> 24:41.840
it's just me and my dog listening.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.080
The expression is the reward,

24:44.080 --> 24:46.560
not the achievement or the medal that I might get.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.840
Yeah, not the external.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.560
Well, look, I went through that in the writing of this book.

24:50.560 --> 24:56.160
So here I am, this writer who writes about trauma and healing.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.120
And all of a sudden I'm in a panic because I'm writing a book.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.840
And I realized that the problem was that you talked about identifying with your work.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.360
So I had identified with this book.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.920
So the problem wasn't the book.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.360
Because let's say I write the book and it's not a success.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.480
I mean, okay, big headline in the Sunday Times.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.480
Book, not a big success.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.760
How big a big deal is that in the history of the universe?

25:20.640 --> 25:24.480
But if I identify with the book and it's not going well,

25:24.480 --> 25:26.960
then if the book fails, then I'm feeling as a person,

25:26.960 --> 25:31.200
which then goes back to my very earliest concern about not being worth it.

25:32.160 --> 25:37.440
So once I disidentified, once I said, no, this is just a book.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.160
It may be a good book, it may be an important book,

25:40.160 --> 25:44.080
maybe a book that doesn't hit the mark, but it's only a book.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.000
And how it goes says nothing about me or my worth.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.920
Once I could decouple that, then I could confidently and much more comfortably

25:51.920 --> 25:53.120
go back to the writing of it.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.240
But I went through that crisis.

25:55.200 --> 26:00.080
It seems like a bit of a paradox that the lack of self-worth would motivate someone

26:00.560 --> 26:02.640
to create great things because they want the approval,

26:02.640 --> 26:05.200
but at the same time make the process so agonizing

26:05.200 --> 26:07.120
because their self-esteem seems to be on the line.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.360
All this sense of self-worth is on the line.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.840
Well, that dynamic was in me once I realized it, I let go of it.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.760
So it didn't dominate me in the end.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.400
And then honest to God, by the time I finished the book,

26:19.120 --> 26:20.800
I'm not just saying this in retrospect.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.120
It's the best seller now in several countries.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.520
I actually said to myself and I meant it.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.120
Now I've done the book.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.360
That's what matters.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.000
I've said what was in me to say.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.080
How the world reacts, I can't control.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.960
And it doesn't actually matter on a fundamental level.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.800
It's not that I don't want this book to be accessed.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.920
I mean, success.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.480
Of course I wanted to sell 10 zillion copies,

26:46.480 --> 26:52.160
but that doesn't define myself worth or how I function in the world

26:52.160 --> 26:53.760
or how I feel about myself.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.720
Honestly, it does not.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.920
And I understood that by the time I finished working on it.

26:58.880 --> 27:04.480
So once it's done, it's out there doing its work or not doing its work.

27:06.320 --> 27:11.440
But I don't have to hang my own sense of self on how the book does.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.200
Because at that point, that's an outcome you can't control, right?

27:15.200 --> 27:18.080
So trying to control that would be anxiety.

27:19.200 --> 27:19.680
Yeah.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.160
Oh yeah.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.120
Well, you can't control it.

27:21.120 --> 27:21.280
No.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.360
Ten years this book took you to write.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.800
Took me to prepare.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.360
Took about three years to write.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.280
You describe it as a calling.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.920
The myth of normal.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.280
Four words to sort of pull people in

27:39.280 --> 27:43.200
and to in some way summarize a 550-odd page book.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.640
Why those four words?

27:44.640 --> 27:45.360
Why that phrase?

27:46.720 --> 27:49.040
Can I pass from them to find a code on my cell phone?

27:49.040 --> 27:49.760
100%.

27:49.760 --> 27:49.920
Yeah.

27:52.320 --> 27:52.800
So this is...

27:53.680 --> 27:56.000
Are you familiar with the work of Eckhart Tolle?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.360
Oh, Eckhart Tolle, yes.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.000
Okay, yeah.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So Tolle lives in Vancouver like I do.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.160
And in one of his books, he says,

28:02.800 --> 28:05.440
the normal state of mind of most human beings

28:05.440 --> 28:08.080
contains a strong element of what we might call

28:08.080 --> 28:10.000
dysfunction or even madness.

28:11.120 --> 28:17.600
So in medical parlance, normal means healthy and natural.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.520
So there's a normal range of blood pressure,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.560
normal temperature.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.320
It's a range.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.760
Outside that range, there's no life.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.640
There's no health, either too high or too low.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.120
You're gone.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.960
So normal means it's equivalent with,

28:34.960 --> 28:37.680
synonymous with, healthy and natural.

28:39.040 --> 28:42.880
However, we make that same assumption that

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
out in society, what we used to,

28:45.920 --> 28:48.880
what we call normal is also healthy and natural,

28:48.880 --> 28:50.080
which is the myth.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.000
Because I'm saying that in this society,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.280
what we consider to be normal is neither healthy nor natural.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.680
In fact, it's hurtful to us,

28:57.680 --> 29:01.360
so that we're using the word normal in a way that

29:03.120 --> 29:06.720
doesn't apply in a narrow medical sense.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.680
It's accurate, but in a broader sense,

29:09.680 --> 29:12.160
that which we're used to in this society,

29:12.160 --> 29:15.120
we consider normal is just not good for us.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.680
And norm is kind of a statistic,

29:17.680 --> 29:20.720
or it's a kind of an average.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.720
So if everybody, you have a dog,

29:22.720 --> 29:25.920
if everybody in London mistreated their dogs,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.880
and if you didn't, then you'd be abnormal.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.880
So it's a myth to say that what is normal is healthy and natural.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.400
That's what I mean by the myth of normal.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.000
That's one thing I mean.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.880
The other thing I mean is,

29:39.840 --> 29:42.800
if we understand the actual science

29:42.800 --> 29:44.400
of the unity of everything,

29:44.400 --> 29:46.560
I'm not talking about spiritual insight here,

29:46.560 --> 29:49.520
I'm talking about physiological science

29:49.520 --> 29:52.640
that are physiology and psychology,

29:52.640 --> 29:55.120
is very much affected by our life experiences,

29:55.120 --> 29:58.640
being in utero, childbirth, early childhood,

29:58.640 --> 29:59.760
and throughout the lifetime.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.480
It also follows that illness and health

30:02.480 --> 30:04.240
are not individual attributes.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.120
They are actually manifestations of our relationships

30:07.120 --> 30:10.640
and our situation in the world and our history.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.040
That also means when these circumstances are abnormal,

30:16.240 --> 30:17.760
you expect people to be sick,

30:18.560 --> 30:21.520
you know, just as if you gave animals

30:21.520 --> 30:22.880
something that wasn't healthy for them,

30:22.880 --> 30:24.960
they'd be sick, that'd be what you'd expect.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.760
So this idea that the people who are ill,

30:29.760 --> 30:31.840
either physically or mentally abnormal,

30:31.840 --> 30:32.960
I say no.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.560
These are normal responses

30:34.560 --> 30:36.560
to an abnormal set of circumstances.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.920
And rather than being sort of those abnormal ones

30:41.920 --> 30:44.560
and the rest of us, it's really a spectrum

30:45.280 --> 30:47.040
that we're all, pretty much all on it.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.240
So in those three senses,

30:49.040 --> 30:51.840
this idea of normal is a myth,

30:52.720 --> 30:56.720
and it's one that keeps us from seeing reality.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.840
And we're all abnormal in some way.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.280
So if maybe my attention is different,

31:05.280 --> 31:08.960
maybe my interpersonal relationships are abnormal,

31:08.960 --> 31:11.280
but in some way I'm going to be abnormal.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.640
As it relates to treatments,

31:12.640 --> 31:14.320
how do you think that the medical profession

31:14.320 --> 31:15.920
and the psychological profession

31:16.000 --> 31:18.640
would respond differently

31:18.640 --> 31:20.960
if we removed this idea that there is a normal?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.240
How would our approaches change to treating people?

31:26.480 --> 31:31.280
Well, that's a multi-layered answer.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.920
First of all, we would recognize that our diagnoses

31:35.920 --> 31:37.600
are not explanations for anything.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.120
So, you know, I've been diagnosed with ADD,

31:41.120 --> 31:44.160
you know, legitimately so, as my first book was on it.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.440
But it doesn't explain anything.

31:50.480 --> 31:54.400
So I tune out easily, very easily, you know,

31:54.400 --> 31:56.960
and sometimes when I don't, often when I don't want to,

31:56.960 --> 31:59.920
but, you know, unless I'm highly motivated.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.800
So you might say, this person has ADD,

32:04.800 --> 32:06.320
how do we know because he tunes out a lot?

32:07.680 --> 32:08.880
Why does he tune out a lot?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.160
He's got ADD.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.320
How do we know he's got ADD because he tunes out a lot?

32:12.320 --> 32:16.320
So first of all, we have to understand that our understanding

32:16.320 --> 32:18.560
of normal and what's outside the normal,

32:18.560 --> 32:20.320
they don't, doesn't explain anything.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.400
They can, they can describe,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.320
if you describe my mental functioning

32:26.320 --> 32:29.040
as that of somebody who's got an automatic tendency to tune out,

32:29.040 --> 32:29.840
you'd be accurate.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.880
So there's a description.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.840
It's helpful as an explanation

32:35.840 --> 32:38.640
as to why this person isn't behaving quote unquote normally.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.600
It doesn't explain a thing.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.640
Now, if you understood that I spent my infancy

32:45.280 --> 32:49.200
under very difficult circumstances where I was very stressed

32:49.200 --> 32:51.760
because of all the stuff I already talked about

32:51.760 --> 32:54.240
and that tuning out was a normal response

32:55.600 --> 32:58.880
to, to those circumstances as a way of protecting myself

32:58.880 --> 33:00.000
from the stress of it all.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.960
And this was happening when my brain was developing.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.400
Then you'd understand there's nothing abnormal about my,

33:06.400 --> 33:07.200
by tuning out.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.600
In fact, it is the normal response

33:09.680 --> 33:11.600
to a set of abnormal circumstances.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.520
So that's the first point.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.320
And I could go through the same kind of

33:17.040 --> 33:20.560
dialectic with all manner of physical and mental diseases,

33:20.560 --> 33:21.680
by the way, so-called.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.760
The second point is-

33:25.760 --> 33:26.800
Why do you say so-called?

33:31.120 --> 33:33.120
Well, look, the disease model is,

33:34.320 --> 33:37.200
as long as we understand it's a model, it's okay.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.680
When we think it describes reality fully, it doesn't.

33:42.320 --> 33:50.640
So, for example, we talk about mental illnesses.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.600
And we're assuming that there's a kind of definite pathology there.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.840
Just as in rheumatoid arthritis,

33:57.840 --> 34:00.560
you can describe the inflammation of the joints

34:00.560 --> 34:04.480
and the blood levels of certain antibodies being abnormal.

34:05.120 --> 34:11.520
And hormonal levels being disturbed.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.520
We're making the same assumption in mental illness.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.440
There's no such evidence in mental illness.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.920
There's no physiological parameters

34:19.920 --> 34:21.760
that you can say somebody's got mental illness.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.360
There's just been a study a few months ago

34:25.360 --> 34:26.960
of thousands of brain scans

34:28.320 --> 34:30.720
of people with mental illness diagnosis.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.440
There's nothing diagnostic about the brain scans.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.160
It's not like I can take an X-ray of a lung

34:36.160 --> 34:40.320
and say that this lung is what we call consolidation

34:40.320 --> 34:43.840
or fluid indicating inflammation.

34:44.640 --> 34:47.600
There's nothing like that in mental diagnosis.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.440
There's no blood tests you can do and so on.

34:49.440 --> 34:54.400
So, illness is a model.

34:56.400 --> 35:01.120
Somebody's really depressed, even suicidal perhaps,

35:01.120 --> 35:03.200
and then might need pharmacological intervention,

35:03.200 --> 35:04.480
which would really save their lives.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.000
That may be true.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.800
And in that sense, you may say that they're ill

35:11.680 --> 35:13.600
as long as we realize that this is a construct

35:13.600 --> 35:14.800
that we're applying here.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.840
But there's no actual measurement of that.

35:18.400 --> 35:21.840
That's at all similar to what we call physical disease.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.000
But even in physical disease, we make certain assumptions.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.880
For example, somebody has rheumatoid arthritis.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.760
No, nothing wrong with that statement on the face of it.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.040
But there's an assumption there.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.920
The assumption is that there's this thing

35:39.920 --> 35:41.120
called rheumatoid arthritis.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.920
And there's this person called me.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.400
And this person has this thing.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.320
No, the example I often give.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.200
Here's my cell phone.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.240
I'm holding it in my hand.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.360
I have a cell phone.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.400
It's not part of me.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.520
It says nothing about me.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.840
It's a discrete object.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.400
Its nature doesn't depend on my nature.

35:59.200 --> 35:59.600
Nothing.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.160
Is that true about rheumatoid arthritis?

36:04.800 --> 36:06.800
Or is it more true to say, as I found out,

36:07.360 --> 36:10.240
that this is a condition that shows up in people

36:10.240 --> 36:12.480
with certain life experiences

36:12.480 --> 36:14.320
in certain ways of functioning in the world?

36:14.960 --> 36:18.480
And that because of the science documented unity

36:18.480 --> 36:21.440
of mind and body and the impossibility

36:22.000 --> 36:24.640
of separating the activity over emotional apparatus

36:24.640 --> 36:26.000
from same or immune system,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.200
because it's all one organismic unit.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.760
Therefore, when the immune system turns against the body,

36:33.760 --> 36:35.760
as it does in rheumatoid arthritis,

36:35.760 --> 36:37.920
the immune system actually attacks the body.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.760
Is that a thing that's got a life of its own?

36:41.760 --> 36:44.640
Or is there a process that's happening inside that person

36:44.640 --> 36:46.800
because of certain aspects of their lives?

36:47.760 --> 36:50.320
Now, if I say it's the thing that happens to you,

36:50.320 --> 36:52.480
then that thing has got a life of its own.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.080
And that's how most doctors see it.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.600
They see somebody with rheumatoid arthritis.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.840
They say, okay, this is the kind you've got.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.280
This is what's going to happen.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.800
This is the only thing we can do is to mitigate the symptoms.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.640
I find that's not true.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.400
I find that the rheumatoid, by the not just I find it,

37:08.400 --> 37:09.600
the science finds it.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.920
The rheumatoid arthritis is very much related to stress and trauma.

37:14.640 --> 37:15.840
And the more stressed there is,

37:15.840 --> 37:17.760
the more likely it is to flare up.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.680
And if people deal with that stress,

37:19.680 --> 37:22.960
if they know how to prevent it, their illness abates.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.400
Which means that it's not a thing that's separate.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.320
It's a process that happens inside them.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.480
This is a subtle concept.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.920
I'm wondering if I'm explaining it clearly.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.560
No, you are.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.720
And it's really making me question

37:34.720 --> 37:37.120
how much we misunderstand the relationship

37:37.120 --> 37:38.480
between the mind and the immune system.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.680
Because that's the real,

37:41.680 --> 37:43.200
that's the important connection to understand

37:43.200 --> 37:46.480
if you are to accept all the things you've just said.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.920
Which we don't understand.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.840
I don't think typically we understand

37:49.840 --> 37:51.360
that my mind and my immune system

37:51.360 --> 37:53.440
have such a close relationship.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.320
Well, there's a whole new science

37:56.320 --> 37:57.840
that studies those relationships.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.440
It's called sacronorminology.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.880
Which studies the interlinked unity

38:02.880 --> 38:05.360
of the emotional apparatus of our brain and body

38:05.360 --> 38:07.360
with the immune system, with the nervous system

38:07.360 --> 38:08.800
and with the hormonal apparatus.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.040
I mean, it's just so obvious.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.240
I could change your hormonal state

38:14.240 --> 38:16.080
in a split second right now

38:16.080 --> 38:17.520
without touching you.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.760
Just by screaming at you and threatening you.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.400
That would necessarily create a change.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.760
I mean, it's just clear

38:23.760 --> 38:25.440
that our emotions are inseparable.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.360
You know, and the other funny thing is,

38:27.360 --> 38:28.560
well, several funny things.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.160
How do we treat most conditions in medicine?

38:32.160 --> 38:33.600
By the way, inflammation.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.840
If you go to a dermatologist with the inflamed skin.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.960
If you go to a rheumatologist with the inflamed joints.

38:39.520 --> 38:40.960
If you go to a gastroenterologist

38:40.960 --> 38:42.320
with the inflamed intestines.

38:43.040 --> 38:47.200
If you go to a respirologist with inflamed lungs.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.320
If you go to a neurologist with the inflamed nervous system

38:50.320 --> 38:51.840
as in multiples grosses,

38:51.840 --> 38:53.760
they're going to give you steroids

38:54.800 --> 38:56.320
to settle the inflammation.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.000
Now what are steroids?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.600
They are stress hormones.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.320
And you would think that as physicians,

39:02.320 --> 39:04.640
we would ask ourselves, gosh,

39:04.640 --> 39:06.720
we're treating everything with stress hormones.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.040
Does stress maybe have something to do with this condition?

39:09.840 --> 39:11.840
Now when you look at the scientific literature,

39:11.840 --> 39:14.480
yes, yes, yes and yes.

39:14.480 --> 39:18.240
So there's a great Canadian physician

39:18.240 --> 39:20.240
actually united by Queen Victoria.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.480
One of the great medical teachers of all kinds,

39:22.480 --> 39:23.600
Sir William Osler.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.960
And he said in 1890,

39:24.960 --> 39:27.920
that rheumatoid arthritis is a stress-driven disease.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.000
The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot

39:32.000 --> 39:34.320
first described multiples grosses.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.200
He said, this is a stress-driven condition.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.720
And since then, there's been so much research.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.600
So what I'm saying is that this way of looking at

39:46.320 --> 39:48.160
what we call disease is a process.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.440
It's so much more accurate scientifically, actually,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.840
and understanding the mind-body unity.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.960
And then naturally, when people are traumatized,

39:56.960 --> 39:59.360
that has a huge impact on their physiology.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.880
Their psychological trauma

40:00.880 --> 40:02.880
has a huge impact on their physiology.

40:02.880 --> 40:03.760
It's just science.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.240
But it's science that's not taught to medical doctors.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.560
It's just for some strange reason.

40:10.560 --> 40:14.000
Well, the average physician never hears a single lecture

40:14.000 --> 40:16.800
about, say, trauma and his relationship to illness.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.960
And yet, there's studies internationally,

40:18.960 --> 40:21.760
thousands of them showing those relationships.

40:22.560 --> 40:27.680
So there's this strange gap between science and medical practice.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.480
But it would change medical practice for the better.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.000
Because what would happen if you went to a physician

40:34.000 --> 40:37.360
and you presented with your symptom and they'd say,

40:37.360 --> 40:39.920
okay, look, we'll give you such as this medication

40:39.920 --> 40:41.360
to deal with your symptoms.

40:41.360 --> 40:45.360
And then let's look at your life in the context that you live it

40:45.360 --> 40:48.720
and see how the stresses that you may be taking on,

40:48.720 --> 40:50.560
the traumas you may be carrying,

40:50.560 --> 40:52.720
might be affecting the physiology of your body.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.880
Now, they don't have to be all trauma therapists to do that.

40:56.880 --> 41:02.400
They just have to raise the question and to begin the inquiry.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.720
That'll make a huge change to that person's life

41:04.720 --> 41:06.160
and to their disease process.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.280
And clearly to their kids' lives as well,

41:09.280 --> 41:11.280
because I remember reading in your book

41:11.280 --> 41:13.520
about the study with the rats.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.880
And how they, could you tell me about that study?

41:16.880 --> 41:18.320
How the stress study with the rats

41:18.320 --> 41:23.680
and how the parents' treatment of a child impacted their stress response?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.680
And then also they passed that on, which I think was...

41:25.680 --> 41:26.880
Yeah, that was a very interesting study.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.280
It was done in Canada at McGill University.

41:31.120 --> 41:35.520
I think maybe something in the last 20 years, early 2000s, I think.

41:36.320 --> 41:41.360
And they looked at how other rats interacted with their infants,

41:41.360 --> 41:42.080
their newborns.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.360
This is a process called grooming,

41:46.160 --> 41:48.880
in which the mother rat licks the infant

41:49.440 --> 41:54.640
or in the perineal area, you know, in the genitalia.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.080
This is shortly after birth.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.160
These mother rats just started licking their infants.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.760
Some of the rats did it in a more efficient

42:01.760 --> 42:04.000
and caring kind of way than other mother rats.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.800
Those that had the better kind of caring,

42:08.800 --> 42:09.920
the better kind of grooming,

42:10.480 --> 42:15.920
grow to be calmer and respond to stress in more functional ways,

42:15.920 --> 42:21.280
than those little rats who, as neonates,

42:21.280 --> 42:24.560
had not been given that same kind of efficient

42:24.560 --> 42:28.160
and quite as caring grooming.

42:30.480 --> 42:34.800
And what they found out in the brains of those adult rats

42:34.800 --> 42:38.320
who had been groomed one way or the other as infants,

42:38.320 --> 42:39.920
the stress apparatus was different.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.000
Certain receptors were the stress hormones.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.560
So one of them could call themselves more easily than the other.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.760
What was interesting, as you might say, was so what?

42:47.760 --> 42:48.880
That she's genetic.

42:48.880 --> 42:52.400
The calmer mothers passed on their genes to their infants.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.440
No, they didn't.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.640
Because if you took the infants of mothers who groomed beautifully

42:57.280 --> 42:58.720
and put them with mothers who didn't,

42:59.280 --> 43:02.240
and conversely, you took the infant rats of mothers who

43:03.920 --> 43:06.640
didn't groom so well, but you put them with mothers who did,

43:09.200 --> 43:11.440
it changed the brain for the adult.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.400
It changed the brain.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.760
It changed the genetic functioning, not the genes,

43:15.760 --> 43:16.960
but the genetic functioning.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.240
This is called epigenetics,

43:18.240 --> 43:21.040
how genes are turned on and off by the environment.

43:21.760 --> 43:25.120
And then those mother and those rats who were groomed well

43:25.680 --> 43:29.200
as infants, it doesn't matter what the original mother was,

43:29.200 --> 43:31.440
but those rats who were groomed well,

43:31.440 --> 43:33.120
they went on to groom their infants

43:33.840 --> 43:35.840
in exactly the way they had been groomed.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.840
So this is how we pass on our parenting stuff.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.680
For one generation to the next, both behaviorally,

43:41.680 --> 43:44.800
but also through the turning on or off of certain genes.

43:46.080 --> 43:50.080
So in essence, how nurturing our parents were has a big impact

43:50.080 --> 43:54.320
on our own ability to handle stress positively or negatively.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.120
Oh, absolutely.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.320
And then we pass that down to our children.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.360
How stressed our parents were,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.400
how they reacted to our own stress as as infants.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.880
That has everything to do with how our brains handle stress later on.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.240
And so some people just don't handle stress very well.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.920
They don't handle the frustration very well.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.720
You should have seen me this morning at the hotel

44:12.720 --> 44:14.240
when the swimming pool didn't open in time.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.360
But I was a lot better than I might have been years ago.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.200
But yeah, our stress responses are very much programmed

44:23.200 --> 44:25.760
by our early developmental experiences.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.280
Speaking about our early experiences,

44:29.280 --> 44:31.120
the first word in the sort of subtitle of your book

44:31.120 --> 44:32.000
is the word trauma.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.600
It's a word that I've talked about a lot on this podcast

44:35.600 --> 44:37.360
and I've had a lot of people hear that have opened up

44:37.360 --> 44:38.320
about their traumas.

44:38.320 --> 44:39.840
How do you define trauma?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.680
I know society has defined it in its own way,

44:41.680 --> 44:43.360
but how do you define it, the word?

44:45.200 --> 44:46.640
I define it very specifically.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.200
It's not something bad that happens to you.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.880
I went to this movie last night and I was traumatized.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.440
No, you weren't.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.800
You were just sad or you had some emotional pain,

44:58.800 --> 44:59.840
but you weren't traumatized.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.160
Trauma means a wound.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.520
That's the literal meaning of the word.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.360
It's a Greek word for wounding.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.840
So trauma is a psychological wound that you sustain.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.680
And it behaves like a wound.

45:11.680 --> 45:15.280
So on the one hand, a wound, if it's very raw,

45:15.280 --> 45:17.200
if you touch it, it just really hurts.

45:17.760 --> 45:20.560
So if I have a wound around not being wanted,

45:21.840 --> 45:24.640
then, or the belief that I'm not,

45:25.520 --> 45:28.880
then decades later, if anything reminds me of that,

45:28.880 --> 45:31.920
it hurts as much as it did when I originally incurred the wound.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.680
So in one sense, trauma is an unhealed wound.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.200
That touch, we get triggered.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.800
That's what triggering means, by the way.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.320
Some old wound gets activated or touched.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.240
And the other thing that happens to wounds

45:44.240 --> 45:45.520
is that they scar over.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.800
And scar tissue has certain characteristics.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.600
It's thick.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.480
It has no nerve endings, so there's no feeling in it.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.680
So people traumatized.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.040
Disconnected from their feelings.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.920
Scar tissue is rigid.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.200
It's not flexible.

45:59.200 --> 46:01.440
So we lose kind of response flexibility.

46:01.440 --> 46:05.120
So when something happens, we tend to react in typical stereo,

46:05.120 --> 46:10.640
typical predictable dysfunctional ways because of the rigidity.

46:10.640 --> 46:14.240
And scar tissue doesn't grow like healthy flesh.

46:14.240 --> 46:17.040
So people who are traumatized tend to be stuck

46:17.040 --> 46:22.000
in emotional states that characterized their development

46:22.000 --> 46:23.280
when they were traumatized.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.000
So when somebody says to you, don't be such a baby,

46:27.920 --> 46:30.480
doesn't sound very pleasant, but there's some truth to it.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.920
It means that you're probably reacting according to the lines

46:33.920 --> 46:36.240
of some wound that you sustained as an infant.

46:36.240 --> 46:40.160
And now you're reacting as if that wound was happening all over again.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.280
This is what one of my friends in the trauma world,

46:43.280 --> 46:45.200
Peter Levine, calls the tyranny of the past.

46:46.080 --> 46:49.360
So something happens in the present and we react

46:51.360 --> 46:53.920
as if we're back there in the past when this first happened.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.400
And we're not in the present moment at all.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.360
And I was trying to figure out how many people,

47:00.160 --> 47:04.640
as a percentage of the population, have trauma.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.920
But then I read this stat with 60% of adults

47:07.920 --> 47:10.240
say that they've had sort of a traumatic early upbringing

47:10.240 --> 47:12.480
or whatever or traumatic events from their childhood.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.320
But then I thought maybe everybody has trauma.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.760
It depends on how we understand trauma.

47:18.400 --> 47:22.000
So if we understand trauma, it's only the really terrible things

47:22.000 --> 47:24.160
that happen to people, which do happen to people.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.480
You know, in the book I talked about a British friend of mine

47:28.480 --> 47:29.760
who had no living in Canada.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.160
They are a yoga teacher and a meditation teacher

47:34.720 --> 47:37.920
and a psychologist and an artist actually.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.960
And they grew up in some orphanage here in Britain

47:40.960 --> 47:44.640
where they were racially taunted every morning.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.560
You know, words that are in the book

47:46.560 --> 47:48.880
by her permission, which I'm not going to cite here publicly.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.840
And that gave her a sense of deficient,

47:51.840 --> 47:53.520
a sense of self that I'm just not good enough,

47:53.520 --> 47:54.880
that I don't belong and so on.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.360
There's those obvious traumas

47:57.360 --> 47:59.680
or the obvious trauma of being sexually abused.

47:59.680 --> 48:03.760
So men who are sexually abused according to Canadian study

48:03.760 --> 48:05.840
have tripled the rate of heart attacks as adults,

48:06.480 --> 48:08.560
you know, and all kinds of physiological reasons.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.080
But that should be the case.

48:10.640 --> 48:15.840
So there's those self-evident, big T traumas

48:15.840 --> 48:19.200
that we call big T trauma, T with a capital T,

48:19.200 --> 48:20.240
trauma with a capital T.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.120
There's a certain percentage of the population

48:23.120 --> 48:25.360
much larger than we think, subject to that.

48:25.360 --> 48:29.120
If you include all the known factors

48:29.120 --> 48:32.320
such as physical, sexual or emotional abuse,

48:32.320 --> 48:36.000
spanking, by the way, has not been shown to be as traumatic

48:36.000 --> 48:39.120
as harsher forms of physical abuse.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.800
Spanking, which is still recommended by so-called experts

48:42.800 --> 48:45.840
who should remain unnamed for the moment.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.440
The death of a parent, violence in a family,

48:50.640 --> 48:52.080
parental violence against each other.

48:53.040 --> 48:56.080
A parent being jailed, a parent being mentally ill.

48:57.280 --> 49:00.160
Did I say a parent being addicted, a rancorous divorce?

49:00.160 --> 49:02.640
These are the identified big traumas, big T traumas,

49:02.640 --> 49:06.480
not to mention poverty, not to mention extreme inequality,

49:07.600 --> 49:08.560
war and so on.

49:10.320 --> 49:15.200
But then if you remember that trauma is not what happens to you,

49:15.200 --> 49:18.960
but what happens inside you is the wound.

49:18.960 --> 49:22.400
People can be wounded not just by bad things happening to them,

49:22.400 --> 49:26.080
but small children can be wounded in loving families

49:27.920 --> 49:29.280
where they don't get their needs met.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.400
I mean, that's obvious in the physical sense.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.720
If a child doesn't get proper nutrition,

49:35.760 --> 49:38.480
their body will suffer, their mind will suffer.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.560
We're also creatures with emotional needs

49:42.560 --> 49:44.160
as important as our physical needs.

49:45.040 --> 49:46.880
So when the child's emotional needs are not met,

49:46.880 --> 49:47.920
that child is wounded.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.320
That's what we call small T trauma,

49:50.320 --> 49:53.680
which is not the big ticket events such as I described.

49:54.240 --> 49:57.600
But just the child's need to be loved unconditionally,

49:57.600 --> 50:01.120
to be held when distressed, to be responded to,

50:01.120 --> 50:06.240
to be seen, to be heard, to be allowed their full range of emotion

50:06.240 --> 50:10.800
without them being stamped on in the name of so-called discipline.

50:10.800 --> 50:18.880
The right to play creatively, spontaneously, out there in nature,

50:18.880 --> 50:25.280
not with these damn digital gadgets that subvert and hijack the child's imagination.

50:26.320 --> 50:29.280
But spontaneous play, that's essential for brain development.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.880
So what I'm saying is that when these needs are not for the

50:33.920 --> 50:36.480
unconditional loving attachment relationship,

50:36.480 --> 50:39.440
when those needs are frustrated, children are also hurt.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.400
And I call that trauma as well, because it shows up later in life

50:42.960 --> 50:45.520
as the impact of painful wounds.

50:46.560 --> 50:50.000
So trauma in this society, for all kinds of reasons,

50:50.000 --> 50:51.680
is far more common than we imagine.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.880
From sitting here and speaking to, I don't know,

50:54.880 --> 50:57.520
somewhere over 100 different people that come from all walks of life,

50:57.520 --> 51:00.320
but specifically people that are successful in their industries,

51:00.320 --> 51:06.000
and you talked about how an anomalous early upbringing

51:06.000 --> 51:08.560
can create sort of abnormality in an adult.

51:08.560 --> 51:12.480
A lot of the people I sit here are successful because of some kind of abnormality,

51:12.480 --> 51:16.080
or at least their interpretation of some kind of early event

51:16.080 --> 51:18.880
that caused them to have some sort of abnormal belief about themselves

51:18.880 --> 51:20.640
that they're not enough, so they become a billionaire,

51:20.640 --> 51:22.160
or a gold medalist, or whatever it might be.

51:22.880 --> 51:29.280
One of the things that I thought I could predict is I thought after doing 100 episodes,

51:29.280 --> 51:31.600
if they told me the traumatic event they'd been through,

51:31.600 --> 51:37.280
I could predict the outcome in them, but there's a disconnect there,

51:37.280 --> 51:39.840
because I'd sit here with a guest who went through one of your

51:41.040 --> 51:43.680
capital T traumas, like domestic violence,

51:44.640 --> 51:48.240
and one of them might become incredibly angry,

51:48.960 --> 51:52.160
and one of them might become the most peaceful, loving person I've ever met.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.640
And that taught me that there's this thing in between the event,

51:56.640 --> 51:58.320
which is what you call interpretation.

51:59.360 --> 52:03.280
And I found that as, that kind of makes it really difficult to diagnose.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.280
Well, now look, so the two examples you gave,

52:07.440 --> 52:12.560
that really peaceful person may be really peaceful for genuinely good reasons,

52:12.560 --> 52:16.400
such as they found the milk of human love flowing through their veins,

52:16.400 --> 52:20.160
and they've had some spiritual reconciliation with the world,

52:20.160 --> 52:23.840
where they may have genuinely learned compassion for themselves and others,

52:24.320 --> 52:28.080
but they could also be very nice and peaceful because they're suppressing their healthy anger,

52:29.040 --> 52:32.400
because they're actually sitting on their rage unconsciously,

52:33.040 --> 52:36.720
which is going to show up in the form of some kind of health manifestation,

52:36.720 --> 52:38.240
I guarantee you, later on.

52:38.240 --> 52:42.400
So you can't tell from the outside without asking some questions,

52:43.840 --> 52:50.240
or I can give you the example of a Donald Trump who had a really traumatic childhood.

52:50.240 --> 52:55.280
I mean, his father was a, as described by his psychologist, niece, Mary Trump.

52:55.840 --> 53:02.240
His father, Trump's father, who is Mary's grandfather was a psychopath.

53:03.040 --> 53:08.320
And who really demeaned and harshly treated their children.

53:09.200 --> 53:14.880
So Trump decides unconsciously that, by the way, I'm not talking about his policies here,

53:14.880 --> 53:16.400
I'm not, this is not a political debate.

53:17.120 --> 53:20.080
And in the book, I point out that his opponent was also traumatized,

53:20.640 --> 53:21.360
Hillary Clinton.

53:21.360 --> 53:26.560
So this is, this is a ecumenical view of trauma and politics.

53:26.560 --> 53:27.680
I'm not choosing sides.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.680
I'm just saying that you can see his trauma in every moment he opens his mouth.

53:32.400 --> 53:36.000
His grandiosity, his need to make himself bigger, more powerful, aggressive,

53:36.000 --> 53:40.480
and eats as much as said in his autobiography that the world is a horrible place,

53:40.480 --> 53:43.120
a doggie dog place where everybody was after you.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.880
Everybody wants your wife and your house and your wealth.

53:46.880 --> 53:47.840
And this is your friends.

53:48.480 --> 53:49.760
Never mind your enemies.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.200
But that's the world he lives in.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.840
Now that world that he lives in reflects his childhood home.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.600
He developed that world view.

53:56.560 --> 53:59.840
He came to it honestly, you might say, because that's the world that he lives in.

53:59.840 --> 54:04.560
And he gets to be really successful in this crazy world.

54:05.440 --> 54:09.680
You know, financially, although people question, you know,

54:09.680 --> 54:11.920
was he really as big a success as he says he was?

54:12.480 --> 54:14.320
But he certainly was successful politically.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.560
If by success you mean the attainment of power.

54:18.080 --> 54:21.760
His brother on the other hand, Mary Trump's father,

54:22.400 --> 54:26.000
Trump's niece's father, drank himself to death.

54:26.960 --> 54:29.680
And they were both responses to the same.

54:30.480 --> 54:32.800
You can never say it's exactly the same for two kids,

54:32.800 --> 54:35.440
but there was a toxic home environment.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.760
One ends up dead as an alcoholic.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.400
The other ends up at the pinnacle of power.

54:43.600 --> 54:47.840
And when I look at them both, I see this function there,

54:47.840 --> 54:49.120
significant dysfunction there.

54:50.240 --> 54:53.280
So one of the consequences of that early upbringing

54:53.280 --> 54:56.080
was it materialized itself as sort of addiction.

54:56.880 --> 55:00.400
And the other got the same psychological reinforcement,

55:00.400 --> 55:03.840
or the thing missing from power and work and money.

55:04.560 --> 55:07.760
Well, Donald Trump learned that the way to survive

55:07.760 --> 55:09.840
is to be aggressive and harsh and competitive

55:09.840 --> 55:11.520
and to get the other before they get to you,

55:12.320 --> 55:16.880
which is a faithful reproduction of his early childhood experiences.

55:16.880 --> 55:21.120
So for him, these were not choices so much as survival

55:21.520 --> 55:23.200
techniques.

55:23.200 --> 55:29.120
And when they talk about his lying,

55:30.480 --> 55:33.680
well, I don't know when he's lying or when he's not,

55:33.680 --> 55:36.800
but my sense is that often he actually believes what he's saying.

55:37.760 --> 55:40.320
And actually he's a biographer or the person who

55:41.840 --> 55:46.720
co-wrote his, caused the autobiographical, the out of the deal.

55:47.280 --> 55:50.800
This writer says that he's never met anybody

55:50.800 --> 55:53.440
who's so capable of believing something that's not true,

55:53.440 --> 55:55.280
to be true, if he wants it to be true.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.320
But that's the mark of a traumatized child,

55:59.520 --> 56:01.440
you know, a denial of reality.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.000
It is an inauguration.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
There was a certain number of people that came to the,

56:07.840 --> 56:11.040
he couldn't stand it, that there weren't as many people there

56:11.040 --> 56:14.720
as came to Barack Obama's inauguration.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.960
There were a much smaller number of people there.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.880
He created this reality where many more people came to his inauguration.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.280
Now what age behavior is that?

56:24.800 --> 56:28.480
That's a four-year-old where more kids came to his party than my party.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.360
That can't be true.

56:30.320 --> 56:32.560
But that's Donald's way of dealing with reality.

56:33.680 --> 56:36.560
It's not a moral failing as such.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.680
That's how he survived.

56:38.720 --> 56:43.600
And these survival mechanisms then get to former personalities.

56:44.240 --> 56:50.480
And again, in this world, sometimes they pay off in certain ways.

56:51.680 --> 56:54.960
Is that often the case with pathological lies?

56:54.960 --> 56:56.800
They've learned to lie as a way to survive.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.920
Oh, absolutely.

56:57.920 --> 57:02.080
The German philosopher writer Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche said,

57:02.080 --> 57:05.440
people lie their way out of reality who have been hurt by reality.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.480
And so I've lied.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.400
You know, like when I had my shopping addiction,

57:13.040 --> 57:15.840
I lied every day to my wife, you know?

57:15.840 --> 57:18.480
And even afterwards, when she tried,

57:18.480 --> 57:20.400
when she stopped trying to change my behavior,

57:21.360 --> 57:25.040
I said, just tell me if you're going to show up,

57:25.040 --> 57:27.360
you're going to spend another $1,000 on music.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.080
Just tell me.

57:30.160 --> 57:35.200
I still couldn't because I was so ashamed of it.

57:35.840 --> 57:41.280
And so the lying became like a way of survival for me.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.320
Defense against reality.

57:42.320 --> 57:46.080
It's a defense against reality and it's a defense against being judged.

57:47.440 --> 57:47.760
You know?

57:48.320 --> 57:51.200
Well, that says something well my childhood, you know?

57:51.200 --> 57:52.480
Nobody's born a liar.

57:52.480 --> 57:55.280
As we say in this book, there are congenital liars,

57:55.280 --> 57:57.120
but there are no congenital liars.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.680
No one day old baby tells any lies.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.080
No one day old baby pretends anything.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.720
If we end up pretending in any way at all to the extent that we do,

58:06.720 --> 58:09.920
it's because we had to learn that's what we must do to survive.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.880
You said something at the start when I gave the example that I have this,

58:14.880 --> 58:18.080
I sat with a guest here who went through domestic abuse

58:18.080 --> 58:20.080
and they are the calmest person.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.600
And then you said, well, maybe they're suppressing it.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.240
And in fact, the minute you said that,

58:24.240 --> 58:25.760
it reminded me of something they said,

58:25.760 --> 58:32.000
which is they said to me on this podcast that they had angry outbursts all the time.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.560
So sometimes their child will come up to them

58:36.240 --> 58:39.200
and want to play when they're working and they'll snap.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.080
And they're trying to, they're trying to deal with that.

58:42.080 --> 58:42.560
Yeah.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.080
That's what I meant, that they're sitting on this

58:46.240 --> 58:51.120
crater of volcanic crater of anger, which sometimes bursts out of them.

58:51.120 --> 59:01.200
So their demeanor is like a really developed, suppressed way of handling rage,

59:02.000 --> 59:05.440
which rage, when they were children, had they expressed,

59:06.080 --> 59:07.840
would have got them into more trouble.

59:07.840 --> 59:12.560
So suppressing it, repressing it, became their survival.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.240
It's all about survival, you see.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.560
So it became their survival mechanism.

59:16.560 --> 59:23.360
No, that person, as long as they keep it that way, they're at risk.

59:24.560 --> 59:28.000
They're at risk for mental health diagnosis like depression.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.800
Because what do we, what is depression?

59:30.800 --> 59:32.240
It means you're pushing something down.

59:32.240 --> 59:32.960
That's what it means.

59:33.680 --> 59:34.640
What do we push down?

59:35.600 --> 59:36.800
Our natural emotions.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.080
Why do we push them down?

59:38.080 --> 59:39.360
Because we had to survive.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
So that, that person, I don't know.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.160
I can't prognosticate what's going to happen to them.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.720
But if they don't work it out in general,

59:47.600 --> 59:52.160
they're at risk for some kind of mental or physical manifestation.

59:52.160 --> 59:52.960
That's my experience.

59:54.000 --> 59:54.560
Quick one.

59:54.560 --> 59:57.280
Some of you may know we've got a brand new sponsor on this podcast,

59:57.280 --> 59:58.480

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.280
which I can't wait to tell you about.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.320
From the 18th of October to the 16th of November,

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.160

then search American Express business platinum card to find out more.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.120
Quick one from our longest standing sponsor here.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.800
I can't tell you over the last and say over the last,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.080
really it's been about two and a half years.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.320
It was really post pandemic,

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.440
how much my health has become such a huge priority in my life.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.760
Huell has been probably the most important partner in my health journey

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.000
because I've been in the boardrooms.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.080
I've been to their offices tens and tens and tens and tens of times.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.640
I've seen how they make their decisions on nutrition.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.920
And that's why it's such a wonderful thing to be able to talk to this audience

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.600
about a brand and a product that is so unbelievably linked to my values

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.040
and the place I am in my life of valuing the gym,

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.160
exercise, movement, my mind, my breathing and all of those things.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.080
And most importantly, my nutrition.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.520
That is the role Huell plays.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520
And so every time I get to read these ads out,

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.040
I do it with such passion,

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.800
because I really, really believe every word I'm saying.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.920
And I absolutely love the brand.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.280
So if you haven't already tried Huell

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.240
and you've been resistant to my pestering,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.400
then give it a go and let me know how you get on.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.280
You talked about expressing one's emotions

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.640
and something you've talked about in this book,

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.680
but also previously is this idea that there is such a thing as healthy anger.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.080
It's one of the seven As of healing, as you say.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.760
The first being a topic we've talked about already, which is acceptance.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.800
The next being awareness.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Well, awareness that we should have put into this book,

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.920
but we didn't, not into this book.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.400
In this book, I put four As and I left out awareness

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400
and that was an omission on my part.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:14.880
Really?

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.320
Yeah, I was, I'm sorry, but it was.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.400
So in the book, you have authenticity, anger, autonomy.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.600
Acceptance.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.960
Agency you have.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.840
An agency, yeah.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.200
Yeah, and acceptance.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.760
So awareness, you've said before,

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.840
before this book that awareness is the starting point.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.200
I've found that to be so true in my life,

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.240
but it's not very easy.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.960
I feel like awareness is a luxury or a privilege that is very hard fought.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.200
Because you're guessing.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.360
You're guessing based on pattern recognition.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.000
So I was guessing 25 years old, I can't get into relationship.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.600
Any time a girl comes near me, even if I've pursued her, I run off.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.240
And to figure out why I was doing that,

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.040
to even identify the behavior pattern and go, that's not helpful.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.200
That's not going to lead me to feeling whole.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.480
Where does that come from?

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.760
Took 25 years and a lot of like introspection.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.680
But most people, they're living unaware of the puppet master of trauma

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.120
that is driving their life.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.320
That's a really good analogy.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.920
The trauma really is like a puppet master behind the scenes

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.960
or in the unconscious, pulling your strings and you're not aware of it.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.280
Do you remember Pinocchio?

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.080
Yeah.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.200
So you remember what Pinocchio says at the end,

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.520
the way when he finally becomes a real boy?

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.400
He says how foolish I was when I was a puppet.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.360
And to the extent that we're being activated by these unconscious strings

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.600
that are traumas pulling behind the scenes and we're acting in our lives

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600
and we think we're autonomous free beings,

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.480
but we're actually being controlled by something in the past

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.600
that we haven't worked out.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.240
We're puppets.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.840
We're actually puppets.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.880
And there's not much freedom in that.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.200
There's no freedom in it at all.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.520
So I mean, I suppose the opposite of trauma,

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.400
if you want to revisit that question, is liberation.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.160
Interesting.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.120
Liberation and by reconnection.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.880
By reconnection, but liberation from the inexorable power of the unconscious.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.120
Which is like cutting the strings in a way.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.800
It kind of brings me to, there's kind of two ways.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.360
I want to go with that.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.680
The first question I have about trauma and the puppet master analogy is,

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.640
do we ever really cut the strings?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.360
Or do we just kind of learn to pull against them

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.680
when they try and tell us to do something with more force

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.520
than they're exerting in the opposite direction?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.640
That doesn't work very well pushing against it

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.000
because they're still reactive.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.960
You're still not in charge.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.080
You're just in automatic resistance mode to something.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.360
There's no freedom in that either.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.240
So yeah.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.240
But awareness that you mentioned is huge

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.800
because once you are aware that there's this,

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.720
see the thing about these strings may not fray right away.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.840
But once you wear that, ah, this reaction of mine,

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.880
it's not about what's going on right now.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.960
There's something all being activated here.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.360
That awareness alone weakens the,

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.120
it slackens the strings of it.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.280
Now you're no longer, they're no longer is taught.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.400
They're no longer is automatically capable of pulling on you.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.000
So it does have to begin with awareness of them.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.600
Ultimately, if we realize that this puppet master is just a desperate little person

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.560
trying to get you to survive, the only way he, she, they knew how,

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.320
when you were small, when they were small,

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.160
if you make friends with it, but we relieve it of its duties.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.640
See, thanks very much, but I can handle it now.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.520
It eventually becomes our friend rather than sort of our master.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.560
On that first step of just acknowledging,

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.640
just understanding that there is a puppet master there controlling us

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.280
and exactly which strings that puppet master is pulling in our lives.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.200
How does one go about awareness, the process of awareness?

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.000
Is that, I mean, is it introspection, keeping a diary therapy?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:14.720
What, what is it?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.840
Well, all that, I mean, all or any, but even when you ask how you go about it,

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.600
what is the it?

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.400
Well, for you to say how to go about it,

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.160
you already must have some degree of awareness.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.000
If you didn't, you wouldn't even be asking the question.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:33.600
So that's the very first step of realizing that there's something here to work on.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.760
There's something here to work through.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.240
It does not need to be the way it is.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.400
That already is the biggest step.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.320
The Buddha said that to recognize the source of your suffering

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.560
is the first step towards relieving the suffering.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:50.800
And so as soon as you ask how you go about it, you've already taken a huge step.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.520
Because a lot of people don't even know that there's an it.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.800
They just think this is a reality, that this is life.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.200
So realizing that this it doesn't have to be the way it is.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.680
That's already a huge step now.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.280
Beyond that, yoga, meditation, nature,

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:18.080
therapy of all kinds, body work of all kinds, like somatic experiencing,

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.840
or craniosacral treatments, or even massage therapy.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.440
It's incredible what can be revealed just through body work like that.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.160
Then all kinds of forms of therapy, the ones I teach, the ones other people teach.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:41.440
Journaling, certain exercises in this book that we recommend.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.880
Just ask yourself where you have troubles saying no in life,

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.720
to things you don't really want to do.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.960
And working that through on a regular basis.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.440
So there's lots of ways once you open the door.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:59.440
I have a chapter on psychedelics here, which is again, it's not like a panacea or for everyone,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.720
but certainly it's a helpful modality for a lot of people.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.880
So some people may actually benefit from taking pharmaceutical medications

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.080
if their situation is dire enough, but not as the final answer,

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.840
but as a way of getting respite, that allow them to go to work on the real issues

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.360
that cause them to be depressed, or anxious, or tuning out.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.400
So any and all of these things.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.440
Well, the people don't even want to open those doors though,

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.240
because there's so much pain associated with maybe going back or revisiting an early experience

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.760
that they just think it's better to keep the doors shut, and get to tomorrow.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.040
That's true, to which I have two answers.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.160
One is, it's true, it's painful.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.920
Because all the pain you didn't want to feel, and you've been running away from

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.200
through your compensatory behaviors, like your addictions,

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.680
or nothing but an attempt to escape from pain, that's all they are.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.320
They're not a disease, they're not a genetic, whatever it is.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.520
Addictions are very simply an attempt to escape pain, which create more pain,

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.200
but that's what they are.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.880
And so we get addicted to work, to sex, to pornography, to gambling, to the internet,

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.280
to shopping, to eating, to power.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.760
On that point, I find it so fascinating, when you mentioned in your previous book,

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:29.200
that you classified things like food, social media, shopping, porn and work,

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.120
as types of addiction, that in and of itself was a bit of a revelation for me,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.280
because I never saw work as an addiction.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.800
The minute you said it was, and I kind of link it to heroin addiction,

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:48.080
which is providing a certain psychological, physiological benefit to me.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.440
Temporarily.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.840
Temporarily, of course it's a fucking addiction.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.560
Of course work is an addiction, of course I have that addiction.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.600
Well, work can be an addiction, work can also be sacred,

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.440
it can also be fulfilling in the manifestation of your creative origins.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.480
But it's strange to say, not that I recommend it,

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.520
but it's possible even to use heroin in a non-addictive way.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.400
I don't personally get it, and I would never want to,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.200
but the addiction is never in the behavior itself,

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.880
it's in your relationship to the behavior.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.480
So if the particular activity gives you temporary relief or pleasure,

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.400
and therefore you crave it, but it causes harm in the long term,

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400
and you can't give it up, you got an addiction.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.520
And I don't care what the activity is, it could be drugs,

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.360
and all the other things that we mentioned.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.120
And it employs the same brain circus, by the way.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.320
The workaholic is after the same brain chemical that the cocaine addict is after, dopamine.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.040
And people can be even addicted to their own stress hormones,

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.800
like adrenaline, the so-called adrenaline junkies, there's such a thing.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.720
So almost anything can be addictive if it serves the purpose

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.320
of temporarily easing some distress, but causing harm in the long term.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.520
Is escapism the right word to use then for it?

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.280
Because it doesn't sound as much like we're escaping,

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.200
rather than we are seeking something.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.000
We're seeking relief from a certain mental state.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.960
I just gave you a definition of addiction,

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.280
so I don't know what addictions you've had or haven't,

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.160
but what did that do for you?

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.120
Temporarily, it gave you something.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:41.040
It made me feel like I was valid and I was pursuing a sense of accomplishment and validation.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.160
It gave you a sense of worth.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.440
Worth, yeah, it was worthy.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.600
No, no, is that something that people need or not?

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:46.960
Yes.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.080
Yeah, that's a good thing.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.840
But the real question is, why did you ever get the idea that you didn't have the worth?

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.440
Why did I get the idea that I didn't have the worth?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.240
That's where trauma comes in.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.680
Because I was called the N-word when I was eight by a kid in school.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.240
Exactly.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.280
And then no one was going to be there.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.960
And because your mother screamed at your father.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.040
And so all that together.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.160
And that's emotionally painful.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.520
Like, what's it feel like to be not to have a sense of worth?

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.640
That's painful.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.280
And so that's why my mantra is don't ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.640
And if you want to understand why the pain, you have to look at that person's life.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.400
And what the benefit of the addiction is?

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.600
That's something that you say in previous book that I found it's a flipping of narrative

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.160
where you say we should be asking what the benefit of the addiction is.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.480
Yeah.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.120
Well, like in your case, it gives me a sense of worth.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.880
Well, okay, I'll say to you, if you come to me because you say like I'm broke all like

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.400
it's causing some harm in my life.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.200
It's keeping me from intimate relationships.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.520
It makes me stressed and tired, whatever it is.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.160
It's the first thing I would ask you for you of you is what is it doing for you?

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.800
And you say a sense of worth and I'd say, you know what?

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.120
You deserve to have a sense of worth.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.120
I totally understand why you'd want to engage in an activity that gives it to you.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.960
But given that it's causing you harm, let's look at why you don't have a sense of worth

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.280
and how else you might develop it that isn't harmful to you, you know?

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.960
So, but you start with what's right about it.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.720
What are you looking for?

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.040
And what you're looking for is always valid.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.160
And how would one go about getting that sense of worth I'm asking for a friend?

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.120
Well, that would be a matter of some form of work.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.840
People who meditate often deal with that issue through the meditation, not always.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.880
Certainly therapy, you know?

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.440
By recognizing also that what you're doing to get the sense of worth doesn't really do it for you,

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.360
just by getting honest about it, you know?

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.760
So there's all kinds of ways, but the first step is the recognition.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.440
That's the first step that you say is missing from the book, which is that sort of awareness.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.560
The next thing which I've been, it's been really front of mind in my life recently,

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.440
because I've been asked this a few times on stage and I've been trying to find the words to

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.720
really articulate the importance of it is, and this is one of your forays in this book about

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.080
how to heal is authenticity. Really interesting concept, because I've been trying to articulate

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.480
why the fact that I've just shared all this stuff with you and the fact that I do this every week,

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.320
I'm getting closer and closer to that sort of authentic self where there's really,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.600
the mask is kind of dropping on me. Why that's been so healing for me.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.880
Why is authenticity such a good way, an important way for us to heal?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.960
It's much more than a way for us to heal. It's actually who we are.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.920
Like what you're really asking is, why is it important for a creature to be true to its own

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.120
nature? Because that's what we're meant to do. We're meant to be here as ourselves,

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.880
and when we're not ourselves because we had to abandon ourselves or betray ourselves,

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:09.440
disconnect from ourselves in order to survive, we lost connections with our essence.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:23.040
And how does it feel to be a successful CEO and more than realizing your financial dreams,

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.800
but to be a workaholic and not to be available to yourself in areas of your life that really matter

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:37.840
to you, as opposed to being honest about your stuff, sharing it with other people,

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:46.080
dropping the veil, dropping the... I mean, to answer your question, what does it feel like?

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.760
I mean, can you sense the difference in your body? Feel the lighter.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.280
Well, yeah. Expansive. Exactly. Well, that's the answer. That's why it's so important.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:03.360
It's so many of us live in authentic lives because, as you said, it's either

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.240
because from an early age, we were escaping some kind of reality in order to help us to

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:14.400
survive, or then the other thing that happens a bit later on in life is we develop an identity

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:21.520
which becomes a career, which becomes a social circle, which becomes a prison of our inauthentic

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.120
selves. We get trapped in there because I was good at something, or because I felt

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:34.160
accepted in this job as a lawyer. So I am now living inauthentically as this robot in this prison.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:45.120
And it's a... There's often a real perception of risk and loss and danger of trying to get

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.680
out of that prison, of trying to get close to our authentic selves. We feel like we'll lose our

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.400
friendship circle. We'll feel like we'll let our parents down who wanted us to become a lawyer.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.280
All of these things, I guess you see that a lot in your work.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:07.040
Well, there's that risk. But here's the issue. As a child, you had no choice but to go for

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.120
acceptance and being approved of and being received under any conditions.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.440
No matter what you had to give up of your authenticity,

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.840
you had to give up your authenticity. You had no choice in the matter. At a certain point as adults,

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.160
we learn that this lack of authenticity, this disconnection from ourselves, this separation

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:35.360
from our gut feelings is costing us. It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our peace of

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:43.760
mind, our relationship, our mental health, and so on. You'll never be as vulnerable again

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.320
as you were when you were a child. You'll never be as helpless, as dependent, as resourceless.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.800
No, it's true that if you develop the whole set of relationships based on your inauthentic persona,

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:07.120
some people in your life may not like it if you gradually move towards authenticity. They may

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:11.120
not like it. It's not what they wanted from you. You're going to find out who your friends are.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.280
You're really going to find, because your real friends will say, oh, I'm so happy for you.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.920
People are waiting for this. Other friends will say, it's not what I signed up for.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.320
The question is, you still have to decide. As an infant, as a young child, I had no agency

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:35.280
in the choice of authenticity and attachment. No, I do. Which one do I want to go with?

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.000
What is the cost of being inauthentic? I can't make that decision for anybody else.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.240
Nobody can make that decision for anybody else. But most people will find that choosing authenticity

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.720
has benefits way beyond whatever they might lose. That's what I find.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.400
And you said the word that agency, which is the second of the four A's on how to heal. Now,

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.560
agency, when I read that word, I hear like personal responsibility, taking personal

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:06.880
responsibility over my life. Exactly. Which also means not letting, you know, you don't use,

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.160
you don't wear trauma as a badge, you know, or you don't use it as a get out of jail pass in a

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.120
game of Monopoly. Oh, I was traumatized. So I can't, I can't be any other way. You know, I mean,

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.440
Giving all the power to the puppet master. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So agency means actually,

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.920
I take responsibility not for what happened to me,

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.120
not even how I interpreted the world as a result going backwards,

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.040
but how I interpret the world from now on. Do I still want to interpret the world

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.960
and my role in it based on some decision I made when I was a one year old?

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.640
That's where agency comes in. Agency also means that if I have

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.640
any kind of dysfunction or illness, it's not just that I put my hands in the hands of a,

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.720
put my, my fate in the hands of a, a physician or a healer, but I, I have agent, I make the

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.320
decisions. I listen to your advice. I accept some, I don't accept some, but I'm the one who's making

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:10.160
the decisions along with what seems right to me. So agency. It's interesting in your,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.400
in your work, throughout your work, you use alliteration as a lot, as a way to kind of

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.240
summarize and make ideas really memorable. It really helps. It's a little trick.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.960
It's a trick. It's a writing trick, right? Well, it's, it also works, you know, before

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:31.200
A's or the four of us, but I don't, I don't want to say, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm denigrating

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.800
my work. If I say it's a trick, no, it's just something, just the way things occur to me.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.600
That's all it is. One of the, one of the, um, alliteration devices you use is also

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.840
relates to limiting beliefs and how we can undo self-limiting beliefs with the five Rs.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:52.640
Yeah. Relabel, reattribute, refocus, re, revalue and recreate. Yeah. Now, from what I

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.600
understood of those, relabeling is

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.720
the story and the belief that is limiting to us, um, sort of redefining it. Well,

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:10.240
it takes something like, um, your work journalism. Yeah. I need to go to work. I need to do this work.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.520
Yeah. Relabeling is, I don't need to do this work. I just have a belief that I need to do this work.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.000
Okay. So that real building just takes a degree of separation from the

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.600
behavior. And, and actually it's true. It's not that you need to do all this work. You have this

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:32.160
belief. So relabeling just says it for what it is. By the way, I have to acknowledge that I,

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.520
these, these five Rs, only one in his mind. I stole the other four from a psychiatrist.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.240
That's fine. That's all.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.960
Yeah. Just, I, I mentioned that in the book, but I find it very helpful technique, but

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.760
it was developed for people with obsessive-compulsive tendencies.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.320
So the relabel is not that I have to wash my hand a hundred times. I just have a belief that I have

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.560
to wash my hand a hundred times. That's the context in which it was developed. I think it works for

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.600
all kinds of, all kinds of, um, dynamics. And then if I, and then so I've relabelled it,

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.560
I don't have to work to feel a sense of validation, but I have a belief that I do.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.160
That's right. And then I reattribute it, which is the second R,

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.880
which means I get clear on where it's come from.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:19.280
Yeah. So let's say you have the belief that you're not worth it. It's not two that are not worth it.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.800
I just have a belief that I'm not worth it. Okay. Or it may not be two that are not worth it,

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.120
but I do have a belief that I'm not worth it. Re-attribute means this is an old brain circuit

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.440
sending me an old message. It's got nothing to do with reality. It has to do with some

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.120
experience that I had a long time ago. That's the reattribute. You just say,

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.760
where is it actually coming from? There's a circuit in your brain that's wired with the message.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.600
You're not worth it. And it's going to keep repeating that message.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.160
Well, you say, okay, that's where it's coming from.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.480
Until I refocus, which is the third R.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:59.840
Yeah. So refocus is just to give us some space. So if they ever say, I need to go to work,

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.680
okay, refocus means well, for five minutes, maybe in five minutes I'll go to work,

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:12.960
for five minutes I won't. I'm going to put on some piece of music or go for a walk or meditate or

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:19.680
whatever. So you refocus, you put the intention somewhere else. Just so that to prove to yourself,

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.400
but you actually have some agency over your brain. If only for five minutes,

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.560
if you have this belief that I'm not worth it. Well, you can go back to it in five minutes if

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.280
you want. Just for five minutes though, consider all the ways that you made a contribution.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.680
Consider all the ways that people have acknowledged your benign presence in their lives.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.720
The times that people have told you that they've loved you or that you told somebody else,

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.720
just for five minutes, hang out with that. Five minutes later, if you want to go back to this

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.600
belief or if you can't help going back to this belief that you're not worth it, well, that's okay.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.880
But at least create some space. It's all about creating space between yourself and these beliefs

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.840
or these behaviors. And in that five minutes, you're basically accepting new evidence to be

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.520
true or you're proving that other evidence is true. I didn't need to go and work. Well,

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.080
you're also proving that you don't have to spend all your time subjected to those beliefs.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.960
You can take a hiatus from it, at least for a while. And that they are not you. They're not you,

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:28.960
yeah. And then revalue. Revalue it really what it should mean or maybe more accurately devalue

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.840
because you say, what has been the actual value? This believed that I'm not worth it.

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.440
What has been the actual value of it in my life? Or this tendency of mine to be a workaholic?

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:45.840
What has been the actual value? Oh, it made me tired. It made me alienated or it keeps me depressed

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.000
or it keeps me hopelessly trying to prove something which I can never prove to myself

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.560
anyway through external activity. So you actually look at what does it mean is actually impact on

01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.480
your life? What has been this real value? Sometimes the value is positive, right? Like I

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.280
think about my own workaholic workaholism, if that's the term, I think there's some

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:11.040
there's some positives here. Yeah, a lot of negatives. Yeah. Well, is the positive due

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.720
to workaholism? Or is it due to your capacity to work hard and on behalf of a goal? They're not the

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:23.600
same. Your capacity to work hard to achieve a certain goal is simply a gift that you have.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.440
And something that maybe takes some discipline and application on your part.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:35.520
That's not workaholism. That's just a strong positive work ethic. The workaholism is when

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.520
you're driven to work, you actually don't need to. It's funny because it reminds me of an analogy

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.760
I've been talking about in the last couple of episodes of this podcast, the distinction between

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.600
being driven and being dragged. Yeah. It's like, which side of the lorry am I flying down the

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.920
motorway? Am I tied to the front and am I running and pulling the lorry? Or am I just like my ankles

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.520
attached to the back of the lorry as it flies down the motorway because I'm being dragged?

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.120
But if I may, I would say that neither of those are particularly desirable.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.640
But but but it's the distinction that I made before between being driven and being called.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.640
Yeah. Because if you're called, you see, if I call you say, Stephen, would you come and have

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.720
dinner with me? You can say yes, you can say no, I just gave you a call and you can say

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:26.080
literally I'm talking about calling a telephone call. You know, you can say yes, you can say no.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.160
It's a decision though. But you're the one who's making the decision. Yeah. When you're dragged

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.240
or pushed or pulled, you're not making the decision. I'm a slave to the decision, to that,

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.600
to the activity. One of the one of the really interesting things I wanted to talk to you about

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:46.560
is ADHD. Yeah. I've had a few of my friends and my close friendship circle diagnosed with ADHD

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.560
recently. And then I looked into some of the statistics around ADHD. And I found this statistic

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:58.640
that said in the 1980s, one in 20 US children were diagnosed with ADHD. Today, the number is roughly

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:06.320
one in nine. Yeah. And just generally, you know, around me there's it feels like and this could

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.640
just be because of my own little narrow circle or it could be because of a wider thing happening

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.760
in society. It feels like there's been an increase in diagnosis of mental illness and things like

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:23.120
ADHD. And the causes when I spoke to my friend about what he believed the cause of his ADHD

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.080
was and he's posted this on LinkedIn and talks about it very publicly now.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:34.400
It seemed to point to he seemed to believe it was relating to some kind of genetic or

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:42.400
heritable factor. Yeah. Now, the issue that I've sort of been contending with myself and why I

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.440
spoke to Johan Hari about this and others about this is if I if I am to accept that,

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:54.240
then I am I feel like I'm accepting that we're being born somewhat broken. And this is almost

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.040
what Johan Hari talked about in the early stages of his teenage years where he he was made to believe

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.400
that there was this chemical imbalance in his brain and therefore he was born broken and here's

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.760
the medication to solve it. Yeah. So but I don't want I don't believe that I don't I don't personally

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.080
believe that we're we're born broken. Well, anybody in the subject might do what I think Johan

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.600
and actually there's to read my book on ADHD is called scattered minds. And I was diagnosed

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.640
within my fifties and so were a couple of my kids. But but I never bought into the idea this is a

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:31.040
genetic disease or there's a disease at all genetic or otherwise. Now, as for the rising number of

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.560
people being diagnosed with it, there could be two reasons at least one is we're better

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:42.080
diagnosis or before we wouldn't have noticed it but now we are. Or genuinely, there's more people

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.960
who are having trouble in certain ways such as with attention and impulse control and so on.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.800
But either way, the fact is that many more children are being diagnosed and medicated

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:58.240
for this condition, particularly in the US, but also increasingly here in the UK as well,

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:07.680
and in China and elsewhere. Now, as I said earlier, if we the fact is here's the actual reality.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:13.360
Nobody's ever found a gene for ADHD. Nobody's ever found a gene that says, if you have this gene,

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:18.320
you're going to have ADHD. No such genes have been found. No group of genes have been found that

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.800
says if you're going to have this gene, you're going to have this condition, nor ever will be.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.280
And no such gene or group of genes have ever been found that if you don't have these genes,

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.480
you will not have the condition. No, there are some diseases that are genetic. One runs in my

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.000
family, muscular dystrophy. If you have the gene, you're going to have the disease. My mother had it,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
my aunt had it. That's a genetic condition. And if you have the gene, you'll have the disease.

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:54.000
Very rare, those kind of diseases. No, there are some genes that the more of them you have,

01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.000
the more likely you are to have any number of mental health diagnoses, ADHD, depression, anxiety,

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:06.880
even psychosis, bipolar illness. But there's no group of genes or set of genes or gene that

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:11.840
themselves determine any one condition. As a matter of fact, you can have those same genes

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:17.760
and not have any condition whatsoever. So something's being passed on, but it's not

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:23.040
any kind of condition that's being passed on. What's being passed on is sensitivity. And the more

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.840
sensitive you are, the more you're going to feel whatever's going on in the environment.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:33.760
So you take the same sensitive kid with these genes that confer greater sensitivity out of them,

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:40.000
and sensitive means to feel, from the Latin word to feel, sincere. The more sensitive you are,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.640
the more you're going to feel. The more you feel, the more bad stuff happens, the more pain you're

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.120
going to be in, and the more compensating you're going to have to do. At the same time, with those

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.760
same genes, if you treat it well and you grow up in a healthy environment, you just be creative and

01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:01.200
happy and joyful and a leader and an artist or a shaman or a very creative CEO or whatever you're

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:08.080
going to be. So the genes don't determine. They make you more sensitive to their environment. No,

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.520
if you go back to what I said about the tuning out, it's simply a defense. So the more sensitive you

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:19.200
are and the stress in the environment, the more you're going to feel the stress, the more you're

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:26.400
going to need to escape from it by tuning out. So it didn't inherit ADHD. You inherited a sensitivity

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.520
that makes it more likely under stressful circumstances that you revert to tuning out

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.720
when your brain is developing, which by the way is an organ that develops physiologically

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:42.160
under the impact of the emotional environment. So if there's a lot of stress in a child's life,

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.080
and what I'm saying is in this society is that more and more parents are stressed,

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.320
not because they don't love their kids, not because they're not doing their very utmost to

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:54.400
provide for them, but because they're more stressed through all kinds of social, political,

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.720
economic reasons than if you look at inflation in Britain, which is a high risk right now,

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:05.280
more people are going to be stressed financially. Financial stress on the parents translates into

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.920
physiological stress in the children. Those children may want to tune out because it's too

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.600
much to be in the present. Some of them will be diagnosed with ADHD. They didn't inherit anything

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:21.040
in terms of a disease. They're just reacting to the environment. So if we're diagnosing more

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.360
and more kids these days, I think it's because the parenting environment has become much more

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.320
stressed. And that's backed up in this book where you mentioned that study of 65,000 parents

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:36.240
and their children with ADHD, right? There's more trauma in their lives.

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.760
So the children, they do a study with 65,000?

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.040
I forget. You're better than I am.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.440
It was 65,000. I read it three hours ago.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.640
Yeah, but many thousands of kids, yeah.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.480
So because I found that to be really, really sort of supportive of what you just said where,

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:56.800
again, I'm saying this from memory, but a study of 65,000 children and their parents,

01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:02.960
and they found that those parents who had more adverse traumatic events in their lives

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.360
ended up having a higher chance of having a child that had ADHD.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.720
Well, look, if you look at the United States at least,

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:17.200
poor kids and kids of so-called color are much more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.640
Interesting.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.160
No, why would that be the case? Because they're living with so much more stress.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.400
Men as well, right?

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.320
Men as well. Adults, you mean?

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.680
Men, yeah. So I read that more men or boys are diagnosed.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:36.640
More men are diagnosed partly because in men, the symptom of hyperactivity seems to be there,

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.240
more often. So when a kid is sitting in school and the cancer is still,

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.440
that's obvious. The teacher will notice it. The girl who's kind of dreamy and tunes out

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.320
kind of fades away at the back of the class. She doesn't create any problems.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.240
So that's one of the reasons.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:03.440
But also, funny to say, but young boys, infant boys are more sensitive to environmental pressure

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.800
than girls are for some strange reason. So they're more likely to be affected by these factors.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.320
Seeing a boy like that in the class, that's a fidgety that has a poor attention span,

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:20.240
bad response to stress. We medicate. What is the impact of that approach to treatment,

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.600
medicating super early? I used to, when I worked as a physician, I would certainly prescribe

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.560
medications sometimes. It's a question of who's prescribing and what intention.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.000
If I understand that the real problem in this child is not that there's anything intrinsically

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.360
wrong with the child, but that they were developed in a stressed environment and no stresses are

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.720
still acting on them. And one of the stresses is the parents don't understand the kids' behaviors

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:52.160
and they tend to react rather harshly. Then if I can help the parent understand

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:57.120
the sensitive nature of their child, which also means that when positive changes occur in the

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:02.320
environment, the kid will be very responsive to that as well. If the parents can create a positive,

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.360
accepting, understanding atmosphere in the home and work on their own stresses so they don't

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.840
unconsciously pass them on to their kids, that kid will change very quickly. And I say, well,

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.160
if in the short term, the child wants the medication to function better and no child should

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:24.080
be forced to take medication and medication are never the final answer that the very most

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.120
there stop cap. There's no proof whatsoever that medications help anybody heal from ADHD.

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.560
They simply suppress symptoms, which may be helpful in the short term, but for God's sakes,

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.760
go to work on the long-term development of that child. And what does that mean?

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.360
Create the conditions in which healthy development takes place. That child will do very, very well.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.760
If you think the problem is a disease, they're just going to medicate away the symptoms of.

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.840
What about for adults? I'm thinking of my friend there. He's in his 30s and he got the diagnosis

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.560
of ADHD in his 30s. He's been given this medication, which he presumably has to take for life.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.880
He's told me the medication has helped him focus. Has helped him focus. He's been a game changer,

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.080
Steve. Yeah, I've taken medication myself for ADHD and it helped me focus. It helped me write

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.840
my first book. I didn't take it for this one. As a matter of fact, more recently, when I was

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.760
beginning to write the medication, I thought maybe I would take a bit of stimulant like I used to.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.720
And just to see if it helps me write the book better, all it did is give me side effects.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.800
My brain has changed. I don't need it anymore. So I would say to your friend,

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.160
if the medication is helping you right now and it's not causing you side effects,

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.520
I got nothing against it. And you might want to give it a break every weekend.

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.320
If you don't, you might want to use it for when you're having to work or having to concentrate,

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:51.280
but it's up to you. If it helps you function, take it, but go to work on the traumas and

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:58.480
stresses driving the ADHD, going back to your childhood. And I may say my book on ADHD,

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.800
scattered minds does outline some ways to do that. You might find that you don't need the medication

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:11.520
so much anymore or not at all, perhaps. Number one, number two, even if you do,

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:17.920
your life will be so much fuller and so much more less stressed if you deal with the underlying

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:23.600
factors than if you simply medicate the symptom. Is there, I always think in life there's a cost

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.480
for all these things we use to medicate and stimulate ourselves. And so I always ask myself,

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.600
like there's got to be a catch here. And even for coffee, I'm like, what's the catch? We can't

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.520
just be all up and positive. And with my friend, when he said, when he had the conversation with me

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.680
about being on this medication for life, my first thought is like, okay, what's the cost?

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.720
It's going to make you really focused and better at work. But what is the long term cost of?

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.360
I'd have to talk to your friend. Those are good questions to ask. When I took medication,

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.880
it made me a much more efficient workaholic. It did nothing for my workaholicism,

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:03.040
just made me much better at it because I could stay up later now and I was more focused.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:09.280
I could even more things done. So you got to deal with these other issues.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:10.720
Did you?

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:19.760
I did. Did I deal with them? Yes, I have. And there's so much more like dealing with the trauma.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:25.120
Like I'm telling you, if your friend's got ADHD, I can tell you he had to stress early for years.

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.600
And his parents were stressed. His parents were stressed. So deal with that. Deal with what

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.480
conditions are you creating now in your life that create more stress for you?

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.480
Are you taking care of your body? Are you exercising? Are you eating well? Do you get out

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.880
there in nature? Nature has a certain kind of harmony to it, which actually calms the mind.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.400
So are you doing all these things? If you're not, all you're doing is medicating a symptom.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.560
If you are taking the medication specifically to help you focus, but you're working on his other

01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.080
issues, you live a much full life and you may find you don't need the medication after all.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:11.280
You came off the medication for your ADD. Because I'm just not that medically well versed,

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.440
what's the difference between ADD and ADHD? It's a kind of confusion. ADHD simply means

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:23.040
that the hyperactivity is present. So you can have ADD without hyperactivity. So the actual

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:32.400
you know, proper way to divide it is ADD. And in brackets, HD so that indicating that the

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.680
hyperactivity may or may not be there. Got you. So you, you, you were on medication,

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:43.520
you did the work, you know, not on medication. Do you still have the symptoms of ADD?

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.400
To a certain degree, but not in a way that anyway, blights my life. Like one thing I can

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.560
pity, be sure that when I go on a speaking trip, I'm going to lose something. I'm going to lose my,

01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:01.440
my portable electrical tooth cleaner, where I'm going to, in this case, I left my rain jacket

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.360
in Budapest when I came here on. You can take it for granted that my attention will just not

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.200
notice something that I haven't packed yet. That's okay. I'm going back to Budapest next week. So

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.320
I get to get my rain jacket back. But sometimes it's the cost of being me. So what? You know,

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.160
so no, not in every way, but that's not the point. Nobody's life has to be perfect.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:25.520
It just has to be a life that I want to live and I can enjoy living.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:32.880
That I have, you know, so who cares if sometimes I forget something or I lose something or

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.560
even if I'm listening to a symphony and I can't keep my attention on it. Okay, so I can't.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.120
This, you talk about this some toxic society. Yeah.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:49.520
Do you think society is getting more toxic? And if so, why?

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:56.000
What measure shall we use? You know, if we use the measure of a number of kids being medicated,

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:03.440
the number of adults having chronic illness or immune disease, number of students,

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:12.480
university students being depressed, contemplating suicide, number of children in the United States

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:18.880
killing themselves, the number of people on medications of all kinds,

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.240
the degree of safety that people have in society, the ranker or piece that characterizes

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:33.440
political discourse in this world, the intolerable fact that eight people in the world,

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:40.480
I think, own as much as the bottom half, as the bottom 3.5 billion. You know, if I look at all

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:46.000
those things by those measures, if we look at what's happening to the environment, if I look

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.400
at the fact that the people who are the worst polluters in the environment also happen to be

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:58.640
the most successful people by a certain measure of success. By any number of parameters, if I look at

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:09.040
how racism still affects the lives of so many people and not just affects it in an emotional

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:16.640
sense, but actually physiologically, you know, then yeah, this is a toxic society and those

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.520
measures are getting worse, they're not getting better and inequality is getting worse here in the

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:29.360
UK and elsewhere. So yeah, I think it's getting more toxic. What's the antidote? Well, how about

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:34.080
people back to this word awareness? Like people just have to get that this is how it is. And

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.560
in the last chapter, I don't lay out a political program, you know, I don't see that as my role

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.520
to do that. I have my own political ideas and preferences, but I don't want to impose them on

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.920
the reader. But I do say, first of all, we have to lose our illusions that this is that this

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.480
normality is actually healthy or natural. You have to just get cognizant that what we consider

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:06.720
to be normal is actually bad for us. Number one, number two, just if we introduced the concept

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:13.920
of trauma into healthcare, the average doctor again, strange to say, doesn't hear a single

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.880
lecture in their medical training about the impact of trauma on physical or mental health,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:24.800
which is astonishing. Given that it was a British psychologist, Dr. Richard Bentall,

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:30.320
who pointed out not that many years ago, that the evidence linking what we call mental illness and

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.800
childhood adversity is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.680
And the average physician doesn't hear a word about that. It's astonishing.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.640
Education, teachers, if they understood child development, brain development,

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.960
the developmental factors that children need, that I cite in this book. And if they understood

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.320
how trauma affects kids' capacity to learn, to pay attention, and to behave in functional ways,

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:06.640
the Daily Telegraph here in London, not that long ago, was bemoaning the fact that kids

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:13.760
aren't caned anymore in schools. I mean, what they were moaning about is that we no longer

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:20.320
traumatize kids quite as harshly as we used to. That's all it does, caning. So if teachers

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:25.120
understood that the behaviors on the part of children are actually manifestations of

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:31.760
emotional dynamics of frustration and needs not being met, and very often of trauma,

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.840
that would change the educational system. If the legal system understood it,

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.640
that most people facing the criminal justice system are actually traumatized people.

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:49.280
They could actually be rehabilitated and healed if we understood that, instead of just

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.680
exposing them to harsh punishments, we actually treated them like human beings

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.600
who may have done things that are unacceptable, but that came from traumas they couldn't have helped,

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:05.040
and that they can be helped back to healthy functioning, as we know from lots of experience.

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:13.920
Just that little trauma information would change society. So that's what I can offer as a physician.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.040
What about parents? What do they need to know?

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:22.880
Yeah, well, if parents actually understood, first of all, that the first three years are

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:29.200
everything, that if they get the template right in the first three years, they can hardly set a foot

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.800
wrong afterwards. But on the other hand, if we're not present for our kids emotionally,

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:41.440
if we don't understand them, if we don't see them, if we don't attune to their emotional states,

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.600
we're going to hurt them. And if they understood what the needs of children are,

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.760
when I mentioned some of them, for play, for experience of all emotions, for

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:59.840
unconditional loving attachment, for the child being able to rest from having to work

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:04.880
to make the relationship work. So the child doesn't have to be good or nice or beautiful or

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.960
successful. They just have to be. So we don't impose conditions on our approval and acceptance

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.720
on them. If parents just understood that, and if they understood how important it is that they

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:23.440
take care of their own emotional needs so that a child doesn't have to take responsibility,

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.680
like perhaps you did for the parents stresses. If parents understood all that, and if society

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.680
actually understood how important parenting was, and it supported parents who needed the support

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:42.480
to be there for their kids, wouldn't be financially costly, it would save us a lot of money.

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.480
Not to mention, we'd have a lot more happier kids who don't need to be on medications. So, yeah.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:54.080
And lastly, schools. Schools? Well, again, like I said about educators, if educators, well, here's

01:46:54.080 --> 01:47:00.480
the thing. If you look at how does the human brain develop? I quote an article from the Harvard

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.760
Center on the Developing Child that appeared in a journal, Pediatrics, official journal of the

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:14.560
American Pediatric Academy in 2012, February. The article said that the human brain develops

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:21.360
through a complex process that begins before birth and continues into adulthood. Okay. Now,

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:27.200
that means A, we take care of the emotional needs of pregnant women. Number one. Number two, if it

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.320
continues into adulthood, continues into adulthood, then the job of the schools, if they understand

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:41.120
it right, is not to teach kids what year the Battle of Austerlitz took place, or the Battle of Waterloo,

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:49.840
or algebra, any of that stuff. The most important job of the schools is to promote

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:55.520
healthy brain development. With a child whose healthy brain development will actually be naturally

01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:02.160
curious, they'll want to know about history. They'll be keen to absorb the skills of algebra.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:09.280
They'll want to know how to use a computer, and they'll want to know how to write properly. The

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:15.840
kids will want to do that spontaneously, because mastery and learning, these are human hungers,

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:22.880
they're human needs. So, in other words, the most important job of the schools is not to

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:28.720
cram the kids full of information, but to help them develop healthy brains. What does that require?

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.760
Safety, above all. Lack of pressure. Healthy relationship with nurturing adults.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.720
And if the kids are not going to spend their time with the adult, with the parents,

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.800
which they can't in this society, like they used to throughout human evolution, let them

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.080
spend their time with adults who are emotionally nurturing and emotionally penetrating the

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:54.800
attentive to the child's needs. Now you're going to have schools that are going to really teach

01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.720
kids something and where kids will want to learn. And it's very simple. It doesn't take more training

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.840
and it doesn't take more. Well, it takes some training, perhaps, but not more than what teachers

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:12.240
are getting now. So that's sort of a take in education. I was thinking there about the importance

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:17.760
of doing certain psychological tests on certain teachers, because if they are also passing on a

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.480
generational cycle of their own at a time when my brain is still being developed, they can have a

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:28.000
huge impact positively or negatively on my life in the same way that my parents could. Absolutely.

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.040
It's quite remarkable. Teachers don't know how much power they have because of the vulnerability

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:39.440
of the young brain. And well-meaning teachers will sometimes behave in ways that are really

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.240
hurtful to kids, just because they don't get it, not because they don't mean well. So I've had many

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:50.000
adults sit in my office say, with tears in their eyes, it was something a teacher said to them

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:59.280
three decades before. The class will continue and Johnny comes back to earth. This kind of sarcastic

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:06.320
little dig can undermine a child's dignity and sense of self so easily. So if teachers just

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.880
understood how powerful they are and how important they are in helping to promote healthy brain

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.200
development, I think their profession will take on a whole new meaning that will be much more

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:20.640
satisfying than it is right now. It's not the fault of individual teachers. We're talking about a

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:30.640
system that is toxic. Gabor, we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the previous

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:37.680
guest asks a question for the next guest. I didn't get to see it until I open the book. So

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.800
there's a question written here for you. Before I ask you this question, I did have a question of

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:48.160
my own, which was you're in your 70s now. What are you still working on in terms of your own

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.880
traumas? Is there anything, even though you're in a later stage of your own life, that you're still

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.960
sort of struggling with as it relates to that puppet master pulling on the strings and

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:07.280
that kind of analogy that we gave earlier? Yeah. It's a sense of peace when I'm not doing anything.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:20.960
Just being the capacity just to be. That's something I'm still looking for. Not

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:26.000
looking for like, I was looking for a lost puppy, but I'm still searching myself for it.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.640
And where exactly does that come from in your own diagnosis?

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:37.600
How about if I tell you when I find out? I mean, I can give you a textbook answer,

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:42.080
but it wouldn't be authentic. Okay. So you don't know?

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:58.960
Entirely? I have some senses. I have some ideas. And then it really means being okay with my mind

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:04.000
the way it is and not needing it to be any different. That's what it would mean,

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.240
which means if I'm sitting there for five minutes, I don't have to reach for the cell phone to occupy

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:18.560
my mind. Now, in the midst of this busy book tour and all the speaking I do, I don't do enough to

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:25.920
take care of that quiet little voice inside myself. I don't. I think it would take some attention.

01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:31.520
I can't either though. I can't sit for five minutes. I couldn't sit for five seconds without

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:35.680
grabbing my phone. It's weird. I noticed the other day that I was like going to the toilet,

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.640
and I had no intention of using my phone in the toilet, but I went to get my phone to go to the

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.320
toilet. But you can't be alone with yourself. Yeah, I can't be alone with myself. I can't,

01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:50.320
sitting for 30 seconds, you know, my brain, is that because they've built these algorithms to

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:54.080
stimulate my dopamine? Or is it because there's something in me? I guess it goes back to a

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:58.640
point of addiction. Well, it's both. I mean, they certainly create algorithms to stimulate

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.200
your brain and get you hooked on a dopamine hit. They're sure for sure. They call that neural

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.760
marketing. Neural marketing. Can you get that? Neural marketing. They work on your brain to get,

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.800
you know, to get you addicted. But it also comes from an earlier discomfort with the self that predates

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:19.200
any cell phone use. It goes back to earliest childhood, where it couldn't have been comfortable

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:30.560
to be just with yourself because of circumstances. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah, because I've got

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:36.400
friends that don't have the same addiction with their cell phones that I do. They can take it

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.200
or leave it. They put it outside their bedroom when they go to bed charging in the kitchen. I'm

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.880
like, I have to hold mine like my pillow. Yeah, exactly. Well, like your little safety pillow.

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.480
And what's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? I grab it with one eye open,

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.800
and all that gunk in my eye. I'm like trying to just, you know. Yeah. Well, how do both of you

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:58.160
and I work on not doing that so much? Okay. I'll give you my number. We shouldn't discuss why I

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.680
phone how we're getting on with this. That's just another reason to use my phone. But next time I

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:08.000
speak to you in person, you can update me on how you're getting on with that. I am working on it.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.600
I'm working on it. I think I've got to become more cognizant of the cost of that addiction.

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:19.600
Well, exactly. To really, I know one of the costs is meaningful connections and presence with

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.760
and the cost to interpersonal relationships. But maybe I haven't had the cost

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.600
impact me enough yet, maybe. The question left for you,

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.640
but I don't know the signature, so I'll have to figure that out later, but is

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.080
what's your selfish dream?

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.800
You know what? I'm not sure how to sit with that question, because I'm not trying to get out of

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:58.960
it, but I'm just looking at my own reaction to it. At this point, I don't have too many,

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.440
what does it mean selfish, by the way? Let me ask you that. What does that mean?

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:10.080
Something that is for me at the expense of others? I don't think I have any dreams like that left.

01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.440
I might have, not might have, I did have at some point. But if I have a dream

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:23.200
for myself in that sense of self-enhancing dreams, something that enhances my ego or something,

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.640
well, if this book sold a billion copies, well, that would be a nice selfish dream, you know?

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:34.720
But I don't know how else to answer that. I do have dreams, but they're more about

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:42.960
the state of the world that I'd like to see, the world I'd like to see, future generations inherit.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.520
Selfless dreams. Yeah. Well, I don't have to self-less, because it certainly involves

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.520
my own history and certainly would make me feel better. So in that sense, it's selfish, you might

01:55:53.520 --> 01:56:01.440
say. But they don't have to do with personal, I have enough. I've done enough and I have enough.

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.320
So I don't have anything lacking that I need to dream about.

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.760
All of our self-less dreams are also very much selfish in that regard as well.

01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:14.240
They're going to help us. It's selfish in a different sense. I mean,

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:20.720
any dreams I have about a better world certainly have the function of making me feel better,

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:28.400
of maybe even the stuff that happened to me or the stuff that happened to you,

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.800
it would mean a lot to me if they didn't happen to any more children, you know?

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.600
So in the sense that it would mean a lot to me, you might say it's selfish,

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.480
but it's not purely about me. It's about something larger. I'm not trying to paint myself as a kind

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.920
of a altruistic saint. I'm just saying that would make me feel better. If I really knew

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.600
that kids in Gaza didn't have to face any more bombings, if kids in Israel didn't have to face

01:56:53.600 --> 01:57:00.960
any more danger of terrorist attacks, if not that I see inequality there, but I'd like that for

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:08.080
both of them. If kids in Ukraine didn't have to live under the threat of missiles falling,

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.440
if people in Russia didn't have to live with the fear of perhaps a nuclear conflict or the

01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:23.040
young man being conscripted into a war, if kids in Britain didn't have to live in poverty,

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.280
would that make you feel better? So to the extent that it makes us feel better,

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.080
you might say it's selfish, but is it?

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.280
Gabel, thank you. Well, my pleasure. Thank you so much.

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.160
Thank you so much for writing such an important book. I think my only wish is that I discovered

01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:48.160
this book sooner, because I think so many of my, I think it would have liberated,

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.240
that's a good word, liberated me from a series of things that would have helped me to live a

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.560
much better life and to understand myself. That's the point of awareness that we talked about.

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.560
I know that your advanced age is over, isn't it?

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.480
I think we all want the answers even sooner, because we reflect on some of the consequences

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:09.760
or the mistakes that we made. Not that I'm imprisoned by any of those, but it's so

01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:15.440
wonderful that this book now exists. You're a name that I started to be peppered with by my

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:20.480
audience over and over again, specifically in the last 12 months. People, really, really young

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.080
people were messaging me and asking me to have a conversation with you about the topics we've

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:30.000
talked about today, things like ADHD and their trauma and so much. And I sit here every day

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:38.880
talking to a lot of people on this podcast. And I think my understanding of trauma has forever been

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:45.680
redefined by both this conversation today, but also by your book. And I really, I'm so thankful

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:49.680
to you because I think that'll help me speak on the topic with more accuracy and therefore,

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:56.880
hopefully, help other people understand their own trauma in a more meaningful way. It's just such

01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:02.080
an important book. Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to talk

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:07.040
about my work and just the opportunity to meet you. Thanks a lot. And it's written in such an

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:11.040
accessible way, which is so important because that means it can reach even more people.

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.040
Thank you so much. Okay, thank you.

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:38.420
you
