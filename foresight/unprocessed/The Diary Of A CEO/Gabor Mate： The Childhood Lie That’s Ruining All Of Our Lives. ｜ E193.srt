1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Financial stress on the parents translates into physiological stress in the children.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,360
They didn't inherit anything in terms of a disease.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,040
They're just reacting to the environment.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,560
People call Dr. Gabomate the people whisperer.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,720
Legendary thinker and bestselling author.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,680
He's highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,120
The evidence linking mental illness and childhood adversity

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,640
is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,520
Any average physician doesn't hear a word about that.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,480
It's astonishing.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
I can give you the example of Donald Trump.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,400
I mean, his father was a psychopath.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,400
You are the enemy of the people.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,880
Go ahead.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
For him, these were not choices so much as survival techniques.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
And that's the mark of a traumatized child, a denial of reality.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
My grandparents were killed in Auschwitz.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
And my mother and I barely survived.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,040
And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,120
The sense, I guess, that I'm being rejected and abandoned because I'm not good enough.

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,920
How did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,520
Any number of ways.

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,320
See, trauma, as I define it, is not about what happens to us.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,680
It's about what happens inside of us as a result of what happens to us.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our relationship, our mental health, and so on.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
How does one go about correcting that?

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
It's a multi-layered answer.

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,040
First of all.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,520
Before this episode begins, I just want to say a huge thank you to all of our new subscribers.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,000
74% of you that watch this channel didn't subscribe before.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
And we're now down to about 71%.

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,440
So that helps us in a number of ways that are quite hard to explain.

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,720
But simply, the bigger the channel gets, the bigger the guests get.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
So if you haven't yet subscribed to The Diary of a CEO,

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
if I could have any favors from you, if you've ever watched this show and enjoyed it,

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,400
it's just to please hit the subscribe button.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,120
Without further ado, I'm Stephen Butler.

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,960
And this is The Diary of a CEO.

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
I hope nobody's listening.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
But if you are, then please keep this to yourself.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
My dear little man.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,640
Only after many long months do I take it in hand, the pen,

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,840
so that I may briefly sketch for you the unspeakable horrors of those times,

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
the details of which I do not wish you to know.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,960
Those are words that your mother wrote into her diary

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,800
in the 1940s during the Holocaust.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
She wrote those words in April of 1945,

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,640
three months after the Soviet Army expelled the Nazis from Budapest,

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
which is where we live.

51
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,640
So she's referring to the previous year and the beginning of that year,

52
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,520
late 1944 and early 1945.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
And in those diary entries,

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,520
she's addressing many of them to you directly as a baby.

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,120
She wrote a diary to me directly,

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,720
as if it was like a count of my life addressed to me.

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
You talk so much in all your books and much of your work

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
about the importance of that early context.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
It's really been the centre point of all the writing that I've read recently.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
And I know because it's so evident in everything that you've done

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
that that's been a key, your own early context has been a key inspiration

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,320
for why you've taken such an interest in these topics.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,320
What was your early context?

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,040
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,800
So it's just a fact about human beings that the template that forms us

66
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,160
will affect how we see the world, how we understand ourselves,

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
how we relate to other people.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,760
And that really template is our earliest months, even in Utah,

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,120
already in the womb, we're being affected by the environment,

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
but certainly in the early years when our brain is being formed

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
and our personality is taking shape.

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,600
And so that forms our worldview.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,920
My worldview was, in my sense of self,

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
was shaped by the fact that at two months of age,

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
when I was two months of age, the German army occupied Hungary.

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
Hungary was the last country in Eastern Europe

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,160
where the Jewish population had not been exterminated.

78
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,120
And that was our turn.

79
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
The day after the German army marched into Budapest,

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,360
which was March the 19th, 1944,

81
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,200
the day after my mother called the pediatrician to say,

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,120
would you please come and see Gabor?

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,640
Because he's crying all the time.

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,240
And the doctor said, of course I'll come,

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
but all my Jewish babies are crying.

86
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
And so that the fact is that when mothers are stressed or in pain,

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
the infant feels all that and takes it personally,

88
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,720
and it becomes part of their template for how they view the world.

89
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
So that was that year, that's when that year began

90
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
in which my grandparents were killed in Auschwitz

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
and my father was away in forced labor.

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
And my mother and I barely survived.

93
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
And it's a story I've told many times,

94
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,560
but that's when my brain is developing

95
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
and that's when I'm forming my sense of myself.

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,160
And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
and I don't see her for six weeks.

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
The sense I get is that I'm not wanted

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
and I'm being rejected and abandoned

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
because I'm not good enough.

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
That's how my life began.

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
So your mother gives you away for five to six weeks

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,040
in order to sort of save you from starvation

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,560
in a ghetto that she was going to, right?

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,040
That's right.

106
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,440
After your grandparents were killed in Auschwitz by the Nazis,

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,200
how do you know in hindsight that that moment

108
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,320
of those six weeks created that sense of abandonment in you?

109
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
I wouldn't say just at that one moment.

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
The children very much view themselves

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
through their interaction with their parents.

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,040
First of all, I had no father because he was gone.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I hadn't seen him, except very briefly

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,600
when I was a month old, but there was no father in the picture.

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
My mother was grief-stricken and terrorized

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,880
and full of war and worry about what's going to happen to us

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
and just the task of surviving each day.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
She's not playful with me.

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
She's not smiling at me very much.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
She's worried-looking.

121
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
She's stressed-looking.

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
The infant takes everything personally.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
That's just the nature of the infant.

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
As infants, we're a narcissist.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
We think it's all about us.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,800
So when things are great, hey, we're great,

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
but my mother is unhappy.

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
It's because she doesn't want me

129
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
or I can't make her happy or I'm inadequate.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,960
So that separation from my mother certainly set a template

131
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,240
for some of my relationship interactions with my spouse

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
decades later.

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,800
But the sense of not being good enough and being responsible,

134
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,680
that was inculcated in me throughout that whole first year of life.

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,040
So much so that in this book, The Myth of Normal,

136
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,560
I actually talk about an experience with the psychedelic mushrooms

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
with the therapist.

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,600
This is not that long ago, seven years ago, maybe,

139
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,280
when I'm at least 70 years old.

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm in this therapeutic session with the cytocybin, the medicine,

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
and the therapist.

142
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
And I know that I'm 70 years old

143
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
and I know this is a therapy session

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
and I know her name and I know who I am in the world.

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
But at the same time, I'm experiencing myself

146
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
as a one-year-old baby and she's my mother.

147
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,960
And I start crying tears come down on my face

148
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,680
and I say, I'm so sorry I made your life so difficult.

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,680
Now that was an unconscious memory

150
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
of my sense of myself as a one-year-old

151
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,040
that I made my mother's life so difficult

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
because that's the way the baby interprets it.

153
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,480
So even if your mother loves you, which mind did, infinitely,

154
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
not that she always treated me the best way possible,

155
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
but she did love me.

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
And can you imagine what a great act of love

157
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,680
even giving me to a stranger in the street

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
would have been for her, you know?

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,400
But because of her own unhappiness,

160
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
I can only conclude that I'm not good enough.

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
And it's my fault.

162
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
70 years old, having that cytocybin experience

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,920
coming to that realization or having that sort of,

164
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,280
having that response to your therapist

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
where they take the role of your mother

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,240
and you're a one-year-old,

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
how does somebody at 70 years old go about correcting that,

168
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,040
that sort of interpretation you had

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,800
of that traumatic early event?

170
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,960
Well, by bringing up to the conscious level,

171
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,600
then when I noticed that sense of guilt or responsibility

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,560
in me, I say, oh, that's what it's about.

173
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,120
So it's a meaning to trauma as I define it.

174
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
It's not about what happens to us.

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
It's about what happens inside of us

176
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
as a result of what happens to us.

177
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,400
And so the wound in trauma means wound.

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
So the wound in this case is my sense of deficiency

179
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
or not being good enough, not being worthy enough.

180
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,000
Once I realize that, oh, this has got nothing to do with anything,

181
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
except this interpretation that I made with my own experience

182
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,280
all those years ago, then when I noticed it,

183
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
I can no longer believe it.

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't have to any longer be a subject

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
to that interpretation of myself in the world.

186
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,000
So awareness is one step, it's not adequate,

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
but it's an essential step towards letting go.

188
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,400
That one belief that you weren't good enough,

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,480
how did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?

190
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,080
It made me a workaholic physician

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
because I had to keep proving my worth.

192
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,880
And it doesn't matter.

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't know if you ever had an addiction,

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
but the nature of it is that we're trying to get from the outside

195
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,200
something that only can arise and fulfill us from the inside.

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,280
So when you're looking at it from the outside,

197
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,600
it's addictive because you get it temporarily,

198
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,720
but then that internal emptiness, that hole, never goes away.

199
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
So it has to be filled over and over and over again.

200
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
It can only be done so temporarily.

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,520
So it becomes runaway addictive.

202
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,440
So then work becomes an addiction

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
because I keep trying to prove my worth.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
And it doesn't matter how many times I may show up

205
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,440
in a positive way at the beginning of someone's life,

206
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,400
at the end of somebody else's life, or anytime in between.

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
It never fills that emptiness

208
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,000
that my sense of lack of worthiness creates.

209
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
So that's one way it shows up.

210
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Another way it shows up is if in my relationship

211
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
I don't feel as satisfied,

212
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
my wife doesn't please me the way I like her too,

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
then I get angry.

214
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
But why am I getting angry?

215
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm getting angry because it's my sense of not being good enough

216
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
that's being now revealed.

217
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,640
That it gets uncovered, this self-acquisition.

218
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
But I get angry at her because her job

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
is to make me not feel that.

220
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,840
We're getting into this relationship for all kinds of reasons.

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
Some of them are conscious, some are not,

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
some are positive, some are come out of trauma.

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
And in my case, I want that relationship to prove to me how good I am.

224
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
So when it isn't proving that, then I get upset with my partner.

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,600
Except the gap is inside me, not inside.

226
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,640
It's not coming from her.

227
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,800
So it shows up, it showed up in my parenting.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,000
It shows up all over the place.

229
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,240
I mean, I think both of those examples sound a lot like me,

230
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,960
especially the first one, the second one as well.

231
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
In what sense?

232
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
In the sense that I'm definitely a workaholic

233
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
and I thought, I think in the earlier phases of my life,

234
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,200
I sacrificed everything in this pursuit of becoming a millionaire

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,080
and having all this stuff and really getting this validation

236
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,160
sacrificed meaningful connections,

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,080
everything in the pursuit of this one thing.

238
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,920
Well, part of the toxicity of the culture

239
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,160
that I talk about in this book is that it actually rewards

240
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:22,480
that kind of emptiness or that desperate seeking to fill that emptiness.

241
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,560
Because you know, you get rewarded.

242
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
You make a lot of money.

243
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,960
A lot of people admire you.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
You get to feel good about yourself.

245
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Mind you, my guess is that good feeling is only temporary.

246
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
At least if my example is any guided,

247
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,080
feeling good because somebody from the outside values you

248
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,680
is only a temporary self for the wound that's inside.

249
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,400
But the world actually rewards it.

250
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,560
You know, so your workaholic doctor, great,

251
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
you make more money and all these people respect you.

252
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,160
Meanwhile, you're hollowing yourself from the inside

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,840
and you're not available for your family.

254
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,040
You know, so that's part of the craziness of this culture.

255
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
And it's like the hedonistic treadmill in a sense,

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,920
because you just never, enough is never enough, as you say.

257
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,520
So the last achievement needs to be surpassed

258
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,120
by a greater achievement for me to get an applaud or a clap.

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,400
I've never really made the connection

260
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,320
that the reason why I'm a workaholic is because

261
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,040
I am trying to prove to the world that I'm enough,

262
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
but I think that it's entirely true.

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah.

264
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,680
So in your case, like race and class in this society of inequality

265
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,720
are certainly traumatic, potentially traumatic inputs,

266
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
as I pointed in this book.

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,880
And to the degree that it affects people's physiology.

268
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,960
But also then, I don't know your family version

269
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,040
or what kind of relationship you have with your parents,

270
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
but there also may have been a sense,

271
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,600
like I got with my mom for reasons

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
and for whatever might have happened in your family.

273
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,840
Maybe you got the sense as well

274
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,600
that even in your family version, you weren't good enough somehow.

275
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,360
So my mom would scream at my dad for like seven hours a day.

276
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,640
And my dad would just sit there.

277
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,960
Okay.

278
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,000
And so my early memories of like looking at my mom and dad

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
are this kind of violent verbally, not like physically,

280
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
this incredibly stressful screaming,

281
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
one person screaming at the other.

282
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,920
That's what I remember.

283
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,080
But from reading what you've written in this book

284
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,120
and from what you've said now,

285
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,040
I actually might have learned sort of learned

286
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,840
to that I was the problem to some degree.

287
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Children interpret it that way.

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,960
That's just the whole point.

289
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,640
That's what I mean about kids being narcissists.

290
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,360
I don't mean that in the negative sense.

291
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,640
I just mean, actually, they think it's all about them.

292
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,080
So if your mother is unhappy, it's your fault.

293
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
And you're not good enough.

294
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,440
So then you have to go out there and work to prove yourself,

295
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,520
to prove to the world and to yourself that you're good enough.

296
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,920
So that going back to your first question

297
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,320
about how these things show up in our lives,

298
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
that's how they show up.

299
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,600
And so 12 years old, you emigrate to Vancouver.

300
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:57,840
Yeah.

301
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,760
By 28, you joined the medical profession.

302
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Yeah.

303
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,320
And you spend the next 32 years, roughly, working in medical degrees.

304
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
At 28, I went back to medical school.

305
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
Actually, I took a detour.

306
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
I was a high school teacher for a while.

307
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,160
And then I was 27, 28 when I started medical school.

308
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,080
At age 33, I think I began my medical career of 32 years.

309
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,120
And in those 33 years, what was your practice?

310
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,160
What did you specialize in?

311
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,440
What did you focus on?

312
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,520
So I was a family physician, which meant I delivered a lot of babies

313
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,240
and I looked after people's problems from beginning to the end of life.

314
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,640
I also worked in palliative care.

315
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,080
I was the director of a unit at the hospital,

316
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,800
which looked after people with terminal disease.

317
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,400
And I did, that was 22 years or so of my practice, 20, 22 years.

318
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,320
And then I switched gears altogether.

319
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,400
And I went to work in the downtown east side of Vancouver, British Columbia,

320
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,760
which is North America's most concentrated area of drug use.

321
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,080
We have more people coming from anywhere in the world are shocked

322
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,720
by what they see.

323
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
There are thousands of people in the streets,

324
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,440
injecting, selling, using, inhaling, ingesting drugs of all kinds.

325
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,400
And people are suffered the consequences of drug use in a society

326
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,840
that doesn't understand drug use.

327
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,960
So it punishes it, excludes it, ostracizes it.

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,960
So people get HIV from dirty needles and hepatitis C.

329
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,680
So this is the population, often they're homeless.

330
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,200
So that's the population I worked with for 12 years

331
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,360
to the end of my medical work.

332
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,360
That experience working with patients that were in palliative care.

333
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,440
So that's for anybody that doesn't know,

334
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
that's patients that are approaching the end of their life

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,280
that have terminal illnesses and that are aware that they're going to die.

336
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
What did that experience teach you?

337
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:03,760
It took an acceptance of one's lack of lack of omnipotence as a physician

338
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,880
because you go into the, you want to cure people, you want people to heal.

339
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
And now it takes the tremendous acceptance to say,

340
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,920
you know, we've reached the limit of our knowledge.

341
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,040
And that doesn't mean we can't help people,

342
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,240
but we certainly can't cure them, you know.

343
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,760
And so it taught me how to be with the inevitable.

344
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,600
And you're working with people who are in the process of dying.

345
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,560
I mean, by the way, who isn't in the process of dying, you know,

346
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,320
but people whose time is more limited than the rest of us.

347
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,960
Acceptance, you learn all of acceptance.

348
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,760
It challenges you to do your best

349
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,400
when you know your best isn't going to be saving anybody's lives,

350
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,160
but it's to help people live a life of as little suffering as possible

351
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
and as much dignity as possible.

352
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,440
So it really challenges the best parts of you to show up.

353
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,880
Patience, acceptance, intuition, personally taught me a lot to listen to people.

354
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,280
Interesting enough, people really want to be heard when they're dying.

355
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,600
They want to make sense of their lives.

356
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,720
They want to tell their stories, then I want their stories to be heard.

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And so I listened a lot.

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,760
I just sat by the bedside and I listened, all that.

359
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,280
When you listened, did you hear any themes relating to regret

360
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
or things that actually mattered?

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
Because I always imagine if I was given such news

362
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,800
that my life was coming to an end and there was an approximate date,

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,160
it would be quite a powerful way of finally realizing

364
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
what truly matters and what never did.

365
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
People react to their impending death in different ways.

366
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,080
So there were some people who just fought it to the end.

367
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,920
They didn't really want to accept it.

368
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,720
But most people were more along the lines that you describe,

369
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
where they really get to see what's important.

370
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
And so I mentioned this a number of times.

371
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,320
It sounds strange and I don't recommend it.

372
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
But I've had patients say to me,

373
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
doctor, I don't know how to tell you this and I can't even explain it perhaps.

374
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
But this illness that's going to take my life

375
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
is the best thing that I've happened to me.

376
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,040
And they meant a couple of things about it.

377
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,600
They meant what you just said, about finding out what's really important in life.

378
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,840
In this book, The Myth of Normal, I enter you a young man called Will Pye,

379
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
who wrote a book called, Blessed with a Brain Tumor.

380
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
What kind of a blessing is that?

381
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,760
What kind of a blessing is that?

382
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
So I asked Will, what's the blessing?

383
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,680
And he said, it made me appreciate every moment.

384
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
It meant every time I talked to somebody,

385
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,680
I knew this might be the last conversation I'm going to have with them.

386
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,800
So it better be a human, genuine interaction.

387
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,520
So that was that aspect of it.

388
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,400
The other aspect of it was that, again, my view is,

389
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,880
as I pointed in this book and in previous works,

390
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
who gets sick and who isn't exactly accidental?

391
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
There are certainly, personally, patterns

392
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,640
based on traumatic experiences in childhood that make disease more likely.

393
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,560
And people very often realize that throughout their lives,

394
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,640
they had abandoned who they were.

395
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
They lived a life that wasn't meaningful for them.

396
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,480
And on death, they reconnected with themselves in an authentic way.

397
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,560
And that seemed to be worth a lot to people.

398
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,800
Again, I don't recommend that way of going to reconnect with yourself,

399
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,640
but people have certainly, I certainly saw it.

400
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
So those are the two big lessons.

401
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,520
After your 33 years in medical practice,

402
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,520
you described that you had a bit of a,

403
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,120
you kind of tuned into a creative calling, which was writing.

404
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
Well, I began to write when I was a physician.

405
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,920
So my first book on ADHD after I was diagnosed with it

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,800
was published in 1999 now.

407
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,720
So that was 23 years ago now.

408
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
So I began to write, and even before then,

409
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,680
I wrote because I wrote columns for newspapers.

410
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
But yes, there was a time in my life where the writing impulse,

411
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,880
which had been with me all my life, was stifled and stymied.

412
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,240
And so was I, because I had this frustration.

413
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,680
In fact, I had the sense that there's something I needed to express.

414
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,920
But I didn't know what, and they didn't know how.

415
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,640
And at some point I realized, oh yeah, I need to write.

416
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,760
So that began before I finished medical practice,

417
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,040
but it certainly has been essential to my ongoing unfolding as a human being.

418
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,160
I was so compelled by that when I read about that,

419
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,040
because I've started to really understand the value of creativity

420
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,240
in all of our lives, regardless of whether we have the luxury

421
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,560
of being called an artist or not.

422
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,720
And so what, in your view, is the importance of?

423
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,960
Well, you're singing my tune here, if I may say it that way,

424
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,160
because I code in this book, there's a great Hungarian Canadian

425
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,080
stress researcher called Yanush Selye, S-E-L-Y-E.

426
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,360
And Selye is the one who actually coined the word stress

427
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,800
in the sense that we use it today.

428
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,040
And he's the one that showed in the laboratory

429
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,120
how stress diminishes the immune system,

430
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,080
and this organizes the hormones and also rates the stomach

431
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
and all this kind of stuff.

432
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,800
But Selye also said, and I quote him here,

433
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
what is in us must out?

434
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
What is in us must out?

435
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,560
That we all have to follow our cave urges

436
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,280
in a way that nature prepared for us,

437
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,040
otherwise we can be hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.

438
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm paraphrasing it very closely.

439
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,720
So we are created in the image of God.

440
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,240
I mean, what are your religious views are?

441
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,120
But that sense that we're created in the images of God

442
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,120
means that we are creators, because the essence of God is creation.

443
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,400
In fact, we call God the Creator, and we call the result of that creation.

444
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,400
If we're created, and if we're offshoots of that creative dynamic

445
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,200
in the universe, then it means that it's in us to create.

446
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
And whatever form that takes, I mean, you don't want to see me

447
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
do art unless you...

448
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,520
I can do a pretty good stick figure, by merit to a nurse.

449
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,680
So that creativity doesn't have to take the form of formal art,

450
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,440
but it does have to take some flow of something that's inside you

451
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,400
that needs to come out.

452
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,840
Otherwise, as Selye says, you get hopelessly hemmed in by frustration.

453
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,560
And so in that sense, everybody's got that creative urge,

454
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,800
and that may take the form of social intercourse.

455
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,320
It might take the form of gardening.

456
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,920
I don't care, communion with nature, athletic expression.

457
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,320
I don't care what, but there's somebody, everybody's got it.

458
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
And if people don't realize they have it,

459
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
it's only because life has hemmed them in and they're too busy.

460
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,320
And sometimes they are trying to make a living or trying to survive

461
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
or to disconnect it from themselves.

462
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
But it's in all of us.

463
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,520
And to the extent that we don't give it expression, we suffer.

464
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,160
One of the things that really hems it in is the prospect

465
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,080
that we might not be good at it,

466
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,920
because we think to express ourselves creatively,

467
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,840
we kind of join a competition of sorts.

468
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
And that's a trap we can fall into.

469
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
So if I'm going to DJ, I need to become a good DJ,

470
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
but in social comparison or else I don't want to...

471
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
But what I've come to learn is, in fact,

472
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,520
the act of DJing alone in my kitchen at midnight is the reward.

473
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,560
Regardless of outcome or whether there's a crowd there,

474
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,840
it's just me and my dog listening.

475
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
The expression is the reward,

476
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,560
not the achievement or the medal that I might get.

477
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
Yeah, not the external.

478
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Well, look, I went through that in the writing of this book.

479
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,160
So here I am, this writer who writes about trauma and healing.

480
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,120
And all of a sudden I'm in a panic because I'm writing a book.

481
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,840
And I realized that the problem was that you talked about identifying with your work.

482
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
So I had identified with this book.

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
So the problem wasn't the book.

484
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,360
Because let's say I write the book and it's not a success.

485
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
I mean, okay, big headline in the Sunday Times.

486
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,480
Book, not a big success.

487
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,760
How big a big deal is that in the history of the universe?

488
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
But if I identify with the book and it's not going well,

489
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,960
then if the book fails, then I'm feeling as a person,

490
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,200
which then goes back to my very earliest concern about not being worth it.

491
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,440
So once I disidentified, once I said, no, this is just a book.

492
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,160
It may be a good book, it may be an important book,

493
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,080
maybe a book that doesn't hit the mark, but it's only a book.

494
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
And how it goes says nothing about me or my worth.

495
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,920
Once I could decouple that, then I could confidently and much more comfortably

496
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,120
go back to the writing of it.

497
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
But I went through that crisis.

498
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,080
It seems like a bit of a paradox that the lack of self-worth would motivate someone

499
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,640
to create great things because they want the approval,

500
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
but at the same time make the process so agonizing

501
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,120
because their self-esteem seems to be on the line.

502
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,360
All this sense of self-worth is on the line.

503
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
Well, that dynamic was in me once I realized it, I let go of it.

504
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
So it didn't dominate me in the end.

505
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,400
And then honest to God, by the time I finished the book,

506
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm not just saying this in retrospect.

507
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,120
It's the best seller now in several countries.

508
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
I actually said to myself and I meant it.

509
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,120
Now I've done the book.

510
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,360
That's what matters.

511
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,000
I've said what was in me to say.

512
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,080
How the world reacts, I can't control.

513
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,960
And it doesn't actually matter on a fundamental level.

514
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,800
It's not that I don't want this book to be accessed.

515
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
I mean, success.

516
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
Of course I wanted to sell 10 zillion copies,

517
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,160
but that doesn't define myself worth or how I function in the world

518
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,760
or how I feel about myself.

519
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,720
Honestly, it does not.

520
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,920
And I understood that by the time I finished working on it.

521
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,480
So once it's done, it's out there doing its work or not doing its work.

522
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,440
But I don't have to hang my own sense of self on how the book does.

523
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,200
Because at that point, that's an outcome you can't control, right?

524
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,080
So trying to control that would be anxiety.

525
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,680
Yeah.

526
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,160
Oh yeah.

527
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,120
Well, you can't control it.

528
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,280
No.

529
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,360
Ten years this book took you to write.

530
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,800
Took me to prepare.

531
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
Took about three years to write.

532
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,280
You describe it as a calling.

533
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,920
The myth of normal.

534
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,280
Four words to sort of pull people in

535
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,200
and to in some way summarize a 550-odd page book.

536
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Why those four words?

537
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,360
Why that phrase?

538
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,040
Can I pass from them to find a code on my cell phone?

539
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,760
100%.

540
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:49,920
Yeah.

541
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,800
So this is...

542
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,000
Are you familiar with the work of Eckhart Tolle?

543
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,360
Oh, Eckhart Tolle, yes.

544
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay, yeah.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So Tolle lives in Vancouver like I do.

546
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,160
And in one of his books, he says,

547
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,440
the normal state of mind of most human beings

548
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,080
contains a strong element of what we might call

549
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
dysfunction or even madness.

550
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,600
So in medical parlance, normal means healthy and natural.

551
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,520
So there's a normal range of blood pressure,

552
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,560
normal temperature.

553
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,320
It's a range.

554
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,760
Outside that range, there's no life.

555
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
There's no health, either too high or too low.

556
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,120
You're gone.

557
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,960
So normal means it's equivalent with,

558
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,680
synonymous with, healthy and natural.

559
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,880
However, we make that same assumption that

560
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
out in society, what we used to,

561
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,880
what we call normal is also healthy and natural,

562
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
which is the myth.

563
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Because I'm saying that in this society,

564
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,280
what we consider to be normal is neither healthy nor natural.

565
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,680
In fact, it's hurtful to us,

566
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,360
so that we're using the word normal in a way that

567
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,720
doesn't apply in a narrow medical sense.

568
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,680
It's accurate, but in a broader sense,

569
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,160
that which we're used to in this society,

570
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,120
we consider normal is just not good for us.

571
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
And norm is kind of a statistic,

572
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,720
or it's a kind of an average.

573
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
So if everybody, you have a dog,

574
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,920
if everybody in London mistreated their dogs,

575
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
and if you didn't, then you'd be abnormal.

576
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,880
So it's a myth to say that what is normal is healthy and natural.

577
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,400
That's what I mean by the myth of normal.

578
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
That's one thing I mean.

579
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
The other thing I mean is,

580
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,800
if we understand the actual science

581
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
of the unity of everything,

582
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,560
I'm not talking about spiritual insight here,

583
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,520
I'm talking about physiological science

584
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,640
that are physiology and psychology,

585
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
is very much affected by our life experiences,

586
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,640
being in utero, childbirth, early childhood,

587
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
and throughout the lifetime.

588
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,480
It also follows that illness and health

589
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
are not individual attributes.

590
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
They are actually manifestations of our relationships

591
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,640
and our situation in the world and our history.

592
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,040
That also means when these circumstances are abnormal,

593
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
you expect people to be sick,

594
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,520
you know, just as if you gave animals

595
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,880
something that wasn't healthy for them,

596
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
they'd be sick, that'd be what you'd expect.

597
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,760
So this idea that the people who are ill,

598
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
either physically or mentally abnormal,

599
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
I say no.

600
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
These are normal responses

601
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
to an abnormal set of circumstances.

602
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,920
And rather than being sort of those abnormal ones

603
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,560
and the rest of us, it's really a spectrum

604
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,040
that we're all, pretty much all on it.

605
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
So in those three senses,

606
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
this idea of normal is a myth,

607
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
and it's one that keeps us from seeing reality.

608
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,840
And we're all abnormal in some way.

609
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,280
So if maybe my attention is different,

610
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,960
maybe my interpersonal relationships are abnormal,

611
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,280
but in some way I'm going to be abnormal.

612
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,640
As it relates to treatments,

613
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,320
how do you think that the medical profession

614
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,920
and the psychological profession

615
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
would respond differently

616
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
if we removed this idea that there is a normal?

617
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,240
How would our approaches change to treating people?

618
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Well, that's a multi-layered answer.

619
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,920
First of all, we would recognize that our diagnoses

620
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,600
are not explanations for anything.

621
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,120
So, you know, I've been diagnosed with ADD,

622
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,160
you know, legitimately so, as my first book was on it.

623
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,440
But it doesn't explain anything.

624
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,400
So I tune out easily, very easily, you know,

625
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,960
and sometimes when I don't, often when I don't want to,

626
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,920
but, you know, unless I'm highly motivated.

627
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,800
So you might say, this person has ADD,

628
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,320
how do we know because he tunes out a lot?

629
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
Why does he tune out a lot?

630
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,160
He's got ADD.

631
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,320
How do we know he's got ADD because he tunes out a lot?

632
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
So first of all, we have to understand that our understanding

633
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,560
of normal and what's outside the normal,

634
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
they don't, doesn't explain anything.

635
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,400
They can, they can describe,

636
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
if you describe my mental functioning

637
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,040
as that of somebody who's got an automatic tendency to tune out,

638
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
you'd be accurate.

639
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,880
So there's a description.

640
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
It's helpful as an explanation

641
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,640
as to why this person isn't behaving quote unquote normally.

642
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
It doesn't explain a thing.

643
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,640
Now, if you understood that I spent my infancy

644
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,200
under very difficult circumstances where I was very stressed

645
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,760
because of all the stuff I already talked about

646
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
and that tuning out was a normal response

647
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,880
to, to those circumstances as a way of protecting myself

648
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
from the stress of it all.

649
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
And this was happening when my brain was developing.

650
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,400
Then you'd understand there's nothing abnormal about my,

651
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
by tuning out.

652
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
In fact, it is the normal response

653
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,600
to a set of abnormal circumstances.

654
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,520
So that's the first point.

655
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
And I could go through the same kind of

656
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,560
dialectic with all manner of physical and mental diseases,

657
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,680
by the way, so-called.

658
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,760
The second point is-

659
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,800
Why do you say so-called?

660
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Well, look, the disease model is,

661
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,200
as long as we understand it's a model, it's okay.

662
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,680
When we think it describes reality fully, it doesn't.

663
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:50,640
So, for example, we talk about mental illnesses.

664
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,600
And we're assuming that there's a kind of definite pathology there.

665
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
Just as in rheumatoid arthritis,

666
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,560
you can describe the inflammation of the joints

667
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,480
and the blood levels of certain antibodies being abnormal.

668
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,520
And hormonal levels being disturbed.

669
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
We're making the same assumption in mental illness.

670
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,440
There's no such evidence in mental illness.

671
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,920
There's no physiological parameters

672
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,760
that you can say somebody's got mental illness.

673
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,360
There's just been a study a few months ago

674
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,960
of thousands of brain scans

675
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,720
of people with mental illness diagnosis.

676
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,440
There's nothing diagnostic about the brain scans.

677
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,160
It's not like I can take an X-ray of a lung

678
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,320
and say that this lung is what we call consolidation

679
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,840
or fluid indicating inflammation.

680
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,600
There's nothing like that in mental diagnosis.

681
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
There's no blood tests you can do and so on.

682
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,400
So, illness is a model.

683
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,120
Somebody's really depressed, even suicidal perhaps,

684
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,200
and then might need pharmacological intervention,

685
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,480
which would really save their lives.

686
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,000
That may be true.

687
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,800
And in that sense, you may say that they're ill

688
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,600
as long as we realize that this is a construct

689
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
that we're applying here.

690
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,840
But there's no actual measurement of that.

691
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,840
That's at all similar to what we call physical disease.

692
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,000
But even in physical disease, we make certain assumptions.

693
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,880
For example, somebody has rheumatoid arthritis.

694
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,760
No, nothing wrong with that statement on the face of it.

695
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,040
But there's an assumption there.

696
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
The assumption is that there's this thing

697
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,120
called rheumatoid arthritis.

698
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
And there's this person called me.

699
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,400
And this person has this thing.

700
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,320
No, the example I often give.

701
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,200
Here's my cell phone.

702
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,240
I'm holding it in my hand.

703
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,360
I have a cell phone.

704
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,400
It's not part of me.

705
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,520
It says nothing about me.

706
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,840
It's a discrete object.

707
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
Its nature doesn't depend on my nature.

708
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Nothing.

709
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,160
Is that true about rheumatoid arthritis?

710
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Or is it more true to say, as I found out,

711
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,240
that this is a condition that shows up in people

712
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,480
with certain life experiences

713
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,320
in certain ways of functioning in the world?

714
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,480
And that because of the science documented unity

715
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,440
of mind and body and the impossibility

716
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,640
of separating the activity over emotional apparatus

717
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
from same or immune system,

718
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
because it's all one organismic unit.

719
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Therefore, when the immune system turns against the body,

720
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
as it does in rheumatoid arthritis,

721
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,920
the immune system actually attacks the body.

722
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,760
Is that a thing that's got a life of its own?

723
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
Or is there a process that's happening inside that person

724
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
because of certain aspects of their lives?

725
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,320
Now, if I say it's the thing that happens to you,

726
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,480
then that thing has got a life of its own.

727
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,080
And that's how most doctors see it.

728
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,600
They see somebody with rheumatoid arthritis.

729
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,840
They say, okay, this is the kind you've got.

730
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,280
This is what's going to happen.

731
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,800
This is the only thing we can do is to mitigate the symptoms.

732
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,640
I find that's not true.

733
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
I find that the rheumatoid, by the not just I find it,

734
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
the science finds it.

735
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,920
The rheumatoid arthritis is very much related to stress and trauma.

736
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,840
And the more stressed there is,

737
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,760
the more likely it is to flare up.

738
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
And if people deal with that stress,

739
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,960
if they know how to prevent it, their illness abates.

740
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
Which means that it's not a thing that's separate.

741
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,320
It's a process that happens inside them.

742
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,480
This is a subtle concept.

743
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,920
I'm wondering if I'm explaining it clearly.

744
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,560
No, you are.

745
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,720
And it's really making me question

746
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,120
how much we misunderstand the relationship

747
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,480
between the mind and the immune system.

748
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,680
Because that's the real,

749
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,200
that's the important connection to understand

750
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
if you are to accept all the things you've just said.

751
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
Which we don't understand.

752
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,840
I don't think typically we understand

753
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,360
that my mind and my immune system

754
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,440
have such a close relationship.

755
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,320
Well, there's a whole new science

756
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,840
that studies those relationships.

757
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,440
It's called sacronorminology.

758
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,880
Which studies the interlinked unity

759
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,360
of the emotional apparatus of our brain and body

760
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
with the immune system, with the nervous system

761
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,800
and with the hormonal apparatus.

762
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
I mean, it's just so obvious.

763
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I could change your hormonal state

764
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,080
in a split second right now

765
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,520
without touching you.

766
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,760
Just by screaming at you and threatening you.

767
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
That would necessarily create a change.

768
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,760
I mean, it's just clear

769
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
that our emotions are inseparable.

770
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,360
You know, and the other funny thing is,

771
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,560
well, several funny things.

772
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,160
How do we treat most conditions in medicine?

773
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,600
By the way, inflammation.

774
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,840
If you go to a dermatologist with the inflamed skin.

775
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,960
If you go to a rheumatologist with the inflamed joints.

776
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,960
If you go to a gastroenterologist

777
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
with the inflamed intestines.

778
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,200
If you go to a respirologist with inflamed lungs.

779
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
If you go to a neurologist with the inflamed nervous system

780
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,840
as in multiples grosses,

781
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,760
they're going to give you steroids

782
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,320
to settle the inflammation.

783
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,000
Now what are steroids?

784
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,600
They are stress hormones.

785
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,320
And you would think that as physicians,

786
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,640
we would ask ourselves, gosh,

787
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
we're treating everything with stress hormones.

788
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,040
Does stress maybe have something to do with this condition?

789
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Now when you look at the scientific literature,

790
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,480
yes, yes, yes and yes.

791
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,240
So there's a great Canadian physician

792
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
actually united by Queen Victoria.

793
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,480
One of the great medical teachers of all kinds,

794
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,600
Sir William Osler.

795
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,960
And he said in 1890,

796
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
that rheumatoid arthritis is a stress-driven disease.

797
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,000
The French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot

798
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,320
first described multiples grosses.

799
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,200
He said, this is a stress-driven condition.

800
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
And since then, there's been so much research.

801
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,600
So what I'm saying is that this way of looking at

802
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,160
what we call disease is a process.

803
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,440
It's so much more accurate scientifically, actually,

804
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,840
and understanding the mind-body unity.

805
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,960
And then naturally, when people are traumatized,

806
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,360
that has a huge impact on their physiology.

807
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880
Their psychological trauma

808
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
has a huge impact on their physiology.

809
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,760
It's just science.

810
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,240
But it's science that's not taught to medical doctors.

811
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,560
It's just for some strange reason.

812
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, the average physician never hears a single lecture

813
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,800
about, say, trauma and his relationship to illness.

814
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,960
And yet, there's studies internationally,

815
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,760
thousands of them showing those relationships.

816
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,680
So there's this strange gap between science and medical practice.

817
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,480
But it would change medical practice for the better.

818
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,000
Because what would happen if you went to a physician

819
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,360
and you presented with your symptom and they'd say,

820
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,920
okay, look, we'll give you such as this medication

821
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,360
to deal with your symptoms.

822
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,360
And then let's look at your life in the context that you live it

823
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,720
and see how the stresses that you may be taking on,

824
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,560
the traumas you may be carrying,

825
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
might be affecting the physiology of your body.

826
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
Now, they don't have to be all trauma therapists to do that.

827
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,400
They just have to raise the question and to begin the inquiry.

828
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,720
That'll make a huge change to that person's life

829
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,160
and to their disease process.

830
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
And clearly to their kids' lives as well,

831
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
because I remember reading in your book

832
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,520
about the study with the rats.

833
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,880
And how they, could you tell me about that study?

834
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,320
How the stress study with the rats

835
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,680
and how the parents' treatment of a child impacted their stress response?

836
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,680
And then also they passed that on, which I think was...

837
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,880
Yeah, that was a very interesting study.

838
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,280
It was done in Canada at McGill University.

839
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,520
I think maybe something in the last 20 years, early 2000s, I think.

840
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,360
And they looked at how other rats interacted with their infants,

841
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,080
their newborns.

842
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,360
This is a process called grooming,

843
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,880
in which the mother rat licks the infant

844
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,640
or in the perineal area, you know, in the genitalia.

845
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,080
This is shortly after birth.

846
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,160
These mother rats just started licking their infants.

847
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,760
Some of the rats did it in a more efficient

848
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,000
and caring kind of way than other mother rats.

849
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,800
Those that had the better kind of caring,

850
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
the better kind of grooming,

851
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,920
grow to be calmer and respond to stress in more functional ways,

852
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,280
than those little rats who, as neonates,

853
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,560
had not been given that same kind of efficient

854
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,160
and quite as caring grooming.

855
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,800
And what they found out in the brains of those adult rats

856
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,320
who had been groomed one way or the other as infants,

857
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,920
the stress apparatus was different.

858
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,000
Certain receptors were the stress hormones.

859
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,560
So one of them could call themselves more easily than the other.

860
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,760
What was interesting, as you might say, was so what?

861
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,880
That she's genetic.

862
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,400
The calmer mothers passed on their genes to their infants.

863
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,440
No, they didn't.

864
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,640
Because if you took the infants of mothers who groomed beautifully

865
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,720
and put them with mothers who didn't,

866
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,240
and conversely, you took the infant rats of mothers who

867
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,640
didn't groom so well, but you put them with mothers who did,

868
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,440
it changed the brain for the adult.

869
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
It changed the brain.

870
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,760
It changed the genetic functioning, not the genes,

871
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,960
but the genetic functioning.

872
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,240
This is called epigenetics,

873
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,040
how genes are turned on and off by the environment.

874
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,120
And then those mother and those rats who were groomed well

875
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,200
as infants, it doesn't matter what the original mother was,

876
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,440
but those rats who were groomed well,

877
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,120
they went on to groom their infants

878
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,840
in exactly the way they had been groomed.

879
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,840
So this is how we pass on our parenting stuff.

880
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,680
For one generation to the next, both behaviorally,

881
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,800
but also through the turning on or off of certain genes.

882
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,080
So in essence, how nurturing our parents were has a big impact

883
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,320
on our own ability to handle stress positively or negatively.

884
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,120
Oh, absolutely.

885
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,320
And then we pass that down to our children.

886
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,360
How stressed our parents were,

887
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,400
how they reacted to our own stress as as infants.

888
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,880
That has everything to do with how our brains handle stress later on.

889
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
And so some people just don't handle stress very well.

890
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,920
They don't handle the frustration very well.

891
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,720
You should have seen me this morning at the hotel

892
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,240
when the swimming pool didn't open in time.

893
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,360
But I was a lot better than I might have been years ago.

894
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
But yeah, our stress responses are very much programmed

895
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,760
by our early developmental experiences.

896
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,280
Speaking about our early experiences,

897
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,120
the first word in the sort of subtitle of your book

898
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,000
is the word trauma.

899
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,600
It's a word that I've talked about a lot on this podcast

900
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,360
and I've had a lot of people hear that have opened up

901
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,320
about their traumas.

902
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,840
How do you define trauma?

903
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,680
I know society has defined it in its own way,

904
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,360
but how do you define it, the word?

905
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,640
I define it very specifically.

906
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,200
It's not something bad that happens to you.

907
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,880
I went to this movie last night and I was traumatized.

908
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,440
No, you weren't.

909
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,800
You were just sad or you had some emotional pain,

910
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,840
but you weren't traumatized.

911
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,160
Trauma means a wound.

912
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,520
That's the literal meaning of the word.

913
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,360
It's a Greek word for wounding.

914
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,840
So trauma is a psychological wound that you sustain.

915
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,680
And it behaves like a wound.

916
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,280
So on the one hand, a wound, if it's very raw,

917
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,200
if you touch it, it just really hurts.

918
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,560
So if I have a wound around not being wanted,

919
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,640
then, or the belief that I'm not,

920
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,880
then decades later, if anything reminds me of that,

921
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,920
it hurts as much as it did when I originally incurred the wound.

922
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,680
So in one sense, trauma is an unhealed wound.

923
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,200
That touch, we get triggered.

924
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,800
That's what triggering means, by the way.

925
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,320
Some old wound gets activated or touched.

926
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,240
And the other thing that happens to wounds

927
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,520
is that they scar over.

928
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,800
And scar tissue has certain characteristics.

929
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,600
It's thick.

930
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,480
It has no nerve endings, so there's no feeling in it.

931
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,680
So people traumatized.

932
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,040
Disconnected from their feelings.

933
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,920
Scar tissue is rigid.

934
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,200
It's not flexible.

935
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,440
So we lose kind of response flexibility.

936
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,120
So when something happens, we tend to react in typical stereo,

937
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,640
typical predictable dysfunctional ways because of the rigidity.

938
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,240
And scar tissue doesn't grow like healthy flesh.

939
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,040
So people who are traumatized tend to be stuck

940
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,000
in emotional states that characterized their development

941
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,280
when they were traumatized.

942
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,000
So when somebody says to you, don't be such a baby,

943
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,480
doesn't sound very pleasant, but there's some truth to it.

944
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,920
It means that you're probably reacting according to the lines

945
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,240
of some wound that you sustained as an infant.

946
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,160
And now you're reacting as if that wound was happening all over again.

947
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,280
This is what one of my friends in the trauma world,

948
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,200
Peter Levine, calls the tyranny of the past.

949
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,360
So something happens in the present and we react

950
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,920
as if we're back there in the past when this first happened.

951
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,400
And we're not in the present moment at all.

952
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
And I was trying to figure out how many people,

953
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,640
as a percentage of the population, have trauma.

954
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,920
But then I read this stat with 60% of adults

955
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,240
say that they've had sort of a traumatic early upbringing

956
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
or whatever or traumatic events from their childhood.

957
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,320
But then I thought maybe everybody has trauma.

958
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,760
It depends on how we understand trauma.

959
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
So if we understand trauma, it's only the really terrible things

960
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,160
that happen to people, which do happen to people.

961
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,480
You know, in the book I talked about a British friend of mine

962
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,760
who had no living in Canada.

963
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,160
They are a yoga teacher and a meditation teacher

964
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,920
and a psychologist and an artist actually.

965
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,960
And they grew up in some orphanage here in Britain

966
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,640
where they were racially taunted every morning.

967
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,560
You know, words that are in the book

968
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,880
by her permission, which I'm not going to cite here publicly.

969
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,840
And that gave her a sense of deficient,

970
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,520
a sense of self that I'm just not good enough,

971
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,880
that I don't belong and so on.

972
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,360
There's those obvious traumas

973
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,680
or the obvious trauma of being sexually abused.

974
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,760
So men who are sexually abused according to Canadian study

975
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,840
have tripled the rate of heart attacks as adults,

976
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,560
you know, and all kinds of physiological reasons.

977
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,080
But that should be the case.

978
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,840
So there's those self-evident, big T traumas

979
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,200
that we call big T trauma, T with a capital T,

980
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,240
trauma with a capital T.

981
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,120
There's a certain percentage of the population

982
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,360
much larger than we think, subject to that.

983
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,120
If you include all the known factors

984
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,320
such as physical, sexual or emotional abuse,

985
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,000
spanking, by the way, has not been shown to be as traumatic

986
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,120
as harsher forms of physical abuse.

987
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,800
Spanking, which is still recommended by so-called experts

988
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,840
who should remain unnamed for the moment.

989
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,440
The death of a parent, violence in a family,

990
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,080
parental violence against each other.

991
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,080
A parent being jailed, a parent being mentally ill.

992
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,160
Did I say a parent being addicted, a rancorous divorce?

993
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,640
These are the identified big traumas, big T traumas,

994
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,480
not to mention poverty, not to mention extreme inequality,

995
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,560
war and so on.

996
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,200
But then if you remember that trauma is not what happens to you,

997
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,960
but what happens inside you is the wound.

998
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,400
People can be wounded not just by bad things happening to them,

999
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,080
but small children can be wounded in loving families

1000
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,280
where they don't get their needs met.

1001
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,400
I mean, that's obvious in the physical sense.

1002
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,720
If a child doesn't get proper nutrition,

1003
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,480
their body will suffer, their mind will suffer.

1004
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,560
We're also creatures with emotional needs

1005
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,160
as important as our physical needs.

1006
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,880
So when the child's emotional needs are not met,

1007
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,920
that child is wounded.

1008
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,320
That's what we call small T trauma,

1009
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,680
which is not the big ticket events such as I described.

1010
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,600
But just the child's need to be loved unconditionally,

1011
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,120
to be held when distressed, to be responded to,

1012
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,240
to be seen, to be heard, to be allowed their full range of emotion

1013
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,800
without them being stamped on in the name of so-called discipline.

1014
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:18,880
The right to play creatively, spontaneously, out there in nature,

1015
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,280
not with these damn digital gadgets that subvert and hijack the child's imagination.

1016
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,280
But spontaneous play, that's essential for brain development.

1017
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,880
So what I'm saying is that when these needs are not for the

1018
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,480
unconditional loving attachment relationship,

1019
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,440
when those needs are frustrated, children are also hurt.

1020
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,400
And I call that trauma as well, because it shows up later in life

1021
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,520
as the impact of painful wounds.

1022
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,000
So trauma in this society, for all kinds of reasons,

1023
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,680
is far more common than we imagine.

1024
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,880
From sitting here and speaking to, I don't know,

1025
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
somewhere over 100 different people that come from all walks of life,

1026
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,320
but specifically people that are successful in their industries,

1027
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:06,000
and you talked about how an anomalous early upbringing

1028
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,560
can create sort of abnormality in an adult.

1029
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,480
A lot of the people I sit here are successful because of some kind of abnormality,

1030
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,080
or at least their interpretation of some kind of early event

1031
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,880
that caused them to have some sort of abnormal belief about themselves

1032
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,640
that they're not enough, so they become a billionaire,

1033
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,160
or a gold medalist, or whatever it might be.

1034
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,280
One of the things that I thought I could predict is I thought after doing 100 episodes,

1035
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,600
if they told me the traumatic event they'd been through,

1036
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,280
I could predict the outcome in them, but there's a disconnect there,

1037
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,840
because I'd sit here with a guest who went through one of your

1038
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,680
capital T traumas, like domestic violence,

1039
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,240
and one of them might become incredibly angry,

1040
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,160
and one of them might become the most peaceful, loving person I've ever met.

1041
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,640
And that taught me that there's this thing in between the event,

1042
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,320
which is what you call interpretation.

1043
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,280
And I found that as, that kind of makes it really difficult to diagnose.

1044
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Well, now look, so the two examples you gave,

1045
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,560
that really peaceful person may be really peaceful for genuinely good reasons,

1046
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,400
such as they found the milk of human love flowing through their veins,

1047
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,160
and they've had some spiritual reconciliation with the world,

1048
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,840
where they may have genuinely learned compassion for themselves and others,

1049
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,080
but they could also be very nice and peaceful because they're suppressing their healthy anger,

1050
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,400
because they're actually sitting on their rage unconsciously,

1051
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,720
which is going to show up in the form of some kind of health manifestation,

1052
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
I guarantee you, later on.

1053
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,400
So you can't tell from the outside without asking some questions,

1054
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:50,240
or I can give you the example of a Donald Trump who had a really traumatic childhood.

1055
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,280
I mean, his father was a, as described by his psychologist, niece, Mary Trump.

1056
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:02,240
His father, Trump's father, who is Mary's grandfather was a psychopath.

1057
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,320
And who really demeaned and harshly treated their children.

1058
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,880
So Trump decides unconsciously that, by the way, I'm not talking about his policies here,

1059
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,400
I'm not, this is not a political debate.

1060
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,080
And in the book, I point out that his opponent was also traumatized,

1061
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,360
Hillary Clinton.

1062
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,560
So this is, this is a ecumenical view of trauma and politics.

1063
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,680
I'm not choosing sides.

1064
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,680
I'm just saying that you can see his trauma in every moment he opens his mouth.

1065
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,000
His grandiosity, his need to make himself bigger, more powerful, aggressive,

1066
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,480
and eats as much as said in his autobiography that the world is a horrible place,

1067
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,120
a doggie dog place where everybody was after you.

1068
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,880
Everybody wants your wife and your house and your wealth.

1069
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,840
And this is your friends.

1070
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,760
Never mind your enemies.

1071
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,200
But that's the world he lives in.

1072
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,840
Now that world that he lives in reflects his childhood home.

1073
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,600
He developed that world view.

1074
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,840
He came to it honestly, you might say, because that's the world that he lives in.

1075
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,560
And he gets to be really successful in this crazy world.

1076
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,680
You know, financially, although people question, you know,

1077
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
was he really as big a success as he says he was?

1078
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,320
But he certainly was successful politically.

1079
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,560
If by success you mean the attainment of power.

1080
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,760
His brother on the other hand, Mary Trump's father,

1081
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,000
Trump's niece's father, drank himself to death.

1082
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,680
And they were both responses to the same.

1083
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,800
You can never say it's exactly the same for two kids,

1084
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,440
but there was a toxic home environment.

1085
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,760
One ends up dead as an alcoholic.

1086
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,400
The other ends up at the pinnacle of power.

1087
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,840
And when I look at them both, I see this function there,

1088
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,120
significant dysfunction there.

1089
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,280
So one of the consequences of that early upbringing

1090
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,080
was it materialized itself as sort of addiction.

1091
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,400
And the other got the same psychological reinforcement,

1092
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,840
or the thing missing from power and work and money.

1093
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,760
Well, Donald Trump learned that the way to survive

1094
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,840
is to be aggressive and harsh and competitive

1095
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,520
and to get the other before they get to you,

1096
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,880
which is a faithful reproduction of his early childhood experiences.

1097
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,120
So for him, these were not choices so much as survival

1098
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,200
techniques.

1099
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,120
And when they talk about his lying,

1100
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,680
well, I don't know when he's lying or when he's not,

1101
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,800
but my sense is that often he actually believes what he's saying.

1102
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,320
And actually he's a biographer or the person who

1103
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,720
co-wrote his, caused the autobiographical, the out of the deal.

1104
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,800
This writer says that he's never met anybody

1105
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,440
who's so capable of believing something that's not true,

1106
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,280
to be true, if he wants it to be true.

1107
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,320
But that's the mark of a traumatized child,

1108
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,440
you know, a denial of reality.

1109
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,000
It is an inauguration.

1110
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
There was a certain number of people that came to the,

1111
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,040
he couldn't stand it, that there weren't as many people there

1112
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,720
as came to Barack Obama's inauguration.

1113
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,960
There were a much smaller number of people there.

1114
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,880
He created this reality where many more people came to his inauguration.

1115
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,280
Now what age behavior is that?

1116
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,480
That's a four-year-old where more kids came to his party than my party.

1117
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,360
That can't be true.

1118
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,560
But that's Donald's way of dealing with reality.

1119
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,560
It's not a moral failing as such.

1120
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,680
That's how he survived.

1121
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,600
And these survival mechanisms then get to former personalities.

1122
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,480
And again, in this world, sometimes they pay off in certain ways.

1123
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,960
Is that often the case with pathological lies?

1124
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,800
They've learned to lie as a way to survive.

1125
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,920
Oh, absolutely.

1126
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,080
The German philosopher writer Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche said,

1127
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,440
people lie their way out of reality who have been hurt by reality.

1128
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,480
And so I've lied.

1129
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,400
You know, like when I had my shopping addiction,

1130
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,840
I lied every day to my wife, you know?

1131
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,480
And even afterwards, when she tried,

1132
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,400
when she stopped trying to change my behavior,

1133
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,040
I said, just tell me if you're going to show up,

1134
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,360
you're going to spend another $1,000 on music.

1135
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,080
Just tell me.

1136
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,200
I still couldn't because I was so ashamed of it.

1137
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,280
And so the lying became like a way of survival for me.

1138
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,320
Defense against reality.

1139
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,080
It's a defense against reality and it's a defense against being judged.

1140
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,760
You know?

1141
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,200
Well, that says something well my childhood, you know?

1142
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,480
Nobody's born a liar.

1143
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,280
As we say in this book, there are congenital liars,

1144
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,120
but there are no congenital liars.

1145
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,680
No one day old baby tells any lies.

1146
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,080
No one day old baby pretends anything.

1147
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,720
If we end up pretending in any way at all to the extent that we do,

1148
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,920
it's because we had to learn that's what we must do to survive.

1149
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,880
You said something at the start when I gave the example that I have this,

1150
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,080
I sat with a guest here who went through domestic abuse

1151
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,080
and they are the calmest person.

1152
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,600
And then you said, well, maybe they're suppressing it.

1153
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,240
And in fact, the minute you said that,

1154
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,760
it reminded me of something they said,

1155
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,000
which is they said to me on this podcast that they had angry outbursts all the time.

1156
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,560
So sometimes their child will come up to them

1157
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,200
and want to play when they're working and they'll snap.

1158
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,080
And they're trying to, they're trying to deal with that.

1159
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,560
Yeah.

1160
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,080
That's what I meant, that they're sitting on this

1161
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,120
crater of volcanic crater of anger, which sometimes bursts out of them.

1162
00:58:51,120 --> 00:59:01,200
So their demeanor is like a really developed, suppressed way of handling rage,

1163
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,440
which rage, when they were children, had they expressed,

1164
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,840
would have got them into more trouble.

1165
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,560
So suppressing it, repressing it, became their survival.

1166
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,240
It's all about survival, you see.

1167
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,560
So it became their survival mechanism.

1168
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:23,360
No, that person, as long as they keep it that way, they're at risk.

1169
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,000
They're at risk for mental health diagnosis like depression.

1170
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,800
Because what do we, what is depression?

1171
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,240
It means you're pushing something down.

1172
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,960
That's what it means.

1173
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,640
What do we push down?

1174
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,800
Our natural emotions.

1175
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,080
Why do we push them down?

1176
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,360
Because we had to survive.

1177
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,920
So that, that person, I don't know.

1178
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,160
I can't prognosticate what's going to happen to them.

1179
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,720
But if they don't work it out in general,

1180
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,160
they're at risk for some kind of mental or physical manifestation.

1181
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,960
That's my experience.

1182
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,560
Quick one.

1183
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,280
Some of you may know we've got a brand new sponsor on this podcast,

1184
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,480

01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,080
then search American Express business platinum card to find out more.

1202
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,120
Quick one from our longest standing sponsor here.

1203
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,800
I can't tell you over the last and say over the last,

1204
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,080
really it's been about two and a half years.

1205
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,320
It was really post pandemic,

1206
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,440
how much my health has become such a huge priority in my life.

1207
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,760
Huell has been probably the most important partner in my health journey

1208
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,000
because I've been in the boardrooms.

1209
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,080
I've been to their offices tens and tens and tens and tens of times.

1210
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,640
I've seen how they make their decisions on nutrition.

1211
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,920
And that's why it's such a wonderful thing to be able to talk to this audience

1212
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,600
about a brand and a product that is so unbelievably linked to my values

1213
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,040
and the place I am in my life of valuing the gym,

1214
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,160
exercise, movement, my mind, my breathing and all of those things.

1215
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,080
And most importantly, my nutrition.

1216
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,520
That is the role Huell plays.

1217
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
And so every time I get to read these ads out,

1218
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,040
I do it with such passion,

1219
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,800
because I really, really believe every word I'm saying.

1220
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,920
And I absolutely love the brand.

1221
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,280
So if you haven't already tried Huell

1222
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,240
and you've been resistant to my pestering,

1223
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,400
then give it a go and let me know how you get on.

1224
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,280
You talked about expressing one's emotions

1225
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,640
and something you've talked about in this book,

1226
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,680
but also previously is this idea that there is such a thing as healthy anger.

1227
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,080
It's one of the seven As of healing, as you say.

1228
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,760
The first being a topic we've talked about already, which is acceptance.

1229
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,800
The next being awareness.

1230
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Well, awareness that we should have put into this book,

1231
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,920
but we didn't, not into this book.

1232
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,400
In this book, I put four As and I left out awareness

1233
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
and that was an omission on my part.

1234
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,880
Really?

1235
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah, I was, I'm sorry, but it was.

1236
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,400
So in the book, you have authenticity, anger, autonomy.

1237
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,600
Acceptance.

1238
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,960
Agency you have.

1239
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,840
An agency, yeah.

1240
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,200
Yeah, and acceptance.

1241
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,760
So awareness, you've said before,

1242
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,840
before this book that awareness is the starting point.

1243
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,200
I've found that to be so true in my life,

1244
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,240
but it's not very easy.

1245
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,960
I feel like awareness is a luxury or a privilege that is very hard fought.

1246
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,200
Because you're guessing.

1247
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,360
You're guessing based on pattern recognition.

1248
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,000
So I was guessing 25 years old, I can't get into relationship.

1249
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,600
Any time a girl comes near me, even if I've pursued her, I run off.

1250
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,240
And to figure out why I was doing that,

1251
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,040
to even identify the behavior pattern and go, that's not helpful.

1252
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,200
That's not going to lead me to feeling whole.

1253
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,480
Where does that come from?

1254
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,760
Took 25 years and a lot of like introspection.

1255
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,680
But most people, they're living unaware of the puppet master of trauma

1256
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,120
that is driving their life.

1257
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,320
That's a really good analogy.

1258
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,920
The trauma really is like a puppet master behind the scenes

1259
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,960
or in the unconscious, pulling your strings and you're not aware of it.

1260
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,280
Do you remember Pinocchio?

1261
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,080
Yeah.

1262
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,200
So you remember what Pinocchio says at the end,

1263
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,520
the way when he finally becomes a real boy?

1264
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1265
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,400
He says how foolish I was when I was a puppet.

1266
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,360
And to the extent that we're being activated by these unconscious strings

1267
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,600
that are traumas pulling behind the scenes and we're acting in our lives

1268
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,600
and we think we're autonomous free beings,

1269
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,480
but we're actually being controlled by something in the past

1270
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,600
that we haven't worked out.

1271
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,240
We're puppets.

1272
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,840
We're actually puppets.

1273
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,880
And there's not much freedom in that.

1274
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,200
There's no freedom in it at all.

1275
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,520
So I mean, I suppose the opposite of trauma,

1276
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,400
if you want to revisit that question, is liberation.

1277
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,160
Interesting.

1278
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,120
Liberation and by reconnection.

1279
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,880
By reconnection, but liberation from the inexorable power of the unconscious.

1280
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,120
Which is like cutting the strings in a way.

1281
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,800
It kind of brings me to, there's kind of two ways.

1282
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,360
I want to go with that.

1283
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,680
The first question I have about trauma and the puppet master analogy is,

1284
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,640
do we ever really cut the strings?

1285
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,360
Or do we just kind of learn to pull against them

1286
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,680
when they try and tell us to do something with more force

1287
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,520
than they're exerting in the opposite direction?

1288
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,640
That doesn't work very well pushing against it

1289
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,000
because they're still reactive.

1290
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,960
You're still not in charge.

1291
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,080
You're just in automatic resistance mode to something.

1292
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,360
There's no freedom in that either.

1293
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,240
So yeah.

1294
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,240
But awareness that you mentioned is huge

1295
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,800
because once you are aware that there's this,

1296
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,720
see the thing about these strings may not fray right away.

1297
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,840
But once you wear that, ah, this reaction of mine,

1298
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
it's not about what's going on right now.

1299
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,960
There's something all being activated here.

1300
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,360
That awareness alone weakens the,

1301
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,120
it slackens the strings of it.

1302
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,280
Now you're no longer, they're no longer is taught.

1303
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,400
They're no longer is automatically capable of pulling on you.

1304
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,000
So it does have to begin with awareness of them.

1305
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:35,600
Ultimately, if we realize that this puppet master is just a desperate little person

1306
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,560
trying to get you to survive, the only way he, she, they knew how,

1307
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,320
when you were small, when they were small,

1308
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,160
if you make friends with it, but we relieve it of its duties.

1309
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,640
See, thanks very much, but I can handle it now.

1310
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,520
It eventually becomes our friend rather than sort of our master.

1311
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,560
On that first step of just acknowledging,

1312
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,640
just understanding that there is a puppet master there controlling us

1313
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,280
and exactly which strings that puppet master is pulling in our lives.

1314
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,200
How does one go about awareness, the process of awareness?

1315
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,000
Is that, I mean, is it introspection, keeping a diary therapy?

1316
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,720
What, what is it?

1317
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:19,840
Well, all that, I mean, all or any, but even when you ask how you go about it,

1318
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,600
what is the it?

1319
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,400
Well, for you to say how to go about it,

1320
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,160
you already must have some degree of awareness.

1321
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,000
If you didn't, you wouldn't even be asking the question.

1322
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,600
So that's the very first step of realizing that there's something here to work on.

1323
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,760
There's something here to work through.

1324
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,240
It does not need to be the way it is.

1325
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,400
That already is the biggest step.

1326
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,320
The Buddha said that to recognize the source of your suffering

1327
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,560
is the first step towards relieving the suffering.

1328
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,800
And so as soon as you ask how you go about it, you've already taken a huge step.

1329
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,520
Because a lot of people don't even know that there's an it.

1330
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,800
They just think this is a reality, that this is life.

1331
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,200
So realizing that this it doesn't have to be the way it is.

1332
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,680
That's already a huge step now.

1333
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,280
Beyond that, yoga, meditation, nature,

1334
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:18,080
therapy of all kinds, body work of all kinds, like somatic experiencing,

1335
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,840
or craniosacral treatments, or even massage therapy.

1336
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,440
It's incredible what can be revealed just through body work like that.

1337
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,160
Then all kinds of forms of therapy, the ones I teach, the ones other people teach.

1338
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:41,440
Journaling, certain exercises in this book that we recommend.

1339
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,880
Just ask yourself where you have troubles saying no in life,

1340
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,720
to things you don't really want to do.

1341
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,960
And working that through on a regular basis.

1342
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,440
So there's lots of ways once you open the door.

1343
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:59,440
I have a chapter on psychedelics here, which is again, it's not like a panacea or for everyone,

1344
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,720
but certainly it's a helpful modality for a lot of people.

1345
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,880
So some people may actually benefit from taking pharmaceutical medications

1346
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,080
if their situation is dire enough, but not as the final answer,

1347
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,840
but as a way of getting respite, that allow them to go to work on the real issues

1348
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,360
that cause them to be depressed, or anxious, or tuning out.

1349
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,400
So any and all of these things.

1350
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,440
Well, the people don't even want to open those doors though,

1351
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,240
because there's so much pain associated with maybe going back or revisiting an early experience

1352
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,760
that they just think it's better to keep the doors shut, and get to tomorrow.

1353
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,040
That's true, to which I have two answers.

1354
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,160
One is, it's true, it's painful.

1355
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,920
Because all the pain you didn't want to feel, and you've been running away from

1356
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,200
through your compensatory behaviors, like your addictions,

1357
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,680
or nothing but an attempt to escape from pain, that's all they are.

1358
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,320
They're not a disease, they're not a genetic, whatever it is.

1359
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,520
Addictions are very simply an attempt to escape pain, which create more pain,

1360
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,200
but that's what they are.

1361
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,880
And so we get addicted to work, to sex, to pornography, to gambling, to the internet,

1362
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,280
to shopping, to eating, to power.

1363
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:21,760
On that point, I find it so fascinating, when you mentioned in your previous book,

1364
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:29,200
that you classified things like food, social media, shopping, porn and work,

1365
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:35,120
as types of addiction, that in and of itself was a bit of a revelation for me,

1366
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,280
because I never saw work as an addiction.

1367
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:42,800
The minute you said it was, and I kind of link it to heroin addiction,

1368
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:48,080
which is providing a certain psychological, physiological benefit to me.

1369
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,440
Temporarily.

1370
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,840
Temporarily, of course it's a fucking addiction.

1371
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,560
Of course work is an addiction, of course I have that addiction.

1372
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
Well, work can be an addiction, work can also be sacred,

1373
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,440
it can also be fulfilling in the manifestation of your creative origins.

1374
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,480
But it's strange to say, not that I recommend it,

1375
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,520
but it's possible even to use heroin in a non-addictive way.

1376
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,400
I don't personally get it, and I would never want to,

1377
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,200
but the addiction is never in the behavior itself,

1378
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,880
it's in your relationship to the behavior.

1379
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,480
So if the particular activity gives you temporary relief or pleasure,

1380
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,400
and therefore you crave it, but it causes harm in the long term,

1381
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,400
and you can't give it up, you got an addiction.

1382
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,520
And I don't care what the activity is, it could be drugs,

1383
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,360
and all the other things that we mentioned.

1384
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,120
And it employs the same brain circus, by the way.

1385
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,320
The workaholic is after the same brain chemical that the cocaine addict is after, dopamine.

1386
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,040
And people can be even addicted to their own stress hormones,

1387
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,800
like adrenaline, the so-called adrenaline junkies, there's such a thing.

1388
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,720
So almost anything can be addictive if it serves the purpose

1389
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,320
of temporarily easing some distress, but causing harm in the long term.

1390
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,520
Is escapism the right word to use then for it?

1391
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,280
Because it doesn't sound as much like we're escaping,

1392
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,200
rather than we are seeking something.

1393
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,000
We're seeking relief from a certain mental state.

1394
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,960
I just gave you a definition of addiction,

1395
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,280
so I don't know what addictions you've had or haven't,

1396
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,160
but what did that do for you?

1397
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,120
Temporarily, it gave you something.

1398
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:41,040
It made me feel like I was valid and I was pursuing a sense of accomplishment and validation.

1399
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,160
It gave you a sense of worth.

1400
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,440
Worth, yeah, it was worthy.

1401
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,600
No, no, is that something that people need or not?

1402
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:46,960
Yes.

1403
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,080
Yeah, that's a good thing.

1404
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,840
But the real question is, why did you ever get the idea that you didn't have the worth?

1405
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,440
Why did I get the idea that I didn't have the worth?

1406
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,240
That's where trauma comes in.

1407
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,680
Because I was called the N-word when I was eight by a kid in school.

1408
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,240
Exactly.

1409
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,280
And then no one was going to be there.

1410
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,960
And because your mother screamed at your father.

1411
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1412
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,040
And so all that together.

1413
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,160
And that's emotionally painful.

1414
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,520
Like, what's it feel like to be not to have a sense of worth?

1415
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,640
That's painful.

1416
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,280
And so that's why my mantra is don't ask why the addiction, ask why the pain.

1417
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,640
And if you want to understand why the pain, you have to look at that person's life.

1418
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,400
And what the benefit of the addiction is?

1419
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,600
That's something that you say in previous book that I found it's a flipping of narrative

1420
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,160
where you say we should be asking what the benefit of the addiction is.

1421
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,480
Yeah.

1422
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,120
Well, like in your case, it gives me a sense of worth.

1423
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,880
Well, okay, I'll say to you, if you come to me because you say like I'm broke all like

1424
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,400
it's causing some harm in my life.

1425
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,200
It's keeping me from intimate relationships.

1426
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,520
It makes me stressed and tired, whatever it is.

1427
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,160
It's the first thing I would ask you for you of you is what is it doing for you?

1428
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,800
And you say a sense of worth and I'd say, you know what?

1429
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,120
You deserve to have a sense of worth.

1430
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,120
I totally understand why you'd want to engage in an activity that gives it to you.

1431
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,960
But given that it's causing you harm, let's look at why you don't have a sense of worth

1432
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,280
and how else you might develop it that isn't harmful to you, you know?

1433
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,960
So, but you start with what's right about it.

1434
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,720
What are you looking for?

1435
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,040
And what you're looking for is always valid.

1436
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:32,160
And how would one go about getting that sense of worth I'm asking for a friend?

1437
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,120
Well, that would be a matter of some form of work.

1438
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:45,840
People who meditate often deal with that issue through the meditation, not always.

1439
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,880
Certainly therapy, you know?

1440
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,440
By recognizing also that what you're doing to get the sense of worth doesn't really do it for you,

1441
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,360
just by getting honest about it, you know?

1442
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,760
So there's all kinds of ways, but the first step is the recognition.

1443
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,440
That's the first step that you say is missing from the book, which is that sort of awareness.

1444
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,560
The next thing which I've been, it's been really front of mind in my life recently,

1445
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,440
because I've been asked this a few times on stage and I've been trying to find the words to

1446
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,720
really articulate the importance of it is, and this is one of your forays in this book about

1447
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:26,080
how to heal is authenticity. Really interesting concept, because I've been trying to articulate

1448
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,480
why the fact that I've just shared all this stuff with you and the fact that I do this every week,

1449
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,320
I'm getting closer and closer to that sort of authentic self where there's really,

1450
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,600
the mask is kind of dropping on me. Why that's been so healing for me.

1451
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,880
Why is authenticity such a good way, an important way for us to heal?

1452
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,960
It's much more than a way for us to heal. It's actually who we are.

1453
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,920
Like what you're really asking is, why is it important for a creature to be true to its own

1454
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:55,120
nature? Because that's what we're meant to do. We're meant to be here as ourselves,

1455
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:02,880
and when we're not ourselves because we had to abandon ourselves or betray ourselves,

1456
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:09,440
disconnect from ourselves in order to survive, we lost connections with our essence.

1457
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:23,040
And how does it feel to be a successful CEO and more than realizing your financial dreams,

1458
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:30,800
but to be a workaholic and not to be available to yourself in areas of your life that really matter

1459
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:37,840
to you, as opposed to being honest about your stuff, sharing it with other people,

1460
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:46,080
dropping the veil, dropping the... I mean, to answer your question, what does it feel like?

1461
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,760
I mean, can you sense the difference in your body? Feel the lighter.

1462
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,280
Well, yeah. Expansive. Exactly. Well, that's the answer. That's why it's so important.

1463
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:03,360
It's so many of us live in authentic lives because, as you said, it's either

1464
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:10,240
because from an early age, we were escaping some kind of reality in order to help us to

1465
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,400
survive, or then the other thing that happens a bit later on in life is we develop an identity

1466
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:21,520
which becomes a career, which becomes a social circle, which becomes a prison of our inauthentic

1467
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,120
selves. We get trapped in there because I was good at something, or because I felt

1468
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:34,160
accepted in this job as a lawyer. So I am now living inauthentically as this robot in this prison.

1469
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:45,120
And it's a... There's often a real perception of risk and loss and danger of trying to get

1470
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,680
out of that prison, of trying to get close to our authentic selves. We feel like we'll lose our

1471
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,400
friendship circle. We'll feel like we'll let our parents down who wanted us to become a lawyer.

1472
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,280
All of these things, I guess you see that a lot in your work.

1473
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:07,040
Well, there's that risk. But here's the issue. As a child, you had no choice but to go for

1474
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:15,120
acceptance and being approved of and being received under any conditions.

1475
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,440
No matter what you had to give up of your authenticity,

1476
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,840
you had to give up your authenticity. You had no choice in the matter. At a certain point as adults,

1477
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,160
we learn that this lack of authenticity, this disconnection from ourselves, this separation

1478
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:35,360
from our gut feelings is costing us. It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our peace of

1479
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:43,760
mind, our relationship, our mental health, and so on. You'll never be as vulnerable again

1480
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:50,320
as you were when you were a child. You'll never be as helpless, as dependent, as resourceless.

1481
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:58,800
No, it's true that if you develop the whole set of relationships based on your inauthentic persona,

1482
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:07,120
some people in your life may not like it if you gradually move towards authenticity. They may

1483
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,120
not like it. It's not what they wanted from you. You're going to find out who your friends are.

1484
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,280
You're really going to find, because your real friends will say, oh, I'm so happy for you.

1485
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,920
People are waiting for this. Other friends will say, it's not what I signed up for.

1486
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:28,320
The question is, you still have to decide. As an infant, as a young child, I had no agency

1487
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,280
in the choice of authenticity and attachment. No, I do. Which one do I want to go with?

1488
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,000
What is the cost of being inauthentic? I can't make that decision for anybody else.

1489
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,240
Nobody can make that decision for anybody else. But most people will find that choosing authenticity

1490
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,720
has benefits way beyond whatever they might lose. That's what I find.

1491
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,400
And you said the word that agency, which is the second of the four A's on how to heal. Now,

1492
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,560
agency, when I read that word, I hear like personal responsibility, taking personal

1493
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,880
responsibility over my life. Exactly. Which also means not letting, you know, you don't use,

1494
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,160
you don't wear trauma as a badge, you know, or you don't use it as a get out of jail pass in a

1495
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:17,120
game of Monopoly. Oh, I was traumatized. So I can't, I can't be any other way. You know, I mean,

1496
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:23,440
Giving all the power to the puppet master. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So agency means actually,

1497
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,920
I take responsibility not for what happened to me,

1498
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:33,120
not even how I interpreted the world as a result going backwards,

1499
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,040
but how I interpret the world from now on. Do I still want to interpret the world

1500
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,960
and my role in it based on some decision I made when I was a one year old?

1501
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,640
That's where agency comes in. Agency also means that if I have

1502
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,640
any kind of dysfunction or illness, it's not just that I put my hands in the hands of a,

1503
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,720
put my, my fate in the hands of a, a physician or a healer, but I, I have agent, I make the

1504
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:02,320
decisions. I listen to your advice. I accept some, I don't accept some, but I'm the one who's making

1505
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:10,160
the decisions along with what seems right to me. So agency. It's interesting in your,

1506
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,400
in your work, throughout your work, you use alliteration as a lot, as a way to kind of

1507
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:20,240
summarize and make ideas really memorable. It really helps. It's a little trick.

1508
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:24,960
It's a trick. It's a writing trick, right? Well, it's, it also works, you know, before

1509
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,200
A's or the four of us, but I don't, I don't want to say, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm denigrating

1510
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,800
my work. If I say it's a trick, no, it's just something, just the way things occur to me.

1511
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,600
That's all it is. One of the, one of the, um, alliteration devices you use is also

1512
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:45,840
relates to limiting beliefs and how we can undo self-limiting beliefs with the five Rs.

1513
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:52,640
Yeah. Relabel, reattribute, refocus, re, revalue and recreate. Yeah. Now, from what I

1514
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
understood of those, relabeling is

1515
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:02,720
the story and the belief that is limiting to us, um, sort of redefining it. Well,

1516
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:10,240
it takes something like, um, your work journalism. Yeah. I need to go to work. I need to do this work.

1517
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Yeah. Relabeling is, I don't need to do this work. I just have a belief that I need to do this work.

1518
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,000
Okay. So that real building just takes a degree of separation from the

1519
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,600
behavior. And, and actually it's true. It's not that you need to do all this work. You have this

1520
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:32,160
belief. So relabeling just says it for what it is. By the way, I have to acknowledge that I,

1521
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,520
these, these five Rs, only one in his mind. I stole the other four from a psychiatrist.

1522
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,240
That's fine. That's all.

1523
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,960
Yeah. Just, I, I mentioned that in the book, but I find it very helpful technique, but

1524
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,760
it was developed for people with obsessive-compulsive tendencies.

1525
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,320
So the relabel is not that I have to wash my hand a hundred times. I just have a belief that I have

1526
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,560
to wash my hand a hundred times. That's the context in which it was developed. I think it works for

1527
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,600
all kinds of, all kinds of, um, dynamics. And then if I, and then so I've relabelled it,

1528
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,560
I don't have to work to feel a sense of validation, but I have a belief that I do.

1529
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,160
That's right. And then I reattribute it, which is the second R,

1530
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,880
which means I get clear on where it's come from.

1531
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:19,280
Yeah. So let's say you have the belief that you're not worth it. It's not two that are not worth it.

1532
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,800
I just have a belief that I'm not worth it. Okay. Or it may not be two that are not worth it,

1533
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:31,120
but I do have a belief that I'm not worth it. Re-attribute means this is an old brain circuit

1534
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,440
sending me an old message. It's got nothing to do with reality. It has to do with some

1535
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,120
experience that I had a long time ago. That's the reattribute. You just say,

1536
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:43,760
where is it actually coming from? There's a circuit in your brain that's wired with the message.

1537
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,600
You're not worth it. And it's going to keep repeating that message.

1538
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,160
Well, you say, okay, that's where it's coming from.

1539
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,480
Until I refocus, which is the third R.

1540
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:59,840
Yeah. So refocus is just to give us some space. So if they ever say, I need to go to work,

1541
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,680
okay, refocus means well, for five minutes, maybe in five minutes I'll go to work,

1542
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:12,960
for five minutes I won't. I'm going to put on some piece of music or go for a walk or meditate or

1543
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:19,680
whatever. So you refocus, you put the intention somewhere else. Just so that to prove to yourself,

1544
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,400
but you actually have some agency over your brain. If only for five minutes,

1545
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,560
if you have this belief that I'm not worth it. Well, you can go back to it in five minutes if

1546
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,280
you want. Just for five minutes though, consider all the ways that you made a contribution.

1547
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:41,680
Consider all the ways that people have acknowledged your benign presence in their lives.

1548
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:46,720
The times that people have told you that they've loved you or that you told somebody else,

1549
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,720
just for five minutes, hang out with that. Five minutes later, if you want to go back to this

1550
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:55,600
belief or if you can't help going back to this belief that you're not worth it, well, that's okay.

1551
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,880
But at least create some space. It's all about creating space between yourself and these beliefs

1552
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,840
or these behaviors. And in that five minutes, you're basically accepting new evidence to be

1553
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,520
true or you're proving that other evidence is true. I didn't need to go and work. Well,

1554
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,080
you're also proving that you don't have to spend all your time subjected to those beliefs.

1555
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,960
You can take a hiatus from it, at least for a while. And that they are not you. They're not you,

1556
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:28,960
yeah. And then revalue. Revalue it really what it should mean or maybe more accurately devalue

1557
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,840
because you say, what has been the actual value? This believed that I'm not worth it.

1558
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,440
What has been the actual value of it in my life? Or this tendency of mine to be a workaholic?

1559
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,840
What has been the actual value? Oh, it made me tired. It made me alienated or it keeps me depressed

1560
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,000
or it keeps me hopelessly trying to prove something which I can never prove to myself

1561
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,560
anyway through external activity. So you actually look at what does it mean is actually impact on

1562
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:00,480
your life? What has been this real value? Sometimes the value is positive, right? Like I

1563
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,280
think about my own workaholic workaholism, if that's the term, I think there's some

1564
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:11,040
there's some positives here. Yeah, a lot of negatives. Yeah. Well, is the positive due

1565
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,720
to workaholism? Or is it due to your capacity to work hard and on behalf of a goal? They're not the

1566
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:23,600
same. Your capacity to work hard to achieve a certain goal is simply a gift that you have.

1567
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,440
And something that maybe takes some discipline and application on your part.

1568
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:35,520
That's not workaholism. That's just a strong positive work ethic. The workaholism is when

1569
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:41,520
you're driven to work, you actually don't need to. It's funny because it reminds me of an analogy

1570
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,760
I've been talking about in the last couple of episodes of this podcast, the distinction between

1571
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,600
being driven and being dragged. Yeah. It's like, which side of the lorry am I flying down the

1572
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,920
motorway? Am I tied to the front and am I running and pulling the lorry? Or am I just like my ankles

1573
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,520
attached to the back of the lorry as it flies down the motorway because I'm being dragged?

1574
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,120
But if I may, I would say that neither of those are particularly desirable.

1575
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,640
But but but it's the distinction that I made before between being driven and being called.

1576
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:16,640
Yeah. Because if you're called, you see, if I call you say, Stephen, would you come and have

1577
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,720
dinner with me? You can say yes, you can say no, I just gave you a call and you can say

1578
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,080
literally I'm talking about calling a telephone call. You know, you can say yes, you can say no.

1579
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:30,160
It's a decision though. But you're the one who's making the decision. Yeah. When you're dragged

1580
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:34,240
or pushed or pulled, you're not making the decision. I'm a slave to the decision, to that,

1581
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,600
to the activity. One of the one of the really interesting things I wanted to talk to you about

1582
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,560
is ADHD. Yeah. I've had a few of my friends and my close friendship circle diagnosed with ADHD

1583
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:52,560
recently. And then I looked into some of the statistics around ADHD. And I found this statistic

1584
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,640
that said in the 1980s, one in 20 US children were diagnosed with ADHD. Today, the number is roughly

1585
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:06,320
one in nine. Yeah. And just generally, you know, around me there's it feels like and this could

1586
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:10,640
just be because of my own little narrow circle or it could be because of a wider thing happening

1587
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:15,760
in society. It feels like there's been an increase in diagnosis of mental illness and things like

1588
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:23,120
ADHD. And the causes when I spoke to my friend about what he believed the cause of his ADHD

1589
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,080
was and he's posted this on LinkedIn and talks about it very publicly now.

1590
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:34,400
It seemed to point to he seemed to believe it was relating to some kind of genetic or

1591
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:42,400
heritable factor. Yeah. Now, the issue that I've sort of been contending with myself and why I

1592
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,440
spoke to Johan Hari about this and others about this is if I if I am to accept that,

1593
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:54,240
then I am I feel like I'm accepting that we're being born somewhat broken. And this is almost

1594
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:59,040
what Johan Hari talked about in the early stages of his teenage years where he he was made to believe

1595
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,400
that there was this chemical imbalance in his brain and therefore he was born broken and here's

1596
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,760
the medication to solve it. Yeah. So but I don't want I don't believe that I don't I don't personally

1597
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,080
believe that we're we're born broken. Well, anybody in the subject might do what I think Johan

1598
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:19,600
and actually there's to read my book on ADHD is called scattered minds. And I was diagnosed

1599
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,640
within my fifties and so were a couple of my kids. But but I never bought into the idea this is a

1600
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:31,040
genetic disease or there's a disease at all genetic or otherwise. Now, as for the rising number of

1601
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,560
people being diagnosed with it, there could be two reasons at least one is we're better

1602
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:42,080
diagnosis or before we wouldn't have noticed it but now we are. Or genuinely, there's more people

1603
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,960
who are having trouble in certain ways such as with attention and impulse control and so on.

1604
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,800
But either way, the fact is that many more children are being diagnosed and medicated

1605
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,240
for this condition, particularly in the US, but also increasingly here in the UK as well,

1606
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:07,680
and in China and elsewhere. Now, as I said earlier, if we the fact is here's the actual reality.

1607
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:13,360
Nobody's ever found a gene for ADHD. Nobody's ever found a gene that says, if you have this gene,

1608
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,320
you're going to have ADHD. No such genes have been found. No group of genes have been found that

1609
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,800
says if you're going to have this gene, you're going to have this condition, nor ever will be.

1610
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,280
And no such gene or group of genes have ever been found that if you don't have these genes,

1611
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:32,480
you will not have the condition. No, there are some diseases that are genetic. One runs in my

1612
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:38,000
family, muscular dystrophy. If you have the gene, you're going to have the disease. My mother had it,

1613
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
my aunt had it. That's a genetic condition. And if you have the gene, you'll have the disease.

1614
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:54,000
Very rare, those kind of diseases. No, there are some genes that the more of them you have,

1615
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,000
the more likely you are to have any number of mental health diagnoses, ADHD, depression, anxiety,

1616
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:06,880
even psychosis, bipolar illness. But there's no group of genes or set of genes or gene that

1617
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,840
themselves determine any one condition. As a matter of fact, you can have those same genes

1618
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,760
and not have any condition whatsoever. So something's being passed on, but it's not

1619
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,040
any kind of condition that's being passed on. What's being passed on is sensitivity. And the more

1620
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:27,840
sensitive you are, the more you're going to feel whatever's going on in the environment.

1621
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,760
So you take the same sensitive kid with these genes that confer greater sensitivity out of them,

1622
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:40,000
and sensitive means to feel, from the Latin word to feel, sincere. The more sensitive you are,

1623
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,640
the more you're going to feel. The more you feel, the more bad stuff happens, the more pain you're

1624
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:49,120
going to be in, and the more compensating you're going to have to do. At the same time, with those

1625
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:53,760
same genes, if you treat it well and you grow up in a healthy environment, you just be creative and

1626
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:01,200
happy and joyful and a leader and an artist or a shaman or a very creative CEO or whatever you're

1627
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:08,080
going to be. So the genes don't determine. They make you more sensitive to their environment. No,

1628
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:13,520
if you go back to what I said about the tuning out, it's simply a defense. So the more sensitive you

1629
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:19,200
are and the stress in the environment, the more you're going to feel the stress, the more you're

1630
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:26,400
going to need to escape from it by tuning out. So it didn't inherit ADHD. You inherited a sensitivity

1631
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:31,520
that makes it more likely under stressful circumstances that you revert to tuning out

1632
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,720
when your brain is developing, which by the way is an organ that develops physiologically

1633
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:42,160
under the impact of the emotional environment. So if there's a lot of stress in a child's life,

1634
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,080
and what I'm saying is in this society is that more and more parents are stressed,

1635
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,320
not because they don't love their kids, not because they're not doing their very utmost to

1636
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:54,400
provide for them, but because they're more stressed through all kinds of social, political,

1637
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,720
economic reasons than if you look at inflation in Britain, which is a high risk right now,

1638
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,280
more people are going to be stressed financially. Financial stress on the parents translates into

1639
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,920
physiological stress in the children. Those children may want to tune out because it's too

1640
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,600
much to be in the present. Some of them will be diagnosed with ADHD. They didn't inherit anything

1641
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:21,040
in terms of a disease. They're just reacting to the environment. So if we're diagnosing more

1642
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,360
and more kids these days, I think it's because the parenting environment has become much more

1643
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:30,320
stressed. And that's backed up in this book where you mentioned that study of 65,000 parents

1644
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,240
and their children with ADHD, right? There's more trauma in their lives.

1645
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,760
So the children, they do a study with 65,000?

1646
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,040
I forget. You're better than I am.

1647
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,440
It was 65,000. I read it three hours ago.

1648
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,640
Yeah, but many thousands of kids, yeah.

1649
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,480
So because I found that to be really, really sort of supportive of what you just said where,

1650
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:56,800
again, I'm saying this from memory, but a study of 65,000 children and their parents,

1651
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:02,960
and they found that those parents who had more adverse traumatic events in their lives

1652
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,360
ended up having a higher chance of having a child that had ADHD.

1653
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,720
Well, look, if you look at the United States at least,

1654
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,200
poor kids and kids of so-called color are much more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.

1655
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,640
Interesting.

1656
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:22,160
No, why would that be the case? Because they're living with so much more stress.

1657
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,400
Men as well, right?

1658
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,320
Men as well. Adults, you mean?

1659
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,680
Men, yeah. So I read that more men or boys are diagnosed.

1660
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:36,640
More men are diagnosed partly because in men, the symptom of hyperactivity seems to be there,

1661
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,240
more often. So when a kid is sitting in school and the cancer is still,

1662
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,440
that's obvious. The teacher will notice it. The girl who's kind of dreamy and tunes out

1663
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,320
kind of fades away at the back of the class. She doesn't create any problems.

1664
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,240
So that's one of the reasons.

1665
01:33:54,240 --> 01:34:03,440
But also, funny to say, but young boys, infant boys are more sensitive to environmental pressure

1666
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:08,800
than girls are for some strange reason. So they're more likely to be affected by these factors.

1667
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,320
Seeing a boy like that in the class, that's a fidgety that has a poor attention span,

1668
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:20,240
bad response to stress. We medicate. What is the impact of that approach to treatment,

1669
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:25,600
medicating super early? I used to, when I worked as a physician, I would certainly prescribe

1670
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,560
medications sometimes. It's a question of who's prescribing and what intention.

1671
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,000
If I understand that the real problem in this child is not that there's anything intrinsically

1672
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,360
wrong with the child, but that they were developed in a stressed environment and no stresses are

1673
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:46,720
still acting on them. And one of the stresses is the parents don't understand the kids' behaviors

1674
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:52,160
and they tend to react rather harshly. Then if I can help the parent understand

1675
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:57,120
the sensitive nature of their child, which also means that when positive changes occur in the

1676
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:02,320
environment, the kid will be very responsive to that as well. If the parents can create a positive,

1677
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,360
accepting, understanding atmosphere in the home and work on their own stresses so they don't

1678
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:13,840
unconsciously pass them on to their kids, that kid will change very quickly. And I say, well,

1679
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,160
if in the short term, the child wants the medication to function better and no child should

1680
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:24,080
be forced to take medication and medication are never the final answer that the very most

1681
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,120
there stop cap. There's no proof whatsoever that medications help anybody heal from ADHD.

1682
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,560
They simply suppress symptoms, which may be helpful in the short term, but for God's sakes,

1683
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,760
go to work on the long-term development of that child. And what does that mean?

1684
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:43,360
Create the conditions in which healthy development takes place. That child will do very, very well.

1685
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,760
If you think the problem is a disease, they're just going to medicate away the symptoms of.

1686
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,840
What about for adults? I'm thinking of my friend there. He's in his 30s and he got the diagnosis

1687
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,560
of ADHD in his 30s. He's been given this medication, which he presumably has to take for life.

1688
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:04,880
He's told me the medication has helped him focus. Has helped him focus. He's been a game changer,

1689
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:10,080
Steve. Yeah, I've taken medication myself for ADHD and it helped me focus. It helped me write

1690
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:15,840
my first book. I didn't take it for this one. As a matter of fact, more recently, when I was

1691
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,760
beginning to write the medication, I thought maybe I would take a bit of stimulant like I used to.

1692
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,720
And just to see if it helps me write the book better, all it did is give me side effects.

1693
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:30,800
My brain has changed. I don't need it anymore. So I would say to your friend,

1694
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,160
if the medication is helping you right now and it's not causing you side effects,

1695
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:41,520
I got nothing against it. And you might want to give it a break every weekend.

1696
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,320
If you don't, you might want to use it for when you're having to work or having to concentrate,

1697
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,280
but it's up to you. If it helps you function, take it, but go to work on the traumas and

1698
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:58,480
stresses driving the ADHD, going back to your childhood. And I may say my book on ADHD,

1699
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:04,800
scattered minds does outline some ways to do that. You might find that you don't need the medication

1700
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:11,520
so much anymore or not at all, perhaps. Number one, number two, even if you do,

1701
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:17,920
your life will be so much fuller and so much more less stressed if you deal with the underlying

1702
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,600
factors than if you simply medicate the symptom. Is there, I always think in life there's a cost

1703
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:28,480
for all these things we use to medicate and stimulate ourselves. And so I always ask myself,

1704
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:33,600
like there's got to be a catch here. And even for coffee, I'm like, what's the catch? We can't

1705
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,520
just be all up and positive. And with my friend, when he said, when he had the conversation with me

1706
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,680
about being on this medication for life, my first thought is like, okay, what's the cost?

1707
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:46,720
It's going to make you really focused and better at work. But what is the long term cost of?

1708
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:53,360
I'd have to talk to your friend. Those are good questions to ask. When I took medication,

1709
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,880
it made me a much more efficient workaholic. It did nothing for my workaholicism,

1710
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:03,040
just made me much better at it because I could stay up later now and I was more focused.

1711
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:09,280
I could even more things done. So you got to deal with these other issues.

1712
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:10,720
Did you?

1713
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:19,760
I did. Did I deal with them? Yes, I have. And there's so much more like dealing with the trauma.

1714
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:25,120
Like I'm telling you, if your friend's got ADHD, I can tell you he had to stress early for years.

1715
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:31,600
And his parents were stressed. His parents were stressed. So deal with that. Deal with what

1716
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,480
conditions are you creating now in your life that create more stress for you?

1717
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:40,480
Are you taking care of your body? Are you exercising? Are you eating well? Do you get out

1718
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,880
there in nature? Nature has a certain kind of harmony to it, which actually calms the mind.

1719
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,400
So are you doing all these things? If you're not, all you're doing is medicating a symptom.

1720
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:56,560
If you are taking the medication specifically to help you focus, but you're working on his other

1721
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:02,080
issues, you live a much full life and you may find you don't need the medication after all.

1722
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:11,280
You came off the medication for your ADD. Because I'm just not that medically well versed,

1723
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:17,440
what's the difference between ADD and ADHD? It's a kind of confusion. ADHD simply means

1724
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:23,040
that the hyperactivity is present. So you can have ADD without hyperactivity. So the actual

1725
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:32,400
you know, proper way to divide it is ADD. And in brackets, HD so that indicating that the

1726
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:37,680
hyperactivity may or may not be there. Got you. So you, you, you were on medication,

1727
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:43,520
you did the work, you know, not on medication. Do you still have the symptoms of ADD?

1728
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,400
To a certain degree, but not in a way that anyway, blights my life. Like one thing I can

1729
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,560
pity, be sure that when I go on a speaking trip, I'm going to lose something. I'm going to lose my,

1730
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:01,440
my portable electrical tooth cleaner, where I'm going to, in this case, I left my rain jacket

1731
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:07,360
in Budapest when I came here on. You can take it for granted that my attention will just not

1732
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:11,200
notice something that I haven't packed yet. That's okay. I'm going back to Budapest next week. So

1733
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:16,320
I get to get my rain jacket back. But sometimes it's the cost of being me. So what? You know,

1734
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:22,160
so no, not in every way, but that's not the point. Nobody's life has to be perfect.

1735
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,520
It just has to be a life that I want to live and I can enjoy living.

1736
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:32,880
That I have, you know, so who cares if sometimes I forget something or I lose something or

1737
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,560
even if I'm listening to a symphony and I can't keep my attention on it. Okay, so I can't.

1738
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,120
This, you talk about this some toxic society. Yeah.

1739
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,520
Do you think society is getting more toxic? And if so, why?

1740
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:56,000
What measure shall we use? You know, if we use the measure of a number of kids being medicated,

1741
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:03,440
the number of adults having chronic illness or immune disease, number of students,

1742
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:12,480
university students being depressed, contemplating suicide, number of children in the United States

1743
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:18,880
killing themselves, the number of people on medications of all kinds,

1744
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:26,240
the degree of safety that people have in society, the ranker or piece that characterizes

1745
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:33,440
political discourse in this world, the intolerable fact that eight people in the world,

1746
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:40,480
I think, own as much as the bottom half, as the bottom 3.5 billion. You know, if I look at all

1747
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,000
those things by those measures, if we look at what's happening to the environment, if I look

1748
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,400
at the fact that the people who are the worst polluters in the environment also happen to be

1749
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:58,640
the most successful people by a certain measure of success. By any number of parameters, if I look at

1750
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:09,040
how racism still affects the lives of so many people and not just affects it in an emotional

1751
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:16,640
sense, but actually physiologically, you know, then yeah, this is a toxic society and those

1752
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:21,520
measures are getting worse, they're not getting better and inequality is getting worse here in the

1753
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:29,360
UK and elsewhere. So yeah, I think it's getting more toxic. What's the antidote? Well, how about

1754
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:34,080
people back to this word awareness? Like people just have to get that this is how it is. And

1755
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:38,560
in the last chapter, I don't lay out a political program, you know, I don't see that as my role

1756
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,520
to do that. I have my own political ideas and preferences, but I don't want to impose them on

1757
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:49,920
the reader. But I do say, first of all, we have to lose our illusions that this is that this

1758
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:56,480
normality is actually healthy or natural. You have to just get cognizant that what we consider

1759
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:06,720
to be normal is actually bad for us. Number one, number two, just if we introduced the concept

1760
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:13,920
of trauma into healthcare, the average doctor again, strange to say, doesn't hear a single

1761
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,880
lecture in their medical training about the impact of trauma on physical or mental health,

1762
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:24,800
which is astonishing. Given that it was a British psychologist, Dr. Richard Bentall,

1763
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,320
who pointed out not that many years ago, that the evidence linking what we call mental illness and

1764
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,800
childhood adversity is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer.

1765
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,680
And the average physician doesn't hear a word about that. It's astonishing.

1766
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,640
Education, teachers, if they understood child development, brain development,

1767
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:52,960
the developmental factors that children need, that I cite in this book. And if they understood

1768
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,320
how trauma affects kids' capacity to learn, to pay attention, and to behave in functional ways,

1769
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:06,640
the Daily Telegraph here in London, not that long ago, was bemoaning the fact that kids

1770
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:13,760
aren't caned anymore in schools. I mean, what they were moaning about is that we no longer

1771
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:20,320
traumatize kids quite as harshly as we used to. That's all it does, caning. So if teachers

1772
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:25,120
understood that the behaviors on the part of children are actually manifestations of

1773
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:31,760
emotional dynamics of frustration and needs not being met, and very often of trauma,

1774
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,840
that would change the educational system. If the legal system understood it,

1775
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,640
that most people facing the criminal justice system are actually traumatized people.

1776
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:49,280
They could actually be rehabilitated and healed if we understood that, instead of just

1777
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,680
exposing them to harsh punishments, we actually treated them like human beings

1778
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:59,600
who may have done things that are unacceptable, but that came from traumas they couldn't have helped,

1779
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:05,040
and that they can be helped back to healthy functioning, as we know from lots of experience.

1780
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:13,920
Just that little trauma information would change society. So that's what I can offer as a physician.

1781
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,040
What about parents? What do they need to know?

1782
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:22,880
Yeah, well, if parents actually understood, first of all, that the first three years are

1783
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:29,200
everything, that if they get the template right in the first three years, they can hardly set a foot

1784
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:34,800
wrong afterwards. But on the other hand, if we're not present for our kids emotionally,

1785
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:41,440
if we don't understand them, if we don't see them, if we don't attune to their emotional states,

1786
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,600
we're going to hurt them. And if they understood what the needs of children are,

1787
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:51,760
when I mentioned some of them, for play, for experience of all emotions, for

1788
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:59,840
unconditional loving attachment, for the child being able to rest from having to work

1789
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,880
to make the relationship work. So the child doesn't have to be good or nice or beautiful or

1790
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:12,960
successful. They just have to be. So we don't impose conditions on our approval and acceptance

1791
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:18,720
on them. If parents just understood that, and if they understood how important it is that they

1792
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:23,440
take care of their own emotional needs so that a child doesn't have to take responsibility,

1793
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:29,680
like perhaps you did for the parents stresses. If parents understood all that, and if society

1794
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:35,680
actually understood how important parenting was, and it supported parents who needed the support

1795
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:42,480
to be there for their kids, wouldn't be financially costly, it would save us a lot of money.

1796
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:48,480
Not to mention, we'd have a lot more happier kids who don't need to be on medications. So, yeah.

1797
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:54,080
And lastly, schools. Schools? Well, again, like I said about educators, if educators, well, here's

1798
01:46:54,080 --> 01:47:00,480
the thing. If you look at how does the human brain develop? I quote an article from the Harvard

1799
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:05,760
Center on the Developing Child that appeared in a journal, Pediatrics, official journal of the

1800
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:14,560
American Pediatric Academy in 2012, February. The article said that the human brain develops

1801
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:21,360
through a complex process that begins before birth and continues into adulthood. Okay. Now,

1802
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:27,200
that means A, we take care of the emotional needs of pregnant women. Number one. Number two, if it

1803
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:32,320
continues into adulthood, continues into adulthood, then the job of the schools, if they understand

1804
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:41,120
it right, is not to teach kids what year the Battle of Austerlitz took place, or the Battle of Waterloo,

1805
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:49,840
or algebra, any of that stuff. The most important job of the schools is to promote

1806
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:55,520
healthy brain development. With a child whose healthy brain development will actually be naturally

1807
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:02,160
curious, they'll want to know about history. They'll be keen to absorb the skills of algebra.

1808
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:09,280
They'll want to know how to use a computer, and they'll want to know how to write properly. The

1809
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:15,840
kids will want to do that spontaneously, because mastery and learning, these are human hungers,

1810
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:22,880
they're human needs. So, in other words, the most important job of the schools is not to

1811
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,720
cram the kids full of information, but to help them develop healthy brains. What does that require?

1812
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:35,760
Safety, above all. Lack of pressure. Healthy relationship with nurturing adults.

1813
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:40,720
And if the kids are not going to spend their time with the adult, with the parents,

1814
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,800
which they can't in this society, like they used to throughout human evolution, let them

1815
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,080
spend their time with adults who are emotionally nurturing and emotionally penetrating the

1816
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:54,800
attentive to the child's needs. Now you're going to have schools that are going to really teach

1817
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:00,720
kids something and where kids will want to learn. And it's very simple. It doesn't take more training

1818
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:05,840
and it doesn't take more. Well, it takes some training, perhaps, but not more than what teachers

1819
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:12,240
are getting now. So that's sort of a take in education. I was thinking there about the importance

1820
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:17,760
of doing certain psychological tests on certain teachers, because if they are also passing on a

1821
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,480
generational cycle of their own at a time when my brain is still being developed, they can have a

1822
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:28,000
huge impact positively or negatively on my life in the same way that my parents could. Absolutely.

1823
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:33,040
It's quite remarkable. Teachers don't know how much power they have because of the vulnerability

1824
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:39,440
of the young brain. And well-meaning teachers will sometimes behave in ways that are really

1825
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:44,240
hurtful to kids, just because they don't get it, not because they don't mean well. So I've had many

1826
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:50,000
adults sit in my office say, with tears in their eyes, it was something a teacher said to them

1827
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:59,280
three decades before. The class will continue and Johnny comes back to earth. This kind of sarcastic

1828
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:06,320
little dig can undermine a child's dignity and sense of self so easily. So if teachers just

1829
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:10,880
understood how powerful they are and how important they are in helping to promote healthy brain

1830
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,200
development, I think their profession will take on a whole new meaning that will be much more

1831
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:20,640
satisfying than it is right now. It's not the fault of individual teachers. We're talking about a

1832
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:30,640
system that is toxic. Gabor, we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the previous

1833
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:37,680
guest asks a question for the next guest. I didn't get to see it until I open the book. So

1834
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,800
there's a question written here for you. Before I ask you this question, I did have a question of

1835
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:48,160
my own, which was you're in your 70s now. What are you still working on in terms of your own

1836
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:52,880
traumas? Is there anything, even though you're in a later stage of your own life, that you're still

1837
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,960
sort of struggling with as it relates to that puppet master pulling on the strings and

1838
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:07,280
that kind of analogy that we gave earlier? Yeah. It's a sense of peace when I'm not doing anything.

1839
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:20,960
Just being the capacity just to be. That's something I'm still looking for. Not

1840
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:26,000
looking for like, I was looking for a lost puppy, but I'm still searching myself for it.

1841
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,640
And where exactly does that come from in your own diagnosis?

1842
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:37,600
How about if I tell you when I find out? I mean, I can give you a textbook answer,

1843
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,080
but it wouldn't be authentic. Okay. So you don't know?

1844
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:58,960
Entirely? I have some senses. I have some ideas. And then it really means being okay with my mind

1845
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:04,000
the way it is and not needing it to be any different. That's what it would mean,

1846
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:10,240
which means if I'm sitting there for five minutes, I don't have to reach for the cell phone to occupy

1847
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:18,560
my mind. Now, in the midst of this busy book tour and all the speaking I do, I don't do enough to

1848
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:25,920
take care of that quiet little voice inside myself. I don't. I think it would take some attention.

1849
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,520
I can't either though. I can't sit for five minutes. I couldn't sit for five seconds without

1850
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,680
grabbing my phone. It's weird. I noticed the other day that I was like going to the toilet,

1851
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:40,640
and I had no intention of using my phone in the toilet, but I went to get my phone to go to the

1852
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:44,320
toilet. But you can't be alone with yourself. Yeah, I can't be alone with myself. I can't,

1853
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,320
sitting for 30 seconds, you know, my brain, is that because they've built these algorithms to

1854
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,080
stimulate my dopamine? Or is it because there's something in me? I guess it goes back to a

1855
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:58,640
point of addiction. Well, it's both. I mean, they certainly create algorithms to stimulate

1856
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,200
your brain and get you hooked on a dopamine hit. They're sure for sure. They call that neural

1857
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,760
marketing. Neural marketing. Can you get that? Neural marketing. They work on your brain to get,

1858
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,800
you know, to get you addicted. But it also comes from an earlier discomfort with the self that predates

1859
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:19,200
any cell phone use. It goes back to earliest childhood, where it couldn't have been comfortable

1860
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:30,560
to be just with yourself because of circumstances. Interesting. Interesting. Yeah, because I've got

1861
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:36,400
friends that don't have the same addiction with their cell phones that I do. They can take it

1862
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,200
or leave it. They put it outside their bedroom when they go to bed charging in the kitchen. I'm

1863
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,880
like, I have to hold mine like my pillow. Yeah, exactly. Well, like your little safety pillow.

1864
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,480
And what's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? I grab it with one eye open,

1865
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:52,800
and all that gunk in my eye. I'm like trying to just, you know. Yeah. Well, how do both of you

1866
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:58,160
and I work on not doing that so much? Okay. I'll give you my number. We shouldn't discuss why I

1867
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,680
phone how we're getting on with this. That's just another reason to use my phone. But next time I

1868
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:08,000
speak to you in person, you can update me on how you're getting on with that. I am working on it.

1869
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,600
I'm working on it. I think I've got to become more cognizant of the cost of that addiction.

1870
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:19,600
Well, exactly. To really, I know one of the costs is meaningful connections and presence with

1871
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,760
and the cost to interpersonal relationships. But maybe I haven't had the cost

1872
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:31,600
impact me enough yet, maybe. The question left for you,

1873
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,640
but I don't know the signature, so I'll have to figure that out later, but is

1874
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,080
what's your selfish dream?

1875
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,800
You know what? I'm not sure how to sit with that question, because I'm not trying to get out of

1876
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:58,960
it, but I'm just looking at my own reaction to it. At this point, I don't have too many,

1877
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,440
what does it mean selfish, by the way? Let me ask you that. What does that mean?

1878
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:10,080
Something that is for me at the expense of others? I don't think I have any dreams like that left.

1879
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:15,440
I might have, not might have, I did have at some point. But if I have a dream

1880
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:23,200
for myself in that sense of self-enhancing dreams, something that enhances my ego or something,

1881
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:28,640
well, if this book sold a billion copies, well, that would be a nice selfish dream, you know?

1882
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:34,720
But I don't know how else to answer that. I do have dreams, but they're more about

1883
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:42,960
the state of the world that I'd like to see, the world I'd like to see, future generations inherit.

1884
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:47,520
Selfless dreams. Yeah. Well, I don't have to self-less, because it certainly involves

1885
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:53,520
my own history and certainly would make me feel better. So in that sense, it's selfish, you might

1886
01:55:53,520 --> 01:56:01,440
say. But they don't have to do with personal, I have enough. I've done enough and I have enough.

1887
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:06,320
So I don't have anything lacking that I need to dream about.

1888
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,760
All of our self-less dreams are also very much selfish in that regard as well.

1889
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,240
They're going to help us. It's selfish in a different sense. I mean,

1890
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,720
any dreams I have about a better world certainly have the function of making me feel better,

1891
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:28,400
of maybe even the stuff that happened to me or the stuff that happened to you,

1892
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:32,800
it would mean a lot to me if they didn't happen to any more children, you know?

1893
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:37,600
So in the sense that it would mean a lot to me, you might say it's selfish,

1894
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:42,480
but it's not purely about me. It's about something larger. I'm not trying to paint myself as a kind

1895
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:47,920
of a altruistic saint. I'm just saying that would make me feel better. If I really knew

1896
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,600
that kids in Gaza didn't have to face any more bombings, if kids in Israel didn't have to face

1897
01:56:53,600 --> 01:57:00,960
any more danger of terrorist attacks, if not that I see inequality there, but I'd like that for

1898
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:08,080
both of them. If kids in Ukraine didn't have to live under the threat of missiles falling,

1899
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:15,440
if people in Russia didn't have to live with the fear of perhaps a nuclear conflict or the

1900
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:23,040
young man being conscripted into a war, if kids in Britain didn't have to live in poverty,

1901
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,280
would that make you feel better? So to the extent that it makes us feel better,

1902
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:30,080
you might say it's selfish, but is it?

1903
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,280
Gabel, thank you. Well, my pleasure. Thank you so much.

1904
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:42,160
Thank you so much for writing such an important book. I think my only wish is that I discovered

1905
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:48,160
this book sooner, because I think so many of my, I think it would have liberated,

1906
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:52,240
that's a good word, liberated me from a series of things that would have helped me to live a

1907
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:56,560
much better life and to understand myself. That's the point of awareness that we talked about.

1908
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,560
I know that your advanced age is over, isn't it?

1909
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,480
I think we all want the answers even sooner, because we reflect on some of the consequences

1910
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:09,760
or the mistakes that we made. Not that I'm imprisoned by any of those, but it's so

1911
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:15,440
wonderful that this book now exists. You're a name that I started to be peppered with by my

1912
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:20,480
audience over and over again, specifically in the last 12 months. People, really, really young

1913
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:24,080
people were messaging me and asking me to have a conversation with you about the topics we've

1914
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:30,000
talked about today, things like ADHD and their trauma and so much. And I sit here every day

1915
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:38,880
talking to a lot of people on this podcast. And I think my understanding of trauma has forever been

1916
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:45,680
redefined by both this conversation today, but also by your book. And I really, I'm so thankful

1917
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:49,680
to you because I think that'll help me speak on the topic with more accuracy and therefore,

1918
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:56,880
hopefully, help other people understand their own trauma in a more meaningful way. It's just such

1919
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:02,080
an important book. Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to talk

1920
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:07,040
about my work and just the opportunity to meet you. Thanks a lot. And it's written in such an

1921
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:11,040
accessible way, which is so important because that means it can reach even more people.

1922
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,040
Thank you so much. Okay, thank you.

1923
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,420
you
