0	15360	Phillip, I want to frame this conversation the same way I did with Keith. I even did
15360	20720	this with Helen, actually, her idealist view, Keith's illusionism, and not with you and
20720	25640	panpsychism. But before we get into that, the question I asked them, which is what I'm
25640	33080	about to ask you is, can you give me a philosophical history of the mind-body problem? How you
33080	38800	conceptualize this, how you started reading about this topic, and how you got to where
38800	44160	you are today? The reason why I ask this question is, I believe it allows us to understand
44160	49160	your views and how it's changed over the years, and how you sort of came to the view you have
49160	54160	today or the conclusion you have today. So if you had to give me that philosophical history,
54160	55160	what would it be?
55160	64160	Thanks, that's a great first question. Yeah, I mean, the mind-body problem has been wrestled
64160	73080	with for centuries, and I think it arises because there are two things we know about
73080	80760	in very different ways. There's the physical world around us that we know through our senses
80760	88320	and which we learn more about through scientific investigation. But there's also the world
88320	95840	of our own experiences, our thoughts, our feelings, which we know about in a quite different
95840	105240	way, I think. I can't look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences. Each
105240	112240	of us knows about our own experiences just through being directly aware of them. If you're
112240	122280	in pain, you're just directly aware of your own feeling of pain. So there are these two
122280	128200	things that we think are real, namely the physical world we know through the senses
128200	135480	and our own minds. We know through our immediate awareness of our own conscious experience.
135480	142320	And the challenge is, how do these fit together? How do these seemingly very different things
142320	149800	fit into a single unified theory of reality? I mean, suddenly nowadays people call it the
149800	155400	hard problem of consciousness and think of it as the mystery of how do brains make consciousness?
155400	160040	I mean, that's one way into it. I suppose I think maybe that way of setting it up might
160040	166600	limit our options somewhat. But I think more generally, that's the question. How does consciousness
166600	172800	and the physical world fit together? And it's a problem I've been obsessed with as long
172800	179440	as I can remember, really, because all of the available options seem to have such deep
179440	184000	challenges associated with them. So it's sometimes say it's a little bit like Churchill
184080	190040	famously said about democracy. It's the worst theory of government apart from all the others.
190040	194360	So I sometimes think that's what it's like trying to find a solution to the mind-body
194360	200800	problem. You're sort of trying to find the least worst option. But yeah, that's the core of it,
200800	205840	I think. So if you had to look back at the philosophers, the scientists, perhaps, who
205840	210880	influenced your views the most leading up to this point, who stands out for you? Who were those
210880	214800	people who actively changed the way you perceived this problem?
216800	223280	I think Descartes has to be a huge influence. Going back to studying Descartes at high school,
223280	229760	Mr Foley was my philosophy teacher. I didn't do that well, actually. I would keep me to go
229760	237600	about and visit him one day. But I mean, what I think Descartes got dead right is that the mind
237600	243120	is better known than the body and the external world. This is what we find in the first two
243120	249680	meditations. Descartes' famous work is set up as six meditations where the narrator is sort of
249680	260560	philosophizing to himself or herself. I suppose himself if it's Descartes. And the method is to
260560	267520	try and doubt everything that we can doubt, to see where we end up, to see what, if anything,
267520	275600	can't be doubted. And the narrator, namely Descartes, concludes that the body, the brain,
275600	281680	the physical world, all these things might not exist for all we know for sure. But the one thing
281680	289040	we can't doubt is the reality of one's own conscious mind. So I mean, again, just to come to a vivid
289120	296320	case of if you're in pain, you can't really doubt the reality of your agony because you're
296960	304640	sort of directly in touch with it in a way that makes its reality totally evident to you.
304640	309360	So I think Descartes was right about that. After those meditations, it goes a bit
309360	314880	sketchy, sort of, tries to prove the existence of God and then prove the existence of everything
314880	322800	else on that basis. It goes a bit awry there, I think. But I mean, in more recent times,
322800	327760	the philosopher David Chalmers was a huge influence on me. You know, when I studied philosophy,
329120	336160	we were taught the two traditional options, dualism, Descartes view, that the mind is
336800	342000	separate from the body or the brain. At the other extreme, materialism, the view that all that
342000	347840	really exists is the physical world, bodies, brains, physical processes in the brain.
348640	354960	And I came to find deep for both of those traditional options. But we were just taught
354960	358960	that's what you've got to choose from, like in a lump bit. And I got really disillusioned and I
358960	364560	actually left my first degree just wanting to stop thinking about consciousness, thinking there was
364560	370880	no resolution. That's actually what I argued for in my end of degree dissertation. But I later
370880	378880	discovered the writings of David Chalmers, who really brought back to life, I guess,
378880	385200	something like the Cartesian project. Also, Thomas Nagel, his famous paper, What's It Like to Be a
385200	392800	Bat, where he argues that no matter how much we learn about the neurophysiology of a bat, we'll
392800	398800	never fully understand what it's like to be a bat, what it's like to adopt a bat's perspective.
399520	405360	Galen Strawson, actually, so I wasn't taught these things as an undergraduate. And then
405360	412480	when I started my MA, finally at the university, there was a professor who thought all the same
412480	420320	things I did who adopted this crazy view known as panpsychism that I that I adopt. And so this
420320	426160	was Galen Strawson. And he was a real confidence booster. I hadn't met another professional
426160	431920	philosopher who thought anything like the kind of views I was attracted to in the philosophy
431920	438880	of mind. So he, from personal interaction, he was a very important influence. And later also,
438880	445680	David Chalmers has been an important mentor as I got to know him personally. And finally,
445680	452400	someone who has a very opposed view to me, David Papineau, who was a physicalist with a total
452400	459680	opposite view to me, but was very kind in guiding me and and help him helping me argue against him
459680	464880	and understand his view and argue against him. And was really a model for I think, really set
464880	469360	me a model of how intellectual interaction should happen through civilized respectful
469360	474240	disagreement. So there's probably more than I can mention, but that's that's a handful of the
474240	479600	influences, I think. I mean, you mentioned so many great names, the legends in the field.
480080	486640	But something that captures my attention is exactly what you concluded with is that having this
486640	491840	discourse and disagreement actually helps us move forward. And I think you and Keith are doing that
491840	497440	wonderfully at the moment. I mean, mind chat, the fact that you guys are such esoterically
497440	503520	different views, opposing different opposites in a sense. I mean, to keep consciousness, phenomenal
504160	510560	consciousness is an illusion. Whereas for you, consciousness is the fundamental basis of reality.
510560	516480	So let's go through panpsychism. Let's run through this. Give me your definition of panpsychism,
516480	520880	how you see it, how you interpret it, and how it's different, perhaps from other views
521440	525280	of panpsychists out there who are perhaps popular in the field.
527120	533200	Brilliant. I mean, just to say on your last point, you know, I've just always loved to engage
533280	538800	with people with radically different views to me, just try and get into their mind and think,
539840	545120	how are they thinking these crazy sounding things? And I really do think that's a really productive
545120	549040	thing to do and something me and Keith have tried to have aspired to. Don't always achieve it.
549040	553760	Sometimes we get a bit annoyed with each other. But yes, but turning to panpsychism,
554880	560320	so I mean, in our, you know, I guess, in our standard way of thinking about things, consciousness
561120	566560	only exists in the brains of highly evolved organisms. And so only exists in
567520	573200	a tiny part of the universe and only in very recent history, at least in terms of the
573200	579840	cosmic history of the universe. But for the panpsychist, consciousness pervades the physical
579840	587680	universe and is a fundamental feature of it. Contemporary panpsychists don't necessarily
587680	593600	think that literally everything is conscious, despite the meaning of the word pan means
593600	599520	everything psyche mind. So the word literally means everything has mind. But contemporary
599520	607440	panpsychists tend to think that the basic building blocks of reality, perhaps fundamental
607440	615440	particles like electrons and quarks, or perhaps universe wide fields, many theoretical physicists
615440	621280	tend to think that fields rather than particles are the things that make up reality. But whichever
621280	629680	way you go on that, these basic constituents of the physical universe have very rudimentary forms
629680	637840	of subjective experience. So not the very rich, complicated experience that you and I have,
637840	643040	not just you and I or the human beings or their animals, which is the result of millions of years
643040	653040	of evolution. So the idea would be that that's what evolution does with consciousness molds
653040	659840	very simple forms over millions of years into much more complex forms that you or I enjoy.
659840	664800	But the thought was in the beginning, as it were, all there were were these very rudimentary
665360	671040	forms of experience at the level of fundamental physics and everything else is kind of built
671040	677920	up from there. So in essence, you're saying that let's say quarks, bosons, well, the most
677920	685280	fundamental particles that exist have experience in a sense, it's got some sort of an experiential
685280	691600	aspect to it, not necessarily a thinking cognitively engaging sort of experience,
691600	696240	but an experience nonetheless, this comes down to some sort of a qualitative phenomenon.
696960	706240	Absolutely. So, yeah, it's hard because people all automatically think of something like human
706240	711760	experience that I think of the electron feeling existential angst or wondering if it's Tuesday
711760	715680	or something. But, but you know, think about, I mean, as a way into this, I often like to
716240	723440	go down the spectrum of life from very complicated organisms, as we move to simpler
724400	732400	forms of life, mice, bed bugs to bed, but if bed bugs have experience, it's presumably
733120	738320	much more simple than we can conceive of. And as we move to simpler and simpler forms of life,
738320	744160	we find simpler and simpler forms of experience. For the panpsychist, this just continues right
744160	750960	down to the basic building blocks of the physical universe. But you said that an aspect of it is
751040	757680	experiential. And I'm not sure how you intended that exactly, but that can almost suggest a sort
757680	766800	of dualism like particles have physical properties like mass and charge, and also these invisible
766800	772480	consciousness properties. But that's not actually the the view as it's standardly defended these
772480	779760	days, the view is rather that all there really is at the fundamental level of reality is forms of
779760	787120	consciousness. And what we think of as particles or fields or physical properties like mass,
787120	793280	spin and charge are just ways of describing these fundamental forms of consciousness.
793280	798320	So it's a radically non dualistic picture of reality is not mined on the one hand matter on
798320	805600	the other. In some sense, all there is is mind. And what we call matter is just a way of describing
805600	812800	these fundamental forms of consciousness did not intend for for it to have that dualistic
812800	819360	aspect. But so in essence, what you're actually saying is that the charge, the the movement of
819360	825360	the particle, these are the things it's doing. It's not what it is fun. That's that's the basic
825360	831120	difference here. These are merely the way in which it's behaving. But it's not it doesn't explain
831120	837120	what it actually is. Yes. And this is the reason panpsychism after being
838000	842080	laughed at for so long in so far as it was thought about at all. I think for a long time there was
842080	847840	maybe just this guy Timothy Sprig in Edinburgh, who defended panpsychism. I
849360	853520	earlier my undergraduate career, I went to a conference they had just after he died
853680	862240	to to to to remember him. That was my one of my first conferences. But it's recently again,
862240	868480	come to come to attention, largely through the rediscovery of really important work by Bertrand
868480	875840	Russell from the 1930s. And very much as you said, Bert, heaven, Russell's starting point
875920	884880	observation was that for all its virtues and wonders, physics is confined to telling us about
884880	891440	what stuff does physics tells you what an electron does, what a quark does, how it gives us
892560	899200	detailed equations to predict how fields are going to evolve over time. And that's really
899200	906160	useful information and allows us to manipulate the world in extraordinary ways and build
906160	910800	incredible technology. But as a, you know, as a philosopher interested in the
911520	918480	ultimate nature of reality, you might want to know, okay, that's interesting, very interesting
918480	925440	what an electron does. But I'm also curious about what an electron is. And about that physics,
926400	929760	as it were, isn't really interested. It's just interested in the behavior.
930400	936000	So there's a kind of a hole in our scientific story of reality there. And then Russell's
936000	940960	observation is, well, we're looking for this, we're looking for a place for consciousness,
940960	945920	this mind body problem we started with, how the hell do we fit consciousness into our scientific
945920	952880	story? We've got this big hole, maybe we can stick consciousness in the hole. So I sometimes
952880	959040	put it by saying, on this view, matter is what consciousness does. So there's just conscious,
959040	966160	there's just very simple forms of consciousness interacting in simple predictable ways.
967040	975360	And what physics does is give us equations to describe how that stuff behaves. So in this way,
976480	981920	physics emerges from underlying facts about consciousness. So typically, people try and
981920	988080	do it the other way around, they can start with physics, or physical science, more generally
988080	992400	neuroscience, and try and work out how you get consciousness out of that. I think that's
993040	998240	impossible, incoherent even, for reasons we could perhaps discuss. But actually, it turns out to
998240	1004400	be pretty easy to do it the other way around. To start with some facts about very simple forms of
1004400	1010000	consciousness, and get physics out of that. And that's very easy, because physics is just
1010000	1014560	purely mathematical. So as long as you've got, it's just about patterns, really. So as long as
1014560	1019920	you've got some kind of stuff, whatever it is, interacting in the right way to get the right
1019920	1026800	patterns, you've got physics. Yeah. And I think something we often don't, well, most physicalists
1027680	1034480	don't comprehend and think about more than they should, is that we even speak about the fact
1034480	1039760	that physics claims that 95% of the universe is inexplicable. It's not, it's something we don't
1039920	1046720	know anything about. So physics is so thoroughly incomplete, that it's, you shouldn't, it's like
1046720	1051600	almost a clue that you should not be a physicalist, because we, in essence, understand almost
1051600	1057840	nothing about the universe. Yeah, that's a good point as well. I mean, well, one thing I said,
1057840	1063040	I guess, it could go a few different ways. I mean, if you're talking about dark matter,
1063040	1068160	I suppose that's distinct, as I understand, at least from the matter that makes up our bodies
1068160	1075600	and brains. So someone like Sean Carroll, who I've argued with a great deal, thinks, oh, yeah,
1075600	1080640	physics is far from complete. But in terms of the matter in our bodies and brains,
1082720	1089200	in normal terrestrial conditions, so not in very high energy, or the kind of high gravity when
1089200	1093760	you're about to step into a black hole, he thinks, you know, in those conditions, it's very well
1093760	1101520	understood. And he uses this as an argument against the kind of view I adopt, where consciousness
1103600	1107680	is a fundamental feature of reality. But there are, I mean, there are two problems with that. I
1107680	1122160	mean, one is that although we do have some kind of consensus about physics at those energy levels,
1122160	1129440	the kind of experiments we use to support our theories in that region, as Sean Carroll agrees,
1129440	1133920	are all conducted with very small numbers of particles. You know, for example, in particle
1133920	1141920	colliders, we just have no idea, I would argue, whether the equations would look exactly the
1141920	1149520	same in incredibly complex systems like living brains, you know, one of the most, you know,
1149600	1154640	with 85 billion neurons, you know, we've never done any experiments to test that I feel, I think
1154640	1161360	it's a kind of zeitgeist of the moment that people assume some kind of very reductionist story.
1162080	1167440	But given that our physics is based on experiments of small numbers of particles,
1167440	1172560	I think we really just based on the experiments ought to be quite agnostic about that. But of
1172560	1179280	course, the more fundamental reason is, okay, even if, even if Sean Cowell right, for example,
1179680	1186240	we do understand the physics of the matter in our bodies and brains, that's only telling us
1186240	1194880	what matter does, not what it is. So even in that case, there's still the option of
1195840	1199680	the panpsychist hypothesis. Of course, you'd have to look at what, you know, what are the
1199680	1208560	reasons for accepting that hypothesis. But I don't think really what we currently know about
1209520	1214720	the physical world scientifically casts any doubt on that story.
1214720	1220560	Yes. I mean, when people talk about panpsychism, a lot of people sort of say it as if it's some
1221520	1226720	spiritual claim, because it was often associated with spirituality, a lot of people who meditate,
1226720	1233440	for example, people perhaps in Eastern traditions, they they've made this claim before many years
1233440	1237840	ago. So for thousands of years, many people have been saying, I mean, this entire universe is
1237840	1245280	conscious. If someone has a, an LSD trip or an asset trip, that they start to see things in a way
1245280	1250960	as if the universe is sort of palpating or has a heartbeat or sort of some sort of a living
1251760	1256480	system. So this has always been part of the conversation. But yet when people talk about
1256480	1261840	panpsychism, a lot of physicalist reductionists have this dark, they look down upon these people
1261840	1266080	as if they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. What do you think they most
1266160	1267280	misinterpret about this?
1269360	1273760	In terms, so in terms of the connection to spirituality, I always say two things.
1274720	1280800	Firstly, that there is no necessary connection with panpsychism and anything spiritual.
1281520	1289120	Many of the contemporary proponents, like Angela Mendelovich, or Luke Rolos, or indeed David
1289200	1294080	Chalmers, you sympathetic to panpsychism, these people are the most, you know,
1299360	1304640	atheistic secular reductionists, but they reject the coherence of a materialistic
1304640	1309760	kind of consciousness. And they think consciousness obviously exists. So they don't believe in any
1309760	1315760	sort of transcendent realm. They just believe in pain and seeing red and think, you know,
1315760	1320080	look, we need an explanation of that. In many ways, I think there's perhaps a
1322400	1329440	division in the panpsychist contemporary community between people who are more secular and people
1329440	1334080	who are more open to spiritual ideas, a little bit like maybe you had in the psychoanalytic
1334080	1340640	community between Freud and Jung, you know, Jung was very open to spiritual convictions,
1340640	1346160	whereas Freud is like, this is supposed to be science. Get all this mumbo-jumbo out of my face.
1346160	1354320	But anyway, so firstly, there's no necessary connection. But if for independent reasons,
1354320	1360480	perhaps as you say, on the basis of mystical experiences, maybe through meditation or maybe
1360480	1367280	through psychedelics or whatever, you independently have certain spiritual convictions, then
1367280	1372640	probably a panpsychist worldview would be more consonant with those convictions. So,
1373760	1378160	you know, if you have the kind of mystical experience you just described where that
1378160	1383920	it seems to you that reality is filled with consciousness, well, if you're a panpsychist,
1383920	1389200	you already think that. And so, you know, whereas if you're a materialist and you just think
1389760	1393680	at the basic level of reality, it's just, it's just what you get from physics, then
1394400	1398480	it looks like you have to think the mystical experience of that kind is a sort of
1398480	1403600	delusion of some kind. You don't have to think that. Of course, it's a further deep philosophical
1403600	1410800	question, even so, whether it is rational to trust mystical experiences. I mean, on that score,
1410800	1418480	I am somewhat persuaded by the argument of William James in his chapter on mystical
1418480	1423520	experiences in his great book, The Varieties of Religious Experience. Most of this is a
1426000	1431680	psychological study of mystical experiences, just as a psychological kind. But at the end, he says,
1431680	1436480	you know, would it be rational for someone having that kind of experience to trust it?
1436480	1443280	And he says, well, look, if we say it's okay to trust our ordinary empirical experiences,
1443280	1449520	you know, there's a table in front of me, but it's not okay to trust the mystic to trust her
1450080	1455360	apparent mystical experiences, then there seems to be a double standard there. You know,
1455360	1459360	yes, a mystical experience could be a delusion, could be just something funny in the brain.
1461120	1465600	But our ordinary empirical experiences could be a delusion. We could be in the matrix, right?
1466080	1472480	This could be a long dream as Descartes made vivid to us. So, you know, I think all
1474800	1481200	knowledge is rooted in trusting experience, trusting how things seem to be. And
1482720	1488320	I don't see why you can say what the argument would be, that it's okay to trust
1488960	1495120	empirical experiences, but not okay to trust mystical experiences. What's the relevant difference?
1495760	1497040	I don't think anyone's ever answered that.
1497680	1502400	Yeah, I mean, even when you take into account, I mean, certain physical is someone like, let's
1502400	1507520	say, Anil Seth. I mean, the way he describes reality as a controlled hallucination and yet,
1508160	1512720	in a dream, it's sort of an uncontrolled hallucination. So, in a sense, when we're awake,
1512720	1520160	where our hallucinations are more attuned to the reality. So, although I am hallucinating this
1520160	1524880	experience, the fact that I do pick up the pen and it does feel like I'm picking up the pen means
1524880	1528480	it's a little bit more controlled, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm hallucinating,
1528480	1534400	in essence, the fundamental nature hasn't changed whether I'm asleep or awake.
1534400	1541040	They're both still hallucination. So, in what you're saying, it makes so much sense because the
1541040	1544880	truth is, whether it's mystical, whether it's some sort of a thought or whether it's reality,
1544880	1548880	they're both still inexplicably different. They're the same.
1549280	1555440	Yeah. I mean, Anil Seth's work is really, really interesting. We've debated a lot of times where
1555440	1562000	due to debate again in November of the Royal Institute of Philosophy annual debate.
1563360	1570800	And I'm always saying to him, I totally agree with all your scientific work. But I think
1571760	1579040	the scientific work on consciousness just leaves open all the philosophical positions.
1579040	1587680	You could be, Anil is a materialist, but you could have a dualist version of Anil,
1587680	1592560	a panpsychist version of Anil. We've got to distinguish the philosophical
1593600	1600080	aspects of the problem from the scientific aspects. Some people think, oh,
1601040	1608320	science is proving materialism. But no, materialism is a philosophical hypothesis
1608320	1613040	as is panpsychism, as in dualism. And we need to assess all these on philosophical grounds.
1613040	1617040	But actually, I've digressed slightly. Coming back to your point, which was an excellent one,
1617040	1624960	I think. Yeah. I mean, some philosophers get a little bit not annoyed by the word hallucination
1624960	1630640	there. It sort of seems to suggest that the external world is not real in some sense. But
1630720	1638880	if it just means that our experiences are in our own minds, in our heads, they don't put us in
1638880	1645920	direct contact with the world around us. We can't get outside of our own consciousness
1645920	1653440	to see if it corresponds to reality. So what do we do? You just, all you have direct contact
1653440	1658000	with is your own conscious experience right now. You don't even know
1658720	1664640	know whether you existed a few seconds ago. You can only do that by trusting your memory,
1664640	1670400	which is itself another kind of seeming, another kind of experience.
1671760	1676720	You know, of course, we can, you know, then people say, well, we can, we can check our memories,
1676720	1683200	we can check our senses, we can get precise with science. But only once you decide to
1683200	1690080	trust them in the first place, if I don't decide to just trust without any reason, my senses or
1690080	1696880	my memory, I can't get out of the present moment. I can't do any science. So although in a sense,
1696880	1702640	we can verify our senses, what our senses are telling us, only that's only in a kind of circular
1702640	1708880	way once we've already trusted them. So it seems to pretty, pretty much the same in the mystical
1708960	1714560	experience. You can't totally rule out it's a delusion, but it's the same in the case of
1714560	1719840	sensory experiences. And if anything, people who have mystical experiences claim that it seems
1719840	1726720	more real than their ordinary experiences. So I think I once, I think I once heard you mention
1726720	1734720	the fact that when someone claims to have some sort of experience in whatever way they have it,
1734960	1741120	what makes that any less true than anything that they've experienced otherwise. Like in
1741120	1746880	the normal realm, when you speak about this quite often, I feel that when I first started out reading
1746880	1752640	about consciousness, when I first entered the field from med school, when I thought about it,
1752640	1757680	I mean, I always wanted to study this, I was materialistic all the way through. I even wrote
1758400	1765520	an essay, my dissertation, Keith read it. He gave me comments. It was, but I defended illusionism
1765520	1770800	as a theory of consciousness using psychiatry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm going now.
1772160	1778560	I'm really joking. But prior to that, I had the emergentism view of consciousness.
1778560	1784880	Then I somehow slipped into illusionism. Sorry. Had the flu last week, I'm just, I'm slowly
1784880	1790320	recovering. And for everyone who's watching, and every time you see Philip looking down,
1790320	1795280	it's because he screens at the bottom. So don't, he's, he's just looking at me basically.
1796640	1800160	You give him a secret. So I, I'm in some context in case they're wondering,
1800160	1804560	is he reading something? What's going on? Well, I was turning my emails off actually that bleep
1804560	1809280	to one point. Anyway, but anyway, so yeah, as I was saying, when I started out, I started out as
1809280	1813200	someone who believed in emergentism, I mean, slowly you work your way up, then I went into
1813280	1818960	illusionism. And from starting this podcast and listening to people's coherent logical
1818960	1827520	arguments, philosophical arguments, I don't know anymore. I have absolutely no idea what I'm so
1827520	1833440	agnostic at this point that to me, if anyone approaches me with some sort of a cogent coherent
1833440	1839520	argument, I'm willing to listen all the way. And I think that a lot of scientists per se,
1839520	1847440	because of scientism, just look down on certain views like panpsychism, idealism, in fact,
1847440	1852000	we should talk about those two and how they're different or similar, because they both somehow
1852000	1856720	talk about the consciousness as being fundamental. But I think that link as we spoke about earlier
1856720	1864720	between spirituality and panpsychism is exactly why scientists or scientism hinders listening to
1864720	1870720	this philosophical argument. Do you agree with that? I do very much. I mean, I think
1871680	1877760	we're going through a strange period of history where people are understandably
1878960	1884400	totally blown away by the success of physical science and the wonderful technology it's
1884400	1890400	produced. And that has such a visceral effect on you think, oh my God, we can put someone on the
1890400	1896640	moon, we can have these tiny mechanisms that you know, just such incredible technology.
1899120	1908720	But it doesn't follow from that that experiments and observation is the only way of finding out
1908720	1914720	about reality. Clearly, experiments and observation are a very important, very successful way of
1914720	1920000	finding out about reality. But their success does not entail that there are not other ways.
1920000	1926400	And the least controversial way of finding out about reality, independently of observation
1926400	1935760	and experiments, is the reality of your own feelings and experiences. If you strictly follow
1936880	1943360	the kind of methodology of Daniel Dennett or my good friend Keith Frankish, and you only believe
1943360	1949840	in what can be established on the basis of observation experiment, then you're led to
1950880	1959680	disbelief in your own feelings and experiences, or at least you're not allowed to believe in
1961040	1969680	anything known on the basis of introspection that doesn't also come from external observation.
1970000	1974560	So Keith often says, oh, I believe in consciousness, I believe in feelings and experiences.
1975600	1981120	But when you dig into that, he totally agrees with Dennett. And Dennett says the
1982080	1987360	data for a science of consciousness or what he calls hetrophenomenology, which is
1990160	1997600	explicitly restricted to what you can know from the outside, including reports, when you
1997600	2003680	say something about your consciousness. But Dennett isn't taking that as testimony about an
2003680	2010080	inner realm of your inner life. He's just taking the report as a physical act that we need to
2010080	2016160	explain in terms of brain mechanisms or whatever. So the only things Dennett believes in, and Keith
2016160	2023520	believes in, are what can be established from third-person public observation experiment.
2024240	2031920	Why? I've never, my hours and hours and hours of talking to Keith, why can't I? Yes, of course,
2031920	2036960	experiments and observation are very important, but what about my immediate awareness of my pain?
2036960	2044080	Why isn't that another fundamental way of knowing about reality? So I think, you know,
2044080	2049520	someone like Keith is at least consistent. I think I'm consistent, but I think most people
2049600	2055840	in this confused middle way where they think, of course, my consciousness exists,
2056720	2063360	but they don't follow through and realize, in that case, there's a fundamental data point here
2064800	2069920	over and above experiments and observations. So you can't just say, we can only find out about
2069920	2075040	reality through observation experiments, because no, there's something else we need to plug in here.
2075680	2079120	And so that's the least controversial example, but I think there are other examples,
2079200	2087440	like our experience of value, you know, our experience of the human trafficking is abhorrent.
2087440	2093920	We think there's something objectively bad about this. And you could say, well, that's just our
2093920	2102240	subjective reaction. Well, it doesn't seem to be. Why? Why, if it's okay, I mean, that's just like
2102240	2108640	saying, oh, my experience at the table might be hallucination. I might be in the matrix. I might
2108640	2116000	be, but it's rational to trust my experience of the table. And it seems to me similarly
2116000	2123360	rational to trust my deepest moral experiences. So I think there are many different ways of
2123360	2128480	knowing about reality. And the task of the philosopher, which we've kind of forgotten about
2128480	2133440	in recent times, in my view, is to put them all together. It's the job of synthesis. Take what
2133440	2140000	we know from science, what we know from our careful ethical thinking, what we know about
2140720	2148160	mathematical reality, excuse me, the world of numbers and logic that necessary structural
2148160	2153200	reality mathematicians and logicians tell us about what we know about our own conscious experience
2153200	2159360	and synthesize it all together in a single unified theory of reality. So that, you know,
2159360	2163760	that's what I'm most passionate about is moving us on from this scientism, where we think,
2164560	2168480	no, it's just, you just got it, all we can really believe in is what we know from experiments,
2168480	2172800	and everything else has to be squeezed into that. And if it can't be, it doesn't exist.
2172800	2178960	Because that leads to this really impoverished picture of reality where really, there's,
2178960	2185920	that our official worldview is doesn't allow for the reality of consciousness, doesn't allow for
2185920	2193120	the reality of moral facts about good and bad and human dignity. And I think that's
2193920	2199440	a weird, unhealthy, difficult way to live. I mean, if it was the truth, it'd be the truth,
2199440	2206560	and we'd have to get used to it. But once we see that there is no good reason, philosophically
2206560	2211840	speaking, not to take seriously these other, these other ways of knowing about reality,
2212800	2218240	because all knowledge, including scientific knowledge is just rooted in trusting experience,
2218800	2226960	then I think we can, we can come to a more expansive conception of the world we live in,
2226960	2231040	and one that's a little bit better for our mental and spiritual well-being, I think.
2231840	2236480	I mean, you paint, it's a bit long-winded. No, no, it's fine. The more long-winded,
2236480	2240160	the better. I think the listeners, they want to hear you've used them. This is all about,
2240240	2244960	I mean, it's your episode. This is about you. But along all the lines of what you were talking
2244960	2249520	about, Dennett, how would you respond to something like this? Because Dennett once
2249520	2254880	said something about idealism and panpsychism in a way, describing them sort of as a
2256080	2261120	modern-day version of the Ian Vitale. I mean, I mean, we're always looking for something deeper.
2261120	2266400	We always want that little extra thing that makes us a little more special somehow.
2267200	2272560	And for humans, from it being life, being at the center of the universe at some point,
2272560	2276800	Copernicus ruins that, then Darwin takes us off the top of the food chain,
2276800	2281360	and now all we have left is consciousness. So we're going to find whatever way we can
2281360	2285200	to make this the most important thing. What do you think about that? How do you respond to
2285200	2292640	something like that? Well, it's an ad hominem argument, isn't it? Which means it's not engaging
2292640	2299440	with the argument. It's speculating, psychoanalyzing about the motivations of the person defending it.
2300480	2308480	You know, I think we're used to, we're very culturally used to the idea that
2310400	2319120	people who have religious or spiritual ideas, it's because they can't face the reality of
2319120	2323120	science or something, that they need to believe in something. But actually, for my own case,
2323120	2334240	I mean, I think I'm more subject to the motivations that lie behind the Dennett picture,
2334240	2339600	which are very seductive as well. You know, it's very seductive to have this simple picture that,
2340400	2345760	you know, experiments are giving us the truth, like the kind of Ricky Gervais story, you know,
2345760	2351920	listen to Ricky Gervais. I think Ricky Gervais, it's very important to his identity and his sense
2351920	2359120	of who he is, and his sense of security, that I think he needs to believe in this very simple
2359120	2364480	story. The experiments give us the answers, and we're on the right side of it. And these
2364480	2372400	superstitious fools, they're on, you know, I think that's, you can psychoanalyze people's
2372400	2379280	motivations in that way. And I mean, that's the, I feel often very silly defending the views I do,
2379280	2387280	because in the kind of, you know, culture that I was grew up in, and that I hang around in,
2388240	2397760	these things are, don't fit in. And so, you know, if I need to be, I need to constantly
2397760	2403840	analyze why I'm thinking what I'm thinking, and I'm constantly critiquing my arguments.
2403840	2408080	But I'm actually, I actually think I need to be more on guard about the seductions of
2408080	2412720	scientists, than the seductions of some need to believe I'm special or something.
2414240	2418320	You know, look, oh, I mean, at the end of the day, one can only speak for oneself,
2418320	2425200	that, you know, I'm sure I do have motivations, but fundamental in lots of ways. But fundamentally,
2425920	2430160	I've always just really wanted to know what's true. That's just been my job. I want to know the
2430160	2435760	answers here. And, and, you know, I've changed my mind a lot. I constantly,
2437680	2442080	sort of talking to myself in my head, trying to find the best argument, because I want to know,
2442880	2448240	is this right? Is this, I just, you know, I just want to know the truth. So, you know,
2448240	2452160	and then if Dennis says he doesn't believe me, then what can you do? But at the end of the day,
2452160	2458800	we should just engage with the arguments and, I mean, hatred phenomenology, as you say,
2458800	2465040	I mean, Keith calls it quasi phenomenal experiences. So this, so they're, they're sort of
2466240	2471040	implicit that it's implicit that it's existing, but it's just not what we think it is to these
2471040	2476720	to, to these thinkers. It's almost, it is there. It's just how we interpret it that's different,
2476720	2481040	and a bit misleading. So that, that doesn't sound too radical, does it?
2482240	2485040	You know, when you say our consciousness is just different to how we think of it,
2485040	2489760	what you've got to know about Keith and that, that it's position, I should be, he's probably
2489760	2493920	going to be listening, might listen to this bunny, is just come back to this point,
2493920	2500960	the heterophenomenology idea that the only data for a science of consciousness are what you can
2500960	2509120	know from the outside, right? That is the only things we can take seriously. So again, you know,
2509120	2513360	that includes what people say, but it's not what they say, because then you can, I think,
2513360	2517440	I think most people, when they, when they, you know, when they trust what someone says,
2517440	2523920	they're in pain, they trust, they're taking that as testimony and evidence about what can't be seen,
2523920	2529200	like I can't see your pain, but you tell me about it, and I thereby indirectly know,
2529200	2536160	that's not how Keith sees it, right? He sees the report, the act, the physical act of your
2536160	2543520	mouth moving as the datum. It is the first person objective, quantitative experience,
2543520	2546960	which that's everything, that's all that exists, right? First person's objective,
2546960	2552640	qualitative experience, which to you is the fundamental experience. And to Keith is the
2552640	2559760	complete opposite. Yeah, I mean, well, it's both, isn't I mean, of course, I agree with Keith that
2559760	2565920	that we, of course, who would deny that we do know a lot from the outside. And that's part of
2565920	2572880	the data, but I've just, I've never seen a good argument from Keith about why I can't just take
2572880	2579360	it as a starting point. Introspect, my feeling of, you know, then it's, then it's noticed,
2579360	2583120	you know, then it's got fascinating arguments about how introspection can lead as a stray.
2584000	2587520	Eric Schvitzkabel, one of my favorite philosophers who's a materialist,
2587520	2591520	has got some great stuff on that. But okay, introspection makes some mistakes.
2592080	2594960	Doesn't mean the whole story's wrong. Like, you know, that
2596800	2601840	yeah, Eric gives objective qualities we seem to experience are just not real at all. So,
2603520	2610000	so that, yeah, the challenge is, I think the more conventional
2612160	2616320	physicalist picture you refer to any of the emergentist picture that they want to try and
2616320	2623360	reduce or account for, they say, oh, yeah, we believe in subjective experience.
2623920	2629840	We want to account for it in terms of the purely third person quantitative science.
2629840	2632960	I think Keith and I both agree that just doesn't make any sense. That's just
2632960	2639280	thinking you can't even, you know, you can't even articulate these subjective private qualities,
2639280	2643120	like the redness of a red experience in the language of physical science. So,
2643200	2647840	you know, your neuroscientific theory couldn't even articulate the data. So it's not going to
2647840	2652800	be able to explain it if it can't even articulate it. So we both agree that doesn't make sense.
2652800	2658080	But he thinks, well, just believe in this stuff, you know, about through the third person way.
2658080	2662640	And if you can sort of translate your talk of consciousness into
2664400	2668160	the stuff, you know, about in third person terms and okay, that's fine. But
2668880	2675280	you're only allowed to do that. Why? Why? It's just, I think it's just over-enthusiasm with
2675280	2678560	science. But you mentioned Eric Schwitzka. I think I interrupted you there.
2678560	2681200	Yeah, sorry. No, we, I mean, Eric and I also chatted about it.
2682000	2682480	Oh, brilliant.
2683760	2687760	He is very skeptical. I mean, he's got that skeptical mindset that leads him to think of
2687760	2692640	so many creative different ways that you can interpret reality and the way we live.
2692640	2695520	I mean, some of his philosophy of science fiction is very intriguing,
2695760	2700000	very diverse writing. And I think that only happens when you are sort of
2700640	2706000	someone who can think metaphysically about things without necessarily having a religious or
2706000	2712080	spiritual view on it. There wasn't, there's almost no dogma towards it. You're just
2712080	2717600	naturally skeptical. Keith and I actually had a three hour conversation about illusionism.
2717600	2722160	We went into the ethics of it all. It was quite a long chat. But I just spoke,
2722160	2727760	I think about three days ago to Helen, yet to Chappelle, am I saying the surname correctly?
2727760	2735040	But we spoke about idealism and your view, panpsychist, the panpsychist and the idealist view
2735040	2739440	sort of overlap in certain ways to some people. And to some people, they believe it's completely
2739440	2744000	different. How would you differentiate between these two views? I mean, there's a lot of new
2744000	2750720	people out there. Bernardo Castro is Donald Hoffman with conscious realism slash idealism in a sense,
2750720	2756080	because he is taking consciousness to be fundamental. How do you differentiate your views?
2758080	2764800	Good. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, to start off with, obviously, I mean, I think of
2764800	2771120	all of these views as very much on the same side of the debate and close in all sorts of ways.
2771120	2778480	It's just wonderful that from both science and philosophy, people are really exploring these
2778480	2785040	ideas that start off with consciousness and build up on that basis instead of starting off with
2785040	2791600	matter and getting to consciousness starting off with consciousness itself. So, you know,
2791600	2798320	it's great all these views on the table. People define terms in different ways. The way I tend
2798320	2806960	to think about it is that the panpsychist, although they think consciousness is fundamental,
2807520	2813840	they also think the physical world is fundamental. But without being due list because
2815120	2819120	how do you square that circle? Well, the physical world is just somehow made up of
2819120	2825920	consciousness or infused with consciousness. Whereas the idealist, I think, tends to think
2827200	2831280	there's something more fundamental than the physical world. Either the physical world is
2831280	2838400	some kind of illusion, or there's some deeper reality underlying the physical world.
2840480	2846880	So I think Bernardo and Donald Hoffman fit into that camp. It's a little bit difficult with Helen,
2846880	2860240	actually. But her view is inspired by George Barclay, the great 18th century idealist who,
2860240	2865760	yeah, thought that the physical world is real, but it's not fundamental tables and chairs and
2865760	2870320	mountains and so on or constructions out of ideas. At the fundamental level of reality, we've just
2870320	2876800	got kind of immaterial minds. And the physical world is constructed out of ideas in those minds.
2876800	2881840	And she sort of relates God from that picture. So to her, it's the ideal, the Berkeley and
2881920	2892320	idealism without God. Yeah. So then God was central to Barclay's picture,
2892320	2895440	because it's a question, well, what happens to a table when we're not looking at it?
2895440	2901280	Yeah. And Barclay's idea is what God's looking at it. And then Helen's idea building on that was,
2901280	2907120	well, why does it have to have, why does this cosmic mind or whatever it is,
2907120	2912480	have to have all the attributes of God? Why does it have to be all powerful? Why does it
2912480	2918960	even have to be a sort of thinking agent in order to sort of experience the table when
2918960	2925360	no one's looking at it? So she instead of thinks of it as a sort of tapestry of experience,
2925360	2930240	lots of threads of experience. So, but if we, I think the problem is, I think she's
2930240	2935040	problem in terms of distinguishing her view from panpsychism is, I think she wants,
2935040	2938640	maybe does she want to identify that tapestry with the physical world?
2939200	2950320	Yeah. Helen is idealist in the way she thinks. There's almost, she's just defending a sort of
2950320	2960000	idea within idealism without actively calling herself an idealist. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,
2960000	2969520	that's a good point. And, and, but why that view that she explores should counters idealism rather
2969520	2975360	than panpsychism? I'm not totally sure actually. But after having such a lot conversation,
2976320	2983920	I'm still not entirely sure. Yeah, because it's not, it doesn't fit the most standard understanding
2983920	2991040	of idealism where there's something underlying the physical world. And, and that's, I mean,
2991040	2998960	that's the argument I have with Donald Hoffman. I'm not sure the motive, I never understand
2998960	3005040	the motivation for thinking there's something deeper than the physical world.
3007760	3010880	You know, so in a way you can think of panpsychism as a sort of middle way between
3011680	3016480	materialism and idealism. So there's for the panpsychist, you know, in some sense,
3016480	3022320	there's just the physical world, particles and fields. But that's filled out with consciousness.
3023920	3030880	And I don't see why we want a place for consciousness. Why can't we put it as it
3030880	3035040	were inside the mathematical structures of physics? Why do we have to put it at a,
3035040	3039200	at a deeper level than that? I've never really understood the motivation.
3040160	3043920	Sorry, this is going to digress, but it's going to go back to something you mentioned earlier,
3044560	3049520	which was, I mean, values inherent morals and ethics and how these all play a role.
3050640	3055440	I would like to ask, what about cultural differences? Because, I mean, if we have this
3055440	3061680	objective truth about ethics and morals, I mean, we clearly see a difference in culture. I mean,
3061680	3066560	and to some cultures, perhaps human trafficking might just be the way the culture has just
3067280	3072480	grown up over time. And to many people, maybe they don't see it as bad. I obviously,
3072480	3078800	though I'm not one of those people, but how do we differentiate them? Because then we have to
3078800	3085360	agree that we don't have objective morals or values. What are your thoughts on that?
3085360	3092240	Yeah, it's a very important challenge to the moral objectivist position. And,
3093200	3097600	you know, I introduce this by saying, if you're going to be skeptical about
3098640	3105040	moral objectivity, you need to say, well, why is it okay to trust your sensory experiences,
3105040	3109920	but not your moral experiences? Otherwise, there's a double standard. But actually,
3109920	3113040	you've just potentially answered that question by saying, here's the difference, you know,
3113040	3119120	with our empirical experiences, we get a great commonality, but then there's this disagreement.
3119120	3121120	And that's a very important challenge.
3124560	3130160	I said, why else have I thought about this? I'm trying to remember what my view on it is.
3130160	3134400	I mean, so one thing is, I think there's a lot more, I mean, I would say not so much,
3134400	3141360	I'm a realist about morality, but a realist about value, that there are facts about
3141360	3146720	what is objectively valuable. And when you think in terms of very, very general claims about value,
3147680	3151120	there is a hell of a lot of commonality and universality. For example,
3151920	3159920	pleasure is good, suffering is bad. Understanding is good, ignorance is bad, creativity is good,
3161760	3169440	apathy and banality are bad, right? Does many people disagree with those general value claims?
3170080	3176480	Now, where you get disagreement is when it gets into the how it all fits together,
3177040	3187200	you know, more specific value claims about justice or the ethics of abortion or whatever.
3187200	3194240	But then that's, to my mind, that's to be expected, given that things just do get,
3194240	3201440	hey, things just do get very complicated when the value equation gets so, so many different
3201440	3205920	factors are at play. So you sort of expect people to evaluate them in different ways,
3205920	3212320	just as you do in philosophy or any complicated topic. When there's complicated considerations,
3212320	3218720	and you've got to sort of do some highfalutin abstract thinking, people end up disagreeing,
3218720	3223280	that's kind of to be expected. The other factor, of course, is that there's a lot of
3224160	3229440	self interest with morality and people wanting to believe certain things and
3231200	3239840	in our modern times, corporations influencing how people think and so on. If you don't
3241360	3247280	want to believe equality is an important part of, economic equality is an important part of
3247280	3251200	justice. If you're very wealthy and you don't want to be taxed, you've got a motivation not to
3251200	3255200	believe that. Of course, there's that, you know, people coming out of certain religious cultures
3255200	3263200	or certain traditional views. So for all these reasons, you know, you'd expect, I think, there
3263200	3274640	to be diversity. But on these very, very general sort of axioms of value, like pleasure is good,
3274720	3280640	pain is bad. I think there's actually a lot of agreement which is consistent with value realism.
3281840	3288240	So within the psychos view, if you take, I mean, you mentioned something like abortion. So ideally,
3289440	3296400	that draws a lot of like philosophical questions with it. Because in essence, this is an experiencing
3297520	3303920	system, part of reality. And now we're drawing the line using scientific methods saying, okay,
3303920	3310320	12 weeks is the cut off line, because this is what has developed since then. How do we work
3310320	3315760	around these things? How do we work around perhaps life after death? I mean, there's so many aspects
3315760	3322880	to this where we, what does panpsychism tell us about these things? Wow, we're getting these
3322880	3330240	very deep and difficult ethical questions. I mean, in a way, panpsychism might not make
3330800	3336880	that much difference insofar as panpsychists tend to think at the macro level of reality,
3336880	3341680	not everything is conscious. And so they might, you know, the view is that the fundamental,
3341680	3346880	at the level of fundamental physics, everything is conscious. But at the higher level, they,
3346880	3351200	a panpsychist might hold the same as anyone else. It's a sort of open question. So they might not
3351200	3356080	think this, they don't necessarily think the table is conscious. They think the bits it's made up of
3356080	3364400	are. But I suppose panpsychists will naturally think spread consciousness,
3366000	3373200	think it's more spread throughout the biological world than other people may.
3373200	3377680	And I mean, for one thing, it makes it very difficult to think about the ethics of eating.
3377680	3384720	I argue a lot on Twitter with vegans about, you know, if you don't think plants are conscious,
3385600	3390400	then you've got a nice moral cutoff point. I'm just not going to eat. I'm going to eat things
3390400	3395120	that aren't conscious. I'm not going to eat things that are conscious. But I think panps
3395120	3400160	probably are conscious, or at least are communities of conscious entities. And
3402080	3407040	so you've got to eat something. It's hard to know what the moral draw off comes pretty
3407040	3414400	difficult. I mean, maybe same with the fetus. I mean, for anyone, it's very difficult to establish
3415200	3426560	that there were exactly consciousness emerges in pregnancy. But a couple of things, I mean,
3426560	3431360	I suppose, for that reason, I'm more inclined to place a lot of moral weight on
3434160	3439520	self-awareness, awareness of one's own existence, the capacity to understand
3439520	3448240	one's self and the world around one, which, for example, pigs have more than newborn babies.
3448240	3453680	So you might think in some sense, this was great. I'm not saying we should kill babies, but
3455280	3463520	there is, we've got to bear in mind that I mean, I think a pig is much more intellectually,
3463520	3472800	cognitively, sophisticated than a very early fetus. So I think those kind of things play heavily
3472800	3480320	for me. I was always very influenced as well by the argument of Judith Jarvis Thompson,
3482000	3487600	it's not so much necessarily denying a fetus a right to life, but thinking about
3488160	3499520	the right of the pregnant woman not to be forced to have her body used to sustain that life.
3500880	3507280	So Judith Jarvis Thompson, this wonderful analogy of you wake up, you've been kidnapped and knocked
3507280	3516400	out and you're hooked up to a famous violinist, it's a bizarre story really, the musical society
3516400	3522480	have hooked you up to this violinist because you're a rare donor and unless you stay hooked up to
3522480	3527440	this violinist in this hospital room for nine months, the violinist is going to die. Now,
3527440	3533920	everyone thinks the violinist has a right to life, but that doesn't mean you're obliged to allow your
3533920	3541120	body to be used to sustain that life. So I think for those two reasons, that would be my motivation
3541120	3548320	for being pro-choice that the lack of cognitive sophistication of a very early fetus and also
3548320	3553760	that the right for a woman to choose where the hair body is used in that way. That's a great
3553760	3559040	answer. Very difficult though. Just going back to your story about the vegan argument, just today,
3559040	3568000	I mean, my receptionist told me that she doesn't like vegans, but she's just joking around and
3568000	3575280	she's like, my main argument is that if you're eating all the plants, you're technically stealing
3575280	3584320	all the animals food. So in essence, you are still killing the animals. That is quite a ridiculous
3585440	3591280	but yet still quite fair, fair enough. I mean, the position I've come to is what I call
3591360	3602000	humanitarianism of just not eating any animal products that are factory farmed. A lot of people
3602000	3608720	say, oh, I don't agree with factory farming and maybe they'll buy meat that's not factory farmed,
3608720	3614320	although that can be very expensive. But very few people ask in restaurants, is the meat factory
3614320	3623680	farmed? Don't eat chocolate unless the milk is not factory farmed. Dairy is often one of the worst,
3623680	3630240	most cruel forms of factory farming. So it's strange to me in some ways being vegetarian if
3630240	3636240	you're happy to eat chocolate because milk, chocolate, dairy products. So my thought is if
3636240	3643920	more people did that, then that could really have an impact. But I'm going to read George
3643920	3648560	Mombio's new book, actually trying to persuade us all to be vegan for environmental reasons.
3649920	3657040	Maybe I'll end up vegan. He's, but anyway, let's not get into that. The main thing here is
3657840	3663360	let's tell me about some of, Philip, some of the best counter arguments you've heard
3663920	3669200	for pants against panpsychism. If you're to play devil's advocate on yourself right now,
3670160	3675440	what has really gotten your attention? Well, you really thought I might not be able to argue this
3675440	3678240	as well as I wish, but perhaps one day someone will.
3680640	3686080	That's a good question. I mean, probably the most discussed challenge is the so-called
3686080	3696000	combination problem, which is okay, it's all very well postulating particles having consciousness
3696000	3700720	or whatever. But ultimately, what we want to explain is our consciousness and
3702000	3706320	how on earth do these little conscious things come together to make our consciousness?
3708800	3715440	And on the face of it, it seems to be something very hard to make sense of. Is it even coherent
3715440	3722160	for lots of little minds to make one big mind? And this is something I've changed my mind about
3722480	3726000	a lot and thought about a lot. I think where I've ended up with, though, is I think that
3727280	3737040	the challenge is really is at its strongest, at least, if you're going for a very reductionist
3737040	3744960	panpsychist story where you say, really, all there is is conscious particles. And
3745840	3752560	what I think of as my mind is just a complicated collection of conscious particles.
3753200	3760960	So someone like Luke Rolofs tries to defend this very reductionist kind of panpsychism.
3762160	3769120	That is hard to make sense of. There seems to be a deep unity about my own conscious mind
3769440	3777760	that resists that kind of very, very reductionist story. It's hard to deny that my mind is
3777760	3783840	something over and above just a very complicated collection of particles, whether they're conscious
3783840	3789760	or not. But actually, and this comes back to my dispute with Sean Carroll,
3792960	3798480	I now no longer think there's much of a motivation to go for that very reductionist story.
3799280	3805040	You only feel pressured to do that when you start from the conviction that
3806240	3811600	everything that happens is ultimately explicable in terms of known chemistry and physics.
3814000	3819840	And I used to think that. That's kind of what I got taught as an undergraduate. But just from
3819840	3824560	talking to neuroscientists, really, we've got an interdisciplinary consciousness group at my
3824560	3831840	university here. And I just, we really don't know anywhere nearing up about the brain.
3832880	3837360	What we know about the brain, really, we know a lot about the basic chemistry. So like the bottom,
3838240	3843120	we know, we know a fair bit about large scale functions, what big bits do.
3844240	3848720	But what we're pretty almost clueless on is how those functions are
3849040	3856880	realized at the cellular level, how it works. And we'd have to know a lot more about that
3856880	3862640	before we could confidently say, you know, everything that happens in my brain is
3862640	3868000	explicable in terms of currently known chemistry and physics. I think we just don't know that.
3868000	3876400	So so I'm more attracted to at least not such a reductionist story. You know, once you're freed
3876400	3882080	from that, then you can just think that let's just stick with particles, the zegazemblissity,
3882080	3889520	just have basic capacities to, in certain circumstances, combine into more complex,
3889520	3897360	unified forms. And we should look to neuroscience to guide us in, in when that happens. I'm quite
3897360	3903440	attracted to the integrated information theory, which is one proposal as to when consciousness
3904400	3910800	arises in the brain. So I actually wanted to ask you about that at some point, your view
3910800	3916400	on integrated information theory and how do you feel it plays a role with the sort of explaining
3916400	3921360	or adopting a panpsychist view, because obviously they're starting off with phi and moving upward.
3921360	3926960	Do you feel as that that represents a panpsychist attempt at philosophical thinking?
3927680	3933120	So my view is we need to distinguish very sharp, not very sharply, quite sharply,
3934560	3940320	scientific bit of consciousness research and the theory and the philosophical bit. So the scientific
3940320	3948800	bit is to work out what kinds of brain activity go along with what kinds of experience. That's the
3948800	3954320	scientific bit and integrated information theory is one proposal on that. It says that
3954640	3961200	you get consciousness in a system when there's more phi, as you say, or integrated information in
3961200	3967760	the whole system than in its parts. So probably this glass of water isn't conscious because
3967760	3972800	there's probably more phi in the molecules than in the liquid as a whole. But in the brain,
3972800	3978320	there's hue in certain parts, the brain at least, there's huge, even though there's a lot of
3979120	3984880	fine and neuron, there's even more in the whole system. So that's why I get conscious. So that's
3984880	3991920	one interesting proposal. What I like about it is that it gives us, allows for kind of sharp
3991920	3998480	cutoff points between systems that are conscious and systems that aren't conscious. And
3999680	4006960	on philosophical grounds, I don't think it makes sense to have fuzzy boundaries around
4007040	4012560	consciousness. Like you think of a cloud, there's no sharp cutoff point between the
4014560	4019360	where's the edge of the cloud, which is this a little bit of water vapor outside the cloud,
4019360	4023280	or is it part of the cloud? There's probably no factor the matter there. But if we're thinking
4023280	4029520	of my consciousness, either something is part of my experience or it isn't, I don't think it kind
4029520	4036480	of makes sense. And for there to be fuzzy boundaries around my mind, that's something
4036480	4044320	we could debate. But IIT integrated information theory can make sense of that. But that's just
4044320	4051040	the scientific bit. And I think that like any philosophical theory, it's sorry, like any scientific
4051040	4058320	theory, it's neutral on all the philosophical options. So you could be a materialist proponent
4058320	4066000	of integrated information theory and think, just have an identity between consciousness and
4066000	4075520	Phi. Or you could be a dualist like David Chalmers and think Phi and consciousness are different
4075520	4080880	things, but there are special laws of nature that tie them together. Or you could be a panpsychist
4080880	4086400	and you could think, you know, consciousness is the fundamental level and that bubbles up when
4086400	4093920	you've got Phi or something. So yeah, so Phi, I think I like for certain specific reasons to do with
4094880	4099200	you can't have fuzzy consciousness, fuzzy boundaries and consciousness. And I suppose it fits
4099200	4105040	upon psychism in that it predicts that there's more consciousness than we ordinarily expect.
4107040	4111600	Are there any other neuroscientific theories that you sort of are attracted to?
4113120	4121600	Not really for that reason, because I mean, look, there's a lot. It's very early days,
4121680	4129920	there is no consensus in neuroscience. Some people thought it would be all wrapped up by now,
4129920	4136400	but it's very hard because consciousness is not publicly observable. And so
4138560	4142880	where you've got a human being, you can ask them what they're experiencing, but the more distance
4142880	4150320	you get from the human case, it's very speculative. Eric Schvitzkabel now thinks we will just never
4150320	4155600	know whether snail is conscious, because it's just too distant from the human case.
4157440	4169280	But I think we can try and look for philosophical signposts. And I think this important,
4169280	4174800	what we can look for, what we know about consciousness from the inside. And one thing
4174800	4181520	I think we know about consciousness from the inside is that there can't be fuzzy boundaries
4181520	4185840	when it comes to consciousness. And I think I'm happy to be corrected on this, but I think the
4185840	4191360	integrated information theory is the only scientific proposal that can accommodate that
4191360	4198320	philosophical data point. So to my mind, it's whatever its flaws are, very far from a final
4198320	4202160	theory of consciousness. To my mind, it's the only philosophically credible one.
4202240	4206880	Yeah. What are your thoughts on, like, let's say someone like Penrose and John
4206880	4211920	Bovecki and quantum consciousness, where's your head at with that?
4215600	4221760	I mean, Penrose thing starts with a fascinating argument to do with girdles and completeness
4221760	4229040	theorem. And it's interesting, though, that that is really when you think about it, it's not so much
4229120	4234240	to do with consciousness, it's to do with cognition, it's to do with understanding,
4234240	4240960	because what Penrose is thinking is he's wrestling with how to make sense of mathematical
4240960	4246400	understanding, given girdles and completeness theorem girdles and completeness theorem seems to
4246400	4256160	show Penrose thinks that, you know, a computer couldn't do the kind of mathematical and have
4256160	4263840	the mathematical understanding we have, because you can't reduce mathematics to a system of axioms
4263840	4269280	where you can prove everything with those axioms. So he thinks mathematical understanding must be
4269280	4274080	sort of non computational. And that's why he thinks there must be some kind of quantum,
4274640	4280240	non classical physics coming in here. So, you know, that's fundamentally his motivation.
4280240	4288560	I want, you know, I wonder whether again, this comes back to the need to connect everything to
4288560	4293920	kind of currently known physics or closely related to currently known physics. I mean,
4293920	4298320	in terms of that problem, I think I'd be
4301920	4309280	much more open to supplementing macro level physics with the idea that there are just new
4309280	4314880	causal dynamics that kick in in complex systems. This is sometimes known as strong emergentism.
4315520	4321680	So we don't have to go down to the quantum level. We can just say, look, there's new causal dynamics
4321680	4327520	that emerge in human cognition. And this is actually what I talk about like my new book I'm
4327520	4335120	working on that's much more about conscious understanding and conceptual meaning. When
4335120	4338240	philosophers and scientists talk about consciousness, they always talk about
4339040	4345680	pain and seeing red and itchers and these kind of very animal sensations. But I think consciousness is
4346640	4351200	permeated with meaning and understanding what things are and what they mean
4352640	4359120	fills my experience, you know, I don't experience colors and shapes, I experience tables and chairs
4359120	4367840	and faces and stuff. So I think Penrose is spot on and he's one of the few to be wrestling with
4367840	4375200	these deep mysteries about conscious understanding. But I think I would go a slightly different way
4375200	4382320	with that and just say go for stronger emergentism rather than trying to hook everything up to the
4382320	4389520	quantum level. And then people like let's say Rupert Sheldrake. What are your thoughts on someone
4389520	4396080	like his view on consciousness? So I'm quite good friends of Rupert Sheldrake and we're doing a debate
4397040	4403360	or a discussion rather in the near future on religion without belief. Because I guess
4404320	4415520	we're both kind of practicing Christians who have very unorthodox views of what it means,
4415520	4419760	what is involved in being a Christian and then we're hooking up with
4422080	4426640	oh what's his name? My mind's gone blank. Wonderful poet and environmental activist who
4427520	4433120	recently surprised everyone by converting to quite conservative Christianity and anyway we're
4433120	4437200	going to be having a chat with him. But anyway, coming back to yeah so Rupert's got very interesting
4437200	4445520	views. You know, I think he can defend them very very articulate, he can articulate them and defend
4445520	4452080	them very well. But so I suppose Rupert is defending his views as a scientist on empirical
4452800	4458400	grounds rather than strictly philosophical grounds. So I suppose it's kind of this may be a bit of a
4458400	4464160	cop out but it's sort of outside of my skill set in a way. I think you know knowledge is very
4464160	4470400	specialized now and I'm jealous to people in the 16th century when you could sort of understand
4470400	4475360	the cutting edge science, the cutting edge of mathematics. But you know in a way when it comes
4475360	4480240	to imperial questions I sort of have to because it's not my skill set I sort of have to trust
4481200	4488320	the you know the consensus and I suppose for better or worse the consensus is against Rupert.
4488320	4493680	But I suppose he would say that's for cultural reasons and people aren't taking him seriously
4493680	4499600	for cultural reasons and I'm very much open to that argument. I've experienced in philosophy
4499600	4508000	which is my area you know how ideology stops certain views being taken seriously and so I can
4508080	4514800	I'm open to that possibility but because it's not my skill set I just don't think I can assess
4515760	4519600	whether he whether he's right or not. It's absolutely fascinating views though and
4520720	4524000	you know I certainly you know he's had his TED talk banned and everything. I certainly don't
4524000	4529200	think he should be as ostracized as he is. I think you know yeah again there is a sort of
4529200	4536000	fear there isn't there about I suppose people worry about losing control you know being open to
4536000	4543760	any old stuff but look if someone can defend their views with rigor and seriousness then you know
4544880	4549760	they should be given a hearing and I think. I think but do you think that some people
4549760	4555680	are now mysterious regarding consciousness because there there are just that many convincing
4555680	4565200	arguments and we just don't know. Yeah mysterious is again a position we should take seriously and
4566240	4571680	I'm to some extent open to it myself. I mean you're asking for challenges to panpsychism.
4572720	4578160	I suppose another one would be well just the position of
4581040	4586720	shouldn't we be agnostic you know. Yeah I can't look into an electron to see whether it's conscious
4586720	4592720	or not. Maybe we should just be agnostic. Maybe we should just say there's a view that's very
4592720	4598160	closely connected to mine that just says so agrees with this Bertrand Russell starting point
4599920	4607760	that physics doesn't tell us what matter is only what it does and agrees that you know
4608720	4614880	whatever manner is it's it's somehow explains consciousness so you might say it's proto-conscious
4614880	4621200	that it's it's somehow has a nature that makes consciousness but it's not itself conscious
4622000	4626800	and you know I'm very much owned opposition that the philosopher Daniel Stoljar and his review
4626800	4631760	of my academic book conscious to some fundamental reality was sort of pushing this line you know
4631760	4637280	that there's something right about this Bertrand Russell position but we just don't know enough
4637280	4643680	to be able to say panpsychism is good so I'm kind of open to that but at the end of the day my current
4643680	4652720	thinking is what why go for mystery when there's an intelligible hypothesis as an alternative and
4653920	4656960	all we can ever do is science and philosophy I think is try and work out
4658640	4666720	you know the most simple parsimonious hypothesis compatible with the data if we can account for
4667600	4674560	not only consciousness but the facts of physical science and natural science more generally
4674560	4682000	by postulating basic simple forms of consciousness then that seems to me by normal scientific
4682000	4685920	criteria of you know the simp going for the simplest theory that can account for the data
4685920	4691520	that's the view we should go for we don't know for sure we'll never know for sure and we should
4691520	4697680	be open to other possibilities but I still think panpsychism is is just a bit more likely
4698480	4703840	to be true than I think other options on the table I think you give a great great coherent
4703840	4708320	argument for it I mean I've read Galileo's era of red consciousness fundamental reality and that
4708320	4715760	one's a lot more in depth and in detail for so like for all the people who read Galileo's era I
4715760	4721280	think I highly recommend you go read the other one because you're going to far greater detail and
4721280	4725840	it's obviously meant for a different group of people but if people have some sort of a view
4725840	4731760	on your view of panpsychism they should definitely read both before making a conclusion on that
4731760	4736960	oh thanks for who do you think because obviously I would recommend your books to someone who wants
4736960	4742000	to read about panpsychism who are the people you'd recommend people should read in order to get a
4742000	4749760	greater understanding of panpsychism um oh well it's just that yeah there's there's so much going
4749760	4755200	on at the moment I mean it's difficult isn't it because I guess a lot of academic philosophic
4755200	4762880	philosophy work now can be so inaccessible um I think this is you know again it's a reflection
4762880	4769520	of knowledge being so specialized and and often philosophers I think we're trained to try and
4769520	4775680	have these watertight arguments and so yeah you try and cover all bases and then it ends up getting
4775680	4780320	really complicated and the jargon comes in so that's why in a way you know I wrote my academic
4780320	4786480	book first because once you write a more accessible version you've got to be a bit looser with the
4786480	4792560	argument you can't cover all objections so then philosophers read it and say oh you haven't considered
4792560	4796480	this you haven't considered this and so then I could say well read the academic book if you want the
4796480	4803120	full story the full argument but um yeah so Luke Roloff's book combining minds is a wonderful book
4804080	4809920	um a little bit challenging I guess Hetahassel Merle great philosopher she's got a she's got a
4809920	4815040	great piece with Nautilus that I would recommend giving the basic panpsychist position something
4815040	4822800	on the integrated information theory for philosophy now she wrote for a special issue I edited um
4824320	4829680	and she's working on on on a book on antiphysicalism actually for Keith's series in philosophy of mine
4829680	4834160	Keith told me about recently um another resource people might want to look to is there's this
4835360	4843200	there was a special issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies um on on 20 years how many
4843200	4850480	was it now 19 essays by philosophers and scientists and theologians responding to my book Galileo's
4850480	4855200	Era um and this is going to be coming out as a book actually later this year called
4855200	4864080	is consciousness everywhere so there's essays by Anil Seth and Sean Carroll and uh Giulio Tenoni
4864080	4872160	for the use of topics all coming up yeah I yeah but I mean well in in a way usual suspects but uh
4872160	4878880	I don't think there's I can't think another time these kinds of scientists have uh responded to
4878880	4884480	panpsychism so it's it's in a way it's I can't I personally can't wait to read this this is it's
4884480	4890400	quite um there is a development I mean these guys don't agree with me but you know I think
4890400	4898480	taking the view is seriously enough to engage with it I think is um is it is an achievement so that's
4900160	4905280	oh there's loads of stuff what is I suppose Miriel Bahari's a very good Australian philosopher who
4906000	4911840	defends it a more spiritual version of panpsychism inspired by Hindu mysticism
4912960	4918400	and partly based on arguing that we can trust the testimony of experienced meditators
4918400	4929280	she's been working on a book for a while I hope to come out soon um my blog yeah um yeah so tell me
4929280	4935680	for the book that you've got prepped and ready to go what's the goal here well what's the next
4935680	4940000	mission because I mean you've read you've written the academic one you've written Galileo's era
4940720	4945920	what do you hope to show us next I hope this book actually is going to be
4947440	4953840	I come both academic and accessible I've wrestled for a long time about which to do I can't
4954800	4962320	so tough to crack yeah I'm hoping maybe it's not possible but so each chapter at the moment
4962320	4967760	is divided into a more accessible bit and and the more technical bits and but the whole thing I
4967760	4974000	try to make quite accessible but it's it's it's a different book in content as well but it's
4975680	4982320	I guess the big idea is exploring the middle ground between God and atheism so I think
4983280	4986960	in the West people think you have to fit into one of those groups you either believe in the
4988320	4994800	Omni God all powerful knowing perfectly good or you think we're in this meaningless universe
4996800	5001280	where you know meaning only arises at the end of evolution or whatever
5003200	5007280	and I I've come to think that both of these views are are pretty implausible
5008000	5011520	both have data they can't handle
5014560	5019920	in terms of the Omni God it's the familiar problem of evil and suffering
5020480	5026960	why would an all all powerful loving God allow or create a world of so much suffering in it
5026960	5034480	in terms of atheism the meaningless universe I think one thing I discuss there is is the
5034560	5038160	that the fine-tuning of physics the discovery in recent decades that
5039120	5044960	for life to be possible many numbers in physics had to fall in a quite narrow range such that
5044960	5048880	it's it's incredibly improbable that that would happen just by chance I think on the
5049760	5054880	on the face of it if you just look at it this passionately that is very strong evidence for
5054880	5060880	some kind of goal-directed activity some kind of directiveness towards life
5061680	5065600	in the very early universe and I think I basically think is a cultural
5065600	5072080	indenial about this I think it's reminiscent of the 16th century where there was this growing
5072080	5078320	evidence for the earth not being in the center of the universe that didn't fit with the picture
5078320	5084960	that people have got used to and people couldn't accept it and they tried to think of these
5084960	5090400	ways of avoiding it you know they postulated these epicycles so they thought everything
5090400	5095600	went around the earth the sun and the planets and the stars they postulated these extra little
5095600	5100560	orbits of the planets in addition to their orbits around the earth and that didn't do it so they
5100560	5108000	postulated these orbits around orbits and um and we think oh god they were so stupid they
5108000	5112480	couldn't just accept the evidence and we're so enlightened now but I think every generation
5113680	5118800	has got used to a picture of how things are supposed to be and you get laughed at if you
5118800	5125680	don't fit into that and I think you know I think I think it's just culturally impossible
5125680	5132880	for people to take this evidence at face value which is that I think what we might call cosmic
5132880	5138400	teleology there's but so I think there's strong evidence for cosmic teleology for some kind of
5138400	5144560	directiveness towards life but also strong evidence against the omniguard and so I'm
5144560	5149920	exploring positions in between so Philip sorry to cut you off there but within this cosmic
5149920	5155440	teleology where do you think it's headed then after humans and life do you think artificial
5155440	5159040	intelligence is sort of the next step and then we're going to move forward from there what what
5159040	5168560	do you think is happening god knows nobody knows so look it so I as I say I think there is there is
5168560	5174640	very strong evidence and could change tomorrow but science as we have it now is very strong
5174640	5180320	evidence for a sort of directiveness towards life maybe that's the end of it maybe maybe maybe this
5180320	5186960	is this is this is the end of the cosmic purpose as it were but in a way you might think that's
5186960	5194400	kind of improbable to think that you know we're the culmination of this cosmic story so you might
5194400	5200400	you know we might speculate that there's that it's it's it's still unfolding some kind of
5202800	5210720	greater reality is yet to come but that would that that would be somewhat speculative I always
5210720	5220400	like a hero of mine growing up the heretical Catholic priest Tyre de Jardin who had this
5221280	5227280	you know he was you know early days after Darwin and parts of the church were sort of
5228160	5232560	worried about what to do at Darwin but he was inspired by the idea of evolution and the idea
5232560	5242880	of an evolving cosmos and you know he thought this these great leaps of life and sentience and
5242880	5251440	self-consciousness and he he thought the next stage would be people humans getting more informationally
5251440	5256800	connected up and this bringing about a new form of life and consciousness that he called the
5256800	5261280	new sphere so some people think you know if you look at the way we're all connected up with the
5261280	5268400	internet and what's up and stuff maybe he was under something but I mean he could have knows
5268400	5272800	I think that still might be possible we don't even know but I think but I you know I think it's
5272800	5281440	I think it's I think it's a it's a good life to live in hope that there is some point to it all and
5281440	5288640	that what we do contributes in some way to some greater purpose I find doing that helps me keep
5288640	5294400	my ego in check that I'm not just thinking of my success I'm just thinking I'm just contributing
5294400	5301280	in some way to some some some greater purpose and you know maybe there isn't a greater purpose and
5301280	5308480	you know but we'll never know and I think it's it's it's it's it's a good way to live to live in
5308480	5315280	hope of that I think it's a happiness conducive form of life so would you describe your religious
5315280	5321680	of if you had to pick on would it be more of a deistic god rather than theistic sort of omniscient
5321760	5327600	omnipotent interactive god would yours be more deistic you started off let the cosmic
5327600	5334640	teleology just roll and whatever happens happens so we need some kind of explanation of
5337120	5340800	why the source of cosmic teleology you know why things aren't better
5342560	5348480	we need a plausible hypothesis that explains can explain the you know the directness towards
5348480	5354720	life but can explain it why things aren't better why this source of cosmic teleology is not more
5354720	5362480	evident so look I explore a variety of options one is just teleological laws that Thomas Nagel
5362480	5368720	explored in his 2012 book mind and cosmos just so this isn't a kind of mind it's just impersonal
5369520	5376720	laws of nature that with sort of purpose is built into them another is is some kind of
5376720	5383440	something closer to the to the the traditional god as a sort of mind but a non-standard designer
5383440	5388960	maybe of limited power so maybe they really care maybe they're trying to do stuff but maybe they
5388960	5395120	yeah maybe all they could do is kick things off or maybe they've got limited powers of of intervention
5396880	5404720	or maybe it's it's the simulation hypothesis maybe they're just some you know scientists in
5404720	5410320	the next universe up trying out a simulation to see see what comes of it that would be a cosmic
5410320	5416960	teleology hypothesis one more naturalistically inclined people tend to like or cosmic psychism is
5416960	5422880	the other one I consider that the you know if we already think the universe is a kind of mind
5422880	5429600	because of our panpsychist views then it starts to be less mysterious that there might be some kind
5429600	5435120	of limited gold erectedness in it so I'm open to all those possibilities you know in terms of my
5435120	5443360	religious practice I think for me it's more about bringing the community together you know
5444960	5452880	marking that the seasons and the the big moments of life you know given my kids a moral example
5453040	5459600	connecting individuals in the community up to something greater and
5461040	5466800	you know inspiring moral action in the community things like that and so I think you know all
5466800	5473440	these things are all these matters are very uncertain and but you've got to live your life
5473440	5480400	and I think people are too folk when it comes to religion a lot of people are too focused on
5481120	5486880	is it true is it not true and I think you know I think I personally think for some people at least
5486880	5491840	are religiously engaged life with the community and the spiritual practice and is a wonderful
5491840	5497280	way to live your life and you know if it turns out all to be nonsense you've I still think you've
5497280	5503760	gained much in terms of a rich life and lost little really it's but you know rather than sort of
5506240	5510000	you know some people have no interest in religion and I'm not interested to persuade them
5510560	5516160	but I suspect there are many liberal minded people who would get a lot out of it but think it's kind
5516160	5521920	of Richard Dawkins has told them it's stupid or you know how do we know it's true and you know
5523440	5528800	whereas I think you know engaging with community and tradition can be a wonderful thing and
5529680	5535600	people can focus. He mentioned he's a fan of your work is Raymond Tellis and something
5535600	5540720	I like that he said well this when we spoke he actually told me now that I realize I realize
5540720	5546160	if he asked me a couple questions to ask you and I forgot to take them down before this interview
5546160	5551200	but then again we were meant to do it tomorrow so I was I was planning on doing that but
5551200	5555680	nevertheless he's a big fan of your work and he finds it very fascinating and something he said
5555680	5561680	that I really liked was he's he's ontologically agnostic about everything but there are certain
5561680	5569040	epistemologies that you can tell are just really just incorrect but when you when you're talking
5569040	5573600	about religion when you're talking about life all of this you have to be ontologically agnostic
5573600	5579520	we don't have the answers that's just the bottom line and I think that's a really cool statement
5580800	5588000	to make. Yeah absolutely absolutely and my wife's text me I think I'm gonna have to
5588000	5594160	uh attend to some family matters in the not too distant future but but just sorry just to throw
5594160	5601920	that in but um yeah no I I I totally agree with that I think I think a lot of people on both
5601920	5607200	we we use again it's come back to we're used to the the epistemic vices of the religious we're
5607200	5612480	used to the idea that religious people might be clinging to certainties but I think that's very
5612480	5618320	present for a lot of people on the scientific side as well I you know I think Daniel Dennett
5620160	5625120	he needs to believe this stuff for it you know he believes to believe it's obvious and it's
5625120	5630240	you know for a sense of identity and I think so like Ricky Giberti he has to sort of have this
5630240	5641280	easy picture that's painted I think I think you know yeah just um this kind of uncertainty
5641280	5651840	is unsettling to a lot of people I think um uh you know I just you you'll never know you've got one
5651840	5660640	life you know and um you have your best yes diagnostic I think that's yeah let's do it put it
5660640	5668320	or you can have your best guess and you know it doesn't have to be um you know I'm certain
5668320	5674080	or it's a load of nonsense I mean I I've never had a mystical experience but I have I have
5674080	5679120	what I would describe as spiritual experiences to the some often with morning or evening light
5680160	5688000	or you know watching my kids play or something you know a sense that there's a way things are
5688000	5694160	supposed to be or there's a greater reality at the root of things and most people think you've
5694160	5698960	I've got to think oh yeah that's definitely right or you've got to think no that's nonsense but
5700000	5709600	a middle way is to sort of engage with that take it seriously work with it in your spiritual
5709600	5716400	practice and you'll never know one way or the other but you can maybe live a richer life through
5716880	5725200	engaging tentatively those experiences beautiful Philip you're already touching on that but like
5725200	5732480	concluding this is obviously called mind body solution I mean you're already touching on it but
5732480	5738080	how would you say we should move forward in order to get one step closer to that mind body solution
5739040	5748080	we're a long way from the final answer humans always think they're at the end of history and
5748080	5754400	we're kind of there we just need to you know dot a few i's and cross a few t's you know so I think
5754400	5761040	that that needs to be the starting point what I'm most passionate about and here's we're going from
5761360	5767120	what we what we don't know here's one thing I feel most confident about is that
5768720	5775440	consciousness is not just another scientific problem and the reason it's not another scientific
5775440	5784000	problem is that we're not dealing with some public observation and experiments we're not
5784000	5790560	dealing it's a very different kind of data we're dealing with something that's privately known
5790560	5798960	and trying to explain this privately known reality you know science is used to dealing with
5798960	5806800	things you can't observe but that's in that's we postulate things you can't observe to explain
5806800	5811760	what you can observe in all other cases the task of science is explaining the data of
5811760	5817200	experiments or observation this is a totally different explanatory project we're trying we're
5817200	5822560	not trying to do that we're trying to explain this privately known reality so we're not even at
5822560	5828560	first base we've got to get on to that this isn't just another scientific problem it's a
5828560	5835200	philosophical problem it's how we bring together what we know about scientifically and what we know
5835200	5842160	about privately trying to meld them together and you know so we're still about you know debate
5842240	5847680	Nanel Seth and he's saying oh well what are the predictions of panpsychism what does you know what
5847680	5853280	scientific experiments result but that's that's not at first base because that's seeing it that's
5853280	5858640	seeing it as just a scientific problem and it's not just a scientific problem you panpsychism
5858640	5863280	might be wrong there are lots of good challenges but treated as a philosophical problem not a
5863280	5868160	scientific problem so we've got to understand the nature the philosophical underpinnings
5869040	5873520	we've gone from pretend you know in the latter half of the 20th century people pretended consciousness
5873520	5881280	didn't exist to avoid the problem since the 90s the 1990s we take the problem seriously
5881840	5886480	but too many people still think just do more neuroscience and we'll solve it we need to
5886480	5891040	see the philosophical underpinnings of the problem we need to see that it's fundamentally a task of
5891040	5898160	how we bring these things together as philosophers ultimately scientifically informed philosophers
5899040	5905440	once we get there I think we'll be at least on or at least on the first stage and I think just
5905440	5912400	that first stage actually will in itself necessitate a kind of revolution in how we think about
5912400	5919920	science how we think about the way we know about the world around us so so yeah exciting times ahead
5920560	5923920	I think that's a beautiful way to end Philip thank you so much for your time
5923920	5928960	it's been an absolute pleasure thanks tab and it's been lovely finally speaking with you hope
5928960	5933840	we get to chat yeah I mean I'm looking forward to it hopefully after your book comes out we can
5933840	5938640	have another chat but I really appreciate your time I mean this is and please just continue
5938640	5943520	doing the work you're doing because as I said the more diverse the views the philosophical
5943520	5949920	arguments as we as we spoke about not neuroscience but philosophy the more diverse and the more
5949920	5953840	people like you come out and speak about it the more we can engage in this topic and this podcast
5953840	5959760	would not exist without people like you so thank you so much for that thank you very much we'll see
5959760	5980000	you again
