00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Good afternoon, Tevin Bernardo. Welcome back. Welcome back to my body

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
solution. How are you? Good to see you. Great to see you, man. How have you been?

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Busy. I can imagine. I mean, Bernardo, the last time we spoke, I mean, your video has been very

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
engaging. A lot of people have been going back and forth in the comment section. I mean, it's

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,040
it's been an intriguing journey to watch. Cool. I spoke to Sue Blackmore, I think it was last week,

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,480
and I was thinking about the, the wonderful discussion you guys had, the your location with

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,240
Kurt. How was that for you? It was a while ago, because it was published quite a while after it

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,840
was recorded. I mean, I like Sue. I met her in person a couple of times. So yeah, if you like

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,840
someone, it's pleasant to talk. I don't think she's an illusionist at all. Because the way she

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,120
defines illusionism is not what other people call illusionism. But other than that, I think it was

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,600
a productive engagement. It was it was amazing. The last time we spoke, we touched on so many

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
different topics, Bernardo. We spoke about Carl Jung, Schopenhauer, mental health, psychiatry,

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
life, death, religion. And to a point where I was trying to figure out how do I approach this

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,080
conversation? How do we do a part two that's engaging and that the listeners and viewers want

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,520
to watch? And the conclusion I've drawn is, let's do a crash course on analytic idealism.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,960
And what inspired me was obviously your course with the Essentia Foundation. I mean, brilliant

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,280
course, well structured. How do you feel about that? How do you feel about this approach?

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm gain. I'm keen. And look, so I've broken it down into the seven chapters. And I think we'll

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,720
move from chapter to chapter. At any point, I feel that there's anything I want to clarify

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,840
or to provide some new content for the listeners. I think it's a great

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,360
opportunity. And for you to also rectify or clarify anything you think you might have wanted to say,

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
and and feel like this is the perfect opportunity. Do you want me to run down the seven chapters

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,640
for you? Or do you just want to go step by step? Help me out, give me the structure.

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,760
Okay, so the first question, I mean, we'll go through chapters. The first one will be

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
investigating whether our ordinary intuitions about the nature of reality and the world at

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
large can be true at all. Is the world really what it looks like on the screen of perception?

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,840
Then on the, no, no, so do you want me to just break it down for you? You want to go?

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
No, no, let's do it one by one. So I don't have to push the many things to my stack before it

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,960
starts popping. Okay, now then let's do it. I think yeah, let's start off with that. Chapter one.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,120
So this is a crash course on analytic idealism for all the listeners.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,280
So the question is, is the world what it what it seems to be in the sense that

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
does the world contain these forms and shapes and entities and events that we discern on the

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,400
screen of perception? And the answer is a categorical no, there are many things about

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,000
analytic idealism that are sort of best guesses guided by reason and evidence,

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,880
but other things are pretty established. They are just not mainstream yet. They didn't percolate

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,880
up to the froth of culture. The world cannot be what it seems in the sense that it cannot have

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,360
those shapes and forms and events and spatial temporal positions that we discern on the screen

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,320
of perception because for the latter to be true, our inner states would have to mirror

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,840
the external states of the world. But there is no a priori upper bound to the dispersion or entropy

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,680
or level of disorder of the states of the world. We cannot decree that the world has an upper bound

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,160
in entropy. So if we were to mirror the states of the world in our inner states, then our inner

42
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,000
states would have no upper bound in their entropy. And therefore, perceiving the world

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,280
could be deadly. You could melt into hot meat soup, because your internal entropy has to be bound.

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,360
Unbound internal entropy is not compatible with life. We would become soup, literally.

45
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,880
So no, our inner states do not mirror the world. Another line of argument is evolution wouldn't

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,960
have given us a perceptual apparatus that mirrors the states of the world. It would be confusing.

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,920
It would be information overload. What we want is to be able to discern the salient aspects of the

48
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,040
world in an encoded form that facilitates prompt responses to environmental challenges

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,640
and also limits our internal entropy. So to summarize it all, the world as it is in itself

50
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,360
is not physical, because what we call physical are the things we discern on the screen of perception

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,240
which are describable through physical quantities, such as length in centimeters, weight in kilograms,

52
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,760
electric charge in Coulombs, and so on and so forth. But these cannot be the way we would

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,320
describe the real states of the world. These are descriptions of our internal cognitive

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,560
representations, not of the states that they represent, the external states. So the real

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
external states of the real external world are not physical in the sense that they are not

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,120
describable through physical quantities. And then it raises the question, are there states

57
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,880
that are not describable through physical quantities? Obviously, how many centimeters does

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,200
your thought have? How many kilograms does your emotion weigh? What's the electric charge in

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,520
Coulombs of your depression, your fantasy? So what the prospect that it raises is that

60
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,600
the external world is probably made of what we call mental states, experiential states.

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,200
And the physical world is our cognitive inner representation of the real external states of

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,960
the world. Tell me, Bernardo, how aligned is this view? Are you familiar with the work by

63
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,680
Jude Caravan? And I mean, of course, you are with, I mean, you're not really okay. But with

64
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Don Hoffman, I mean, you know that your guys idealism theories are very similar. Of course,

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,680
we spoke about this before, where you separate at the point where I think he takes conscious

66
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,760
agents to be fundamental. So you need that human consciousness element.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,680
No, so is that not we don't don doesn't say that humans are an instance of

68
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,600
okay. So so fundamentally, when you think about the pioneers of this thought, because Don obviously

69
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,080
wrote about the case against reality and your work also describes I mean, when you talk about

70
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,880
the fact that we have this dashboard in terms of the use the plane as a common example,

71
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,720
and measurement, briefly elaborate on that just for all the listeners who are not familiar with

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,640
that analogy. Think of an airplane, an airplane has sensors that measure the external states of the

73
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,800
sky, air pressure, wind direction, humidity. In the case of a weather radar, it will pick up also

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,520
all these elements, but in a more compound manner. So the airplane has sensors. Now,

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,560
the results of the measurements that are performed by the airplanes sensors are displayed to the pilot

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,760
on a dashboard. So the states of the dashboard represent the real states of the world outside.

77
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,800
But the dashboard isn't the real world outside. That's obvious. Yet you can fly the plane without

78
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,920
a transparent windscreen, you can fly the plane by instrument alone, because the dashboard conveys

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,960
accurate information about the states of the world without being the states of the world.

80
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,360
So the idea here is that our perception states, the colors we see, the sounds we hear, the smells

81
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,360
we feel, the texture on our skin, all that. These are dashboard representations of the real

82
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,240
states of the world. We are airplane pilots that were born inside a cockpit without windows.

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,080
And all we have ever had is the dashboard. And we've come to take the dashboard for the world,

84
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,080
which is understandable, but not under the light of 21st century analytic philosophy and science,

85
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,120
because we should know better now than to make what Donald Hoffman calls a rookie mistake,

86
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,640
which is my metaphor to take the dashboard for the sky. One represents the other. It doesn't

87
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,120
mean that the representation is the thing represented. Do you ever feel that there would

88
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,280
be a way for us to get that dashboard to not be our main perceptive reality? Do you feel like

89
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,040
whatever reach a point where we can actually see beyond into the true nature of reality?

90
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Whatever that is, whatever that means. Mystics throughout history seem to claim that that is

91
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:35,440
possible. It hasn't been possible to me. And I'm not sure about the analytic coherence of that claim,

92
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,880
but I'm open to my ability to analyze things rationally to be limited. I mean, why would the

93
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,880
nature have to conform to the limitations of a monkey like me, a primate that has been running

94
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,520
around with an intellect for only about 30,000 years? I mean, for all I know, it may be possible.

95
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,760
I think on the basis of reason and evidence and not spiritual introspection and insight,

96
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,640
I think the dashboard is an artifact of life. The dashboard was constructed by evolution

97
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,640
in the journey that life has undertaken on this planet. So if you don't want to have the dashboard

98
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,320
on your way, that time is coming because you're going to die. And once you die, this dissociative

99
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,280
process in the mind of nature that we call ourselves will no longer be dissociated because

100
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,920
life is what the dissociation looks like. If there is life, it means there is dissociation

101
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
because life is the representation. It's what that dissociation looks like. It's the extrinsic

102
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
appearance of the dissociation. And the dashboard is an artifact of the dissociation

103
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,080
because the dashboard is the panel that allows you to have commerce from external states to

104
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,600
internal states. But for there to be external versus internal, there has to be a boundary.

105
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,160
Otherwise, everything is just outside or everything is just inside and there is no

106
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,760
boundary and then there is no dashboard. What is that boundary? That boundary is the dissociative

107
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,360
boundary. It's a cognitive boundary enforced by the dissociative process we call life because

108
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,360
it looks like metabolism when represented on another dashboard. So the end of life is the

109
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,240
end of that boundary and therefore it's the end of the dashboard. And it's the difference between

110
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,360
perceiving the world and being the world. So to be honest, personally, I'm not in a hurry to get

111
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,560
rid of the dashboard. I'm okay if it takes a while. Have you ever thought about what I mean,

112
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,440
evolution obviously provided us with these tools, hid the truth from our eyes in a sense.

113
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,720
Why would you think that is the case? Do you think that there could have been alternative

114
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
ways to do this? Do you think that there were other options possibly available?

115
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
Options to what?

116
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:06,320
To perceiving reality in a different way. I think every species has a slightly different

117
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,600
dashboard. I don't think they are completely different because of convergent evolution.

118
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,240
If doing things one way worked out very well for one branch of the evolutionary chain,

119
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,000
chances are that other branches will hit upon that as well and that will be fixed by evolution

120
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,120
because it works well and therefore things will converge. So I don't know that our

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,280
dashboard, our screen of perception is the most optimal way to cognitively represent

122
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,360
the external states of the real world. But if it's not that, it's not a bad way either,

123
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,400
otherwise we wouldn't be here talking about it. So I don't think it's the only way.

124
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,640
I think there are conceivably almost infinite other ways to represent the world.

125
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
It's a way that works and I would expect that even other species have similar

126
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,480
dashboards, similar perceptual screens, but not identical because it doesn't need to be

127
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,120
identical. Bees see ultraviolet. There are species that detect infrared. Some species have

128
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,200
sonic radar and we don't have. What is it like to be a bat or a dolphin?

129
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So ours is certainly not the only one. This is certainly not the only way.

130
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,880
But it seems to have been good enough for the past, what seems to genus Homo has been around

131
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,680
at 1.8, maybe 2 million years. I think you once spoke about,

132
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,120
I think you had one psychedelic trip. How did your dashboard change at that point?

133
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,840
Oh, I have had several psychedelics. In my mid 30s, I was writing about consciousness and I

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,680
thought it would be lapse to the point of irresponsibility to write about consciousness

135
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,320
and not investigate consciousness through every avenue that we know to be safe.

136
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,960
So I did several fairly high dose psychedelic trips. I am in a country where it's legal

137
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,960
to the point that before I did my first trip, I went to my doctor

138
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,480
and I told him what I was about to do and asked for him to check me up. So I had my liver checked,

139
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,080
I had my heart checked, blood pressure and all that good stuff checked and I was given an okay and

140
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:42,160
here we go. I don't know whether psychedelics trip is so overwhelmingly rich and intense

141
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
that it's very difficult to make statements about

142
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,640
what the causality behind what you are experiencing is. Where does that stuff come from?

143
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,440
Is it from outside me? Is this my own stuff, my own shit, the skeletons in my own

144
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:11,120
cupboard? Is it from aliens? Is it from another dimension? It's virtually impossible to say this

145
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,960
and to be honest with you, I don't think it's very important either because the most baffling

146
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,200
thing about a psychedelic trip is that it seems to be exactly what you need

147
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,120
and where it comes from is utterly unimportant because the effect will be the same.

148
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,560
So I don't know that psychedelics allow you to see the world, this world as it is.

149
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,840
Could they do that? Yeah, I even suspect they might to some extent do

150
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,080
but even in that case, even if they do to some extent allow you to see our surroundings as our

151
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,880
surroundings really are and there's good reason to think that they might be doing that because

152
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
psychedelics reduce brain activity. So chances are that what is being reduced is in fact the

153
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,040
dissociative process itself, the dissociative boundaries being weakened so you're taking

154
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,680
in things as they are as opposed to representing them on a dashboard. But I don't think that's

155
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,080
the only thing psychedelics do or even the main thing because if that were the main thing they do,

156
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,120
we could die from a psychedelic trip because the entropy of our inner state to be unbound again,

157
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,600
you see? So I don't think that that's the only thing that is going on and even to the extent

158
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,320
that that is going on, I think it sort of gets mixed in with all kinds of other things. So it's

159
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
impossible to make a statement that, oh, that particular experience, that was the world as it

160
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,120
really is. I personally feel incapable of making that pronouncement. I mean, while sticking to

161
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,680
this chapter's theme on our intuitions and whether it is a true reflection of reality, when people

162
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,320
do have these trips or make certain claims, whether it's religious psychedelic trips,

163
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,120
spiritual claims, and the way they link it to idealism, how do you feel that impacts

164
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,960
the field of analytic idealism? Spiritual claims in general.

165
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,920
I don't have the delusion that I am in some sense owner of analytic idealism or even idealism.

166
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,000
So what people make of it, it's their own personal freedom and their own personal

167
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,200
responsibility, as long as they don't attribute that to me or attach that to analytic idealism as

168
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,400
a pronouncement of analytic idealism, what they make of it in their own lives, I think it's

169
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,680
their business, it's their responsibility, it's their lives. The way analytic idealism informs

170
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,120
their lives is their own thing. So long as they don't attribute spiritual claims to

171
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:04,480
analytic idealism itself or to me, I think it's okay. Okay, great. So okay, we've touched on that,

172
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,080
is reality what it looks like? Anything else you want to touch on regarding our screen of

173
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,040
perception and this nature of reality that you find on that? Okay, let's discuss then why

174
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,600
mainstream physicalism in general fails on all key post-enlightenment values, such as coherence,

175
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,040
internal consistency, parsimony, explanatory power, and empirical adequacy.

176
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,040
Let's start with coherence. Mainstream physicalism is internally contradictory,

177
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:43,600
probably more ways than one, I will mention one. Physicalism will say we have these physical

178
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,440
quantities that describe the contents of the screen of perception. So if I lift a heavy piece

179
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:58,480
of luggage, I can describe that heaviness that I feel as 50 kilograms or the lightness of a feather

180
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:08,160
that I feel as five grams. So physicalism starts with the obvious, we describe the perceived world

181
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,160
through physical quantities. This is metaphysically neutral and eminently reasonable. Galileo

182
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,480
started doing this. But then physicalism makes a very weird step. It says, oh, those descriptions,

183
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,600
those physical quantities, they precede the thing described. What really exists is not

184
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,760
the feeling of heaviness that I have when I lift the 50 kilograms piece of luggage. What really

185
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,680
exists is the 50 kilograms and somehow my feeling of lifting it arises from the 50 kilograms or is

186
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,760
modulated by the 50 kilograms. And the same thing for everything else. What really exists

187
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,080
are kilometers, joules, coulombs, seconds, grams, and so on and so forth. And the things that are

188
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,960
described through these quantities, they are secondary and they arise from the quantities.

189
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,440
That's eminently incoherent. It's like saying, I can pull the territory out of the map. The map

190
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,360
which describes a territory precedes the thing that is described. The moment you do that, your

191
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,640
descriptions lose their semantic anchoring. Because the lines on a map only have meaning

192
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
so far as you can link them to the territory. But if the map precedes the territory, the lines mean

193
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:39,920
nothing. And that's what we call the hard problem of consciousness. We cannot derive the territory

194
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,800
out of the map because the map loses its meaning unless from the moment zero,

195
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,880
it's cementically anchored to the territory. So to translate it into real life, we cannot derive

196
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:00,160
the sweetness of eating an apple from the mass, charge, spin, momentum of the molecules constituting

197
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,320
the apple. Of course not for the same reason that you cannot pull Cape Town out of the map

198
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,680
of Cape Town. Because the map loses its semantic anchoring the same way, mass,

199
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,000
charge, spin, momentum. If you say that they precede the sweetness of the apple,

200
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,040
they lose their semantic anchoring. In other words, they mean nothing. And you cannot derive

201
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,480
anything out of something that doesn't have meaning. So that was coherence. What was the next one?

202
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
Internal consistency.

203
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,840
Physicalism defines matter as that which has nothing to do with the qualities of experience.

204
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,080
And then tries to explain the qualities of experience in terms of matter. Good luck with that.

205
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,040
I mean, that settles. It is quite a tough one. I mean, particularly knowing that

206
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,520
a mainstream physics has had so many different revelations over time. And each time we seem to

207
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,280
be more and more confused about it. And knowing that matters like 99.9 recurring percent,

208
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,320
we just don't know what it is. There should be a clear indicator that we really just don't know

209
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:22,480
what matter is. The human psychology is such that the most obvious and self-evident bullshit

210
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,080
gains an aura of plausibility if enough people, along enough time, tell you that it's true.

211
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,400
That's human psychology. That's very true. Okay, let's go into the next one. Possimony.

212
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:47,600
The one ontological category that we absolutely know to exist because it precedes theory

213
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,360
are the qualities of experience. Qualitative stuff. That's how we begin. That's how we begin

214
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,520
experiencing the world. That's how everything started. And then we started theorizing after

215
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,000
that, but it begins with qualities. Now, the most parsimonious account of reality would be one

216
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,320
that explains reality in terms of qualities alone. Not only the qualities you experience,

217
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,480
or only the qualities that I experience, but qualities as a type, as a type of existent.

218
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,680
If we can make sense of nature in terms of qualities alone, that's the most parsimonious,

219
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,840
because it only grants existence to the one ontological category that we know absolutely

220
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,400
surely to exist because it precedes theory. Physicalism, however, postulates another one.

221
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
Physicalism postulates another type of existent that's not qualitative at all,

222
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,840
but can be exhaustively described in terms of quantities alone. Mass, charts, being momentum,

223
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,640
geometrical relationships, and so on and so forth. That is only justified if you can't make sense of

224
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,560
reality, account for the dynamics of nature in terms of qualities alone. If you can't, then okay,

225
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,600
you postulate something else. But if you can, then postulating something else violates the

226
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,120
principle of parsimony. And physicalism does that. All we need to account for nature is that there

227
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,040
are external states beyond our individual minds, external qualitative states, experiences that

228
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,920
are not mine or yours. They are experiences of nature out there. These are real external states.

229
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,880
But they can also be experiential just like mine and yours. In the same sense that my thoughts

230
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,200
are external to you, but they are still experiential states. If you were not around,

231
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,520
would still be having my thoughts from your perspective, they are external and objective,

232
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,120
but in their own nature, intrinsic nature, they are subjective and qualitative. So that's all we

233
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:54,480
need to explain nature, external qualitative states. But physicalism conflates everything,

234
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,280
and in postulating external states outside our minds, it thinks that those external states

235
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,800
should also be non-mental because anything outside our minds should be non-mental. Why?

236
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,080
Why the hell? I mean, my thoughts are mental, but they are outside your mind. So from your

237
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,320
point of view, if I tell you, well, the black holes are made of experiential states,

238
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,760
it's entirely analogous to my thoughts being experiential and outside your minds too.

239
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,840
So that's a grotesque violation of the principle of parsimony.

240
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Yeah. The last two are explanatory power and empirical adequacy. I mean,

241
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,080
another part of it, I mean, I wanted to ask you about certain things like the observer effect or

242
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,960
perhaps even the big bang and how we explain all of these using this concept now and understanding

243
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
it differently. I'm not sure what people mean by the observer effect.

244
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
Yeah, because it has to be an observer and it has to be separate at that point.

245
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,720
I don't know how to map it to the technical aspects of quantum theory, what people refer

246
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,800
to as the observer. There is a measurement problem. That's probably what people mean by

247
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,520
the observer effect. I don't know. Okay, why is physicalism then not empirically adequate?

248
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,640
Physicalism assumes that what really exists are physical states. In other words, states that

249
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,280
can be exhaustively described through numbers or quantities alone. And we call those states

250
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:34,240
strictly physical states. If physicalism is correct, then physical states or physical entities or

251
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,440
physical properties have standalone existence because they are supposed to be the bottom level

252
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,320
of reality. All states such as mental states are supposed to arise epiphenominally from

253
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,760
physical states. But what really has standalone existence, in other words, states that do not

254
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,800
depend on anything else to exist, those are physical states. Physical entities do not depend on

255
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,440
anything non-physical to exist. They do not depend on processes to exist because physical entities

256
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:12,080
are the bottom level of reality. Experiment contradicts this. There is a series of experiments

257
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,520
which had been going on about 45 years, and each won the Nobel Prize in physics last year,

258
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,280
which shows that if you have two particles, physical particles that are entangled,

259
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
and you shoot one at the speed of light in one direction, and you shoot the other in the opposite

260
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,760
direction, and then after a while, let's say scientist Alice makes a measurement on particle A.

261
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,960
And at the same time, scientist Bob makes a measurement on particle B,

262
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,600
and Alice and Bob do not talk to one another. It turns out that what Alice chooses to measure

263
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,480
about particle A determines what Bob sees when he looks at particle B. How can this be? If particle

264
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,120
A and B are fundamental, if they have standalone existence, they should be whatever they are,

265
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,600
irrespective of what Alice chooses to measure. Measurement is supposed to merely disclose what

266
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,360
the particle already was immediately prior to measurement. That's not what turns out to be

267
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:20,240
the case. Alice's choice of what to measure, technically, for instance, the axis of angular

268
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,320
momentum in which you measure angular momentum. That choice by Alice determines 100% what Bob

269
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,440
sees when he measures particle B. How can particle B change and be something different?

270
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,480
Because of what Alice, on the other side of the universe, chose to measure about particle A.

271
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
So what this is telling us is that physical entities do not have standalone existence.

272
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,840
Physical entities are a product of measurement. They arise from measurement. The thing that is

273
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,400
measured, the state that is measured in the first place, isn't physical. It can give you a metaphor.

274
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,120
Suppose you love football, but you can't go to the stadium. So you buy two television sets,

275
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,160
and you put them in your living room, and you watch the match on both televisions at the same

276
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:15,520
time, but on different broadcasters. Now, assuming that each broadcaster has their own cameras in

277
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,560
the stadium, so the images on the two televisions will not be the same because they are produced by

278
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,400
different cameras, but they will be completely correlated because they are images of the same

279
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,400
football match. Now, if a time traveler from the 19th century were next to you watching this in your

280
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,160
living room, the time traveler would be discombobulated, flabbergasted. How do the little man inside the

281
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:45,520
box to the left can run exactly in synchronicity with the little man inside the box to the right

282
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,680
without communicating? The box are separate. How do the little man on the left know what to do

283
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,480
based on what the little man to the right are doing? The mistake our time traveler does is to

284
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,680
confuse the appearance, the image of a phenomenon, the representation of a phenomenon, for the

285
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,880
phenomenon itself. The time traveler thinks that there are real little man inside the two boxes.

286
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,920
He doesn't understand that those images are just that, images of something else, of a reality,

287
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,240
but that reality is in the stadium. What you see on the television are just appearances thereof,

288
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,360
and the appearances are synchronized because they are both appearances of the same thing.

289
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,640
Now, what the Alice and Bob experiment tells us is that what Alice sees and what Bob sees,

290
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,840
the particles they measure, they are the images on the television screen, and Bob's measurements

291
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,440
are completely correlated with Alice's measurements, just for the same reason that the images on the

292
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
two television screens are correlated with one another. In other words, the particles are not

293
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,800
the thing in itself. The particle is the appearance that arises upon measurement when the cameras

294
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:03,520
shoot a frame on the stadium. That's why they're synchronized. They are both frames of the same

295
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,120
underlying reality, and the clue that that's underlying reality is the same is the word

296
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:17,600
entanglement. And we have to part with this notion that when we make a measurement and we see a

297
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,560
particle, that the particle was the thing measured. No, the particle is the image on the television

298
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,640
screen. The thing measured isn't a particle. It isn't physical. It isn't exhaustively

299
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,720
describable through physical quantities. It is almost certainly a mental state, not in your mind

300
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,320
or my mind. A mental state out there in nature at large. I mean, you spoke about entanglement,

301
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,960
and I mean, I'm just thinking about you mentioned that Nobel Prize. And when you think about

302
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,760
Nobel Prizes, they're usually given to settled sciences. So when something is settled, you get

303
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,640
the prize. I was just discussing the other day how Einstein never got the Nobel Prize for the

304
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,680
for relativity rather for the photoelectric effect rather than that. But more and more,

305
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,520
there's a growing body of evidence that seems to be showing us just how in true this non-locality

306
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,440
actually is. The fact that something that happens here is can happen 12.8 billion

307
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,400
light-years away. And how do you feel that these new physical data, well, we'll call it physical

308
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,560
data for now, actually provides more evidence for your claim rather than for the physicalists out there?

309
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,240
The Nobel Prize tends to be given to discoveries that have meaningfully and positively impacted

310
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,720
human life. So that's something to keep in mind. Even the Nobel Prize last was given to those scientists

311
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,760
because of quantum communication and quantum encryption. In other words, it tends to focus

312
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,240
on the applications rather than the raw theory, which is one of the reasons why there is Nobel

313
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,280
Prize in mathematics. You wait until it's applied by engineering, and then you get a Nobel Prize

314
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,440
in engineering or physics, and then you get a Nobel Prize somewhere else. In mathematics,

315
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,720
there is the Feuds Medal, which is something different, but just as important.

316
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,960
Look, there is no question that these new scientific results, which are not only

317
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,360
foundations of physics like we talked about, but also in the neuroscience of consciousness.

318
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,760
We've known for 10 years now, and this result has been repeated ad nauseam, that psychedelics

319
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,720
only reduce brain activity. They don't increase brain activity anywhere beyond measurement error.

320
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:43,760
That's also not what physicalist intuitions would expect. There is no question that these

321
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:52,400
results are not what the physicalist intuition would expect. But what happens is, and this is

322
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,800
nothing new. This has been the case throughout the history of science, and if you want to know

323
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,800
about it, read a wonderful little book called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions written

324
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,480
in 1969, I believe, the third edition, which is the one you should read.

325
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,280
What's happening now is what has happened many times before in history.

326
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,520
A certain metaphysics, a certain worldview, a certain paradigm, which is the word used in that

327
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:31,040
book, resists evidence that contradicted, and it keeps on resisting that evidence until it becomes

328
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:38,000
completely untenable. There are two conditions. One, it becomes completely untenable. You run

329
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,760
out of excuses, and two, you have to have an alternative that is viable. You never abandon

330
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,120
a paradigm or a metaphysics or a worldview just because it is untenable. Human psychology sticks

331
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,880
to what it knows isn't true until it has an alternative that looks more appetizing.

332
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,360
These two conditions have to be fulfilled, and the alternative cannot be something that you

333
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:18,240
find in a book after you devoured an enormous library for 10 years. It cannot be hidden.

334
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,000
It has to be in your face. It has to be talked about. It has to be known. It has to be common

335
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,040
knowledge in a culture. Analytic idealism, more idealism in general, has not achieved

336
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:39,360
that status yet. There are a surprising number of academics who do not understand idealism.

337
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,440
They mix it up with solipsism. They mix it up with upon experientialism. It's a catastrophe of

338
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:57,200
ignorance. The first criterion is not yet met, but the second one is also not met,

339
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:06,080
which is we haven't run out of excuses yet. Our tolerance for absurd excuses has increased

340
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:13,920
a lot because of science fiction. We have become trained by mainstream science fiction

341
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,440
to completely abandon our natural sense of plausibility. Think of theories like Black Mirror

342
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,680
and stuff like that. You can upload your consciousness to a computer. It griges nonsense,

343
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,480
or the aberration view of multiverses. There are many multiverse theories, some of which are quite

344
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:49,040
reasonable, but this particular one is egregious as well. The way we explain how Alice and Bob's

345
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,080
measurements are correlated is that everything that can happen actually does happen just in a

346
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:01,600
parallel universe. Congratulations. You just found a way to accept anything, any kind of bullshit

347
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,960
that doesn't violate first principles can now be accepted on the basis of this. But

348
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,720
look, from the moment my mouth started open when I said the last word,

349
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:23,280
countless gazillions of physical universes, as big as this one, have popped into existence

350
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,920
out of nothing for no reason, for which we have precisely zero empirical evidence.

351
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:37,200
I mean, we now accept this as plausible. Now, there are YouTube videos from respectable channels

352
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,720
like Veritasium that say, well, this is probably true. I mean, you have to hang your rationality

353
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:52,400
at the door when you come into a room before you say that. But we have legitimized nonsense

354
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,000
through science fiction, which has given enormous scope for excuses.

355
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,040
So it allows people to say, well, those experiments that just won the Nobel Prize,

356
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,720
they don't mean actually that physical entities do not have standalone existence. You know why?

357
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,600
Because there are these hidden variables in nature that are global. They are spread across

358
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,360
space and time. They are everywhere. And they do exactly what needs to be done for us to continue

359
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:30,400
to believe in physicalism. But how? Oh, we have no idea. Okay. What are those hidden variables?

360
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Can you at least theoretically define them? No. We define them in terms of what they need to do,

361
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,480
so we can continue to believe in physicalism. Is there any evidence for these hidden variables?

362
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:51,760
No. Not an iota. Yeah. I mean, this is worse than religion. It's much worse than religion because

363
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:00,800
in religion, you at least are basing your faith in some states, like your intuitions.

364
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,800
You're basing it in some states, in something that comes across as substantial in some way.

365
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,600
But this is based on nothing. This is based on trying to make nature fit your theory,

366
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:24,640
as opposed to making your theory fit nature. Unfortunately, this is widespread. So we are

367
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,960
nowhere near running out of excuses because we've now been, we've grown in our culture to accept

368
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,720
tremendous implausibility as something that may be the case. It's probably true.

369
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,800
No, it's probably true. There we go. Yeah, there's a lot of those. Okay. So chapter two, I think,

370
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,840
look, so physicalism, we've concluded, we've spoken about why that fails on all those post

371
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,360
enlightenment values. Anything else about physicalism you want to touch on, Bernardo?

372
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Anything else? Yeah, chapter three, right? Let's investigate now. We'll move on to the next one.

373
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,480
I mean, this one is something I know you're very passionate about talking about as well.

374
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,120
Let's investigate the insoluble problems of constitutive panpsychism.

375
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,160
Passionable metaphysics postulates consciousness to be a fundamental property of matter.

376
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,840
Well, let's first look at the differences. What idealism says is that everything is mental state,

377
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,360
not your mental states alone or my mental states alone, mental states at large,

378
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,480
everything's a mental state. Physical states are representations of mental states upon

379
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,760
measurement. But even the physical states are mental, because the contents of the screen of

380
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:45,600
perception, the things we see, hear, touch, feel, they're experiential as well. So we have mental

381
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,240
states representing other mental states. All there is is mental state. Matter is a mental

382
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:02,000
representation of other mental states. Pencychism is not like that. Pencychism says what really exists

383
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,680
is matter. And matter has physical properties that are not mental, such as mass, charts,

384
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,280
pain, momentum. But in addition to having physical properties, matter also has mental

385
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,760
properties that are fundamental and irreducible. So mass, charge, momentum, and an experience.

386
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,040
Still, an experience is now seen either as a property of matter or as the intrinsic nature

387
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,600
of matter. In this latter case, it comes closer to idealism, but not much. Because even if experience

388
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,760
is the intrinsic nature of matter, the structure of reality is still the structure of matter,

389
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,080
the structure we perceive on the screen of perception. In other words, reality is still

390
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,920
made of tiny little particles that come together to form bigger physical arrangements and bigger

391
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,200
consciousnesses. Because the mental states somehow are supposed to combine with one another until

392
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,600
giving rise to what it feels like to be us. A combination of the mental states of every

393
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,880
subatomic particle in our brain. Something like this. So constitutive Pencychism is different

394
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,800
from idealism. Now, why is constitutive Pencychism obviously wrong? There are many reasons. I

395
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,120
mentioned one reason, and then I'll try to dissect the intuition behind Pencychism. So even drop

396
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:28,480
that motivation to begin with. But first one, Empiricalism. Pencychism assumes that at the

397
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,400
bottom level of nature, according to modern physics, there are subatomic particles. In other words,

398
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,400
discrete little building blocks with spatial boundaries that form structure. By the way,

399
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,600
they either split apart or come together. This is incredibly naive. This would have been acceptable

400
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:58,720
in physics up to the mid-1920s. But by the late 1940s, we've known better. When physicists,

401
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,000
and by this, what I mean is high-energy physicists or theoretical physicists working foundations

402
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,840
of physics. Because we have solid state physicists and applied physicists, applied physics guys,

403
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,240
and they tend to make the same mistake. Because it's a model that works in practice. Let's think

404
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:26,000
of nature as casillions of little bricks. But we know that's not the case. Because since the advent

405
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,080
of quantum field theory in the late 40s, well, that was quantum electrodynamics by Feynman. And then

406
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:40,560
that was extrapolated not only to electromagnetism, but to all the other families of particles.

407
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,960
So now we have quantum field theory. We know that what we call particles, we use the word as a

408
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:57,040
metaphor. Particles are like ripples, excitations of underlying quantum fields. A ripple on a lake

409
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,840
can be characterized through physical quantities. A ripple has a certain height, has a certain speed,

410
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:10,640
a direction of movement, a certain width and breadth. But that doesn't mean that the ripple is

411
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,840
something other than the lake. The ripple is a doing of the lake. You cannot fish the ripple out of

412
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,920
the lake. The ripple is something the lake does. There's only the lake. There are no ripples. You

413
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,520
see what I mean? So in exactly the same way, there are only the quantum fields. There are no

414
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,600
elementary subatomic particles. And yet we talk about the properties of elementary subatomic particles,

415
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,840
spin, charge, momentum. Yeah, just like the ripple has a certain height, speed, the direction of

416
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,000
movement. It doesn't mean that there is anything to particles other than the underlying quantum

417
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,160
field. There are only quantum fields and they are not spatially bound. They do not have spatial

418
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:56,640
boundaries. They cut across the entire universe. And this is true in very significant ways because

419
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,920
without it, we could not explain a great many things. For instance, we could not explain particle

420
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,040
interactions, which is how I grew up. My first job was at CERN. And CERN is about the experimental

421
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,600
study of particle interactions. You use a collider to make particles interact.

422
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,760
When particles interact, they produce other particles that were not part of them.

423
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,080
For instance, when you produce a Higgs boson in the atlas experiment at CERN,

424
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,800
that Higgs boson decays into particles that were not part of the Higgs boson.

425
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,720
And that's what we measure. You can never measure the Higgs boson. It decays too quickly before it

426
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,960
interacts with any measurement surface. So one of the possibilities is that the Higgs boson decays

427
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,080
into two muons or heavy electrons. But the Higgs boson is not made of two muons. There aren't

428
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:00,720
muons inside the Higgs boson. And yet somehow the Higgs boson, when it seizes to exist, two muons

429
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,320
appear. And that's what we measure. How do you explain that? Well, you cannot explain it without

430
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,560
quantum field theory, because the muon was a certain ripple, and that ripple decayed into two

431
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,080
other ripples. And that's all there is to it. There was never a Higgs boson. There were never

432
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,400
two muons. There were patterns of excitation of underlying quantum fields, which decay and

433
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,040
take on different patterns. A ripple can decay and become lower in height, longer in breath,

434
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:38,720
and reduce speed. That's why particles decay into other particles. Or another thing that you

435
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,160
cannot explain without quantum field theory, unless you are prepared to accept magic,

436
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,160
is quantum fluctuations, the spontaneous appearance and disappearance of elementary

437
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,600
particles in a complete vacuum. I mean, this is bloody magic if you think particles are little

438
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,840
bricks. Little bricks pop into existence, and little bricks pop out of existence. No, that's

439
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:10,240
not what's happening. What's happening are the unavoidable noise or the unavoidable excitation

440
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,960
on the surface of a lake. If you look, even a very calm lake, if you look at it with a

441
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,000
magnifying glass, you see there are tiny little ripples appearing and disappearing everywhere.

442
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,440
The same thing on the fabric of reality, and that's quantum fluctuations. I mean, I could

443
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,960
go on and on. There are no bloody particles. There are only feuds. Feuds are not spatially

444
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:39,040
unbound. Therefore, insofar as constitutive pentpsychism assumes very naively that the

445
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,600
elementary building blocks of nature are particles, which it does for it to be able to work.

446
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,680
It's just wrong. This is not a philosophical opinion. This is a scientific bloody fact.

447
00:47:52,640 --> 00:48:00,640
The whole thing is based on a surprising ignorance of, we could say, modern physics,

448
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:08,080
but it's by now a century old. I mean, it's not even really very modern anymore. For the past 50

449
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,840
years, we've been trying to go beyond quantum field theory and fold gravity into it. I mean,

450
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,080
that quantum field theory is right. I mean, it's the most successful theory in the history of mankind.

451
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,680
So, yeah, it's pentpsychism is wrong. Now, let's explore the intuition behind it. Sorry for the

452
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,000
long-winded answer. Go ahead. I mean, this is literally your opportunity to do that.

453
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:39,520
The intuition behind pentpsychism is that we are compound beings. We are made of discrete

454
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:48,240
little cells, billions of them. Therefore, our minds should be compound as well. Our consciousness

455
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,280
should also be made of a combination of casillions of little consciousnesses. Our subjectivity should

456
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,280
be made of the combination of casillions of little subjectivities, because after all, we are compound.

457
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,720
So should our consciousness be compound? Ergo constitutive pentpsychism.

458
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:13,520
Now, this makes all kinds of mistakes. The first one, which I would just mention without going in

459
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,360
depth, is it mistakes the structure of what is represented on the screen of perception

460
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,080
or the structure of the perceiver. It's like mistaking the pixelation of my screen

461
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:35,280
for a pixelation of my subjectivity. Particles or elementary subatomic processes,

462
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,960
they are the pixels of the screen of perception, not necessarily the structure of the perceiver.

463
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,360
But you say, well, you are a perceiver, and if I would look at your body with a big magnifying

464
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:55,520
glass, I would see that it's made of little pixels, little subatomic particles. And I know

465
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,680
my body is not my subjectivity. My body is the appearance of my subjectivity on a screen of

466
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,920
perception. My body is itself a representation. It's what my subjectivity looks like on the

467
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,720
screen of perception that we call the physical world. So that pixelation you're seeing is the

468
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,400
pixelation of the representation of my subjectivity, not necessarily of the subject. So that's one

469
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,280
error. The other error is more subtle, so I won't spend a little more time with it.

470
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:31,280
It's this very notion that we are actually assembled together by a number of cells.

471
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,800
If we look at a grown human body, yes, you'll find lots of cells. And then you may confuse it

472
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,920
with a car, because a car is also made of parts. We are made of parts, cells, the cars made of parts.

473
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,240
What you have to remember is how the car came to being and how a human being came to being.

474
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:58,000
A car was assembled. Parts were brought together from different places and then welded together

475
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,680
or bolted together to form a car. Our car truly is a compound entity. But we are not.

476
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:14,400
We were not formed by gazillions of little cells crawling towards one another on the

477
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,440
ground and then piling up on top of one another until, hey, here, a human being. That's not how

478
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,440
it happened. We grew. We were not assembled. And if you look at growth, immediately after

479
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:34,320
facundation, and you know that, of course, better than most people are hearing, the egg,

480
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:42,160
the fertilized egg, is a single cell. It's not a compound organism. It's one cell.

481
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:50,160
Three days later, it's eight cells. But if you look at it, you realize that those eight cells

482
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:58,480
is just a linguistic way to say that the original zygote or the original egg fertilized developed

483
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:08,400
in their structure. Our cells are not parts. They are a kind of self-similar or fractal

484
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:17,120
inner structuring of the original zygote. In other words, I am still that zygote that was

485
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:23,280
in the womb of my mother nine months before I was born. It's just that that zygote got bigger

486
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:30,720
and created internal differentiation in a self-similar way. So it started as a cell,

487
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:37,920
so its internal differentiation has the shape of, guess what, cells. Because it was a cell. It

488
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,200
only knew how to be a cell, so its internal differentiation is cell-like. There's nothing

489
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,480
really counter-intuitive or surprising about this. We are as unitary and non-compound as adults

490
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,800
as we were when we were a one-day-old zygote in the womb of our mothers. It's just that it's a big

491
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,720
and highly internally differentiated zygote right now. We are not compound, so that very

492
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:10,560
intuition behind panpsychism is wrong because it naively presupposes that we were formed by

493
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,600
casillions of cells crawling towards one another and piling up on top of one another to make us.

494
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,320
Sorry, that's not how it worked. And the clue to it is that every cell has the same genome.

495
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,840
That's the physical clue that we are not compound.

496
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,640
And Tammi Bernardo, why do you think it's on the rise the way it is?

497
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,520
Panpsychism, that is.

498
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:44,800
Because we, as a culture, even amongst the elite, cultural elites in academia, I use this word

499
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:53,440
in a rather pejorative sense, so I mean it pejoratively. I think this whole elite stuff

500
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,680
is one of the biggest bullshit in the history of mankind, which doesn't mean that everybody's an

501
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:08,800
authority on anything, but anyway, I digress. There is this sense in academia and in cultural

502
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:16,800
elites that you know what, physicalism indeed doesn't work. We are screwed. It's not going to go

503
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:23,920
anywhere. Chris, of course, just lost his bet to David Chalmers made 25 years ago,

504
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,040
that in 25 years science would have an account for experiential states or consciousness. Well,

505
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:38,560
it doesn't. And it's not any further than it was before. In fact, things got worse. So,

506
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,920
Christo, we have to give Dave, I think, what was it? I think it was a case of wine. I forgot what

507
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:56,000
the bet was. So, there is this sense of impending doom for physicalism, but there is a very strong

508
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:06,960
psychological need to see this process, not as an error, but as a step in a kind of evolutionary

509
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:14,400
path in which we are constantly getting things more and more right. So, physicalism was a step

510
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:22,560
forward, but it was not the final step. So, now we have to take the next step by reusing

511
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:28,960
the good parts of physicalism, namely that the universe is made of matter. Now, we just add

512
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,040
experience as a fundamental property of matter or the intrinsic nature of matter. And physicalism

513
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,240
still sort of survives. And we have this warm fuzzy feeling that, oh, it was not all for nothing.

514
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,920
We were not stupid. We just didn't see far enough. And therefore, panpsychism now adds the ingredients

515
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,320
that was missing. And merrily, we go onwards. It's a progression. It's not an error. That's

516
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:03,840
the psychology underlying this. We want to hold on to as much as possible of what we used to believe.

517
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:10,560
Even after we realized that it will not deliver the child that the child is stillborn,

518
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,080
we still want to stick to as many aspects of it as possible in order to go to bed with that feeling

519
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:23,040
that we didn't waste our intellectual lives. Well, this is complete nonsense, of course.

520
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:30,640
This injects human subjectivity into what is supposed to be a rational reason and evidence-based

521
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:37,600
process. No, physicalism is just bloody wrong. And that's the end of it. We owe nothing to it.

522
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,040
Science doesn't depend on physicalism. Science is metaphysics agnostic. Science is the study

523
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,880
of what nature does, not what nature is. All scientific entities, theoretical entities,

524
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,600
are convenient fictions. Nature behaves as though those entities really existed.

525
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Whether they really exist or not is irrelevant. We can still build mobile phones

526
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,560
and put a spaceship on an asteroid, even knowing that Newton's laws of motion were wrong.

527
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,960
Newton's laws were wrong. And we put a spaceship on the surface of an asteroid using Newton's laws

528
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:20,320
of motion because things behave as though they were true. So these convenient fictions are the

529
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,320
bases of both science and technology. We owe nothing to physicalism. The only thing we owe to

530
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,720
physicalism is that less scientists died burned at the stake during the early stages of the

531
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:43,840
Enlightenment. After Bruno was burned in 1600 in a central square in Rome, burned at the stake for

532
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:51,200
holding scientific views, scientists realized, damn, we have to come up with the story here

533
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,920
to say that, you know, we are working on something completely different from the church and we are

534
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,800
not a threat to the church. So what's this domain of the church? Well, the church claims domain

535
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:12,160
over a psyche, the Greek word for spirit and so, but also mind. In ancient Greek, there was no

536
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,800
differentiation between mind and spirit and so it was all psyche. It's okay, that's the domain

537
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,160
of the church. Let's invent another one, one that is not psyche, one that is not mental.

538
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,240
And we were not to burn at the stake and lo and behold, it worked. And the problem is that

539
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,360
the early figures of the Enlightenment knew what they were doing. They needed to always on record

540
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:43,440
saying, materialism, the old word for physicalism, materialism doesn't work, but we have to keep on

541
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,120
using it as a weapon against the church. I mean, this is written, it's on record. They knew that,

542
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,200
but at some point with the bourgeois intellectual revolution of Darwin in the mid 19th century,

543
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,240
intellectually it's figured not only can we survive the church, we can supplant the church

544
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,880
and drunken, as they were in that time, they started believing their own snake oil

545
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,920
and they bought into physicalism. There were other psychological factors as well. You know,

546
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:20,320
you get rid of hell, you get rid of the greatest fear of mankind, which is what will we experience

547
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,360
after we are dead. That has been the greatest anxiety of mankind throughout our history.

548
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:32,800
And in the mid 19th century, it was gone. I mean, this is fantastic stuff, right? And then we

549
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:40,720
forgot that certain things were never meant to be truly believed. They were political tools. And now

550
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:48,160
we believe that shit. Sincerely. Sincerely. You mentioned so many different things that I want

551
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,480
to touch on. I mean, I think the first thing that stood out, I mean, you mentioned Christ of

552
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,280
and he lost that bet. I spoke to him quite recently. And I'm just thinking about when,

553
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,880
if you were there when Francis Crick was started this whole talk about the neural

554
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
correlates of consciousness, what you have said to him?

555
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:12,960
Christoph, I regard Christoph very highly. And I tell you why Christoph is sincere.

556
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes. He's not a politician. He's not trying to protect his image or his respectability.

557
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:32,480
Or his grants. He's honest. He's sincere. And his view of things therefore evolves.

558
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:39,600
Because as he thinks more deeply about things, as he's exposed to more evidence,

559
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:45,600
as he exposed to different ideas, he is incorporating all of that in his inner mental

560
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:53,280
processes. Outwardly, of course, he will be cautious, because nobody in science

561
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:01,200
or analytic philosophy wants to be coopted by the nonsensical fringes. Nobody wants to do that.

562
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:08,160
I run this risk more than most because idealism has for so long been associated with religion

563
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,400
and spirituality. Even though that's not my angle on it, I run that risk. But I'm not an

564
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,320
academia. I don't depend on grants. I'm pretty free to say what I really think.

565
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,520
But Christoph, I think he's quite sincere.

566
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:33,920
And the influence of Francis Crick on him was, of course, immense. Christoph was very young.

567
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,360
Francis was already a Nobel Prize winner. And Francis was beyond the Nobel Prize winner.

568
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,800
He's the guy who discovered DNA. I mean, this is the Nobel amongst the nobles.

569
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:52,240
This is the meta Nobel Prize. And the guy was his mentor. I had a mentor too,

570
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,560
Rudy Bock, who was a famous physicist at CERN. He was a father figure to me. I know what it is

571
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:06,640
to be in the field of a mentor. And I don't know for a fact that that happened to Christoph.

572
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:13,360
But Christoph is human, just like the rest of us. I would be surprised if that hadn't been a factor

573
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:20,320
there. So in other words, I am prepared to give Christoph all kinds of passes for

574
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,520
because I believe in his sincerity. Yes, now he's a wonderful. I believe in his honesty.

575
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,920
Yeah. And your thoughts on just general neural correlates of consciousness,

576
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,040
anything you want to say about that?

577
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:41,920
I think it is undeniable that there are correlations between patterns of brain activity

578
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,360
and inner experience. I just interpret that differently. Instead of thinking of patterns

579
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:53,360
of brain activity as the cause of inner experience, I interpret them as the appearance

580
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:58,560
of inner experience. In other words, brain activity is what inner experience looks like

581
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,240
when it's observed from the outside. And this is not surprising, the appearance of a phenomenon

582
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:10,560
correlates with the phenomenon. It's an appearance of, I mean, right? So it's a different interpretation,

583
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:16,800
but not a denial of the fact of the correlation, the correlation is there. And to do neuroscience,

584
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,080
all you need is the correlation. Because an objective measurement of brain activity

585
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,760
gives you an extrinsic appearance of what's going on in the mind of the subject.

586
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:37,680
And that ought to be tremendously useful. So analytic idealism does not contradict neuroscience.

587
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,880
On the contrary, it validates neuroscience metaphysically. You should keep on doing brain scans

588
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,560
because that appearance is what the phenomenon you're interested in looks like.

589
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,120
You look at the image of a phenomenon to study it. There is nothing wrong. I mean,

590
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:59,680
this is the essence of science. Sciences, we look at the image of a phenomenon. For instance,

591
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,920
when I am in my work bench here behind me and I'm using an oscilloscope to measure electrical

592
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,600
activity, I don't think that that picture on the screen of my oscilloscope is the phenomenon.

593
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,760
No, it's what the phenomenon looks like upon measurement. But that appearance is extremely

594
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,520
useful. I use it every day. Now, the same thing for brain activity, you're looking at the appearance

595
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:27,280
of the phenomenon you're interested in and that science, that's legitimate. So I think looking

596
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:33,680
for the neural correlates of consciousness, pay attention to the words, the neural correlates of

597
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,280
consciousness, not the neural causes of consciousness is incredibly valid. I think there is an issue

598
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,880
that for a long time we mixed up the neural correlates of consciousness

599
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,400
with the neural correlates of meta consciousness. In other words, reportable experience, which is

600
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:59,120
something extra on top of the experience itself. But awareness of this conflation is growing.

601
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:06,320
And so now we will be adopting, say, no report paradigms to look at the

602
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,960
true neural correlates of consciousness and I'm all for it. I'm all for it. I think neuroscience

603
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:21,360
is critical for a healthy future of the human species. And I am not skeptical of neural imaging

604
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,480
to the extent that others are because those bugs were found in analysis software a couple of years

605
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,320
ago and people said, well, throw away 23 years of neural imaging. I don't think that I think some

606
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:38,480
results are so robust that despite those bugs, many of the conclusions can still be said to hold.

607
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:46,720
So I'm not antagonistic at all. What I'm antagonistic of is when a neuroscientist is biased

608
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:56,640
and tries to fit or communicate his results in a way that makes it sound compatible with

609
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:05,280
physicalism. That I think is dishonest. I think it's a lie. I think not only it defaces science,

610
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:14,880
but it's immoral. And I think things like that should end scientific careers

611
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,720
when they become public. I think before we close off a chapter three, which is...

612
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,960
By the way, Christoph is guilty of none of what I just said. I had other people in mind.

613
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,400
Do you want to mention them or should we just move on?

614
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,880
Whoever pays attention to my output knows who I'm talking about.

615
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,400
I mean, we're closing off on panpsychism. Before we do that, we have to address the

616
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,600
elephant in the room, which I think in this case has to be Philip Goff. Because the last time we

617
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,440
spoke about, we had a chat, you mentioned Philip Goff and how he changes his views all the time,

618
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,280
but we didn't go into it. So I think this is a perfect time to touch on this.

619
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:59,360
Oh, but that's cruel, because now you're inviting me to freely criticize a colleague.

620
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,360
I mean, if Philip's a colleague of mine too, we've chatted as well. So this is not a platform

621
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,720
for hatred or anything, but just more often a critique of his ideas.

622
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Now, if you give me a specific point that I disagree with,

623
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,040
point that Philip makes and I disagree with, I'm prepared to argue why Philip is wrong.

624
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:22,160
But if you just invite me to say, okay, now, no, okay, criticize Philip Goff.

625
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,200
Okay, not Philip Goff. Philip Goff's version of panpsychism.

626
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,120
It is a form of constitutive panpsychism in which instead of saying that

627
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,680
experiential states are a property of matter, he says experiential states are the intrinsic

628
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:45,600
nature of matter. In other words, matter is experiential states and physical properties

629
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:51,360
are sort of epiphenomenon. So it comes very close to idealism in a sense, but not at all in

630
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:58,000
another sense, which is it still attributes to consciousness, the structure of matter.

631
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,800
And that's the error of taking the pixelation of the image for the structure of the thing that

632
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,720
is represented as an image. For instance, on your screen right now, I appear pixelated. Unless you

633
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,800
are using an Apple retina display, if you look close enough, you see that Bernardo on your screen

634
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:22,720
is made of little rectangles. But that's the pixelation of my representation on your screen.

635
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:29,040
Bernardo himself is not made of little rectangles. So when Philip says the structure of nature is

636
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,320
the structure of elementary subatomic particles, he's making precisely this mistake. He's taking

637
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:40,320
the pixelation of the appearance for the structure of the thing that appears. And he also makes

638
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:48,480
the mistake, which was forgivable for him when he began, of taking elementary subatomic particles

639
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:59,200
as irreducible things. While physics, for the past 90 years, or at least 80, knows that, no,

640
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:05,360
particles are just ripples of fields. What really exists are the fields. Now, I've made this criticism

641
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:13,120
to Philip years ago. And his response was to say, well, but there is one possible theory of physics

642
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,760
which acknowledges that there really are particles. And that's Bohmian mechanics.

643
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:29,760
Came out in a famous double paper by David Bohm in 1951, famous pilot wave theory, which is an

644
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,640
interpretation of quantum mechanics, according to which particles really exist as little things.

645
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,000
But there is a reason why that thing was never taken seriously by the vast majority of scientists.

646
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:52,720
There are many reasons. Many of them technical. There is that check, or is it Slovakian? There's

647
01:09:52,800 --> 01:10:02,960
check physicist, Motel, I forgot. Ludo, Ludo's Motel, I forgot his name. But he once wrote sort of a

648
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:12,080
the definitive criticism of Bohmian mechanics. He took the time to elaborate in every technical

649
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:20,720
detail why that thing is just nonsensical. But an intuition survived because there was a famous

650
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:27,920
experiment done many years ago with droplets on a fluid that were that was claimed to emulate

651
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,160
the results of the double slit experiment, but with little droplets, in other words, physical

652
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:41,760
little entities. But three years ago or four paper came out showing that those results were because

653
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:48,240
of experimental errors. Those results were not valid. So even the intuition behind it, it's

654
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:56,160
now gone. So Bohmian mechanics is history. It just it doesn't have a chance. And even if it had,

655
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:04,160
it's such a niche thing that if Philip hangs the plausibility of his view on that, as he did a couple

656
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:13,280
of years ago, then might as well give up instead of going to Joe Rogan and other podcasts and

657
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,160
talking about something that by now he shouldn't know is untenable. There's something else he

658
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:23,760
should know. But apparently he's still talking about it. He says idealism is inflationary compared

659
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:30,160
to pent-psychism. And the reason is he says, well, Bernardo, you yourself talks about mind

660
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,760
underlying the physical world. So you have these two things, the physical world and mind, which

661
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,640
makes me go that, oh, my God, no, I would expect that from a podcast listener, but not from a

662
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,000
professor. He's running away with language and failing to understand what is meant.

663
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,120
And under idealism, mind underlies matter only in the sense that the thing that really exists is

664
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:01,040
mind. And what we call matter is itself a mental process that represents mental processes. In

665
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:06,960
other words, there is only mind. There aren't two things. The usage of the word underlies is just

666
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,000
to cater to popular intuitions. You see a physical world. There is something that underlies that

667
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,160
in the sense that the sky underlies the indications on a dashboard. But the dashboard and the sky are

668
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:27,680
physical. The sky is not a separate ontological category. In the same way, the physical world

669
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:33,680
is mental because it's an experience I have. And what underlies this mental process is another

670
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,480
mental process that is represented by the first one. In other words, there are only mental processes.

671
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,720
There is absolutely no inflationary approach here if you bother to think about it for 10 seconds

672
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:50,720
and try to understand what is meant as opposed to sticking to the mere word underlies as if it's

673
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:58,800
signaled ontological inflation. It doesn't, sorry. I wanted to move on to Jep to four before this,

674
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,120
but I have to ask you this question. I know because Philip and Keith now have the podcast

675
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,880
mind chat. I love the fact that more people are chatting about this. We're getting into this a

676
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,760
lot more in depth. What are your thoughts on that as a concept? Because I know Philip does say that

677
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:19,360
if panpsychism does not work, the most reasonable theory that he thinks is second best is illusionism.

678
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:27,760
I think it's the stupidest thing in the history of philosophy. It's a completely self-defeating

679
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:35,760
thing that only survives by making its own proponents very confused and all tied up in a

680
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:41,680
conceptual web. So confused that at some point they squint their eyes and wave their hands and say,

681
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:48,640
oh, and behind all that, there's the answer. That's how it survives. It's not a product

682
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:56,080
of clear thinking. Let's first address it from the obvious perspective. We will go deeper because

683
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:03,520
most listeners should believe that the proponents cannot be this drastically wrong,

684
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,000
that they see a little deeper than this. So the obvious perspective is

685
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,800
an illusion is already an instance of a conscious process. You experience an illusion.

686
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,880
So you cannot dismiss the existence of consciousness by appealing to illusions

687
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:28,400
because illusions are already instances of that which you want to dismiss. So it's immediately

688
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,720
self-defeating. If consciousness is an illusion, then consciousness exists. If every content of

689
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:40,080
consciousness is an illusion in the sense that it doesn't correspond to external states of affairs,

690
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,480
consciousness would still exist and actually it would be the only thing that exists because it's

691
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,640
all illusion. So there is nothing else. There is only the illusion. Illusion is already an instance

692
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,920
of consciousness. And then you might think, oh, but these guys with PhDs, they must see

693
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,440
deeper than this. There must be something to illusionism beyond this, right? Not really,

694
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:09,600
but they think there is. And I'll tell you what they think is there, what they say is the following.

695
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:15,520
And this could be a paraphrasing, not only of Keith Frankish, but of Danny Dennett,

696
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:26,880
his master as well. It goes like this. If my experiences are actually just brain activity,

697
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:37,200
why do my experiences not look like firing neurons? If my experience is firing neurons,

698
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,640
why do they not look like firing neurons? If I experience the night sky, the night sky

699
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:51,760
doesn't look like firing neurons. The theory goes as follows. Oh, it's because the brain

700
01:15:52,560 --> 01:16:03,440
produces a kind of summary digest of its own activity. And what we experience is that sort of

701
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:11,120
summary digest. Now, the summary digest is not the original brain activity. And that's why we

702
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:16,640
don't experience things that look like brain activity, that look like firing neurons. It's

703
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,520
because what we experience is a summary digest produced by the brain of its own activity and

704
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:31,600
not the original activity itself. Does it sound reasonable? It's difficult for me to say because

705
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,640
I mean, initially, when I came into this podcast, I actually supported illusionism as a theory of

706
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,920
consciousness. It does sound reasonable, doesn't it? So that's the thing to me. It actually does

707
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,240
sound pretty reasonable. Now, let's take the next step. What is this summary digest?

708
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:58,320
It's brain activity. It cannot be anything else. Yes. Because if you say, well, it's the soul,

709
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,280
then you're not an illusionist. If you say it's mental stuff, then you're not an illusionist.

710
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:10,720
Right? You could say, well, it's not brain activity, it's liver activity. But you still have the same

711
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,720
problem that I'm about to tell you. The argument is we don't experience firing neurons because what

712
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:22,640
we experience is a summary digest of firing neurons. But that summary digest can only be

713
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:29,840
firing neurons. There is nothing else it can be. So why doesn't the summary digest itself

714
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:36,800
feel like firing neurons? Oh, because there must be a meta summary digest.

715
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,920
Yeah, but the meta summary digest can only be firing neurons.

716
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:51,600
And infinite regress is upon us. You cannot escape this. Yes. And people think they can escape this

717
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:58,560
by doing all kinds of linguistic hand waving. Keith, for instance,

718
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:10,960
the way he defines qualia makes you dizzy. And at some point, you realize that there really

719
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:18,320
is nothing there. There is just an attempt by otherwise intelligent people to accommodate

720
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:27,280
their belief system. And therefore, fooling themselves, they need to fool themselves in order

721
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:34,240
to accommodate their own belief system. And they will fool themselves linguistically and through

722
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:40,640
conceptual obscurantism, which is not malicious, normally obscurantism is malicious, you do that

723
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:47,280
in order to deceive other people. But there is such a thing as auto obscurantism, which is

724
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:54,160
something your mind does to safeguard its own belief system. So you will start adding layers

725
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:59,200
of conceptual abstraction one on top of another until you can't see the end anymore. Oh, but

726
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,720
there is something there. Therefore, I can continue to believe that materialism is right.

727
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,560
Do you think you fully grasped Sue's version of illusion or delusionism?

728
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,840
No, it's not illusionism. Because if you look at the conversation,

729
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,080
she defined illusionism as the idea that that some things we experience are illusions.

730
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:28,400
Well, yeah, it's certainly right. But it's not what Danny Danette and Keith Frankish

731
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:36,240
make of illusionism. Because the problem of illusionism is that it is either incoherent,

732
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:46,640
or it is irrelevant. Because if it is relevant, then it offers an avenue for solving the hard

733
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,600
problem of consciousness. And for it to do that, it has to convince people that consciousness

734
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,880
doesn't exist, that it's some kind of illusion, which backfires because an illusion is already

735
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,080
an instance of consciousness, but never mind. So for it to be relevant, it has to solve the hard

736
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:08,160
problem, or at least offer an avenue for treating the hard problem. Or in that case, in this case,

737
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,360
the illusion problem is what they refer to. Yeah. So for it to be relevant, it has to do that. But

738
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:19,120
if it does that, it's incoherent. Now, if you don't want it to be incoherent, you have to redefine

739
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,920
illusionism in a way that makes it coherent. But then it no longer addresses the hard problem at

740
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:30,880
all. And therefore, it's irrelevant. Illusionism is either nonsensical, or it is irrelevant.

741
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:38,400
And that's a conundrum. And because of that, he will see true illusionists, not Sue. Sue,

742
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,920
based on our conversation, she clearly is not an illusionist in the strict sense of the word.

743
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,880
I mean, I spoke to her last week, her view is more about our delusions about how we approach

744
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,400
consciousness, and the illusions of how we perceive the word per se, or the way we perceive

745
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:01,120
everything about this concept. So it's a lot of nonsense in there. Yeah, lots of illusions in

746
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:11,120
there. The problem is that they, this can be a way to create straw man. I had a direct

747
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,680
acceptance of this, I once wrote an article criticizing the work of a neuroscientist from

748
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,040
California, Antonio Damatio, I think. No, yeah, Antonio Damatio, the guy who said consciousness

749
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:27,760
doesn't doesn't exist. It doesn't happen. He is on record saying that in an article on new science,

750
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,240
cover feature. And I criticized that. And the way I criticized that was that

751
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:41,120
what he defined as consciousness is not what philosophers call consciousness at all. It's

752
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:46,960
not even what the regular person on the street would call consciousness. He defines consciousness

753
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:56,960
as a kind of immortal soul, a kind of a ghost, a kind of persistent self that inhabits our body.

754
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,760
And then he proceeds to dismantle that notion that there is no self, no personal self,

755
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:07,040
all of which I agree. There is no stable personal self. There is no personal self this.

756
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,800
It's an illusion. The personal self is an illusion. But that's not what we mean by consciousness.

757
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,800
What what we mean by consciousness is the qualities of experience. And Damatio's argument

758
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:26,880
doesn't even touch that. So I criticized him. And he replied with pure ad hominence.

759
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:36,320
Portraying me as some kind of spiritual wacko, religious fanatic. And I was amazed with that.

760
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:45,760
I mean, I confess it drew a smile, because it was a answer to a criticism that in over 800 words,

761
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,880
didn't at all touch the criticism. It was a non answer. And but it dawned on me

762
01:22:53,840 --> 01:23:00,800
that it is the illusionists that are confused about what is meant by the word consciousness.

763
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,720
It is they who are thinking of disembodied souls or permanent personal selves.

764
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:14,240
It's they who make that mistake. And now they found a way to refute the mistake they make.

765
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,400
But they project that on other people. But the other people are not making that mistake.

766
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,520
You see what I mean? Like Danny Dennett, he went to great lengths to dismiss

767
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:31,840
the homontulus idea that consciousness is a little guy sitting inside your head,

768
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,400
watching the output of your brain. I mean, that's nonsense. I mean, congratulations,

769
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:43,520
you refuted something. Everybody in the world in the 21st century know is untrue. But don't

770
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:50,320
attribute that nonsense to me. Don't attribute it to the analytic idealism and then go and burn

771
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,400
the straw man you created. So what dawned on me after that interaction with Damazio was that

772
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,320
they are not refuting the confusion of others, the illusionists. They are refuting their own

773
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:10,160
confusion. And they think that they are refuting other people. I don't think that's what's going on

774
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,240
here. Yeah. What about Galen Strossen and Mysterionism?

775
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:23,200
Well, Mysterionism, by definition, is not a step forward. In term, it's not a positive step forward

776
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:29,680
in the sense that it's not bringing new clarity. It can be positive in the sense that it at least

777
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:35,600
avoids the bullshit. It avoids the bullshit of saying, oh, consciousness is just brain activity.

778
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:43,440
No, brain activity is probably, it's certainly correlated with consciousness. But the causality

779
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:49,200
here is probably to substantiate that for one and a half century and fail. Then now we know for

780
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:53,920
sure that it's not there. So at least we avoid that false conclusion by saying, well, we don't know

781
01:24:53,920 --> 01:25:00,080
what it is. So there is a negative step forward in the sense that you negate a step backwards.

782
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,000
But you don't produce a step forward by saying, well, we don't know what it is.

783
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:11,360
I think it's too soon to give up because the problem is not as intractable as it seems. It only

784
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:18,400
seems intractable if one makes some unexamined assumptions that make it intractable. But if

785
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:24,320
you drop those unexamined assumptions, and you clear your head, and you approach the problem with a

786
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:31,360
clear, unprejudiced head, it's certainly not as intractable as it would otherwise seem. So

787
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:37,760
I'm not prepared to give up. Yeah, I will. What was the other thing you said, Mysterionism?

788
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,080
I think I just said Galen Strossen. I was just mentioning Galen Strossen and Mysterionism.

789
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,360
I'm trying to think there's no other theory of consciousness. But anyway, Chapter 4 is pretty

790
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,240
much moving away from the other theories of consciousness, where I wanted to go into depth

791
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:55,840
on analytic idealism itself, discussing how it makes sense of reality without requiring

792
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:02,400
anything other than nature's soul given, which is experience. So I think let's do that.

793
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:07,600
Yeah, can we take a quick bio break? I need to go to the toilet. Let's do my bottle.

794
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,840
I just realized that would have actually been a perfect opportunity for me to test out some of

795
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,880
these bumpers I created.

796
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:28,640
Okay, yeah. So let's go into depth. Let's go in depth into analytic idealism itself,

797
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:33,680
discussing how it makes sense of reality without requiring anything other than nature's soul given,

798
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:40,560
which is experience. Yeah. So to make sense of nature, we have to grant that there is an external

799
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,080
world that we inhabit. If I were in your studio with you right now, I would describe it in a way

800
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:51,840
that would be consistent with your own experience of it. So our experiences are not identical,

801
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:59,680
but they are clearly modulated by something outside them, some set of states that we inhabit

802
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:09,760
and which surround us. In other words, solipsism, we cannot, not solipsism, we cannot say that

803
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:17,680
the whole of nature is made of individual mind states. In other words, mind states within people

804
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:24,960
and animals and avoid postulating an external world. I believe that is impossible. There are

805
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:32,240
attempts to do that that are not necessarily incoherent, tends to go by words like radical

806
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:40,560
constructivism or inactivism. But I believe, and that may be just my being old fashioned or too

807
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:46,160
stupid to understand some of these approaches, I believe ultimately to prove impossible to get

808
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:54,080
rid of the external world. There has to be external states that we inhabit. But in admitting

809
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,920
this, we do not need to make them non mental. To make them non mental is equivalent to the

810
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:06,560
following. It's equivalent to be standing on the earth, looking until the horizon and understanding

811
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,600
that everything we see until the horizon is colloquially physical in the sense of no contents

812
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:17,680
of perception. But then saying beyond the horizon, it's not planet earth anymore. Until the horizon

813
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:22,320
it's planet earth. But beyond the horizon, I acknowledge there is something beyond the horizon,

814
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:28,960
but it's no longer planet earth. Why? Beyond the horizon, it's just more of the same type

815
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:38,080
of what is in the horizon. In the same way, beyond individual minds, it's more stuff of the same

816
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,800
type that individual minds are made of. In other words, mental processes, mental states.

817
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,160
They are beyond the horizon. They are not within my individual mind. If I stopped existing,

818
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,960
those external mental states would still exist. If every living being would die, those mental

819
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,920
states would still exist. They existed before the first living being popped into existence.

820
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:04,480
But they were still intrinsically mental. It's just more earth beyond the horizon. That's the idea.

821
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,480
And with that, you can explain nature as something separate from our individual minds and which is

822
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:18,880
not susceptible to our whims, our fantasies, our fears, will not change what it does because of

823
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:26,160
our morning affirmations. There is still a world out there that is objective from our perspective,

824
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:32,720
but from its own perspective, it is subjective. Just like my thoughts are objective to you,

825
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,000
but from their own intrinsic perspective, they are subjective. So that's an analytic

826
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,400
idealism in a nutshell. And the question that remains unanswered is what creates this inside,

827
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,600
outside division? Because to speak of individual minds and a world outside individual minds,

828
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:55,280
you need boundaries that determine the inside of the individual mind. If everything is mental,

829
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,600
what mental process accounts for this boundary? Well, the answer is a mental process we have

830
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:10,400
known to exist already for centuries, but we know for sure is a fact of nature for the past 20 years

831
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:19,200
or so. And that's dissociation. Dissociation can literally make you blind to what is right in front

832
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:25,760
of your open eyes, as has been shown in Germany in 2015. So dissociation creates a cognitive

833
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:31,920
boundary within a single mind that leads to the appearance of multiple disconnect centers of awareness.

834
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,960
In psychiatry, these different centers of awareness go under the technical name

835
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:44,720
altars or alternative personalities. Studies by Harvard show that 25% of people with

836
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:52,240
dissociative identity disorder have dreams in which multiple altars partake at the same time.

837
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,480
They experience the same dream, each from its own perspective, and they see one another as

838
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:04,960
characters within the dream. They can even club each other over the head, speak to one another,

839
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:10,480
touch one another. And when the person is awake, a person with dissociative identity disorder,

840
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,600
depending on the altar that is in executive control of the body, that altar will relate to

841
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:21,440
the therapist, the same dream, but from its own point of view, describing the other altars as

842
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:28,160
characters within the dream. And the other altars do the same thing. So the hypothesis is that,

843
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:35,360
okay, there are only mental states. So the unified field of physics is a field of subjectivity.

844
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:43,280
Excitations of this field of subjectivity are what we call experiences. And within this field,

845
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:51,200
dissociative processes form that create these cognitive boundaries. We know since 2014 that

846
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:56,560
people with dissociative identity disorder, if you put them in a brain scanner, there is something

847
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,880
a dissociative process looks like in an fMRI. In other words, dissociative processes have an

848
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:08,000
appearance. They look like something. In the context of nature at large, what dissociation

849
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,520
looks like is biology. It's life. Life is the appearance of dissociation. It's what the dissociation

850
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:21,120
in the mind of nature and the field of subjectivity that is nature. It's what it looks like when it

851
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,840
forms. And that's why when you look in the mirror, you see a living being. And when you look at other

852
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,080
people who can't read your thoughts and don't know what's happening in the galaxy of Andromeda right

853
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:35,920
now, they too are the extrinsic appearance of dissociative processes. And that's why they

854
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,440
can't read your thoughts. That's why they don't know what's happening in the galaxy of Andromeda,

855
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:44,400
even though they're all part of the same underlying field of subjectivity, the one mind of nature.

856
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,800
They cannot access cognitive content beyond their own dissociative boundary.

857
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:57,120
And because of this dissociative boundary, we lose access to the mental states in the world that

858
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:03,520
surround us, which is itself made of mental states. But evolutionarily speaking, it's very

859
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,400
important for our survival that we can collect information about the environment around us,

860
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:14,000
negotiate that environment to perceive threats, to perceive food and water.

861
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:24,000
So it stands to reason that we would have evolved to indirectly represent external states,

862
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,360
as these external states impinge on our dissociative boundary. Because even in a person with

863
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,160
dissociation, let's not talk about pathological dissociation, let's talk about something that

864
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:42,640
everybody can relate to. We all undergo dissociation all the time. Most of the time, it's not pathological.

865
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:47,120
For instance, if you're having relationship problems with your partner at home,

866
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:55,280
and it's really grieving you, but in the morning, you have to go to work. So what do we do? We park

867
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:01,280
our problems. That's a way to induce a form of dissociation. When you are at work, you're not

868
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:08,640
experiencing your relationship problems. You're experiencing your work. But that dissociated

869
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:16,480
emotion is impinging indirectly on your work life. It is modulating the tone of your thoughts.

870
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:23,600
You may become more negative, less optimistic. It's modulating your reactions to environmental

871
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:32,000
challenges. For instance, you become more brisk, abrupt and rude towards people. All that is happening

872
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,840
while you're still dissociated from your relationship problems because you've parked them.

873
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:42,640
But the dissociated process is still impinging on your dissociative boundary and modulating

874
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:48,080
what's happening inside. Now, the same thing in nature. When a living being forms, that's the

875
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:53,040
appearance of a dissociative process. But the mental states around that living being are still

876
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,160
impinging on that dissociative boundary. And evolution, of course, leveraged that impingement

877
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,040
to collect information about what's happening outside, even though because of dissociation,

878
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:09,120
you are no longer able to directly access external states. And that's what we call perception.

879
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:16,480
Perception is a way to collect the sensory input, the sensor input of the airplane that comes in

880
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,680
the form of impingement and then translate it into an experience that gives you a sort of

881
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:27,440
at a glance view of what's around you. And we make all that vision. Now, what would be the

882
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,560
alternative? The alternative is that you're not dissociated. So you are a telepath. Now,

883
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,920
if you're a perfect telepath, it would be impossible to survive. Imagine a telepath in the middle

884
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:44,720
of a roused political oriented crowd, you become completely dysfunctional. So what you need is to

885
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:53,280
have a sort of not direct at a glance view of what's going on. So you see people agitated,

886
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:59,040
but you don't get overwhelmed by it. You have a dashboard representation of the mental states

887
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:04,400
that are outside, but you're not directly experiencing those mental states or that would

888
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:10,720
be the end of your dissociation. So that's what perception is. Perception is the way evolution

889
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:18,480
has found to allow our inner mental states inside the dissociative boundary to be modulated

890
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:24,800
by external mental states that impinge on our dissociative boundary. And what we call the

891
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,320
physical world is basically the contents of the screen of perception. And physical quantities,

892
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:39,200
such as meters, coulombs, seconds, these are descriptions of the representations.

893
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:46,640
So the hierarchy you get is that real states are mental states out there beyond your dissociative

894
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:52,640
boundary. Physical states are inner cognitive representations of these external mental states.

895
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:59,040
And physical quantities are descriptions of these cognitive representations of this inner

896
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:08,480
physical sort of physical state. So life is what dissociation looks like. Death is the end

897
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,280
of dissociation. There is still an external world that you cannot change just by doing

898
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,600
your morning affirmations. Otherwise, believe me, my world would have changed already long ago.

899
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:24,000
Science is still valid. Science is a way to model and predict the behavior of the

900
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,920
external mental states. It says nothing about what those states are. That's not part of the

901
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:34,800
scientific methodology. It's only part of the methodology of people who are very confused

902
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,320
about the difference between science and philosophy. And often they are science spokespeople,

903
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:45,600
people who don't do science just talk about it. Yeah, that's it.

904
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:54,320
I mean, that's a wonderfully in-depth summary of it all. Overall, I think that for people who

905
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,920
want to listen to this further and find out more about it, they should definitely go watch the

906
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,720
essential course because this is definitely a crash course. But I think let's move on to chapter

907
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:08,800
five because you've already dived quite deep into analytical idealism at this point. Chapter five is

908
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,040
we're reviewing empirical evidence from the fields of foundations of physics and neuroscience

909
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:17,600
of consciousness, which seems to directly contradict mainstream physicalism and suggest

910
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,640
the validity of analytic idealism. So one of these things we already touched upon,

911
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:29,840
which is the physical entities do not have standalone reality. They are produced out of

912
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,240
an act of measurement. And this is very easy to understand with the dashboard metaphor.

913
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:41,680
If physicality is what appears on the dashboard, if the airplane sensors don't make a measurement,

914
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:49,680
then the dashboard shows nothing. Is it so complicated to understand? It's not magical,

915
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:55,840
it's not quantum, oh my god, quantum mysterious. No, there are no physical entities unless you

916
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:01,280
measure for exactly the same reason that the dashboard dials show nothing unless they are

917
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:07,680
plane sensors, measure. What we have to abandon is this notion that the external world is the

918
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:13,360
physical world. It isn't. The external world is what's measured. The physical world is the

919
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:20,800
representation of the measurement results on the dashboard. So physical experiments have shown

920
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:28,720
already, unless you believe in egregiously gratuitous and inflationary science fiction,

921
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:37,680
like avaration, multiverses, or the magical undetermined hidden variables of super determinism,

922
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:44,080
unless you're prepared to entertain fantasy, experimental evidence has refuted the standalone

923
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:51,280
existence of physical entities. And neuroscience of consciousness now has a number of examples

924
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:57,440
that show a inverse correlation between brain activity and the richness and intensity of experience.

925
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:02,560
The most famous one is of course psychedelics. You have the richest, most intense experience of

926
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:10,320
your life while the activity of your brain has only reduced with respect to the baseline.

927
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:18,800
But there is more. Pilots undergoing g-force training in centrifuges, they pass out. But when

928
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:26,240
they come round, they report, and I will quote, memorable dreams. In other words, what we take

929
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:33,200
to be unconscious is just unresponsiveness. Those people are not unconscious at all. They are

930
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:43,280
experiencing memorable dreams. Or another example, acquired savant syndrome. People who suffer accidents

931
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:49,840
or are shot in the head or suffer head trauma, they suddenly become capable of incredible

932
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:57,200
mathematical feats, or they start composing music like professional composers, even though

933
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:02,640
they have no training, or they become exquisite artists. So that's another instance of impaired

934
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:09,200
brain function leading to broader consciousness. Or Vietnam war veterans, that's a study from 2016,

935
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:17,600
war veterans, more than 100 of them were studied, damage to specific parts of the brain is correlated

936
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:25,440
with a much higher propensity to so-called spiritual or religious insight. A more prospective study

937
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:31,360
was done in Italy in 2010, in which people who were to undergo operations for the removal of

938
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:37,600
brain tumors, they were studied for an index called self-transcendence, your ability to identify

939
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,560
to something bigger than yourself. They were scored for that before and after surgery. And

940
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:50,880
after surgery, which always causes damage in surrounding cerebral tissue, spiritual self-transcendence,

941
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:57,440
the index of self-transcendence is much higher. So people have a broader deeper experience of life,

942
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:05,840
despite impairment of brain function. Or even trivial things, like choking. In Asia,

943
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:11,200
worldwide, have figured out, and this is a very dangerous thing, that partial strangulation

944
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,240
can give you a psychedelic trip. You can go to other dimensions, speak to alien beings,

945
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:23,280
fathomable experience, just by partial strangulation. Of course, some of them die because, turned out,

946
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:31,040
they actually get strangulated. But strangulation, which reduces blood flow to the brain and therefore

947
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:36,880
reduces metabolism, a generalized reduction of brain metabolism, leads to much richer and

948
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:45,200
intenser experience. I could go on and on and on, but this shows that experience is not caused by

949
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:50,240
brain activity, because there are cases in which brain activity reduces and experience increases,

950
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:55,280
and both happen in significant amounts, significant degrees. So what this shows us,

951
01:42:55,280 --> 01:43:01,200
is that brain activity is what experience, inner experience looks like. And unlike the cause of

952
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:05,760
a phenomenon, the appearance of a phenomenon doesn't need to be complete. It doesn't need to

953
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,320
tell everything there is to know about the phenomenon. For instance, I see an appearance

954
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,680
of you right now, but I can't see what's underneath your skin. I don't know what's on your back.

955
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:21,440
I can't see the details of your metabolism. Your appearance correlates with what you are,

956
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,000
you're conscious in your life, but it doesn't tell me everything there is to know about that.

957
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,560
In the exact same way, brain activity correlates with your conscious in your life, but doesn't

958
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,040
tell you everything there is to know about conscious in your life. If it were a cause,

959
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:42,320
it would need to. There cannot be anything to a phenomenon, but what you can trace back to its

960
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:47,280
causes. But an appearance doesn't need to be complete, and that's why in all these instances,

961
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,720
you have experience that cannot be traced back to brain activity.

962
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,920
I mean, you've given so many different neuroscience of consciousness examples there.

963
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,680
I mean, I'm definitely not going to say, or be one of those guys is going to say,

964
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,960
I'll find each paper and put the link down below. Anyone listening and watching?

965
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:08,880
I have done that already. Although you are not one of those guys, there are many of those guys

966
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,280
out there. Yeah, that's fine. Now I'm talking about for the audience, if they want to find those

967
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,040
things, they're just going to have to Google it and research it on their own. Oh, if you go to

968
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:24,080
which chapter was it? Chapter five? Chapter five, yes. So if you go to the description of that video,

969
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:28,880
and it's not all because there are just too many, but it's a couple of dozen there. At some point,

970
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,960
I thought this should be enough for the worst skeptic at this point. Okay, no, then I'll definitely

971
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,280
have that like ready for them. Within that, something I thought about while you were talking,

972
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,920
but otherwise, because part of it was the fields of foundations of physics. Well,

973
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,920
I don't think we touched on this, but what do you think about Penrose's and Stuart Hameroff's

974
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:54,400
quantum consciousness theory? I don't think it, I think it was a valid attempt,

975
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:59,280
but I don't think it pans out. No, but Penrose's objective collapse,

976
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:08,480
I think it looks at things the wrong way. And now I'm in extremely dangerous territory because

977
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:16,720
I'm about to criticize a physics Nobel Prize winner. But sometimes physicists get sidetracked

978
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:23,280
by wrong or unexamined philosophical assumptions. And for those, I am a bit of an authority.

979
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:33,440
So what I'm about to say, I say with humble humility towards Penrose because I have profound

980
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:40,640
admiration for him more than respect. But we are all humans, nobody gets it perfect.

981
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:46,640
So, and I'm too committed to truth to not say what a few needs to be said just because of my

982
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:54,560
extraordinary respect for Sir Roger. I don't think there is such a thing as collapse.

983
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:04,240
I think collapse is a merely operational concept that allows us to operationalize

984
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:09,520
experiments and talk about them, but it doesn't reflect an actual element of reality.

985
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:16,400
I don't think anything collapses in reality. And therefore objective collapse is an illusion

986
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:21,600
because there isn't collapse to begin with. And I think Sir Roger started from the assumption

987
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:27,920
of collapse because operationally, it's useful. You know, you have a quantum system in a superposition.

988
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:38,240
If you touch it, it will deco here and collapse. So that's what we experience doing science. So I

989
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:46,880
understand the tendency to try to take it for a fact, an objective event. I don't think it is.

990
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:54,000
I don't think, if you have specialist viewers, they will now raise all kinds of questions.

991
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,320
So at least continue a little bit more, at least to give an impression to people that

992
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,160
I have thought about it. Maybe I didn't give you a complete answer, but I have thought about that.

993
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:10,800
Decoherence is not collapse. What we take to be collapse is merely decoherence.

994
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:18,000
But decoherence is such a marked effect that we think collapse really exists. So what do I

995
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,360
think is happening? What is decoherence? Let's start like that. Okay, if you have a microscopic

996
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:28,240
quantum system in a superposition, that superposition has information.

997
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:36,720
When you touch that quantum system with a classical apparatus, the information in the

998
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:47,280
superposition will sort of leak into the classical environment. In other words, you can no longer

999
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:54,480
see the superposition. But the superposition is not lost. That information didn't go away.

1000
01:47:55,040 --> 01:48:01,600
It just became diluted in the classical environment, the moment you touched the quantum system.

1001
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:08,960
So nothing collapses. The superposition still exists in the broader classical environment,

1002
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:14,320
but you can't perceive it for the same reason that you cannot perceive a drop of ink in the ocean.

1003
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:22,560
When you drop ink in the ocean, the droplet didn't disappear. It didn't collapse out of

1004
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:28,640
existence. The information in the droplet and its molecules, properties of its molecules,

1005
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:35,120
it's still there. It's just diluted and dispersed in a much broader context. So that's

1006
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:41,040
decoherence. You lose your ability to see the information in the superpositions. If you run

1007
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:46,000
an interference experiment, you will not see an interference anymore, because it's now diluted

1008
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,640
in the classical context. What decoherence does not tell you is how the classical context

1009
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:58,480
became classical to begin with. Because the whole thing is based on this notion that the

1010
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:03,760
laboratory equipment and the laboratory itself is classical. But if everything is quantum,

1011
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:09,920
how did that become classical to begin with? That's where we need to review our understanding

1012
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:15,920
of foundations of physics. But the point I'm trying to make for now is that what passes for

1013
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:23,040
collapse is merely decoherence. Nothing truly collapses. The question we need to answer is how

1014
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:32,000
things appear classical to begin with. Okay, interesting. I wanted to ask you about this,

1015
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,120
but I was considering just moving on to the next one, but I was going to ask about the

1016
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:45,280
last one regarding superdeterminism. Oh yeah, I had a debate with Zabine Hossenfalder a while ago.

1017
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:54,960
How do I describe that without coming across in a way that I don't want to?

1018
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,600
I think I read your paper about it already.

1019
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:09,520
I can repeat some of the criticisms I made of superdeterminism towards Zabine. If you link

1020
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:14,240
the video, then people can go back or I wrote about it as well. You wrote about it. I'll put it

1021
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:24,720
in the details. But in a nutshell, what superdeterminism tries to account for is the measurement

1022
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:30,160
problem. For instance, the correlations between Bob's measurements and Alice's measurements,

1023
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:35,120
even though Alice and Bob cannot communicate and the particles were already in flight for a while,

1024
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:40,960
so the particles couldn't communicate with one another either. Superdeterminism tries to address

1025
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:49,840
that by saying that the statistical character of an individual quantum measurement, which cannot

1026
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:56,240
be determined, when you make a single quantum measurement, the outcome is random, all you can

1027
01:50:56,240 --> 01:51:02,000
determine is a law of large numbers. If you make enough measurements, then we know the statistic

1028
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,880
distribution of the results. But for individual results, they are random. In other words, they

1029
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:12,640
violate the determinism. What superdeterminism says is that, no, there is no violation of

1030
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:19,120
determinism. We just cannot predict the outcome of a single measurement because there are variables

1031
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:26,880
involved that we don't measure, that we know nothing about. It's those hidden variables

1032
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:34,720
that actually determine everything. That's then extrapolated to account for the whole of quantum

1033
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:40,560
mechanics and preserve notions such as physical entities do have standalone existence. The correlations

1034
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,920
between Alice and Bob's measurements is just because these hidden variables are not spatially

1035
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:52,720
located, so they provide a kind of instantaneous transmission of information that causes the

1036
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:03,040
correlations. If you go a little bit deeper into this general idea and try to explore

1037
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:08,560
what it means in practice, what you get is the following. I will use a metaphor, but the metaphor

1038
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:15,040
really corresponds to the technicality of the thing. What is being postulated here is the following.

1039
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,920
If you were, suppose you are an astronomical photographer and you want to make a picture of

1040
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:27,440
the moon at night, so you take your camera out to your backyard, you put it on a tripod,

1041
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:34,400
you point it at the moon, and then you program the parameters of the camera, such as exposure,

1042
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:43,440
exposure time, and aperture. What superdeterminism says is that what the moon is

1043
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:52,160
depends on the settings of your camera. If you change the exposure, you change the aperture,

1044
01:52:53,280 --> 01:53:02,160
the moon will change. The settings of your experimental apparatus determines what the

1045
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:10,080
thing that you measure is. How does it do that? Hidden variables. We don't know,

1046
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:17,920
but that's what it does. Why is this interesting in order to preserve materialism? For the following

1047
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:26,320
reason. If you believe that your camera settings change the moon itself, then whatever your photo

1048
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:33,120
shows will be consistent with your theory, because the photo that comes out is no longer

1049
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:38,800
an objective representation of the thing measured. It is now a representation of your

1050
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:44,400
experimental settings. Nothing is objective anymore. Everything depends on experimental

1051
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:51,040
settings, because your experimental settings will change what things are via these hidden causal

1052
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:58,240
chains. Worse yet, even if you postulate a theoretical entity such as hidden variables

1053
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:04,960
that have not been shown yet to exist, for which there is no evidence, even in that case, the minimum

1054
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:13,040
that is expected from a decent scientist is to specify what it is that you're postulating to

1055
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:21,680
exist. Not to just say hidden variables, but tell me something more. More or less, what is

1056
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:29,040
it supposed to be? Where am I supposed to find it? What would be the physical parameters under

1057
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:34,320
which I could expect to measure them or to find them? Give me something to give you a concrete

1058
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:42,240
example. When Higgs predicted the Higgs boson in the 60, Peter Higgs, there was zero evidence for

1059
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:49,440
the Higgs boson, but he told us what was the expected energy level. He told us what it was

1060
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:57,840
expected to decay into so we could know what to find. He told us the circumstances and parameters

1061
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:03,280
and conditions under which we could expect to produce it. He gave us the ranges of different

1062
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:09,440
physical properties of the Higgs boson. No evidence for it, but he told us what the Higgs boson was

1063
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:14,320
supposed to be if you postulate a theoretical entity. At the very least, you have to specify

1064
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:18,880
what it's supposed to be so people can look for it. And sure enough, we went looking for it and we

1065
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:25,520
found it. By the way, we found it within the range that Peter Higgs predicted. It was not

1066
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:31,920
being in the middle of it. It was a little higher on the energy level, but it was within range.

1067
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,320
This is science. But Zabine, she doesn't even begin to tell you what it's supposed to be.

1068
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:44,880
So how does she define hidden variables? Well, hidden variables are whatever is necessary to be

1069
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:51,360
in nature such that I can continue to believe in materialism and determinism. That's not science.

1070
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,600
And during the debate, she told me now she did determine the hidden variables. She even referred

1071
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:04,640
to a paper. And I believed her. I thought, well, then I failed in my homework. She determined it

1072
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:11,040
somewhere. Turned out that she just, well, I'll just say it. She just lied to my bloody face.

1073
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:16,560
And it was an outright lie because I went to the paper she mentioned. And there is no such a thing

1074
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:22,560
down there. The paper was a toy model of hidden variables, which was never meant to apply to

1075
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,400
reality. It was a mathematical exercise. So they could train about writing the equations.

1076
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:36,880
Path integrals. Zabine's path integral for super determinism has a term called

1077
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:44,000
quantumness, which is supposed to be minimized. And it's like, come on. I mean, this isn't

1078
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,320
theory. This isn't science. This is hand waving. And in the very paper she referred to, the first

1079
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:59,280
author of, who was not her, he says at the end, this is just a toy exercise. The hidden variables

1080
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:04,640
we are specifying here cannot exist in reality because we are violating several things we know

1081
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:12,640
to apply in reality. So it is, so far it may change. Somebody may specify coherently some

1082
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:17,760
hidden variables and give us ranges and give us something that we can work with. But right now,

1083
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:26,000
it's a kind of unfalsifiable religion. It's something that is defined in terms of which

1084
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:33,440
what you want, in terms of what you want to believe nature to be or how you want to,

1085
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:38,240
how you want nature to behave. So you don't say what the hidden variable is. You just say,

1086
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:42,160
there is something that does whatever needs to be done so I can continue to believe what I believe.

1087
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:48,320
This isn't science. It borders on the unethical, in my opinion.

1088
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:55,280
At least it has a cool name, super determinism. It's a pretty nice name.

1089
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,720
I think let's move on to chapter six, Bernardo. So in this chapter, we're going to discuss the

1090
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:05,600
distinction between phenomenal consciousness and meta consciousness, arguing the so-called

1091
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,000
unconscious reflects merely a lack of the latter, not the former.

1092
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:18,560
So phenomenal consciousness is present when there is experience. I'll give you an example.

1093
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:25,600
Right now, everybody listening to this is experiencing their breathing. They are experiencing

1094
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:30,960
the air going into the lung, the dilation of the rib cage. They are experienced. They are

1095
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:38,960
flowing through their nostrils. But they, right before I said it, they didn't know that they

1096
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,680
were experiencing their breathing. They were not telling themselves in their minds, oh, I'm now

1097
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:50,400
breathing. This can happen also with subtle forms of pain, especially with men. Men can be in pain

1098
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:57,200
for days that has happened to me. And only realize after days, oh, I've been feeling this pain for

1099
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:04,880
a while. So I was experiencing pain, but I couldn't report on my pain even to myself. I was experiencing

1100
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:10,880
my breathing, but I was not reporting on my breathing even to myself. So phenomenal consciousness

1101
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:18,640
requires the experience, the pain, the breathing, but not the report of the experience. When an

1102
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:24,240
experience is accompanied by the internal report, I am now having this experience that's now meta

1103
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:32,160
consciousness or conscious metacognition. That's your ability to introspectively assess the contents

1104
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:38,320
of your own mind and then describe them for yourself. Now we know these two things are separate at the

1105
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:44,480
very least. I mean, arguably, we have known this forever because it's very reasonable. And in the

1106
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:51,600
annals of philosophy, we have people talking about it without using the name. Nietzsche talked

1107
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:56,960
explicitly about the distinction between consciousness and metaconsciousness. So did Schopenhauer,

1108
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:05,760
so did Kierkegaard. So there's history about that. But technically, we've known since at least 2002

1109
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:13,120
that there is this distinction when Jonathan Schuller published a paper in which he showed

1110
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:19,280
that not only these two things are separate, they can even differ. You can have one experience

1111
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:23,440
and report on something else. There are dissociations between consciousness and meta

1112
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:27,440
consciousness, which is the title of the paper, dissociations between consciousness and meta

1113
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:37,440
consciousness. What often people talk about when they say consciousness, what they mean is

1114
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:44,640
metaconsciousness. The experience is that not only we have stuff that we not only experience, but that

1115
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:50,400
we know that we are experiencing them. In other words, it requires this higher level mental function

1116
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:57,520
called re-representation. An experience is already a representation. If you see a balloon in the sky,

1117
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,200
that balloon you perceive is an inner cognitive representation of external states of affairs.

1118
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:09,280
But when you tell yourself, I am experiencing a balloon now, you re-represent that inner

1119
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,800
cognitive representation, such that the re-representation points to the representation

1120
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:22,000
and say, that is happening. This re-representation is a higher level mental function that perhaps

1121
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,320
only humans have, and if other animals have only higher animals, pachyderms, cetaceans,

1122
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:36,720
other higher primates. But it's not there in earthworms. Probably it's not there in a cat.

1123
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:43,120
A cat's not going around saying, I feel hungry now. I have the experience of hunger. The difference

1124
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:48,000
between consciousness and metaconsciousness is the difference between, I am hunger,

1125
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:56,560
and I feel hungry. Because when you are not metaconscious, the experience is all there is.

1126
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:01,120
There isn't the subject who is having the experience. There is only the experience,

1127
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:05,760
so you are the hunger. But when you say, I am experiencing hunger right now, that's

1128
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:13,200
metaconsciousness right there. And humans are so big in this metaconsciousness business

1129
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,040
that we mistake it for raw consciousness itself.

1130
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:24,240
Yes. At some point, what are your thoughts? Because I remember the last time we spoke,

1131
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:28,880
we spoke about how David Chalmers perfectly framed the hard problem of consciousness for

1132
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:33,840
everyone, because that's the first step to getting a solution to a problem, framing it correctly.

1133
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,080
And then now we obviously started the metaproblem of consciousness.

1134
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,920
What were your thoughts when you came out with that infamous new line?

1135
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:50,880
The metaproblem of consciousness is why about 30% of people do not see the hard problem of

1136
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:57,520
consciousness, right? I'll talk about this. Just to conclude my previous thought,

1137
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,920
because I didn't connect it back to the storyline. The important thing about

1138
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,680
making this distinction between consciousness and metaconsciousness is that

1139
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:13,680
when we talk about unconscious states, we may actually be talking about non-metaconscious states.

1140
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:19,440
Under idealism, everything is a conscious state or a mental state. So there is no such a thing

1141
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:28,080
as unconsciousness. So how do we, how do we account for this nominally unconscious states?

1142
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:32,640
Well, we can account for them in two ways. One is they're not unconscious. They're just not

1143
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:37,920
metaconscious. And the other one is they are not unconscious. They're just not accessible to the

1144
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,680
reporting ego because of internal dissociative processes in inner dissociation. That's why we

1145
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:50,320
talk about unconsciousness. It's not that there is actual, there are actual states that are not

1146
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:57,200
conscious. It's just that those states are not accessible due to lack of metacognition or lack

1147
02:03:57,200 --> 02:04:02,400
of associative links. They're not accessible to reportability, even self-reportability.

1148
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,720
Now the metaproblem of consciousness is the problem of why a certain percentage of people

1149
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:16,880
do not see the hard problem of consciousness. Why they do not, they do not recognize its existence.

1150
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:24,960
The hard problem of consciousness is the following. There is nothing about physical parameters

1151
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:31,360
in terms of which we could in principle deduce the qualities of experience. In other words,

1152
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:36,080
there's nothing about the configuration or disposition of subatomic particles and fields

1153
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:41,520
in your brain in terms of which we could deduce in principle what it feels like to eat an apple

1154
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:50,000
or to have a bellyache or to experience a disappointment. There is no link between the two

1155
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:57,040
and I already gave you an explanation for why there is no link between the two. It's physical

1156
02:04:57,040 --> 02:05:03,440
parameters are descriptions. They are the map. But when you try to put the descriptions prior

1157
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:08,800
to the thing described, the lines in the map lose their meaning. They mean nothing. And if they mean

1158
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:13,200
nothing, of course you cannot account for the qualities of experience or deduce the qualities

1159
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:21,120
of experience from a map that means nothing. It's very clear. Now the problem is why do some

1160
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:26,240
people not understand this? Some people think that there is no hard problem of consciousness,

1161
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:34,800
that it's perfectly reasonable that the physical parameters of your brain as a material object

1162
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:44,160
lead to conscious experience. I have theories about this. There are different reasons why

1163
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:48,960
some people don't recognize it. I think the leading reason is that they do not understand

1164
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:55,840
what physicalism means or entails. They do not understand physicalism. And that's something

1165
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:03,840
that I discovered by personal interactions with friends of mine who are very technically capable,

1166
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:11,120
very erudite people, not philosophers, engineers, scientists. They do not understand physicalism.

1167
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:17,600
I had a friend a couple of years ago here in my backyard and we were having a beer in my backyard.

1168
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:23,600
And at some point I sort of got lost in my own thoughts and I made a comment out loud which

1169
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:28,960
was basically an inner thought. I said, look at this garden. I have several trees in my backyard

1170
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:38,880
and lots of plants. Under physicalism, all of this is inside your head. Why did I say that?

1171
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:43,520
Because under physicalism, the qualities of perception are created by your brain inside your

1172
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:50,320
head. The green of my garden is inside your head. Oh yeah, there is stuff out there in my garden,

1173
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:54,720
but it has no qualities. It's a set of mathematical equations floating in a vacuum.

1174
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:59,760
It's the best way you can visualize that. All the qualities that I associate with my garden,

1175
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:04,640
they are supposed to be produced by my brain inside my skull. So they own my garden as I perceive,

1176
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:10,000
is supposed to exist inside my head, which is absurd. And I made that comment. And my friend

1177
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
jumped. He has a doctorate in computer science. He jumped and said, what nonsense? Physicalism

1178
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,440
says no such a thing. Of course, your garden is out there. And then it dawned on me that many

1179
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:27,360
people who identify as physicalists do not understand physicalism. They think that the

1180
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:32,560
only thing that is inside your head are endogenous experiences like thoughts,

1181
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:40,400
fantasies, emotions. But that perceptual experience is really out there. No, that's not

1182
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:46,160
physicalism. Physicalism says that perceptual experiences too are inside your head.

1183
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:48,400
Is that not naive realism?

1184
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:55,840
Yeah, it's a form of naive realism. So I think it's my suspicion that

1185
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:01,280
many people who do not recognize the hard problem fail to do so because they do not

1186
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:07,200
understand physicalism. If they truly understood physicalism, they would have to acknowledge

1187
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:12,000
that there is an impassable bridge between quantities and qualities.

1188
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,320
Fernando, anything else you want to touch on between that distinction between phenomenal

1189
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:21,680
and meta consciousness and the unconscious relation? Good to go. Good to go. Okay. So the

1190
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:27,680
closing part of the chat of this crash course on analytic idealism, we respond to any objections

1191
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:34,080
that you found most most appealing, most convincing, close to convincing you otherwise.

1192
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:37,920
And then obviously you can leave us with some personal reflections about idealism in life.

1193
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:43,680
Many of the objections are based on a misunderstanding of idealism. For instance,

1194
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:51,760
some time ago, some Harris was at the Lex Friedman podcast, and he was asked a question

1195
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:56,080
about idealism. And I will paraphrase his answer. I don't remember the words exactly,

1196
02:08:56,080 --> 02:09:02,800
but his answer was like, you know, the notion that all of this out there, the cosmos is in my

1197
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:10,560
mind is obviously nonsensical. And I was appalled by that because here's someone who brandishes

1198
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:17,920
a degree in philosophy from Stanford University. And idealism is part of the ABC 123 canon of

1199
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:26,320
philosophy. And he didn't know what idealism is. It's farcical, almost. If that's your

1200
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:31,600
misunderstanding of idealism, then as per your misunderstanding, idealism is not true.

1201
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:38,240
But the idealism you're talking about is your own delusion about what it means. It's not a real

1202
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:44,640
idealism. To most of the criticisms are based on these kinds of misunderstandings, and they can

1203
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:50,960
come from people even who brandish a philosophy degree from Stanford University. Now ignorance

1204
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:56,240
suffixed by the latter's PhD is the worst form of ignorance because it's plausibly believable.

1205
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:07,520
Yes. Other criticisms are based on assumptions that people make without knowing that they are

1206
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:13,920
making them. For instance, the criticism that often come that I often hear from very highly

1207
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:20,160
educated people is the following. Bernardo, if I have a needle and I stick it in your arm,

1208
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:28,880
that physical process of a needle piercing your skin will lead, will cause the mental

1209
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:35,520
process called pain, and you will withdraw your arm. So here we go, a direct arrow of causation

1210
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:40,720
from a physical process to a mental process. Ergo, mental processes are not fundamental,

1211
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:47,520
and idealism is not true. Now, do you see the strawman here? Under idealism, there are no

1212
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:56,640
non-mental processes. Under idealism, that needle piercing your skin is a dashboard representation

1213
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:03,600
of a mental process, a mental process that impinges so strongly on your dissociative boundary

1214
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:10,000
that it directly modulates in inner states within the dissociative boundary. We call that pain,

1215
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:17,840
but the whole thing is mental. The needle or the glass of alcohol that you drink,

1216
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:25,360
those are dashboard representations of transpersonal mental processes that impinge or even pierce

1217
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:30,560
your dissociative boundary. So the arrow of causation is not from physical to mental,

1218
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:36,800
it's from mental to mental, and that mental processes causally affect other mental processes

1219
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:42,320
of a different type. It's trivial. Your thoughts modulate your emotions every day. You have a

1220
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:47,360
bad thought, look how you feel, or if you're feeling bad, pay attention to your thoughts.

1221
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:52,800
Your emotions modulate, causally modulate your thoughts every day. Mental processes

1222
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:57,840
causally impinge on other mental processes. This is trivial, there is nothing extraordinary about

1223
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:03,200
it. So that needle causing pain is just an instance of that, a transpersonal mental process

1224
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:09,280
piercing through your dissociative boundary and causally impacting your inner mental processes,

1225
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:13,440
we call that pain, or you could call that something positive in the case of a caress,

1226
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:20,160
but that hand caressing your skin, that too is the dashboard representation of a mental process

1227
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:27,280
that is impinging on your dissociative boundary. Finally, there is a deeper type of criticism

1228
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:36,400
that I already talked about, which is based on this notion that under idealism,

1229
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:40,720
there is only one field of subjectivity, that's how we avoid the combination problem. We start

1230
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:45,600
from something that is already universal, and now all you have to explain is the appearance

1231
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:50,720
of separation, which lo and behold is very easy to do because we have an empirically established

1232
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:56,240
phenomenon in nature called dissociation that does exactly that. So we escape all of these

1233
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:00,800
discussions about the conceivability of a hypothesis, forget conceivability, it's an

1234
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,280
empirical reality, whether you can coherently conceive of it or not, it's your problem,

1235
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:10,640
don't make epistemology with ontology, dissociation exists, whether we understand it or not,

1236
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:17,600
but you still have this one field of subjectivity and a frequent criticism against it is this

1237
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:24,960
notion that we are compound organisms made of parts, made of cells, therefore our consciousness

1238
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:31,200
must be compound, it cannot be just one dissociative process in a big unity, it has to be something

1239
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:38,080
that forms from parts, but I already discussed the fallacy here is to think of human beings as

1240
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:44,080
assembled as opposed to grown. Tell me, did you touch on, I'm trying to think if you did touch

1241
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:50,800
on the difference between solipsism and idealism, did you touch on that? There is a lot of confusion

1242
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:59,280
out there with these words, solipsism, so the strict definition of solipsism is the view that you

1243
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:07,440
are the only conscious entity that exists and that everything in the world, in the universe,

1244
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:12,960
is your own dream, that the other people you see, they are figments of your imagination,

1245
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:19,440
there is nothing it's like to be other people, there is only something it's like to be you

1246
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:24,640
seeing other people, in other words, other people are just shells with no ghost inside,

1247
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:30,320
they don't have their own conscious perspective, they're just images you produce in your own

1248
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:38,160
dreamy mind. Solipsism is a non-starter, it's not something that can be discussed because if you

1249
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:42,880
are a believer in solipsism and you're consistent with it, you're never going to defend it,

1250
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,160
you're never going to talk about it because you're just talking to yourself.

1251
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:49,760
Do you argue with solipsists often?

1252
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:57,760
A true solipsist will not argue, what is his name?

1253
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:08,160
Alan Watts, he made a joke once, imagine a conference of solipsists,

1254
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:16,000
each one of them thinks that everybody else is an illusion, why would they go to their conference?

1255
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:20,560
Why would you defend solipsism to someone else? These other persons are supposed to be a figment

1256
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:26,640
of your own imagination, who are you talking to? So there is no, there is no debate around

1257
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:36,000
solipsism, Bertrand Russell in the early 20th century he said, people who maintain to believe

1258
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:44,080
in solipsism actually act in contradiction to that professed belief, they don't act consistently

1259
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:47,120
with that professed belief, in other words they aren't really solipsists.

1260
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:55,040
You see, solipsism is unfalsifiable because every evidence pro or against solipsism

1261
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:59,920
is construed by the solipsist as a figment of their own imagination,

1262
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:08,800
but it is not the most reasonable explanation and I'm not going to get into why, there is a line

1263
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:14,800
of argument that shows you that solipsism is not the most reasonable explanation and it has to do

1264
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:21,600
with observing other people behavior that is caused by emotions or experiences that you haven't yet

1265
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:28,880
had, so therefore you could not have imagined them and therefore solipsism is not the best

1266
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:33,680
explanation, but that's strictly speaking solipsism and it's completely different from idealism,

1267
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:39,440
a solipsist would say other people are not conscious, they only exist as shells that I imagine,

1268
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:43,440
an idealist would say other people are dissociative processes in the mind of nature,

1269
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:47,120
there is something that is like to be them, they have their own conscious point of view too,

1270
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:53,760
a solipsist would say there are no external states of the world, this is all my personal

1271
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:59,920
dream, they are all inner states, an idealist, an objective idealist would say no, no, there is

1272
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:06,400
really an external world out there that is not in my mind, but that external world is also mental,

1273
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:12,960
it's not in my mind but it's mental, just like your thoughts are mental but they are not in my mind,

1274
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:20,880
they are external to me, so yeah these are, there's a glaring spectacular differences

1275
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:26,640
between solipsism and idealism, things get confused when people use the term solipsism

1276
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:31,840
in a non-rigorous manner, I have a friend for instance who talks about cosmic solipsism,

1277
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:37,120
he says no, no, there is really just one mind and it's dreaming this whole thing up

1278
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:43,840
and I admit that you are it too and that's non-dualism, that's eastern non-dualism

1279
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:51,200
and and this is idealism indeed, but it's not solipsism strictly speaking, cosmic solipsism is

1280
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:57,440
idealism, why will we use two words instead of one, just call it idealism and by calling it

1281
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:03,360
cosmic solipsism you create confusion with this strict definition of solipsism, so I steer away

1282
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:09,440
from it, I disclaim everything that has the word solipsism because acquiescing to it is conducive

1283
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:16,240
to confusion, and I do think they're really so closely associated in the sense that people mistake

1284
02:18:16,560 --> 02:18:22,240
the two views that you should actually do that, it's a good way to avoid that, any other objections

1285
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:27,600
Bernardo or do you think you've covered them all? Oh certainly not, oh well all the main ones at least,

1286
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:32,720
the ones that are slightly convincing, yeah the ones that came to my mind the quickest I have covered

1287
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:37,040
them, okay not great, so then I think the closing parts obviously, I know you're not a mystic, I

1288
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,160
know you're not someone who's very spiritual, you're not very spiritually inclined, you don't

1289
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:45,520
like giving that type of advice or opinions on it, but your closing personal reflections on

1290
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:49,520
idealism and life in general, and then we can conclude this crash course on

1291
02:18:54,080 --> 02:19:00,160
idealism is the most self-evident, obvious, intuitive, natural, and empirically adequate

1292
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:07,600
worldview that we could have, and we just took a wrong path because of social political reasons

1293
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:16,800
in the early Enlightenment, we started believing our own snake oil, there was a reason for coming

1294
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:22,560
up with this fiction of materialism at that time, it was a social political reason, and then we

1295
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:28,160
started mistaking our own fantasies, social political tools for realities, and this has

1296
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:33,600
brought us where we are, and you might say well it's been a long time, no less than two centuries,

1297
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:41,440
it's nothing, it's the blink of an eye in the cultural history of humanity, we will overcome

1298
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:48,480
this, we put our foot in the wrong place, we will overcome, we'll bring our feet back to the path,

1299
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:54,880
and we'll continue to go forward, and it will be a historical blip, that's all there will be to

1300
02:19:54,880 --> 02:20:02,240
physicalism in the future, so don't think for a moment that because physicalism is mainstream,

1301
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:11,200
that this and of itself makes it extraordinarily plausible, because throughout human history,

1302
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:20,080
the mainstream has always been wrong, at least throughout western history, the mainstream has

1303
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:25,840
always been wrong, we have absolutely no reason to think that miracle upon miracle right now,

1304
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:33,200
for the first time it will be right, it will not, it is not, the plausibility of physicalism

1305
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:41,680
is a cultural artifact, it has been manufactured by people who are born and are told that physical

1306
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:46,800
is true from their school teachers, their parents, their family doctors, and the eight o'clock news

1307
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:51,760
anchor, and they think I don't need to think about these metaphysical questions, because all

1308
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:56,800
these people who were alive before I was even born, they already did the thinking for me,

1309
02:20:56,800 --> 02:21:01,600
they arrived at this conclusion, and this conclusion apparently bases all science,

1310
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:08,720
so it must be true, and people like Bernardo Castro, they're just taking too much psychedelics,

1311
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:16,720
right, too many drugs, I haven't taken psychedelics in years now, but it's very easy to come at this

1312
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:23,760
conclusion, and very tempting, because it's the lazy conclusion, it's the conclusion that doesn't

1313
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:30,880
put the responsibility on your shoulder to be critical about your own beliefs, in that sense

1314
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:35,680
it's attractive like a religion, it gives you the answers without asking you to do any of the hard

1315
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:41,040
work, now in the second half of life this comes back to bite you, because believing in it becomes

1316
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:46,720
in a personal habit, and it's very difficult to part from it once it has become a personal habit,

1317
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:52,880
and in the second half of life it's a terrible thing to believe in, because it gives you the

1318
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:59,040
picture that the universe is dead, and life has absolutely no meaning, that if all of everything

1319
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:04,800
you learn, all of your hard-earned lessons, the product of the suffering you had to undergo

1320
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,240
throughout life, all of those are supposed to be physical brain states that lose their coherence

1321
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:17,200
once you die, and therefore it's all for bloody nothing, all for nothing, don't think that when

1322
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:24,000
you're 28, but when you're 48 you start, oh shit, now all this shit and it's for nothing,

1323
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:33,040
and then the way to get out of this completely unnecessary dilemma that leads to depression

1324
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:39,520
and anxiety is to review assumptions, but now those assumptions have become a lifelong habit,

1325
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:45,360
and it's very difficult to even see them, let alone revise them, but if you can revise them,

1326
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:55,680
if you can value your own individuality, your critical individuality as a worthy opponent to

1327
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:02,480
mainstream stories, if you have enough trust in yourself to trust your rationality,

1328
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:11,520
to a nico extent, as the story begins outside, you can demolish this artificial source of

1329
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:18,480
depression and anxiety, and realize that what there is is mind, and life is a configuration of

1330
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:23,920
mind, that configuration ends, your body disappears, you're no longer dissociated, but everything you

1331
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:32,000
learn through this terrible rollercoaster that we call life, which is exquisitely prone to suffering

1332
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:38,480
and pain, everything you learn, everything, all of your maturation process, all of your

1333
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:44,880
edification process as a suffering human being, it doesn't disappear, because at the end of the

1334
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:50,640
dissociation, the boundaries over, therefore, the mental contents of that dissociative process

1335
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:55,280
are now seeded in a much broader cognitive context, they are now seeded into nature at large,

1336
02:23:55,280 --> 02:24:02,400
and it wasn't all for nothing, if you can get to this point, it will not suffer a day

1337
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:10,000
of existential depression in your life anymore, what you will suffer again from is a kind of death

1338
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:20,640
anxiety that our ancestors knew very well, but we don't, what we fear is oblivion, which is a

1339
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:28,640
kind of existential anxiety, but we no longer fear what we will experience after the end of life,

1340
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,960
the great unknown, because we think we are not going to be there to experience it,

1341
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:39,280
so we are not fearful at all about the state of consciousness that comes after life,

1342
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:46,160
well, that's the bad news, that anxiety comes back, if your listeners have gone through an

1343
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:52,480
experience of ego dissolution through psychedelics, that's a sample of what might be coming,

1344
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:02,720
and there is some degree of dread about it, you know, you are going to exit the state of

1345
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:08,400
consciousness that you've experienced your whole life, which is where you feel comfortable,

1346
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:12,720
it's your safety zone, it's that state of consciousness where you can repress

1347
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:18,960
this stuff, you don't want to feel, you don't want to know, and with the end of that state of

1348
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:23,120
consciousness we call life, you may not be able to repress any of this shit anymore,

1349
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:32,800
and then what? Yeah, so your life will be very meaningful again, meaning will be permeating

1350
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:37,840
every single aspect of your life, whether you want it or not, whatever you do or don't in your life,

1351
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:44,640
it will still be immersed in meaning, and you cannot avoid it, but shit, when the time comes,

1352
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:53,840
maybe in your pants again, because yeah, I am afraid of that transition.

1353
02:25:53,840 --> 02:26:00,400
No, you're making me quite afraid right now, I mean, for someone who claims to not be as

1354
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,920
so a spiritual storyteller or mystic, that is quite mystical, I must say.

1355
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,280
Well, if we equate mysticism with

1356
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:20,320
human, human, being human with dealing with what it means to be human, such as our sense of meaning

1357
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:24,960
and our anxieties, then yeah, then everything is true. That's what I meant, that is what I meant,

1358
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:32,400
I didn't mean mystical. Yeah, I'm not spiritually in the sense of some external deity that is

1359
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:39,360
interfering with states of affairs in nature according to some premeditated plan, no,

1360
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:46,800
I don't think that applies. I think we're both the same in that regard, Bernardo, thank you so

1361
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:52,480
much, I mean, this was pretty cool, I was figuring out how we could do this, and I think this was

1362
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:56,240
the perfect approach, how are you feeling, anything you want to add to that, anything you

1363
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:02,160
want to say, final comment? That passed pretty quickly. Exactly, I mean, I looked at the time

1364
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:06,400
and I was actually quite surprised, but how are you feeling, everything you feel like you've got

1365
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:10,960
everything off your chest or is a good crash course, you're right. Yeah, I think we covered

1366
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:14,720
good ground. Yeah, thank you so much, Bernardo, for joining me again, I mean, I'll try and think

1367
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:20,880
outside the box for the next one. Sure, thanks for having me again, it's been a pleasure.

1368
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:24,720
It's been an absolute pleasure, cheers, Bernardo, thank you so much, crash course time.
