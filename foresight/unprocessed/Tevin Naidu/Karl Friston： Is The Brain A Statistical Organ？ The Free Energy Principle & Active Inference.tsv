0	15760	I've been reading your work for many years and you are someone who's managed to incorporate
15760	21440	so many different fields together. At this point, your free energy principle can be discussed
21440	25520	in fields of mathematics, physics, biology. It seems you've managed to cross all these
25520	29840	borders and I think it's perfect for this show. One thing I want to start off with is
30720	35040	when you think of the topic of the mind-body problem, you think of Rene Descartes and he
35040	41920	often said, I think therefore I am and you've now become synonymous with I am therefore I think.
41920	45200	I think let's start off with that because I think it's beautifully poetic considering this
45200	54160	podcast is called Mind-Body Solution. Yes, I do like that homage to Descartes.
54160	65040	So the cheekiness of the reversal is based upon the free energy principle read as a physicist
65040	73120	and effectively this is a description, a principle that will be applied to anything that exists
74560	82800	and the maths tells you that if something exists in a certain sense then it can be read
82800	91680	or interpreted as making inferences. So if you allow me to equate inferring with thinking,
91680	100480	that means to exist is to infer. So if I am therefore I think. So that's the genesis. It's
100480	110480	one of those down that it's strange inversions. Speaking to the slightly sort of deflationary
110480	116880	aspect of the free energy principle, it's a slightly tautological aspect. I think at that
116880	123040	point it would be a perfect opportunity to let's play with definitions. Let's talk about free energy
123040	128480	principle, a Bayesian brain and perhaps active inference. Let's play around with these definitions
128480	136080	before we move to a formalism of the free energy principle. Right, so they're all very closely
136080	143120	related. So defining the free energy principle, first of all, what is it? It's just a principle
143680	149360	of the kind that you would remember at school in physics like Hamilton's principle of least action.
151360	159840	And as such it is effectively a mathematical method. It's a method or a tool that you would apply
159840	167760	to a particular situation. And when applied to things like you and me, or in fact many other
167760	176720	animate things and biotic things, one gets an interpretation of the behavior of such things
176720	185840	in terms of active inference. The inference part is just a statement of sense making and
185840	191840	representation on the inside of the thing, where the thing in question can be a person
191840	198880	or a particle, it could be you or me. And that sense making speaks to making sense,
198880	206800	representing, explaining, inferring the causes of sensory impressions from everything else,
206800	215040	from the outside world. And the best or the most, if you like, inclusive way of understanding
215040	220640	that kind of inference and sense making, when applied to the brain would be the Bayesian brain
220640	229840	hypothesis. So the Bayesian brain hypothesis is the notion that we can understand our sense making
229840	237440	and to a certain extent with one commits to neuronal process theories, the underlying neurophysiology
237440	245520	neuronal dynamics, in terms of Bayesian belief updating, basically changing our physical,
245520	252400	biophysical states by neurodynamics to represent probabilistic beliefs, Bayesian subpersonal
252400	258640	beliefs, probabilistic beliefs about the causes of sensations. So that's inference, inference
259760	265200	loosely described under the Bayesian brain. Active inference is the simple move that you
266160	274000	acknowledge that the sensations upon which you're basing your inference are actively
274000	281280	sampled. You are in charge of the data that is subtending your inference. And that sort of
281280	287040	closes the loop between you as an inference machine, a statistical organ, or your brain,
287040	293600	at least as a statistical organ, and the world supplying that sensory evidence of those sensations.
294560	301520	And that story, that sort of closing the loop, an action perception kind of cycle,
302080	309520	a description of sentient behavior, appealing to the notions of active sensing and active learning
310880	317280	is one way of reading what comes out of the Fienta principle. So that's in my mind how
317760	322080	those things, how you triangulate amongst those three notions.
323360	328000	When we think about, I mean, obviously, as you said, they're all very linked. When you think
328000	333440	about the free energy principle, the formalism of it, do you think of energy minus entropy? And
333440	338240	then you obviously go into different aspects, surprise, divergence, then you discuss obviously
338240	344880	your internal states, hidden states, action perception, talk to us about how this formula
344880	349280	actually works. And how you, because a lot of people have noticed when they question you about
349280	354800	this theory, everyone comes from a specific field. So someone often tends to attack you from a
354800	360320	psychological perspective. Someone tends to talk to you from a biological perspective. How do you
360320	365840	navigate all these territories? And I think with that, I'd like to say that you, one of the few
365840	371200	people that I've noticed, who seems to be a genuine polymath in that regard, because you're always
371200	377200	able to answer these questions succinctly with a lot of definitions. And just beautifully, how do
377200	383760	you manage to do this? I have a lot of naughty and inquisitive students, so you get used to
385040	393360	answering questions after a while. Again, very gracious of you to say that. But it's not,
394240	403520	I don't think it's my wisdom. I think that ability to jump from different disciplines or just take
403520	409760	different perspective or views on what is probably the most important thing to all of us, which is
409760	417360	how do we work and why are we here? And is the gift of things like the free energy principle,
417360	421280	and the free energy principle, I'm not claiming that the free energy principle is just the current
421280	428080	formulation of millennia of thinking and physics and psychology and philosophy,
429200	435040	and probably nearly every other field, including behaviorism, economics and the like. So the whole
435040	444400	point of the free energy principle is that it is there to try and unify and to try and encompass
444400	450960	and thereby endorse all the various perspectives you could take upon scented behavior or choice,
452160	461200	the imperatives and write our decisions right through where do I look next in the next few
461200	471200	hundred milliseconds through to which school should I send my children to? And so the eclectic
471200	476000	aspect that is brought to the table by the free energy principle is just due to its fundamental
476000	482240	nature. It's a first principle account. And by definition, if it is a first principle account,
482240	488400	if it is applicable, then it should be applicable widely to various phenomena read or looked at
488400	496640	through the lens of an economist or a psychologist or a physicist or a philosopher. It's interesting
496640	506320	you say, oh, I talk about things like surprise information theory and entropy and intrinsic value.
506320	514240	You didn't actually say that, but I do talk about that. The whole charm of having a first
514240	521440	principle account that is sufficiently simple to write down mathematically is that you can see
521520	527040	that the same mathematical quantities mean different things to different people,
527040	532800	but they're all the same thing. So perhaps you're just to give you a couple of examples of them.
532800	538320	Underneath all of this is just basically a description of the states that I exist in,
538320	544800	those states that are characteristic of me. So how would I express that mathematically?
544800	552240	Well, I could just write down a function of any particular state that reflected how
552240	558720	characteristic it was of me. And that would be most commonly written down as a log probability
558720	563280	of me being in this state. Now, any log probability is basically a potential.
564240	570000	And if it's a potential, you can now read it in by analogy to thermodynamics.
570480	577120	That log probability of being in a particular state via me can also be read as a statistician,
577120	584720	and you can call that model evidence or in statistics marginal likelihood. If your information
584720	588560	theory would be called self-information, and the average of self-information is entropy.
589920	596000	If you were an economist, it would basically be the states that I aspire to. It would be description
596080	603280	of my attracting set, written as if you were a theorist dealing with vandal dynamical systems.
604160	611840	So now this same quantity now becomes an expression of utility or value. If you were
613440	618960	ET James, you would call it a constraint on the imperative to maximize the entropy,
619760	626720	and so on and so forth. So the key thing is that everybody's talking about exactly the same thing.
626720	633760	It's just that they've got different words from it. So the joy of sort of seeing that
635120	643120	central quantity under the hood being able to make sense to lots of different people
643120	651280	just is an expression of the explanatory scope of this kind of first principles account.
651280	653840	So everybody's right. They've just been using different words.
655200	661040	I think you're absolutely right. I think when people try to develop any theory or hypothesis,
661040	667040	it's always very important to sort of realize that we don't exist in a vacuum. There's so
667040	672560	many different fields of study that are studying the same things, but just defining them differently
673760	677920	discussing them very differently. But they all come together at some point and any good
677920	683840	theory needs to be able to explain these various expertise as well. There needs to be some sort
683840	688800	of a full explanatory version of all of these and there shouldn't be a gap and you manage to
688800	694400	bring these all together. When you talk about hierarchal Bayesian inference, it plays a very
694400	699840	central role in your work. And I remember when I was reading about this and doing computational
699920	704400	psychiatry as part of the blocks during my masters, I remember coming across your work and
704400	708640	thinking, this is so beautiful. This is the way you've managed to sort of incorporate this into
708640	713520	psychopathology is even more intriguing. Because I remember the first time I read about it and you
713520	719440	spoke about posterior and priors and the way it will dictate how someone experiences hallucinations,
719440	725440	delusions, and just general differences in their field of vision, etc. How did that come to you?
725840	730160	At what point did you manage to realize that this theory has a very active role to play in mental
730160	742000	health? Well, the answer is another strange inversion, I'm afraid. I started as a psychiatrist
743120	749680	and what used to be called a sort of mathematical psychologist or what I wanted to be a mathematical
749760	754640	psychologist. I think a clinical version of that is exactly as you say, a computational
754640	760000	psychiatrist. That phrase introduced by my friends, Reed Montague and Peter Diane,
761040	766240	has only been around for about half a decade. But now we're all computational psychiatrists.
766240	771120	So as a young man, I aspire to be a computational psychiatrist. So the free energy principle is
771120	778000	the denouement of that formalization. But I think it's a really important point you bring to the
778000	787440	table there. And I think there are two moves you have to make to appreciate the potential
787440	794000	applicability of things like the Bayesian brain of the free energy principle to the suffering
794000	799520	of patients that you might see in the health patients. The first move is to have a physics
799520	805520	of beliefs, a physics of inference, a physics of sense making, if you like, a physics of basic
805520	810800	sentence that is inactive. So it has to be sentient behavior. So it's all about choices
810800	817440	and decisions and how I move and indeed, how I control my autonomic reflexes, you know,
817440	823360	respond to my gut feelings and exert some sub personal control over my physiology and internal
823360	829680	learning. So that's the first thing that you have to have. You have to have a physics of
829680	838960	sentence. You have to have a mathematics that connects the foundations of our dynamics in a
838960	846800	physical world to the world of beliefs and inference and sense making and representation
847440	854320	in this inactive sense. So that's the first thing. Then once you've done that, you can then say, well,
854320	861360	okay, under what circumstances or what would it look like if this inference
862000	869120	went awry, was in some sense not fit for purpose with a particular world or eco niche or environment
869120	877760	or direct interpersonal relationship that this person was having to infer and to learn and to
878320	884880	actively navigate to deploy or active inference, for example. And then you get, I think, to
884880	893200	computational psychiatry. But that does depend upon committing to a view of all psychopathology
894080	900480	as intrinsically some kind of false inference. But it's a very natural view that if you just
900480	906560	think about hallucinations and delusions, for example, I mean, what are they? They are effectively
907120	913440	inferring something is there when it's not. So if you were a statistician, you'd say, oh,
913440	917200	yes, that's a type one error. That's just bad inference because you've got something wrong
917200	922320	with your standard error. But of course, you know that the standard error corresponds to the precision
922320	928480	in, say, predicted coding variants and the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which itself then
928480	935120	relates to synaptic gain and neuromodulation and the action of certain drugs. Similarly,
935200	941920	all neglect syndromes or in the old days would have been called dissociative or hysterical
941920	948640	syndromes. You know, again, read as false inference would simply mean I'm inferring
948640	955760	something is not there when it is. It's a type two error. And if you think about all the different
956320	963760	disorders and ways of suffering that people present within psychiatry and indeed quite a
963760	968000	lot of neurology as well, they can all be cast as some kind of false inference, you know,
969280	975760	dysmorpho-phobias, say, anorexia nervosa having false inferences about my body.
976880	984000	And even simple things like parking not simple, but awful things, but simple in the sense that they're
984000	990560	more motor and neurologically oriented conditions like Parkinson's disease, you could think of a
990560	998800	failure to infer and to realize my inferred intentions that I am now about to move. So
999760	1005040	you would make two moves. First of all, we've linked physics to belief updating and inference.
1005040	1014560	And then we've taken psychiatry as instances of a kind of aberrance or a kind of failure
1014560	1020640	of the inference and belief updating process. But I repeat, put it in an inactive context.
1020640	1024400	So you couldn't explain Parkinson's disease unless you talked about
1025520	1032880	aning as inference, you know, treating movement and an active engagement with the world as the
1033440	1040080	realization of inferred plans, things that I am likely to do next in this moment or indeed
1040160	1043360	again, choosing which school to send my children to.
1045040	1049920	I still remember there was one specific line that I quoted from one of your papers. I can't
1049920	1055520	remember the name of the paper, but you actually spoke about that phenomenon way. Someone who's
1055520	1060560	acutely psychotic, schizophrenic, when you look at these patients and you show them visual illusions,
1061520	1067200	you're able, they're able for some reason to see the reality of the situation, whereas we fall for
1067200	1072800	this trick. So in those cases, people often say that they're seeing the real reality, the vertical
1072800	1076640	truth, and we're not. Talk to me about this phenomenon, because I think it's quite intriguing
1076640	1080720	that they don't fall for it, but you, with the free energy principle, with your theory, you're
1080720	1088560	able to explain this with the brain as well. Yeah, no, it's a fascinating area. So there are
1088560	1098480	rare instances where psychopathology or any pathology can actually improve certain performance.
1099040	1104960	Of course, one has to qualify what one means by improved performance, but the particular example
1104960	1108880	you're talking about, I think is absolutely fascinating. And it's a resistance,
1110240	1115200	characteristically shown with certain people, either people on the spectrum or people with
1115280	1126560	schizophrenia or schizo-type approaches to life, that renders them uniquely resistant to the kind
1126560	1133920	of illusions that we all experience. And it's just worth noting, well, what's an illusion?
1133920	1138880	Well, it's a false inference, but why is it false? It's perfectly good from the point of
1138880	1145920	view of the person having the inference and having the presumed percept and qualitative experience.
1147680	1154960	However, the experimenter, the naughty experimenter who's deliberately crafted this stimulus
1155520	1161840	in a way which is so unlikely that they can now say, no, no, this is a false percept because
1161840	1167680	I know how it was caused. And the subject, I, for example, have completely the wrong idea,
1167680	1175120	the wrong inference about how it was caused. So it is a wonderful tool for people in psychophysics
1175120	1184080	to actually test how our inferences can fail in relation to the actual causes of our sensations.
1184080	1187920	But to put that another way around, what it does, it's a beautiful pro
1188560	1194000	of the prior beliefs that we bring to the table. So that, you know, going back to the notion of
1194000	1202240	the Bayesian brain, read simply, that means that we have at hand a number of hypotheses
1202240	1207360	that can explain the causes of this pattern of sensory, for example, visual information.
1208080	1212960	And we generate these hypotheses actively, say predictions in predictive coding,
1212960	1219840	and then we look at the adequacy of these predictions in explaining the sensory data.
1219840	1226000	So we're effectively little scientists. We are testing hypotheses against sensory data.
1226000	1233040	And if they're not good hypotheses, we will reject them and revise our hypotheses. And this is the
1233040	1241680	Bayesian belief updating that we were referring to previously. But that adjudication and that
1241760	1247760	updating rests upon your prior beliefs before you see some sensory data,
1249840	1256480	relative to the precision of those data that are going to move your prior beliefs to making
1256480	1261360	it to posterior beliefs after seeing the data. So we come back again to this notion,
1262320	1268960	and a key notion of the precision afforded your prior beliefs, the way that you think the world
1268960	1275280	works, or the way that these particular sensory, panther sensory stimulation are generated,
1275840	1282320	relative to the evidence at hand through that you're accessing through your sensations.
1282960	1291040	So when people, well, certainly when people like me and you talk about this resistance to illusions
1292000	1297200	in people separate from schizophrenia, what we are effectively saying is that they
1297920	1306000	have less precise or imprecise prior beliefs that they're more sensitive to any sensory evidence
1306000	1315040	at hand. So if illusions are the things that reveal our prior beliefs, and people with schizophrenia
1315040	1320160	are resistant to illusions, that means they don't have very precise prior beliefs. And that tells
1320160	1327840	you an enormous amount about the message passing the dynamics and the sense making in people who
1327840	1334480	are resistant to illusions, particularly in relation to how we think the brain encodes
1334480	1338080	that precision, because you have to estimate the precision, it doesn't come for free.
1338080	1344320	It's very much like a statistician computing the standard error, which is the inverse or the
1344400	1350880	component of precision, it has to be evaluated. And if you get that wrong, you can produce your
1350880	1356160	type one, your type two errors, all that false inference and the rights and these nations and
1356160	1363760	delusions. And in this instance, a resistance to a particular kind of, not a pseudo hallucination,
1363760	1369280	but a particular kind of illusory person. I think I'm glad we're touching on this,
1369280	1373840	because this leads me into my next question, which which is surrounding illusionism as a
1373840	1379600	theory of consciousness. When you think of an illusion as a misinterpretation of a sensory
1379600	1385120	stimulus that does exist. And you think of the theory of illusionism, Keith Frankish, Daniel
1385120	1390480	Dennett, Susan Blackmore, lots of people working. And to an extent, when you take into account
1390480	1395520	certain things that someone like Anil Seth says with perceptions being active hallucinations,
1396800	1402000	you sort of come to this conclusion that, okay, the sensory stimulus we're receiving
1402000	1406960	sort of gives us an idea, a posterior belief at some point that we have what is known as a
1406960	1412400	conscious experience, a phenomenal first person subjective experience. Sorry, I'm going to head
1412400	1418400	into philosophy at this point and then we'll try to get back into the neuroscience, but and the
1418400	1424160	physics, etc. So when you think of Dennett and all these philosophers who discuss illusionism as a
1424160	1430240	theory of conscious, the basic premise is that we are experiencing something. However, because
1431040	1437200	let's say someone like you or Donald Hoffman who takes fitness payoffs over reality. The fact is
1437200	1442720	we are never really perceiving what is actually out there. We're just perceiving what is meant to
1442720	1448640	allow us to survive long enough, perhaps to breed to whatever we have to do. And in this case,
1448640	1453440	consciousness believing we have some sort of an entity, something similar to an Ian Vitale.
1454000	1460160	I mean, the fact that we believe this allows us to go through life and successfully reproduce
1460160	1465120	and continue to thrive. Do you think this has a lot of value? And do you think that these theories
1465120	1471760	of illusionism as a theory of consciousness has value using your theory of free energy principle
1471760	1479920	and the Bayesian brain to back it up? Well, in the way that you articulated them, absolutely, yes.
1480800	1484160	Okay. Do you have any rebuttals against that?
1486000	1496080	Not whatsoever. No, I think you phrased it in a compelling way and it fits exactly with the view
1496080	1504560	of a Bayesian brain and more generally the free energy principle. Your controlled hallucination
1505520	1512480	is just an expression of the way that sensory impressions somehow control our sense making
1512480	1517440	on the inside and the degree to which we let them control depends upon the precision that we afford
1518480	1524560	the sensory impressions. By definition, we'll never actually know what's going on on the outside.
1524560	1531040	So the whole point of inferring is you don't know the answer. You're just left with the best belief,
1531120	1537120	the best probabilistic guess as to what's going on out there. There will never be any
1537120	1544960	true access to the causes of that. And in a sort of complementary fashion, I will never know
1544960	1548960	what you are thinking. I can never know. So I'm on the outside looking at you.
1550160	1556960	So you're all including the free energy principle, but as applied to your brain, this is just a
1557040	1564080	hypothesis. It's just a belief. There is a fundamental divide that in the physics application,
1564080	1569680	the free energy principle rests upon something called a Markov blanket. But there's a fundamental
1569680	1577040	divide, an informational barrier, or probably beyond information, an existential barrier
1577040	1584720	between the inside and the outside of any thinking thing, which means that the question
1585680	1592320	is what is reality? Is there a metaphysics? Is unanswerable? All you can do is, I think in
1592320	1600080	itself, as inference to the best prediction as opposed to explanation. But inference to the
1600080	1605440	best explanation is perfectly okay in terms of explaining the world to yourself as you
1606240	1615920	sample it and as you sense it. So I am not a philosopher, so that's the one area that I am
1615920	1625680	very naïve in. However, I did want to make a philosophical point here that you use the phrase
1625680	1634960	that we believe in some aspect of ourselves, including the fact that we believe that we
1634960	1641840	have experiences. There is an argument that this is just another illusion. It's just another hypothesis
1641840	1648160	that in fact, selfhood in and of itself is just another hypothesis, that these are sort of illusions
1648160	1655280	that we bring to the table to make parsimmonious sense of the fact that there appears to be some
1655280	1661520	coherence in mind-bodied interaction with the world. But it's not a necessary belief for
1662320	1668960	living and surviving and adapting. I'm sure if viruses could tell you, they would deny
1668960	1677440	having a sense of self. You might argue that consciousness, either the kind of self-consciousness
1677440	1685360	that you refer to, or just the notion that I am having a qualitative experience. The kind of
1685920	1693520	experience that people like Thomas Mixinger would associate with opacity or phenomenal opacity.
1694480	1700320	These in and of themselves are still just hypotheses. They're just ways of explaining
1700320	1706880	my sense-making and this instance on the inside, as opposed to explaining what caused my external
1706880	1712720	sensory states. Does that make sense? But all of this I think is entirely consistent with the
1712720	1720480	views that you expressed. I think it's, sorry, were you continual? Well, no, you asked for a pushback.
1721440	1728880	The only pushback I can think of, and again, forgive me if I'm using the wrong words, but
1732880	1740480	the free energy principle inherits from the theory of sparsely coupled random dynamical systems.
1741360	1749200	And the special case that emerges when you have a particular kind of sparse coupling between
1749840	1758240	something and everything else. If that is true, it does have, if you like, a metaphysical commitment
1758240	1764880	that there has to be something else out there. So there is a sense that you can
1765840	1775040	be a complete skeptic. There is no reality from the point of view of applying the free energy
1775040	1782400	principle to my sense-making or indeed applying it to your sense-making, your sentience. But
1783280	1789920	the free energy principle in and of itself starts from a very metaphysical position that
1789920	1796640	there is an outside and there is an inside. And what we are looking at is quite simply a
1796640	1801680	generalized synchronization between the dynamics on the inside and the outside. That can be read
1801680	1806960	as inference and belief update. That's a pushback I can think of. I think that's exactly where
1806960	1810800	someone like Daniel Dennett would break away from someone like Donald Hoffman. Exactly what you're
1810800	1816080	talking about. Where Dennett would suppose that there is a reality, there is an external reality.
1816080	1821200	However, there's still no such thing as phenomenal experience or conscious experiences because we
1821200	1825760	are crafting this as we're going along or interpreting it that way. That might not be the
1825760	1830160	best way to say it anyway. Whereas Donald Hoffman then goes to the assumption that all conscious
1830160	1835360	experience is the reality we're talking about. And that might take it a bit further because now
1835360	1840880	there is no external reality. We're sort of creating reality from conscious experience.
1840880	1846400	But yeah, he takes a different physical route. Just called briefly what I wanted to say was,
1846400	1851840	I mean, I've got tons of notes here. Just want to show you a lot of different things. I've got a
1851840	1856560	bunch of equations here. The main goal was because I've seen so many different talks with you and
1856560	1861360	so many different interviews, I've noticed how people tend to, as I said, ask you questions
1861360	1866400	based on their expertise or their field of expertise. And I didn't want that to happen because
1867120	1873200	for the most part, I'm so on board with your view. And I love the theory so much that I used it in
1873200	1879200	my own master's dissertation to defend illusionism. So I, the dissertation is called psychiatry's
1879200	1884720	defense for illusionism as a theory of consciousness. And a huge chunk of that actually
1884720	1891920	incorporated your work, yourself, Chris Frith, many others. But I was worried that when I get
1892000	1896320	into this interview, I'm going to start defending it even more. And I did not want that to happen.
1896320	1902080	So I made very specific notes to sidetrack me off that path. But before I do leave that part,
1902080	1907280	the last thing I do want to say is, if someone does ask you what consciousness is,
1907920	1912160	how do you actually go about answering that question? Do you find that you go down a
1912880	1917520	philosophical route? Or do you stick to a neuroscientific slash psychiatric route?
1918400	1925840	Well, I think very much like you, it would depend upon who I'm talking to and who is listening.
1928080	1936640	It would be very context sensitive. If you're talking to
1936880	1950480	people who are in a more physics-y world, and they are interested in the naturalization of
1950480	1958800	consciousness, I would appeal to this, well, go right back to the Cartesian dualism. How would
1958800	1965600	you repair that? Or should you repair that? There is actually an argument I've heard recently from
1965680	1974160	very valued colleagues that there is a neo-Cartesianism that emerges from, specifically,
1974960	1980000	the free energy principle on the one hand, and quantum information theoretic formulations on the
1980000	1986720	other hand. This is due to things like the inner screen hypothesis by Chris Fields, which is a
1986720	1994400	fascinating resurrection of the Cartesian theater of a particular sort. But if I was talking to
1994400	2002720	somebody who wanted to naturalize in relation to the laws of physics written as usually differential
2002720	2009040	equations or in quantum information theoretic terms, I would be looking to answer their question in
2009040	2018800	terms of how do you bridge these two? How do you arrive at some kind of dual aspect monism
2019360	2026320	that still preserved the duality that explained it? And I would be talking about
2027120	2038320	the difference between a posterior belief, a Bayesian belief that is encoded by the states of
2038320	2045760	a brain, for example, and the probability distributions that are entailed by the states
2045760	2054720	of those brains. So you've got on the one hand an intrinsic information geometry that inherits from
2054720	2060080	the probability distributions that somebody in thermodynamics, a physicist, would understand
2060080	2065040	the kind that we use in brain imaging, for example, to look at brain activations through
2066240	2073120	the expenditure of thermodynamic energy in order to support neural dynamics,
2074000	2082000	but exactly the same by physical states are those that parameterize another kind of information
2082000	2087440	geometry, which is the information geometry of beliefs, the space in which I do my belief
2087440	2092560	updating, moving one belief from this point to this point. And of course, that moment is important
2092560	2100160	because most of the much of the arguments that I would engage with in terms of consciousness
2100160	2106880	would frame consciousness as a process. I think you mentioned that explicitly. What does that mean
2106880	2113760	from the point of view of trying to naturalize a conscious process that was quintessentially
2113760	2119360	believed basis movement on statistical manifold. So you do get that for free from the free energy
2119360	2127680	principle. So that's why I and a number of at least close friends and collaborators use the
2127680	2133440	phrase, you know, a physics of sentience. Sometimes we don't want to be quite so bold.
2133440	2137360	Sometimes you get told off for using the word sentience. So but at least you can talk about
2137360	2144080	a physics of information. And it is that sort of link between the information theoretic, the belief,
2144080	2153760	the statistical aspect of neural dynamics, and the thermodynamics that underwrite that,
2153760	2159360	which does, I think, provide that link between the, you know, the mensuric, well, you know,
2159360	2171760	the Cartesian dual aspects of certain things like the brain. If I was talking to people
2172640	2179280	in philosophy who are more interested in, you know, phenomenology, I think you have to address
2179280	2186400	some hard questions about, you know, what would be the necessary properties of a
2187120	2193360	self-organizing, self-evidence free energy minimizing system that could possibly support
2195120	2202400	qualitative experience or qualia as and then you have to ask other questions about
2203360	2210160	when would there be some self-awareness of this and, you know, issues of self-modelling of the kind
2210160	2220480	again, addressed by people like Thomas Metzinga. Those kinds of conversations would take a slightly
2220480	2225360	different route and would focus on the phenomenology. And interesting, they come back to the precision
2225360	2231600	we were talking about before. If you remember, we were talking about having to estimate the
2231600	2242160	precision, which means that you've got, well, for those kinds of systems or creatures or
2242160	2251120	particles that have the capacity to estimate the precision of their implicit beliefs and
2251120	2259200	the sensory evidence that is updating those beliefs, that the very act of deploying those
2259280	2263200	estimates of precision and inferring that precision becomes a kind of mental action.
2263760	2273280	So now you've got a way of linking mental action, red as people like Jacob Nynowski and Thomas
2273280	2280400	Metzinga and that kind of philosophizing and with the psychological reading of this mental
2280400	2286400	action, which is just attention, it's just basically deploying or affording more attention
2286400	2295440	to this level of representation in a hierarchical context or this sensory stream, thereby selecting
2295440	2303200	that for belief updating, giving those sources of evidence privilege access to your deeper,
2303200	2311280	higher level belief updating. So now you're in the world of building bridges between attention,
2311920	2319200	mental action and phenomenology. Then you start to talk to people who like to think about
2319200	2327040	selfhood and self-modeling and self-awareness and you start to think about how do these things
2327040	2335760	unpack in terms of the kind of generative models that are necessary to define model evidence,
2335760	2341520	margin and likelihood, variational free energy. What kind of models would you need and you normally
2341520	2348240	get to your very, very deep models, hierarchical models where we normally have in mind a sort of
2348240	2355120	heterarchy or a centrifugal hierarchy. So your deeper is usually sort of more abstract and slower
2356480	2362720	and what normally starts to think about what kind of depth would be required
2363680	2369600	for me to have a sense of self. Well, first of all, I have to be an agent. To be an agent,
2369600	2375280	I have to have a generative model that entertains the consequences of my action, otherwise I can't
2375280	2383680	plan. So immediately we're talking about generative models entailed by certain creatures or people
2384560	2389760	that escapes the moment simply now because I've got a generative model of the future.
2389840	2395120	Unlike a thermostat or a virus, I've now got a very deep generative model of a particular sort
2395120	2400720	which goes into the future. It's future pointing, but crucially, it's my future. It's not your
2400720	2407280	future or anything else, it's just my future. What will happen if I do that? So that makes me
2407280	2414640	to an agent. So immediately you're talking about a very special class of self-organization,
2414640	2422240	self-evidencing. And then you have to ask the question, well, at what point do I recognize
2422240	2428080	that it is me that is actually doing the planning? And why? If you want to apply the
2428080	2433280	free energy principle, you have to ask the question, well, what licenses this kind of deep
2434400	2441440	generative modeling? And that's a pressing question because you have used the phrase
2441440	2446880	self-evidencing. I should just very quickly qualify that, which is a philosophical term,
2446880	2452960	which I know nothing about in philosophy. But I do know that Jacob Hoey, my friend in Melbourne,
2452960	2460080	is a philosopher, thinks it's quite apt to use as a description of the Bayesian brain minimizing
2460080	2465600	its free energy. Because if you remember, the free energy is synonymous with technically a lower
2465600	2471920	bound on surprise, surprise is self-information, but it's also the negative model evidence or
2471920	2479840	log-bottle evidence. So as you're doing optimal inference, you are implicitly trying to maximize
2479840	2487120	the evidence for your models of your nipped world, so you're self-evidencing. So the interesting twist
2487120	2498000	here is that you can easily show, literally on the back of a matchbox, that the log evidence
2498720	2507600	is equal to accuracy minus complexity, which means that every move I make and every aspect of my brain
2508320	2520160	that is engendered during neurodevelopmental need evolution has to pay a price for every more accurate
2520160	2532720	explanation, illusion that it deploys. And that price is the complexity cost. So it means you're
2532720	2540640	trying to minimize the complexity. So why in earth would, say, evolution equip you and me with this
2540640	2545680	really deep generative model, where I've got all this extra complexity that I can be in this state
2545680	2549680	of mind, on that state of mind, I can be anxious, I can be in that, I can be frightened, I can be
2549680	2557040	embarrassed. Why would it do that? Well, of course, if it provides a parsimonious explanation
2557920	2566880	of my sense making and my active engagement with the world, then it pays its way in terms of the
2569360	2574320	increase in accuracy of the kind of things I can explain and engage with,
2576880	2584240	pays its way or compensates sufficiently for the increased complexity. And then you ask yourself,
2584240	2592960	what kind of worlds would potentially justify this kind of modeling, this kind of very
2592960	2599920	sophisticated hierarchy, deep modeling? And usually one ends up, and now I'm talking to people
2599920	2607360	in your ethology and social neuroscience, you end up with, well, the only kind of worlds in which
2607440	2615280	I need to infer I am me and I am in this dispositional state is in a world in which there are lots of
2615280	2620160	other things that are exactly like me that have certain dispositional, intentional states in
2620160	2627040	relation to me. Otherwise, I don't need this. It would be an overly complicated model. So you argue
2627040	2634320	yourself into a situation where this kind of consciousness, it can only be present, or is
2634320	2640400	any licensed under the free energy principle, in a world full of conspecifics and creatures,
2640400	2646400	and usually N and N functioned eternally, that depends upon lots of other people. So that now
2646400	2654000	becomes a slightly relational aspect to this kind of consciousness. So I haven't talked about the
2654880	2660000	inner screen hypothesis, but there is another quantum physics version of this. So there's lots
2660000	2663840	of different stories you can tell depending upon what people want to hear.
2664560	2668000	Carl, you touched on so many different ones there. I love the last one because
2668000	2672000	it reminds me of Chris Fritz's work, and he loves to talk about this social and relational
2672000	2676400	aspect of consciousness. You guys have written many papers together, and someone else you've written
2676960	2680960	with is a colleague of mine from South Africa, a very good friend, Mark Solms.
2680960	2684800	You guys have also written together, and I know Mark takes us down to a more basic level of
2685760	2690320	existence in terms of conscious experiences coming from more basic parts of the brain.
2691440	2695040	What got you guys to write together, and how did you guys sort of get together and do this?
2695040	2700400	These beautiful papers together. Right, well I'll just mention both Chris and Mark in that.
2700960	2706960	So interestingly, when I, as a young psychiatrist, got into brain imaging,
2707840	2716160	it was exactly at the same time that Chris was, Chris Frith, came from basically clinical
2716720	2722080	psychology and neuropsychology. Those were the worlds, certainly the UK's experts in schizophrenia
2722080	2728240	research. He came to join us at the MRC Cyclotron Unit, the very first brain imaging, also an
2728240	2734720	emission tomography studies of people with schizophrenia. So he's been my mentor and friend
2735360	2742080	since the inception of my academic career, and he's still meant to be writing the last paragraph
2742080	2750480	of the last paper that I'm trying to submit at the moment. Mark, but there's an interesting
2750480	2759120	connection and comparison between Mark and Chris. Mark, I met later in life at international
2759120	2767040	conferences, and we're very impressed with, in those days, his encyclopedic and very embracing
2767040	2774160	knowledge of Freudian ideas in relation to psychoanalysis, but also neuropsychology.
2775040	2783360	So he's one of those polymaths who can transcend different fields. He can write volumes on Freud,
2783360	2792000	and yet bring the most informative and puzzling neuropsychological cases to the fore
2792000	2798560	to evince some very deep questions about how we experience our world and how that can be
2798560	2805200	expressed via things like neuropsychanalysis. So the interesting thing is that Chris really
2805200	2811600	hates Freud, whereas Mark loves Freud, but they're both, they're both committed to understanding the
2811600	2820560	brain as an organ, as a social organ. But as you rightly say, Mark is much more on the sort of,
2820560	2826480	you know, it predicates his work on the neuropsychology and the neurobiology,
2827680	2832960	whereas Chris is much more in terms of the dyadic and the social and social neuroscience aspects
2833920	2841360	that underwrite sense making where it matters. But both of them at the end of the day are trying
2841360	2846400	to understand the, you know, the patients they saw as young men, and perhaps Mark is still seeing
2846400	2854800	patients, I don't know. So that's how I got involved. Mark's ideas, you know, I think you're
2854800	2867840	absolutely right. They are more grounded in the wetwear that would have this,
2868800	2876960	that would endorse certain psychoanalytic, psychotherapeutic, neuropsychological and
2876960	2885280	psychiatric readings. And interestingly, he's happened upon exactly the same
2887520	2891280	focus that I suspect to your computational psychiatry thesis
2893040	2899520	focused on. So again, we come back to this key notion of precision and uncertainty. And of course,
2899600	2907280	you know, if you want a, you know, to naturalize psychopathology, it's all about beliefs. And
2907280	2915600	if you want to, what is definitive of a belief? Well, it has clearly, when thought of or when
2915600	2921040	read as a probability distribution, it has an attribute of content in terms of the location
2921040	2926640	parameters. But more importantly, it's got an attribute of uncertainty of dispersion.
2927600	2932720	That's the whole point about a belief as opposed to a point estimate. So if we are creatures that
2932720	2941360	deal in beliefs, then the, you know, the challenge that we face is basically evaluating and knowing
2941360	2947360	and representing our own uncertainty, either personally or subpersonally. You know, and indeed,
2948640	2952560	you can see this throughout, say, in economics, you know, the markets of lost confidence,
2952560	2957760	there's in, you know, things that matter, I usually knows the confidence and the uncertainty
2957760	2965280	that I hold my beliefs with. So that, that I keep using the word uncertainty, because there's a
2965280	2970480	lovely little phrase that Mark has celebrated in his most recent book that you know, The Hidden
2970480	2976080	Spring and Subsequence and Academic Publications, which is a notion of felt uncertainty. So he thinks
2976080	2986320	that feelings are all about the estimation of and deployment of precision uncertainty in exactly
2986320	2992160	the same way that we ended up trying to naturalize the resistance to illusions in people with
2992160	2998800	schizophrenia. It's all the same thing. So he puts a very heavy weight on that. To the extent he
2998800	3004640	gets very cross when people become cortical centric, you know, they think he's all in the
3004640	3012400	frontal lobes. He's literally deep in the hierarchy, literally deep in the cells of origin
3012400	3018240	of these really powerful neurotransmitter systems that do the attentional game, they do the
3018240	3024720	neuromodulation, they set the precision, they balanced and coordinate our belief updating.
3024720	3028560	And of course, that fits very comfortably with what we've talked about before, which is a mental
3028560	3038400	action read as attention, being able to get some control over those dynamics and belief updating
3038400	3042800	processes, that Bayesian mechanics that's going on inside our head.
3044320	3050720	So, I mean, you guys, both of your papers, I remember, you all sort of culminate and get
3050720	3055280	together with this idea that this Bayesian brain, this is fundamental to what we do.
3055360	3060320	When you think about perceptive experiences, we realize that at some point, my red sunset and
3060320	3065280	your red sunset are not the same. It's a very two different experiences, both comprised of
3065280	3070160	different neural, neuro factors, different social factors, different experiences in the past. So
3070160	3074960	even time plays a big role. This comes along well when you think of Markov blankets, because you
3074960	3080640	think of these different internal states, different active states, perhaps for each person who's
3080640	3086560	thinking, how do you find Markov blankets play? Well, let's first talk about how Markov blankets
3086560	3091600	play a central role in the free energy principle, and how this sort of navigates across different
3091600	3097280	areas from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology. Let's go to economics, etc.
3099040	3104400	Right. I thought you were going to talk about synchronization across Markov blankets and
3104400	3106960	communication. I wasn't sure you can get that at some point.
3107520	3118000	Excuse me. So, yeah, as you say, the Markov blanket plays a foundational role in the physics
3118560	3124960	reading of the free energy principle, where you have to, before you can start to talk about anything,
3125600	3132160	you have to be able to demarcate and define what you mean by something. And the first move is
3133120	3139360	to individuate that thing from everything else. How do you do that? Well, you simply identify
3139920	3144960	those states that intervene between everything else and the thing in question. They separate the
3144960	3154560	internal states, dynamics, paths, narratives. Technically, these would be states in a state
3154640	3161680	space, from the point of view of, say, a Langevin equation or some kind of statistical physics.
3165840	3173360	What transpires is that if you want to individuate the state's internal to something,
3173360	3180000	from the state's external to something, then one way of doing that, and one could argue the only
3180080	3184880	way of doing that, is to demonstrate that they are conditionally independent. If you want to be
3184880	3190480	able to separate, there has to be some kind of probabilistic separability. There has to be
3190480	3195520	some kind of independence. But it's conditioned upon the Markov blanket. So what does that mean?
3195520	3202400	Well, it basically means that you and I, almost specifically your brain and my brain,
3203840	3209040	are not closed systems. We are open systems, and our systems are open to our niche, our
3209120	3219920	environment, or our heat bath, if you were a physicist. But that kind of openness is a kind
3219920	3225200	that preserves that conditional independence between me on the inside and everything else
3225200	3232880	on the outside. And that's where the Markov blanket comes in. And then you can, for most things,
3233840	3238720	partition the Markov blanket into two sets of states, the active states and the sensory
3238720	3244320	states. The semantics are rather obvious in the sense that it's just making a distinction
3244320	3251680	between those states that mediate the exposure of the inside to the outside. So the influence,
3251680	3256880	the vicarious influences of the outside on the inside and those of the sensory states.
3256880	3262320	And then to complete the circle, to induce the necessary kind of circular causality we need
3262320	3267440	for the synchronization we're going to talk about, you have to have the other side of the street,
3268320	3275120	which is the active states that mediate the influence of the internal states on the external
3275120	3282800	states. So you've got this rather delicate, fundamental sparsity structure where the sparsity
3282800	3289200	is read in terms of the influence that one state has on another state. The foregrounds
3290160	3296320	a special set of states that are called blanket states that can be divided into active and
3296320	3302960	sensory states that intervene between the external and internal states. The inner screen
3302960	3308880	hypothesis we were talking about before inherits from a quantum information theoretic formulation
3308880	3316800	of this notion where you can look at this blanket as a screen onto which I can write,
3316800	3323600	say the environment or the world out there writes onto this blanket, writes onto this
3323600	3329360	holographic screen and those become my sensations and I can then read those sensations from the
3329360	3335680	holographic screen on the inside and then I can couple back so that the environment senses me
3335680	3340640	through my actions. So there's a, if you like, one level of perfect symmetry between the two
3341280	3352960	and that symmetry is just, sorry, that symmetry is evinced by the minimization
3354320	3360720	of free energy in the sense that if I can predict what's going on out there and what's going on
3360720	3364960	out there is at the same time in some sense trying to predict what's going on inside my head,
3365680	3371440	the ultimate free energy minimizing solution, the most likely solution just brings us back to
3372480	3378000	being in characteristic states for the environment and the mean. So we're talking just about a
3378000	3385120	description of a generalized synchronization or a synchronization of chaos between two
3385120	3391280	sparsely coupled dynamical systems with a special sparsely structure that allows me to preserve
3391280	3398560	my conditional independence. So in a sense the illusionist perspective we were talking about
3398560	3405840	before is a must, it can't be any other way if you define existence as conditional independence
3405840	3410720	from the world in which you are immersed, but of course there has to be a world in which you are
3410720	3416240	immersed so you can't take that too far in terms of a skeptical position. Yeah, when you think of
3416240	3423120	Markov blankets, in the context of let's say neural networks, how could the concept of Markov
3423120	3431440	blankets be used to better understand flow of information or computations within a neural network?
3432160	3435680	Is this applicable and are there any specific applications we could
3436320	3441520	utilize this concept to enhance our understanding of consciousness, neural connections, etc.?
3441920	3448720	Yeah, I think there are, it's interesting that you should ask that and what you should do is get
3450000	3454880	Maxwell Ramstead and Chris Field and possibly even Mark and then Mark Serms has also been
3454880	3458960	involved in these conversations and another other people I'm sure they will also suggest.
3460000	3469040	So this group have been thinking for a year or two and are currently submitting papers to things
3469040	3477200	like the general consciousness studies and elsewhere that rest explicitly on arving the
3477200	3484240	internal dynamics of a brain in terms of nested Markov blankets and trying to ask the question,
3484880	3492720	is there something unique about a Markov blanket on the inside in your brain which
3492720	3498080	may be physically very distributed but statistically well defined that could possibly
3498080	3503040	support consciousness? So this is the inner screen hypothesis that I mentioned before.
3503040	3507200	So your question, perhaps you've actually seen a preprint.
3510080	3515520	Well, it's a very prescient and astute question then because this is exactly what people like
3515520	3521040	Maxwell and Mark and Ken and David and everybody else would love and Chris would have loved to
3521040	3526640	have been asked. Yeah, so that's the whole premise that well, first of all, it's a spin back.
3527360	3535120	So you're right to ask, are Markov blankets useful? I think that they are foundational and
3535120	3539520	they're used implicitly everywhere. I mean, not only are they foundational in the sense that they
3540640	3546400	define your existence and my existence and anything that we engage with or we think we engage with
3547200	3554160	but they are implicitly used whenever you start to simulate or reproduce
3555600	3559840	or emulate any kind of sense making or intelligence, artificial or natural.
3561120	3566640	Whether you're playing with neurons, neural cultures in a dish, the cell membrane is a Markov
3566640	3573840	blanket that defines the cell, the connectivity of the neurons defines another scale of Markov
3574560	3577120	blanket or another scale, which says that this is a network.
3579040	3584880	And exactly the same maths applies to neural networks in machine learning and artificial
3584880	3589600	intelligence research and the operation of your iPhone or Google search machines.
3590480	3595680	So these things become practically really important in defining the network of a thing
3595680	3602240	that's doing the computations or the information processing in a pragmatic sense.
3602240	3607360	And indeed, you can read these active and sensory states as the inputs and outputs to
3607360	3614640	anything that is doing some kind of computing. So they are essential in defining things like,
3614640	3620160	say, von Neumann architectures. You and I don't use a von Neumann architecture,
3620160	3626000	but you can still use Markov blankets to define them. But even if you look at the kind of architectures
3626960	3634800	that we use for sense making in the hierarchal Bayesian brain or hierarchal predictive coding
3636320	3645360	story, then the message passing that is required to do the brief updating becomes tremendously
3645360	3653040	efficient due to the presence of these carefully self-maintained, self-evidencing Markov blanket
3653040	3660160	structures. So remember the Markov blanket rests upon a sparsity structure. It's what the connections
3660160	3666160	and the influences that are not there. So that means that you can now do local computations.
3666160	3671680	If you can define the Markov blanket of you, you may be just an element of your dendrite,
3671680	3677120	dendritic tree, you may be a synapse, you may be an entire dendritic tree, you may be a cell,
3677120	3681600	you may be a brain region, you may be the campus, you may be an entire brain,
3681600	3687280	you may be an entire person, or you may be a family, you may be a species, you may be an institution,
3687280	3696400	you may be a biosphere, and every scale the same rules apply whereby you get the efficiency from
3697600	3704240	the sparsity where the sparsity underwrites the very structure and the ability to actually dissect
3704880	3712880	every scale, the system at hand. So that leads to, I repeat, that's practically really important
3712880	3718000	when you're designing your networks or chips. You need to keep all your computations as local as
3718000	3725840	possible and you do that by using your Markov blanket. If you wanted to, if we return to
3726800	3738000	the implications for belief updating in a brain, then just saying the phrase hierarchical predictive
3738000	3744160	processing or hierarchical Bayesian inference immediately connects you to a certain class
3744160	3750800	of Markov blankets because the hierarchy is just defined in terms of the connections that are not
3750800	3758720	there. So each hierarchical level possesses a Markov blanket that separates its superordinate
3758720	3766560	level from its subordinate level. So just talking about hierarchical structures is just one special
3766560	3773920	case of a particular kind of nested Markov blanket. And then we get to, is there a special
3773920	3779120	Markov blanket? So now this is the crux of the paper that you haven't read, but I thought you had.
3780080	3786160	I'm looking forward to it. Well, I'll send you, well, I asked, you know, if you email Maxwell
3786160	3792320	Ramstead and Montreal, he'll send you, he'll send you, I've only got a copy with all the authors
3792320	3798720	redacted, so I'm not quite sure who the authors are. I'll take up that off, I'll take up that
3798720	3809920	off and definitely do that. No, he'd be delighted. So the idea of one of the key ideas that fits very
3809920	3817200	comfortably with the ideas from Chris Field and people like Jim Laysbrook and Mike Levin,
3818240	3823840	which is this inner screen hypothesis, is that there is one irreducible Markov blanket.
3824560	3830880	There is one that you can't get inside and find any hierarchical structure or any partition.
3831760	3838320	So what would that mean if there was one or more possibly, but there was certainly at least one
3838320	3844160	irreducible Markov blanket in my brain? It would have some quite profound implications.
3844880	3851760	It would mean that it could never see itself other than acting on the outside, which is the
3851760	3856640	rest of the brain. So the only way it can solve evidence is by engaging in mental action.
3857760	3864640	And now you ask, well, what kind of mental action would it engage? What are the executive
3864640	3870320	systems, the active states of this particular minimal Markov blanket? They are precisely
3870880	3876800	the cells of origin of the neurotransmitters that implement precision control and attention.
3876800	3881920	So we're right back with Mark Soames again, but we're in a very comfortable position because
3881920	3888080	not only are we friends with Mark Soames, but we're also friends with everybody who talks about
3888080	3893440	things like higher order thought theory. So predicate the entire argument on this hierarchical
3893440	3898880	structure, which means that at some level, and usually it's the higher level or the deeper level,
3899680	3906080	do interesting metacognitive things start to happen that you could associate with
3906960	3912640	conscious processing. But this is exactly what the minimal Markov blanket, irreducible Markov
3912640	3918320	blanket would say. It is something that is deep within the hierarchy that there is no higher
3918320	3923520	or deeper level. Because if there was, you'd be able to partition the internal states within
3923520	3927840	that minimal Markov blanket. It also fits very comfortably things like the global neuronal
3927840	3933600	workspace theory. I mean, what is global? And what is a workspace? Well, it's something where you
3933600	3938400	can share stuff. So you can't further subdivide it and it's global because it sees everything.
3938400	3944160	So it has, it has a lot of constructability in relation to a game where we started,
3944160	3949920	everybody's right, but they just got their own way of expressing it. But in this instance, we are,
3949920	3957520	or one is expressing it explicitly in terms of individuation, separability, read through the
3957520	3963920	lens of the free energy principle in terms of Markov blankets, crucially in a scale applied
3963920	3969760	to a particular scale, this scale is the scale of brains. So this wouldn't work when you're
3969760	3975760	trying to describe the weather or evolution. It wouldn't work when you're trying to describe
3975760	3984640	things at a quantum level or indeed at the level of a single neuronal, neural population.
3984640	3991040	This argument is scale is tied to a particular scale, but it has, if you like, a scale free
3991040	4001360	aspect in the hierarchical partitioning that induces the notion of a non partitionable or
4001360	4008880	irreducible Markov blanket. So, funnily enough, that notion of the irreducible Markov blanket
4008880	4014320	being the inner screen is exactly the new Cartesian theater that we're talking about.
4016240	4019520	That's very fascinating. I mean, I'm scheduled to chat to Mike Levin soon,
4020160	4026400	and I had no idea. I think I should send him an email to chat about this. You said it was Mike Levin,
4026400	4030000	Mark Sorms, Chris Fields, who else was, there was one more name you mentioned.
4030640	4040720	The inner screen hypothesis that, if you like, provides a cornerstone for this more collective,
4040720	4047200	inclusive effort to try and get at, you know, what Vanya Weiss would call a minimal unifying
4047200	4056400	model of consciousness. That includes people like Mark Sorms and David Rudolf and lots of people.
4060960	4066640	Organized by Maxwell Ramstead, and Chris Fields is a really important player in that,
4066640	4075840	but the inner screen hypothesis in and of itself is indeed due to Chris Fields and his
4075840	4083360	friends, and particularly Mike Levin and people like Jim Glacebrook. So, that formulation is
4083360	4088480	another, if you like, access, which you'll have some great conversations with both Chris and Mike.
4089440	4096640	So, they come at this from the point of view of sort of basal cognition, the notion that
4096640	4106320	everything is effectively, can be cast, and possibly even is, just a process of information.
4107040	4111120	It's just information processing, and self-organization just is
4112000	4121920	the processes that evolve that effectively do believe updating or process information,
4121920	4128000	usually classical information, you know, when it comes to sort of kind of biotic self-organization
4128000	4134000	that Mike Levin deals with. So, he's famous for Xenobox and all sorts of really insightful
4134480	4145440	takes, new takes on cellular and biological self-organization.
4146720	4152560	You know, some of my favorite ideas are, you know, if you'd, you might like, is that, you know,
4153680	4160000	when you appreciate that sort of, you know, physics, and this is a Chris Fields quote,
4160960	4166720	there is no bright line between sort of physics, biology, and psychology. They're all the same
4166720	4172720	things, just using different words. And Mike takes this to his extreme, what he used to,
4172720	4179600	he's got more sophisticated in the past review, but several years ago, he had this notion that
4180480	4188000	cancer was a delusion, a delusion that arose from a pathology of basal cognition, which I think is
4188000	4194480	why your cells are failing to infer, know their place, they're failing to infer that, no, I shouldn't
4194480	4199600	be growing in this context. They've got this delusion, oh, I should keep on growing. And of
4199600	4205520	course, he's absolutely right. So you can even get a computational psychiatry of cancer out of this,
4205520	4213360	but it does require a commitment to think about all self-organization as basically a process that
4213360	4220000	can be read as an inference process or a belief of basic dating process, the right kind of
4220880	4229360	processing and bounding self-information and entropy read from the point of view of information
4229360	4238000	theory. Chris Fields' particular take comes from his skills with Jim Glacebrook in quantum
4238000	4243520	information theory. So that's where the information theoretic aspects come, and then you can start to
4243520	4249280	talk about the relationship between the principles of unitarity and entanglement and the like,
4249280	4258560	and what that means when read or what it means in terms of a quantum formulation of the classical
4258560	4263840	reading of the free energy principle that doesn't normally deal with quantum, you know, it usually
4263840	4268720	starts with, you know, classical mechanics with all the kind of formulation of the like.
4270400	4276240	I know, I love so much about what you just said, because when I talk about it, I often think about
4276240	4282720	the same thing. I often call ourselves receiving persons organized by organelles, crafted by cells,
4282720	4288560	designed by DNA, manufactured by molecules, assembled by atoms, forged by fusion over,
4289520	4294400	forged by fusion via stellar supernovae. So this is a saying, because I think if you don't
4294400	4298240	incorporate all these things together, you're just, you're missing out an opportunity not to
4298240	4304480	reduce things to the nothing but aspects, but rather to grow the complexity of what we're talking
4304480	4311920	about. You just increase the scope of the conversation so much more by discussing every realm of reality.
4312720	4316800	And I think you get that, and you seem to be working on that from that perspective as well.
4317760	4324960	Absolutely. That Gail, I think that's a lovely way that you actually expressed it.
4324960	4331520	You should definitely get Chris Fields on your podcast, because his big thing is that scale
4331520	4339440	freeness, that scale invariance. And in fact, I was on a call literally about two hours ago,
4339440	4346080	where he made, I thought, a delightful point that because the free energy principle is by
4346080	4352000	construction scale free, it cannot be reductious at the same time. So it is quintessentially
4352000	4359280	anti-reductionist. So what you just expressed, I think, covered all those scales. And I think
4359280	4367280	that's part of the saying, your formalism has to be scale free. It has to be deployed
4368720	4373840	for me, mathematically, in the spirit of the renormalization group. It has to be deployed
4373840	4381200	time and time and time again. And as soon as you realize that, then you start to ask deep questions
4381200	4386160	about bottom-up and top-down causation between scales. So as soon as you've got a scale free
4386160	4396160	theory that can apply either to gamma oscillations in your hippocampus, or it can apply to natural
4396160	4401520	selection, led as Bayesian model selection. Then you start to ask big questions, well,
4401520	4409600	how does this very slow self-evidencing process contextualize and be informed by this very fast
4409600	4415360	self-evidencing process or information processing in a way that is emergent from just having these
4415360	4423360	same kinds of processes unfolding with a separation in this instance, temporal scales. So, you know,
4423360	4428080	Chris would wax lyrical for a long time about this. So you should perhaps you can get Chris and
4428080	4432640	Mike together. I think that's a very good idea. I think I should start doing that. I know the
4432640	4437680	last, I think you Kurt and Mike, I think spoke together as well, if I recall correctly, I can't
4437680	4443360	remember. Yes. Yes. I wanted to ask you, when you think about this project that everyone's talking
4443360	4450800	about, and Markov blankets, do you think that because some systems are so complex, do you
4450800	4456800	find, do you think there will be any sort of indirect or hidden causal relationships that
4456800	4462800	might hinder this from happening? What sort of applications or techniques should be employed
4462800	4467280	to effectively identify Markov blankets within complex systems?
4468240	4477760	Ah, right. Yeah. So this is a very sort of practical issue. And it would be very nice to be able to
4477760	4487680	sort of parcelate the brain, for example, or parcelate an institution or an economy to be able
4487680	4496720	to identify the different Markov blankets given some empirical data. There is a worked example
4496720	4502160	of this, which is little known because it's just so complicated. It's almost impossible to read,
4502160	4509600	but I wrote it and I'm quite proud of it. And I think it was in network science, but it was
4509600	4519040	exactly the challenge of taking brain imaging data with thousands, hundreds of thousands of
4519040	4525200	measurements of activity over time, and then parcelating it at different scales. So it was
4525200	4529680	exactly what we're just talking about. It was creating Markov blankets and Markov blankets
4530080	4538320	and doing it in a way that was empirically constrained by measuring the connectivity
4538320	4544160	and its sparsity to imply where the Markov blankets were. And then once you've got a Markov
4544160	4549760	blanket, those now constitute the Intel states of a bigger Markov blanket. And then you can sort
4549760	4557920	of carve up the entire brain at successively course from course spatial scales. And what was
4557920	4568320	really interesting is a phenomena that is, I was going to say emergent, but in fact it's actually
4568320	4576480	baked into the normalization group that you would access mathematically, or you would use to access
4576480	4583200	the scale free behavior, at least formalize or naturalize it, that things get slower as they
4583200	4592240	get bigger. So we could actually estimate the time constants of the neuronal fluctuations
4592960	4600640	and implicit belief updating associated with different spatial scales ranging from a cubic
4600640	4606640	centimeter or millimeter or so of the brain through to entire frontal lobes. And then we can
4606640	4613600	extrapolate out to very, very big things and very, very small things and look at the characteristic
4613600	4619440	time scales. It was just implicit by scanning through the time scales by having lots and lots,
4619440	4626160	you know, literally hundreds of thousands, well at least a thousand, a thousand little Markov blankets
4626160	4632800	all jostling together, partitioned and then moving to say a hundred of them and then to ten.
4632800	4637040	And just by extrapolating, you could then think about sort of collections of brains,
4637040	4646080	ten brains, or a tenth of a cubic centimeter of the brain right the way down to the quantum scale.
4646080	4650080	And just look at the different time constants that were engaged. So that was a really interesting
4650080	4656880	academic exercise, but it did rest as the same, being able to identify Markov blankets. What
4656880	4665760	you're asking though is a key issue in terms of complex system analysis and modelling, being able
4665760	4673200	to carve the system in the right kind of way in order to usually to simulate it in a way that
4673200	4680640	allows you to do forecasting or scenario modelling and the like or projecting a response to a
4680640	4687760	therapeutic intervention in say clinical neuroscience or psychiatry through to weather forecasting.
4687760	4693680	You know, getting the right course-graining, the right Markov blankets in plain is absolutely
4693680	4699120	essential. There are lots of people working on that at the moment. One email exchange I've had
4699120	4704320	this week is from a gentleman called Jeff Beck who's taken on the very deep challenge
4705280	4712240	of considering Markov blankets that wander around. So one interesting aspect
4712240	4721120	of a simple definition of a Markov blanket is that it depends upon a probability distribution
4722560	4730400	that exists over a non-trivial amount of time. But if you think of something like a candle flame
4730800	4737600	that is moving and furthermore the constituents, the molecules and the irons that constitute
4737600	4746560	the plasma that is the surface of the flame, is it fair to say that the flame has a Markov blanket
4746560	4753600	given all its constituent molecules, i.e. other small-scale Markov blankets, are continually
4753760	4763120	being exchanged and moving and wandering around. So he's taken on the challenge of taking Markov
4763120	4770320	blankets into this sort of more liberal domain and dynamic domain and see if one can still apply
4770320	4776480	the free energy principle in a practical way. But to do that, he has to have at least simulations
4776480	4784080	on numerical studies that allow him to actually identify Markov blankets that move like waves
4784080	4791040	in certain media. So that's still an outstanding problem which a lot of people, when I say a lot,
4791040	4797600	a few key postcomings are looking at and I think it's a very useful ability to be inquiring.
4797600	4801040	That's quite fascinating. It's great to see that so many different people are working on this at
4801040	4805120	this point because when you look online and you look at the amount of citations, I mean you are
4805120	4810400	one of the most cited neuroscientists on the planet and it's great to see that a lot of people
4810400	4815040	are taking these concepts seriously and trying to roll with it. Looking ahead to the future,
4816480	4822640	what directions or advancements do you anticipate in the study of Markov blankets, for example,
4822640	4827840	except for the one you just mentioned? Where do you think the free energy principle is going from here?
4828480	4838000	I think there are probably three directions of travel and we've implicitly already covered
4838000	4848400	the most important ones in our conversation. So the first one is indeed computational psychiatry
4848400	4856720	and computational neurology. I mean in a sense all the work that Chris Frith and I and many other
4856720	4864560	colleagues put in decades ago into understanding functional brain architectures via brain imaging
4864560	4870800	was in the service of ultimately asking questions about neurology and psychiatry and much of the
4870800	4878880	theorising that led to active inference and the free energy principle inherited from the data
4878880	4886160	analytic and modelling that we were applying to make sense of brain imaging data and realised
4886320	4890960	exactly the same principles could be applied to the brain or when I say realised we're told by
4890960	4896880	people like Geoffrey Hinton you can apply the same principles to the brain, the Helmholtz machine.
4898480	4905680	So that's one direction of travel I think. Again, I use the word naturalising. I recently
4905680	4912160	learned what it means and I think it's a useful phrase to naturalise psychopathology in a way
4912160	4916800	that you can write down the laws and the maths and you can start to create in silico patients
4916800	4924320	and digital twins and intervene on them without actually giving drugs or psychotherapeutic
4924320	4930640	interventions to patients until you've shown. To a certain extent that style of approach is
4931360	4936880	already starting to bite not in the context of the free energy principle explicitly but certainly
4937840	4945520	in the modelling of things like epilepsy. Having naturalised a pathophysiology say the
4945520	4951200	transmission of epileptic discharges and seizure activity in the brain to the extent you can
4951200	4957040	actually put it in the computer and start to do weather forecasting of this particular person's
4957040	4962480	brain and what might happen if we did this and that. I think that's one very exciting way forward.
4963200	4970080	Another complement of that sort of applied application of the free energy principle
4971440	4976880	would be the ability to phenotype people. So there's a phrase computational phenotyping which
4976880	4984720	I quite like which basically means being able to characterize this person or this cohort
4985680	4992080	in terms of the parameters of their generative models that they use to explain their world
4992800	5000160	and that provides a really powerful and efficient summary on this person and in terms of their beliefs
5000160	5006400	and their belief updating and their prior commitments and being able to be able to measure
5006400	5012320	and quantify somebody in that kind of way can be very very useful not only in terms of tracking
5012400	5018160	the responses to therapy but also just getting the right nosologies the right way of carving up
5019360	5024480	various psychiatric conditions and their etiologies because now you've got a naturalised
5024480	5029760	process theory under the hood. So that's one kind of thing. The other direction of travel I think is
5030320	5036960	in artificial intelligence just actually building see practically what the free energy principle
5037040	5049040	brings to the table is not really a pretty first principles account of existence and sentient
5049040	5056480	behaviour but practically another strange inversion another denit strange inversion
5057600	5064640	instead of having to instead of having to understand the system in terms of its dynamics
5064640	5070640	as you would the complex system modelling you're trying to understand the underlying mechanics
5071200	5076400	by saying well these dynamics this set of say differential equations looks as if
5076400	5079600	it's performing a gradient flow on this light who not functional this
5081840	5089360	Lagrangian and I'm going to try and estimate what this what this underlying potential function
5089360	5094960	is that causes my dynamics and it's best a simple explanation for the complex system I want to
5094960	5106720	understand. For me of course that's always going to be this surprise or the log marginal likelihood
5106720	5113920	or the free energy bounds on that but what you can do is if you know that the dynamics of your
5114000	5120960	complex system can always be expressed as a gradient flow on a free energy functional
5120960	5126800	of a gerative model where the gerative model just scores or articulates characteristics states of
5126800	5134880	being that you want to emulate then what you can do is you can just write down the free energy
5134880	5141040	functional of your preferred states of being and then just integrate the system to reproduce
5141040	5146240	the sentient behavior that you would have seen if this thing existed and had these was attracted
5146240	5151520	to these characteristics states so it's a really powerful way of building machines that look as
5151520	5156720	if they exist in a particular way of course that's the aspiration of machine learning and
5156720	5163200	artificial intelligence you know and so it's certainly in principle you could deploy the
5163200	5169360	free energy principle in the context of building artifacts that do the right kind of belief updating
5169360	5176160	by the right kind of course I mean being able to model their world where their world is basically
5176160	5180880	the world of users basically you and me which brings us to the third direction of travel which is
5182240	5186640	the kind that Chris Fifth would like which is you know the explicit acknowledgement that
5187280	5192000	what is really interesting here is this scale free application of free energy principle where
5192000	5196400	you've got lots of different free energy minimizing self-evidencing Markov blankets
5196960	5202640	all living in Markov blankets of a different scale in institutions and theologies and their
5202640	5210240	ideologies and your ethnic bounds and all that so how does that unfold and how do you get the
5210240	5217360	right kinds of ecosystems that have this joint free energy minimizing behaviors that does not
5218640	5226160	incur upon or require certain Markov blankets to be vitiated or destroyed you know so what
5226560	5233600	we're talking about now is a physics of an ecology that has sustainability at its heart
5233600	5240320	or at its core because the whole point of the free energy principle it's a description of systems
5240320	5246960	that have an attracting set and how they sustain themselves within that attracting set so I would
5246960	5251600	imagine that the free energy principle will be useful and indeed pursuing this with colleagues
5251600	5260960	that and versus AI so my colleagues in industry this this is one application the free energy
5260960	5269200	principle in the service of in you know underwriting in a principled way the aspirations of all
5269200	5274240	right-minded people engaged in designing the next version of the world the world wide web
5274240	5280720	or artificial intelligence or information services and speak not to growth but speak
5280720	5288080	to sustainability that you're a biomimetic take on sustainable ecosystems but in this instance
5288080	5293840	ecosystems of intelligence so that was a bit hand wavy but it's you know it really is a fascinating
5293840	5299200	game when you start to talk to people who are actually in charge of engineering the next the
5299200	5304800	next web there really is so much potential um there's something I wanted to ask and I forgot
5304800	5309840	about it earlier but I was thinking about Markov blankets and how they they play this role um to
5309920	5316080	sort of this differentiate between let's say it can sort of play a role between differentiated
5316080	5323600	between a self and an other in a sense and does it have any role or impact when it comes to free will
5325040	5331040	how can you incorporate these ideas together well let's do my games
5331360	5335040	um so the self versus others
5335040	5339280	check the sound there as your sound is my sound good on your side
5340480	5344320	my sound is good and your sound is good otherwise yeah good
5349840	5355600	are you hear me yeah I can okay so I think you picked two ideas um
5355600	5360160	I haven't been able to return to that question um so let's um self and services
5366960	5369920	uh sorry just having an issue with your audio
5373440	5374560	um okay are you
5378640	5381920	okay are you okay no no sorry I was having issues with this audience
5382880	5384400	yes I couldn't hear you for about
5387360	5389920	it's back it's back sorry what did you do
5400480	5406560	okay so what I mean was when you think of Markov blankets they can indirectly play a
5406560	5410240	role in differentiating between a self and an other
5410640	5416240	how is this possible is this what's the trait of the free energy principle and
5417200	5419600	Markov blanket and what role does this
5420800	5422800	when it comes to
5424160	5431200	right yes thank you okay um so the self versus other I think is really important um
5432080	5434080	it was irrespective of
5436080	5443840	issue that that's that's that's what we didn't know we haven't covered any of our conversations
5443840	5445840	and it is the
5449840	5454400	and so you're thinking about early development and
5455360	5460400	I myself have been thinking of a new goal in Charles as to engage in that kind of work
5460400	5465600	out behind the world of this system and of course the first thing that I think we need to
5466160	5473040	um and recognize where the further is that is that another is not part of itself you know
5473040	5479280	the free energy which shall enslave to being right in the sense and um you know
5480160	5482160	as to
5496080	5498080	so
5509280	5517280	So I think that's quite the notion of just having blood in the blood of others, in a
5517280	5518280	clear way.
5518280	5525040	It's a really central aspect of having a model of pregnancy, building estimations and illusions
5525040	5529040	about women and the world, and what behind your model of pregnancy, when you're looking
5529040	5532880	well, that's what it means like you and your mother.
5532880	5542880	So I would, I know that, you know, and I think that's how she's going to do that, which I'm going to introduce now.
5542880	5548880	There are a lot of my colleagues who have done this, you know, and you've got an actual
5548880	5552880	attention on the side of it.
5552880	5556880	There's, you know, there's a hundred years on your side, so I think it's certainly
5556880	5560880	the exercise of the audience of that, and I've also seen a course in human-human
5560880	5565880	disasters, as you can see, and I'm sure you've heard about it, because certain things tend to be
5565880	5570880	different, and that's there, and in between, the modern world model of the, I think that
5570880	5573880	is the world model, and it's not as good as the modern world model.
5573880	5579880	It's part of itself, I mean, I think, I have access to every kind of, like, anything,
5579880	5581880	including your children.
5581880	5586880	So I think that's how the space needs to go in, and how the modern world has to be
5586880	5590880	experienced, and I think that's the way it's constituted by how it's going to happen, you know,
5590880	5595880	and so I think that's a really important point, and I think that, you know, that was in terms of
5595880	5599880	how it really is, as long as it's science, you know, that kind of thing, you've got
5599880	5602880	additional structures, and so on and so forth.
5602880	5610880	I think that's what we're talking about, you know, to, you know,
5610880	5620880	in order to have, you know, in a certain psychology sense, I have to be able to select from
5620880	5621880	something.
5621880	5627880	So what are the things that I'm going to select from, and what, well, you know,
5627880	5633880	the energy business, and that's from your active influence, and those are the things that
5633880	5637880	are going to have to go to the models of their future.
5637880	5642880	So I can select from those kind of actual features that are under their control.
5642880	5647880	So for example, which is that sound, which is going to have to go to models, and then
5647880	5650880	contain the consequences of that kind of thing, policies.
5650880	5656880	And I think in a position position, what we know and what we can select is the role of
5656880	5662880	the available and what we have in mind as a part of the modern world models.
5662880	5665880	So this is just a statistician's matter.
5665880	5668880	It's just amazing modern selection.
5668880	5673880	But it's quite wide, and the context is selective, it's interesting.
5673880	5681880	For me, that is also a nice, nice answer to the words, in the real world,
5681880	5685880	in the real world of employment, you know, in the real world.
5685880	5687880	And I think that's what I'm going to say.
5687880	5689880	I notice it's posing a price to age.
5689880	5691880	It's a very new price to patients.
5691880	5694880	And that's the objective model of their future.
5694880	5698880	So you wouldn't have to buy the virus, and you wouldn't have to buy some thermostat.
5698880	5703880	But it would apply to a bigger and more new kind of thing.
5703880	5706880	So that would be one thing.
5706880	5712880	There are other ways of using this in the basic level, in terms of the terms of the
5712880	5714880	casting of the virus.
5714880	5717880	I think what's more interesting now is the amount of energy that you can see
5717880	5722880	in the cell going on, and I think that's one of the various models
5722880	5725880	that are there for these people.
5725880	5732880	I think that sort of brings me to something I wanted to ask you
5732880	5736880	from the very beginning, with the free energy principle in mind,
5736880	5740880	what do you call is the meaning or purpose of life?
5740880	5753880	Well, as a physicist, I don't really have too much of a question.
5753880	5755880	It has no meaning.
5755880	5761880	So from the point of view of physicists observing a universe that was comprised of things,
5761880	5768880	what will not the free energy principle is saying is that if this universe is settling
5768880	5772880	on to an attracting set, and if they are all like attractors,
5772880	5780880	then it must be the case that it is, on average, maximizing the energy of being
5780880	5783880	on things, attracting the characteristic states.
5783880	5787880	It's just like it's rolling to the bottom of a hole.
5787880	5789880	That's it.
5789880	5792880	What way of reading that rolling to the bottom of a hole,
5792880	5799880	that convergence to the attractive set,
5799880	5805880	is in terms of a minimization of thermodynamic free energy.
5805880	5808880	The special claim that's brought to the table by the free energy principle
5808880	5811880	is the assertion of a Markov blanket.
5811880	5816880	Now, you can read the minimization of thermodynamic free energy
5816880	5822880	in terms of a minimization of certain beliefs, inference,
5822880	5826880	where the beliefs are held by internal states,
5826880	5829880	but they are about external states.
5829880	5831880	So this is important.
5831880	5835880	I've phrased it like that because of your purpose on the meaning.
5835880	5842880	So the free energy principle gives you what people like a Ramster custom,
5842880	5849880	which is exactly the same as physical mechanics,
5849880	5853880	exactly the same as physical mechanics, exactly the same as quantum mechanics.
5853880	5859880	The only difference is that you've got a Markov blanket in your partition
5859880	5861880	inside the outside.
5861880	5864880	So in this and only this situation,
5864880	5868880	when you talk about beliefs having a meaning about something else,
5868880	5871880	there is no something else unless you have a Markov blanket.
5871880	5875880	You can't get meaningful information in statistical mechanics.
5875880	5878880	It's just the probability of being in the state,
5878880	5882880	whereas in the free energy principle, it actually requires being now.
5882880	5886880	So this particular physical state has a meaning in the nation,
5886880	5891880	in every sense it is explaining its hypothesis about it is a model of
5891880	5897880	this external state about something else, this illusion of what might be out there.
5898880	5902880	So I think that the meaning of life,
5902880	5910880	if there is life in the sense of there being a Markov blanket,
5910880	5915880	there is emergent meaning and that meaning is found in the internal dynamics of life
5915880	5919880	and its meaning is established in a relational sense.
5919880	5927880	This is the relation of the internal sense making,
5927880	5930880	the measurement of your quantum physicist,
5930880	5934880	of whatever is causing these donations and the sensations
5934880	5937880	that you are using to do your measurement.
5937880	5939880	So this is a model to it.
5939880	5943880	There is a levy and an election quantum information theory,
5943880	5946880	which I'm completely subscribed to.
5946880	5948880	So that would be one way to do it.
5948880	5954880	I think a slightly more popular answer to the question would be,
5954880	5957880	well, what's the meaning in my life,
5957880	5963880	where I am one of the superior systems that has this capacity for agency
5963880	5967880	in the sense that I have very precise dynamics
5967880	5972880	and that I have the ability to model the consequences of my action
5972880	5978880	in this very particular case where I can now infer what I am going to do in the future.
5978880	5981880	There is something called expected free energy,
5981880	5987880	so you can compute the probability of a particular narrative action
5987880	5998880	trajectory into the future as basically a softmax function
5998880	6000880	of the expected free energy.
6000880	6006880	So the path into the future that has the lowest expected free energy
6006880	6009880	is the most likely action that I will follow,
6009880	6012880	and it will select very well.
6012880	6016880	I will select the path that has the lowest expected free energy.
6016880	6019880	What does that mean, expected free energy,
6019880	6028880	in the same way that you can express log evidence as equal to accuracy minus complexity,
6028880	6034880	you can express the expected free energy as the expected information
6034880	6039880	minus the expected cost, where the cost is a surprise,
6039880	6046880	the negative self-evidence that scores the characteristic state.
6046880	6052880	So if you are in a very uncharacteristic or dead dissipating,
6052880	6056880	then that would be very surprising, highly costly.
6056880	6063880	So you have now got two, like, affordances or imperatives or ams that you will select,
6063880	6070880	which is what I am reading, the meaning of life to be,
6070880	6074880	what is my life meaning, what is its purpose, what is my purpose.
6074880	6080880	Well, it is the imperatives and the libel things I choose to do.
6080880	6081880	What do I choose to do?
6081880	6084880	I choose those things that minimise my expected free energy.
6084880	6085880	What does that mean?
6085880	6090880	It means I will try to choose those things and maximise the expected information gain
6090880	6093880	or minimising the expected cost.
6093880	6096880	The expected information gain is just curiosity.
6096880	6103880	So the meaning of life for me, assuming that I am avoiding all those costly states of being,
6103880	6107880	just like, you know, don't put myself in danger or go out very much,
6107880	6109880	I get into trouble with my life,
6109880	6114880	but the majority of what I mean is the curiousity.
6114880	6121880	It is basically being a scientist, the energy principle is like a person.
6121880	6124880	I think that is a beautiful way to put it, Carl.
6124880	6127880	There are so many things I want to ask you about,
6127880	6130880	but something I often love to ask, I guess, is,
6130880	6134880	and I think it is because this gives us an idea of how you were crafted as a thinker
6134880	6137880	and how you really developed as a thinker over time.
6137880	6143880	If you had to give us a Mount Rushmore of your favourite philosophers or scientists,
6143880	6145880	who comes to mind instantly?
6145880	6148880	Who are these people who really guided your thoughts growing up
6148880	6150880	and made you the man you are today?
6150880	6154880	Because I am pretty sure when people look at your work today,
6154880	6157880	from the time when time moves on, we are going to be talking about you,
6157880	6160880	have a feeling, the same way we talk about some of the greats,
6160880	6165880	and I think it would be great to know who inspires Carl Friston.
6165880	6167880	Right, yeah.
6169880	6172880	Always a tricky question to ask that one.
6172880	6177880	One reason it is tricky is my hero is Sherlock Holmes,
6177880	6180880	but Sherlock Holmes is not a real person.
6180880	6182880	I can't because he is my hero too.
6182880	6184880	I think that is a great option.
6185880	6195880	I think the two people, when I read or reference with warm feelings
6195880	6201880	and a tinge of excitement, especially when I find their quotes,
6201880	6205880	are Helmholtz and Feynman.
6205880	6208880	Herman von Helmholtz and Richard Feynman.
6208880	6211880	Look, the Helmholtz reference, that makes sense.
6211880	6214880	I mean, when you think of unconscious inference and all your work,
6214880	6215880	it makes a lot of sense.
6215880	6218880	What about these guys really get you going?
6218880	6223880	Well, very much what probably gets you going about people like Mark Somes
6223880	6226880	and possibly me, I mean, he was a clear polymath.
6226880	6230880	I mean, if you just think about every move you make,
6230880	6233880	or certainly every move I make in my little world,
6233880	6237880	in trying to naturalise psychology and psychopathology
6238880	6242880	and more generally sort of what makes us tick,
6242880	6246880	you come across some foundational idea
6246880	6250880	or principle or decomposition that he has brought to the table.
6250880	6253880	So you've mentioned the notion of unconscious inference.
6253880	6256880	I mean, that's just basically the Bayesian brain,
6256880	6260880	as beautifully articulated by Peter Diane
6260880	6266880	and Geoffrey Hinton's Helmholtz machine in the early 90s.
6267880	6270880	So that's certainly one thing, but it doesn't stop there.
6270880	6275880	You look at his work in perception generally,
6275880	6279880	he had all the one aspect of illusion,
6279880	6283880	illusionist thinking at least, down to fine art
6283880	6287880	and anything that was worth saying at some point, even if you said it.
6287880	6291880	But more than that, of course,
6291880	6294880	the Helmholtz notion of free energy
6294880	6296880	and the contribution to thermodynamics
6296880	6298880	is also pretty central to what we're talking about.
6298880	6301880	Well, I'm the kinds of things I talk about.
6301880	6305880	Interestingly, right down to something called
6305880	6307880	the Helmholtz decomposition,
6307880	6309880	which I suspect you probably won't know about
6309880	6311880	if you're more interested in computational psychology.
6311880	6315880	So this is an expression of the fundamental theme
6315880	6318880	of, what is it, vector calculus?
6318880	6320880	No, variation, I can't remember my part.
6320880	6323880	Anyway, the Helmholtz decomposition just means
6323880	6328880	that what you can do is describe any dynamics
6328880	6332880	in terms of two effectively orthogonal parts.
6332880	6335880	One part is dissipative,
6335880	6338880	and it climbs hills or climbs down hills,
6338880	6341880	like the ball rolling down the hill.
6341880	6344880	This is the thing that generates energy.
6344880	6346880	It's a thing that does Bayesian belief
6346880	6348880	updating in an information theoretical
6348880	6351880	of the energy principle context.
6351880	6354880	And the other part is called the conservative part,
6354880	6357880	also in a solenoidal flow.
6357880	6359880	And this part, if you like,
6359880	6362880	circulates upon isocontos or potentials
6362880	6364880	or probability distributions.
6364880	6366880	So this is, if you like,
6366880	6368880	can be read in many, many different ways.
6368880	6370880	If you're an engineer,
6370880	6374880	it's a decomposition of procedures
6374880	6376880	that you would use to assimilate data
6376880	6379880	or estimate unobservable states
6379880	6381880	to do inference as an engineer
6381880	6383880	using, say, a Kalman filter.
6383880	6385880	And you would have a prediction.
6385880	6387880	So given my beliefs about states,
6387880	6390880	the prior prediction about what I'm going to sample next,
6390880	6393880	and that would be the conservative solenoidal part,
6393880	6395880	and then you would have your update,
6395880	6398880	which is basically a prediction error
6398880	6400880	weighted by its precision,
6400880	6403880	which changes my prediction, my prior belief.
6403880	6406880	And that's the, if you like, the dissipative part.
6406880	6408880	That's my engagement in the world.
6408880	6410880	That's what takes energy
6410880	6412880	and does the belief updating.
6412880	6414880	But that is written down mathematically
6414880	6417880	very beautifully by the Helmholtz decomposition.
6417880	6419880	And what it tells you
6419880	6422880	is that if you've got this,
6422880	6425880	if, by appeal to the Helmholtz decomposition,
6425880	6427880	you've got this solenoidal flow,
6427880	6429880	then you are necessarily
6429880	6432880	breaking something called detail balance
6432880	6434880	of the kind that you see
6434880	6437880	in open systems and non-equilibrium systems.
6437880	6439880	So there's a direct mathematical mapping
6439880	6442880	between the Helmholtz decomposition
6442880	6445880	and the class of systems that physicists use
6445880	6447880	and study,
6447880	6449880	which largely in the past few centuries
6449880	6451880	has been sort of
6451880	6454880	systems, closed systems that are equilibrium.
6454880	6458880	In this century, it's now all about non-equilibrium systems.
6458880	6461880	And that non-equilibrium aspect
6461880	6464880	is just due to the conservative part
6464880	6466880	of the Helmholtz decomposition.
6466880	6469880	Also, it is exactly the thing
6469880	6471880	that makes us lifelike.
6471880	6473880	It's what equips us with life cycles,
6473880	6476880	with biorhythms, with oscillations in the brain
6476880	6479880	at every scale of gammas oscillations
6479880	6482880	and our favorite hippocampal dendrite
6482880	6485880	through to our beating heart
6485880	6488880	and respiration, through to our sleep wake,
6488880	6491880	diurnal cycles, through to our life cycles,
6491880	6494880	through to the orbit of the heavenly bodies.
6495880	6498880	All of these, that's not quite a biological aspect,
6498880	6501880	but certainly for biological systems
6501880	6503880	that break detailed bounds
6503880	6506880	and have this particular kind of itinerancy,
6506880	6509880	while still maintaining their integrity
6509880	6512880	and a free energy principle.
6512880	6515880	Then you've got a description of biotic self-organization
6515880	6518880	that foregrounds oscillations and rhythms
6518880	6522880	and arenses returning to the states I was once in,
6523880	6525880	which of course is part of this
6525880	6528880	sort of keeping our stuff within characteristic states.
6528880	6531880	So I got on a little bit there about Helmholtz.
6531880	6534880	You can see why you're such a fan of Helmholtz.
6534880	6536880	I mean, it's clear.
6536880	6538880	You can see the joy in your face when you're talking about this,
6538880	6540880	and it's very fascinating work as well.
6540880	6543880	It makes sense why this really gets you going.
6543880	6545880	And Feynman, what about Feynman, really?
6545880	6547880	Because Feynman, I'm a huge fan of Feynman's work.
6547880	6550880	Sometimes even for fun, I end up watching Feynman lectures
6550880	6553880	just to keep me calm at night.
6553880	6557880	Yeah, it's one side of the entertainment
6557880	6559880	that I can enjoy.
6559880	6561880	My wife watches as well.
6561880	6564880	My wife is a nurse and not into the physics.
6566880	6570880	But yeah, now he's a very alluring personality.
6570880	6574880	But if you didn't know this,
6574880	6577880	it's possibly worthwhile just saying out loud,
6577880	6581880	I mean, the variational free energy was his invention.
6581880	6584880	So he was trying to, well,
6584880	6587880	one reading of the history is that it was his invention.
6587880	6591880	You could have good arguments with Russian mathematicians
6591880	6597880	that can get at compression and free energy minimization
6597880	6599880	from the point of view of algorithmic complexity
6599880	6603880	via things like soft induction and the like.
6603880	6605880	And certainly there is a school of thought
6605880	6609880	that really celebrates that sort of compression view
6609880	6615880	that is described by free energy minimization.
6615880	6620880	But the Feynman view is much more closer
6620880	6626880	to my academic training and inheritance.
6626880	6629880	So what he was trying to do
6629880	6633880	was to solve exactly the impossible marginalization problem
6633880	6635880	that people would try to solve
6635880	6638880	if they wanted to engage in exact base and inference,
6638880	6641880	exact sense making, the exact statistics
6641880	6647880	to actually get a grip of the very best explanation
6647880	6652880	of this metaphysical world that of course doesn't exist.
6652880	6654880	But that's intractable in the same sense
6654880	6658880	that he couldn't possibly integrate over all the paths
6658880	6660880	a small particle say an electron
6660880	6662880	would take in quantum electrodynamics.
6662880	6666880	He couldn't possibly normalize that probability distribution
6666880	6671880	by integrating over all the universe of paths
6671880	6675880	an electron could take.
6675880	6679880	So what he did was to dissolve that problem
6679880	6683880	by converting this inference marginalization integration problem
6683880	6685880	into an optimization problem.
6685880	6689880	And he did it by creating this band on the quantity
6689880	6694880	he wanted to optimize, namely the log marginal likelihood
6694880	6696880	which is the variation of the energy.
6696880	6700880	So that's all of the Feynman view principle.
6700880	6705880	It's greatest debt, I think,
6705880	6707880	but that's not quite fair on health health
6707880	6711880	so everybody else runs through from a cat through to a...
6711880	6713880	And base all the way through.
6713880	6715880	Everybody, yeah.
6715880	6717880	There's certainly people you couldn't mention.
6717880	6720880	Anyway, certainly from a technical point of view
6720880	6725880	that that pathological formulation is so beautiful
6725880	6730880	and it is leveraged directly,
6730880	6732880	certainly in my personal work
6732880	6735880	and the way that I would formalize the free energy principles.
6735880	6736880	Not the only way to...
6736880	6738880	You could read the free energy principles
6738880	6741880	as dual to James's maximum entropy principle
6741880	6745880	but when read or written as a...
6745880	6747880	in its pathological form,
6747880	6751880	that is really a homage to Feynman's original conceptions.
6751880	6754880	But as you say, he's such a delightful person to watch as well.
6754880	6758880	And like me, he was a committed smoker, so I like that.
6758880	6761880	Yes, you love your cigars, I know that.
6761880	6765880	I often think about that video of Feynman
6765880	6768880	where he's talking about a red flower, I think it was.
6768880	6772880	And he says his friend, his artist friend,
6772880	6774880	looks at this flower and then tells him,
6774880	6777880	you as a scientist, you're obviously going to break this down
6777880	6778880	and ruin it.
6778880	6780880	And he's like, no, no, no, it's actually because I'm a scientist,
6780880	6783880	I'm going to look at the cells beneath the flowers.
6783880	6786880	I'm going to look at every single flow of each atom.
6786880	6788880	He's going to look at every single aspect of this flower
6788880	6790880	in so much greater detail
6790880	6793880	that it only increases in its complexity and beauty.
6793880	6796880	And to him, the flower is far more beautiful because of this.
6796880	6798880	And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier
6798880	6801880	and I think that's something that you guys have in common.
6802880	6805880	Yeah, and with you apparently with you.
6805880	6809880	It's beautiful because Feynman has that perfect way
6809880	6811880	of blending the science with the art.
6811880	6813880	And that brings me to this question.
6813880	6817880	I wanted to ask you, when are you going to make or write a book?
6817880	6820880	Because your work is so complex to a point
6820880	6823880	where most people really don't know how to approach it.
6823880	6826880	When it comes to whether it's a neuroscientist, psychologist,
6826880	6828880	physicist, if they don't understand the work,
6828880	6830880	they're going to find it very difficult.
6830880	6832880	Have you ever thought of writing a book
6832880	6835880	that is a bit more for the layman out there?
6835880	6843880	Yeah, no, I'm notoriously bad at writing accessible photos
6843880	6847880	of a kind I think would be required for a book.
6847880	6849880	So I'm probably not going to.
6849880	6852880	What I've found tends to work best
6852880	6856880	is to have the next generation of people
6856880	6858880	who are much more fluent.
6858880	6861880	Usually either because they're sort of
6861880	6866880	in a person facing kind of science
6866880	6869880	like psychology or medicine
6869880	6872880	or they've had a philosophical training.
6872880	6875880	So I find these people are much better
6875880	6879880	than I am at articulating in prose and narrative form the ideas.
6879880	6882880	So they can write the books.
6882880	6886880	I'm just sitting back and I did try once.
6887880	6890880	There's a book called Robert Pryor,
6890880	6892880	Robert Pryor, MIT Press,
6892880	6896880	who has been asking me for at least three decades
6896880	6899880	when I go into writing the Free Energy Principle book.
6899880	6901880	And he thinks he's got precedence
6901880	6903880	because his surname is Pryor.
6903880	6908880	So he thinks any book that appeals to the major pain,
6908880	6910880	especially the Free Energy Principle,
6910880	6912880	has to be commissioned by him.
6912880	6914880	And he was absolutely right,
6914880	6917880	but the problem is there is stuff I can write,
6917880	6920880	it's so torturous.
6920880	6922880	And I have to say that, you know,
6922880	6924880	as with the Free Energy Principle itself,
6924880	6926880	with its emphasis on complexity minimization,
6926880	6929880	namely providing a parsimonious explanation,
6929880	6932880	the Free Energy Principle becomes simpler and simpler,
6932880	6934880	the longer it baronates, certainly in my head.
6934880	6937880	So I've taken now every year now,
6937880	6941880	I write a paper describing how a simpler version
6941880	6943880	and a simpler version, that process will go on
6943880	6945880	at some point it may be sufficiently simple
6945880	6948880	to be attractive to Robert Pryor
6948880	6951880	or any other editor who invites me
6951880	6954880	or asks me the question that you've just been asking.
6954880	6957880	My suspicion is I will probably be retired or die
6957880	6959880	before that was derived.
6959880	6964880	So, you know, but there are some wonderful renditions
6964880	6967880	of the Free Energy Pro and Con.
6967880	6969880	But certainly most recently,
6969880	6972880	the Active Inference book by Thomas Parr
6972880	6974880	and Giovanna Pazzullo, you know,
6974880	6977880	I actually say it there that, you know,
6977880	6982880	I was allowed to write the forward, but nothing else.
6982880	6984880	Yeah, that's okay.
6984880	6985880	I was just about to ask you,
6985880	6986880	what are some of the reading recommendations?
6986880	6987880	I think that's definitely one.
6987880	6988880	That's on top.
6988880	6992880	That's actually a book that I want to read desperately.
6992880	6994880	And I cannot wait.
6994880	6996880	If you had to recommend us any other books,
6996880	6999880	what type of books would you recommend
6999880	7001880	to either increase our knowledge with regards
7001880	7004880	to the Free Energy Principle or Active Inference in general,
7004880	7008880	or just books that you find help a scientist,
7008880	7014880	philosopher in general to grow in this field?
7014880	7018880	I'm afraid I'm not going to give you a very good answer
7018880	7019880	for that.
7019880	7020880	There's a reason for that.
7020880	7021880	There are two reasons.
7021880	7024880	One, I don't have time to read books.
7024880	7028880	When you get to my age, you tend to be,
7028880	7031880	you get asked to write blurb for books.
7031880	7034880	So I have to speed read certain chapters of books,
7034880	7039880	but I don't actually have time in my working life
7039880	7040880	to read books.
7040880	7043880	I can only review papers and scientific proposals.
7043880	7046880	That's even working seven days a week.
7046880	7048880	Any papers that come to mind?
7048880	7050880	Any papers that come to mind?
7050880	7051880	Oh, there are lots of papers.
7051880	7055880	Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you what they are
7055880	7060880	because the people I don't mention will be very, very upset.
7060880	7065880	So I'm not very good at reading books nor recommending books.
7065880	7069880	So what I'm going to do is what my father is.
7069880	7073880	So he sometimes sends me books to read,
7073880	7075880	which he thinks are good for me.
7075880	7077880	So I'm just going to mention the last one that I read,
7077880	7079880	literally a couple of weeks ago,
7079880	7082880	which is Hell Go Land by Carlo Rovelli.
7082880	7084880	I really like that.
7084880	7087880	So that would, I would certainly recommend that.
7087880	7091880	And I think that had color written that last year,
7091880	7093880	as opposed to I think 2014,
7093880	7095880	there would have been more emphasis
7095880	7097880	because the Friended Bridge Bridge is just that,
7097880	7099880	you know, that viewpoint,
7099880	7102880	I think articulated slightly more in a classical setting,
7102880	7105880	in particular the pathogen formulation of Richard Feynman.
7105880	7107880	So I really enjoyed that.
7107880	7110880	Otherwise, if people are generally interested,
7110880	7113880	there are lots of wonderful papers, usually by philosophers,
7113880	7115880	usually by, again, people like Andy Clark,
7115880	7119880	Jacob Howe, and Maxwell Ramstead,
7119880	7124880	you know, when he's wearing his philosophy hat.
7124880	7126880	But there are also lots of really wonderful other,
7126880	7128880	but you can just go to a repository.
7128880	7131880	So Baron Edge has got a nice repository and GitHub
7131880	7133880	of his favorite FEP papers.
7133880	7136880	There's something called the Active Inference Institute,
7136880	7138880	by Daniel Friedman,
7138880	7142880	that is dedicated to trying to organize the material
7142880	7145880	in a didactic or pedagogical way.
7145880	7147880	They're actually writing now, I think,
7147880	7149880	another Active Inference book,
7149880	7152880	which is an explainer for Thomas's and Giovanni's
7152880	7154880	Active Inference book.
7154880	7156880	So if you're interested, I think you go to the people
7156880	7161880	actually know how to teach and articulate these ideas.
7161880	7163880	It's funny because one of the last people,
7163880	7165880	well, this was actually a year ago now that I think about it,
7165880	7168880	who talks about hierarchical Bayesian brains
7168880	7170880	and Active Inference.
7170880	7171880	It was Lisa Feldman.
7171880	7172880	Oh, yes.
7172880	7173880	Yes.
7173880	7174880	And one of the books.
7174880	7175880	Yes, exactly.
7175880	7177880	And the book she recommended was Halkeland.
7177880	7179880	And this was just when the book came out.
7179880	7181880	So it's funny that you both basically talk around
7181880	7184880	the same topic and recommend the same book.
7184880	7186880	So it clearly is an impactful book in general.
7186880	7187880	Yeah.
7187880	7189880	Well, she's also written some very influential stuff
7189880	7190880	in the emotional sphere.
7190880	7192880	And there's now, you know,
7192880	7195880	quite a key player in the Active Inference,
7195880	7197880	but certainly the emotional inference
7197880	7199880	and intercepted inference field,
7199880	7202880	along with Anil Seth and colleagues.
7202880	7207880	Just to close off called any theories of consciousness,
7207880	7211880	the brain that you feel sort of go against
7211880	7213880	the free energy principle,
7213880	7216880	anything that you know stands out that counter argues
7216880	7220880	this principle in a way that does sort of get you,
7220880	7223880	get you shield up.
7223880	7225880	No, I'm afraid not.
7225880	7227880	I think that probably affects the fact that I don't have
7227880	7228880	a philosophical training.
7228880	7231880	So I don't, you know, I'm not used to adversarial progression,
7231880	7234880	adversarial argumentative approaches.
7234880	7238880	No, I don't, you know, the whole point of the free energy principle
7238880	7242880	is it has to explain everything or it's, it explains nothing.
7242880	7245880	So if there is a viable theory of consciousness out there,
7245880	7248880	there has to be some way of, if you like,
7248880	7253880	reframing it or substantiating that right theory
7253880	7256880	by naturalizing it using the free energy principle.
7256880	7258880	Remember, free energy principle can never be wrong,
7258880	7260880	so it doesn't need to defend itself.
7260880	7262880	It's just a method or a tool,
7262880	7265880	very much like Hamilton's principle of least reaction.
7265880	7268880	Inherently unfalsifiable.
7268880	7269880	Yeah.
7269880	7270880	Yeah.
7270880	7273880	And I think just, I'd like to say thank you so much
7273880	7274880	for all your work.
7274880	7276880	I clearly supported in the fact that I,
7276880	7280880	I quoted you a couple of times, referenced you numerous times.
7280880	7282880	So to me, it is replicable.
7282880	7285880	It is work that a lot of us are using out there.
7285880	7288880	So from my side, I just want to say thank you so much, Col.
7288880	7289880	It's a pleasure.
7289880	7291880	It's an absolute honor to actually chat to you.
7291880	7294880	And I really enjoyed this conversation.
7294880	7295880	Well, so am I.
7295880	7298880	You've asked some really excellent questions.
7298880	7301880	You've kept me on my toes, but also kept me smiling.
7301880	7302880	Thank you very much.
7306880	7308880	Thank you.
