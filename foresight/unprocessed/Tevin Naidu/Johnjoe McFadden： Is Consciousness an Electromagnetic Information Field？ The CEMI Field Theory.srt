1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Jaja, you have a great approach of addressing the problems of consciousness. You go through

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
the why, the how, the why not, the what, the where. So these are talking about the heart

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,600
problem, the binding problem. What is the difference between conscious and unconscious

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,520
brain processes? Where is the seat of consciousness? So I'd like you to start this conversation by

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,040
running us through these processes. And in doing so, I'd also appreciate if you could talk me

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
through your views on all of this prior to your quantum biology revolution, because it's always

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,040
interesting to see how someone's view changes over time as well, regarding your concepts.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,280
Okay. So first, why are we interested in consciousness? Because if you look, if you

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,680
get to the butcher shop and you look at a brain from a cow, it just looks like meat. That's what

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,320
our brain would look like, a lump of meat. And the strangest thing in the universe, in my view,

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,680
is the fact that a lump of meat can know it's there. And that to me is profoundly puzzling. And

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,480
strange, because nothing else outside of that lump of meat inside our heads and presumably other

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,080
people's or other animal's head has this property of knowing itself, knowing that it is around,

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:39,440
that it is a thing. And that property is kind of mysterious, because it's outside of science.

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,880
Science does not talk about this. It's not an area that can ever look inside our heads. And this

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,040
describes our experience. It's only a first person account that we can have a go of our

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,640
experience. And yet, it's the most important part of us. It's what would life be like if we were

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,760
totally zombies, as the conscious community tends to call it. If we were zombies that have no

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,320
consciousness, what would be the purpose of life then? So it's profoundly important. It's something

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:21,360
that, in one way or another, I've always had an interest in. I've always been interested in the

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,120
history of ideas and history of ideas going back to the myths and stories and the religious basis

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,360
of where the religion comes from. It seems to come from the same question, really, that what is it

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,000
that's inside us that is the us that is important to us and makes us feel that we're worth

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:51,040
maintaining our life. So that, to me, is the most profound and interesting question of not only

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,520
science and the whole of the world. Of course, not only science deals with the puzzle of

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:08,000
consciousness, lots of literature and art also is around this strange understanding we have of

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,320
ourselves and our perceptions. So that's always been the puzzle. And I didn't really get interested

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,600
in trying to figure it out scientifically until over 20, 25 years ago, something like that, I guess,

29
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:40,160
when I was, I wrote a book called Quantum Evolution, it was published in 2000. I became

30
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,560
interested in the idea that quantum mechanics may be involved in life, in life more generally,

31
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,760
not consciousness at this stage, but I thought it might be involved in evolution and I grew in

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,320
touch with the, because I didn't know very much if anything at all about quantum mechanics, I got

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,400
in touch with Jim Alcalely, who is a famous broadcaster and physicist, who was at the same

34
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,520
university as me at the University of Surrey. And we, and it was then about evolution and mutation

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,400
and whether quantum mechanics may be involved in this. And, you know, we're still pursuing that

36
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,920
at the University of Surrey and unraveling that question of whether quantum mechanics is involved

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:36,400
in mutation. But it did get me profoundly interested in the role of quantum mechanics in life more

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:46,400
generally. And then I thought it's a book and I persuaded a publisher to give me an advance to

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,160
write it, which was called Quantum Evolution. Now, in the book proposal, I had chapter 13,

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,600
which was reserved for probably the most famous consciousness idea, the idea put forward by

41
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Roger Penrose and Stuart Hammerhoff, that consciousness can be explained by quantum

42
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,320
mechanics and it's going to do gravity and gravitational collapse of wave functions.

43
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,480
That sounded kind of interesting. And I thought, well, that's a good thing for chapter 13. That was

44
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,080
the final chapter of the book, which otherwise looked at things like enzymes and DNA and that

45
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,040
kind of thing. So, but chapter 13, I thought, okay, it's consciousness. And then when I started

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,480
reading it, I knew enough about quantum mechanics at the time to kind of gave me pause and thought,

47
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,200
well, actually, what they're proposing, Hammerhoff and Penrose doesn't work.

48
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,960
They propose an interesting idea that structures called microtubules in the brain, which transport

49
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,320
neurotransmitters up and down neurons, that they could be in a quantum mechanical state.

50
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,480
And by this time, by the time I got to chapter 13, when writing the book, I'll get

51
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,800
new a lot about quantum mechanics, a lot more than I did before I put it down as a topic for

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,120
chapter 13. And I realized, no, that's not going to work. Microtubules are the busiest structures

53
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,240
in the brain and always doing stuff. There's no way they could be in a quantum mechanical state.

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,280
So I was convinced by their story, but reading Roger Penrose is, I then read Roger Penrose's

55
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,680
book, Emperor of the Mind. Emperor of the Mind, the Emperor of the New Clothes,

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,040
as I think of Roger Penrose, his book, On Consciousness, who come to me the title in a moment,

57
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,200
but he convinced me that consciousness is a kind of field. And that's the fundamental idea that

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,440
goes behind all of young field theories of consciousness and my own idea that when I look

59
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,760
at my window here in the UK, and I see trees, I see wall, I see people moving around,

60
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,440
I don't see them as independent things. They're all part of a single structure,

61
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:13,680
which is my conscious mind. And how do you account for that in science? When, if we encode

62
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,520
information, say, in a computer, it's all split down into binary digits. And one binary digit will

63
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,480
be there, another will be over there, and they're all distributed all over the place. And this

64
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:31,360
brings us to the binding problem, which is a famous problem in consciousness, that how is all

65
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,040
the information bound up in your brain, or the matter is divided up into lots of discrete units,

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,520
like atoms and neurons, et cetera, biomolecules or microtubules, they're all separate stuff.

67
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,560
And information is distributed amongst all of them. So for example, if I'm looking at the trees

68
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,480
across the road, facets of the trees such as the color of the leaves, the color of the bark,

69
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,560
the shape of the leaves, the texture, the movement of the branches as they're swaying in the wind,

70
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
all of those facets are encoded in different parts of our brains, in different neurons,

71
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,800
in different areas of the brain. But that's not what it feels like. It feels like our conscious

72
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,320
mind is stuck together. It's a single physical entity of which we are at the center of. And

73
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,360
how do you make that? And what Roger Penrose proposed in his Emperor of the Mind, or whatever the

74
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,760
book is called, something like that, is that it was a field. And what we mean by field is like

75
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,320
the gravitational field that holds us, holds me on my seat at the moment. If you're standing up,

76
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,160
it holds you to the ground. And the field is everywhere around, it's invisible, it's everywhere.

77
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
But the field that the soul of your feet, if you're standing on the ground is an integration

78
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,040
of the mass of your body and the mass of the entire planet. That's what's holding you at

79
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,160
the soles of your feet to the ground. And that's kind of remarkable. And that's feature of fields,

80
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,920
physical fields, that all of the information is distributed everywhere within the field. It is

81
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:20,240
indivisible. There's no place where the soles of your feet or the continent of Australia,

82
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,880
which is contributing to you being standing at that point, it's everywhere within the field. It's

83
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,000
not just in Australia, it's at the soles of your feet as well, that information which provides a

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,160
little bit of the gravitational force that holds you there. And that's really I thought what we

85
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,560
needed for consciousness. Penrose thought that many people before him have thought that. And

86
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,760
when I did more research, it goes back to guest out philosophers back in the early part of the

87
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,800
20th century, they also proposed that consciousness was some kind of field. But that kind of fell

88
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,360
out of favor when neuroscientists started studying the brain and seeing that when you see neurons,

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,960
you don't see fields, you see neurons and they communicate by these synapses and neuron firing

90
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,880
and all that kind of stuff. And that doesn't involve fields. So the idea that consciousness

91
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:25,760
was some kind of field fell into disuse, if you like. Penrose re-energized it with his proposal

92
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,360
that it was a quantum field. But the quantum mechanics, what quantum mechanics does is it

93
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:39,360
turns matter into a field. So if you have an atom of matter that's behaving quantum mechanically,

94
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,960
then it doesn't have a fixed position in space, just like the information of the

95
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,520
of the mass of Australia isn't a fixed position in the gravitational field of the earth, it's

96
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:57,360
everywhere. Well, an atom can be everywhere in quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics is really

97
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,480
a science about fields. So if there was in the brain a quantum mechanical field, then it could

98
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,280
account for consciousness. But the problem is in making quantum mechanical fields out of matter

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,240
is hard. Normally, you have to have a very simple system, an atom or two in a box cooled down to

100
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,920
absolute zero as close as you can get to it in a vacuum on an optical table, which will remove any

101
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,280
vibrations or anything. And when you've got all this, you might retain a quantum mechanical state,

102
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,920
those two or three atoms can behave as a single entity for, you know,

103
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,720
in picoseconds or some very short length of time. But that's not going to happen in the brain.

104
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,520
So although I was convinced that quantum that consciousness is a field, I wasn't convinced

105
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,720
that it could be done by a matter field quantum mechanical matter field. So I looked around for

106
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,280
what is there any other field in the brain. And of course, there is the field that people have

107
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,240
been looking at for over a century, even then when I was first thinking about it,

108
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,640
people knew that was the brain generates its own electromagnetic field. And that electromagnetic

109
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,720
field is what physicians measure when they put the electrodes on your skull to do an EEG,

110
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,000
they've been measuring it for 100 years or more. And mostly they've thought it's just

111
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,000
there's just a consequence of the brain's activity, but doesn't impact on the brain's

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,800
activity in any way. It's often described as the steam whistle of a steam train generates

113
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,440
a whistle, we know about it, you can detect it with the EEG electrodes, but it doesn't function in

114
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,000
any way. But it occurred to me, well, if consciousness isn't in the matter of the brain,

115
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
in the electromagnetic field generated by brain, the brain's activity,

116
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,920
then it already has some very interesting properties. For example, it contains all of the

117
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,520
information in firing neurons. And that's kind of useful, because we've got an awful lot of

118
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,560
information on conscious mind, it's distributed all over the brain. But in the brain's ear and field

119
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,720
is everywhere within the brain's EM field. So that was kind of good. But it also has a very

120
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:33,760
interesting property. And that's to do with how fields interact. And this, to me, was the key

121
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,880
to thinking, wow, this could really be it. At that time, Francis Crick started to work on

122
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,600
consciousness and the Nobel Prize winners for discovering the structure of DNA. Before Francis

123
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,080
Crick worked on consciousness, working on consciousness as a scientist was like working

124
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:02,320
on fairies. I'm going to study fairies from now on. It was a career destroying move, if you said

125
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,640
you're going to work on consciousness. Nobody worked on consciousness. It was considered only

126
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,280
crackbots worked on consciousness. But then this mega brain, Francis Crick started to work on

127
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,240
consciousness and suddenly became respectable to think about consciousness. So he put a lot of

128
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,920
gave conscious the consciousness field a really big boost. What he said was the best way to get

129
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,080
into studying the brain is first of all, start with looking at the correlates of consciousness.

130
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,240
What that means is, when we, for example, I'm always losing my glasses on them.

131
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,600
When I take them off and I can't find them, and they're somewhere on a very messy desktop,

132
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm looking at that desktop and I can't see my glasses, then suddenly I can see them.

133
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Now, what happens between the millisecond before I saw them, when I was looking at them,

134
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,600
the image of them was on my retina, but I still wasn't seeing them. And then suddenly I can see

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:11,680
them. What happens in that few milliseconds between the image entering my retina, being in

136
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,840
my brain, being processed, but I'm not seeing them. And when you see, when you become consciously

137
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,760
aware of my glasses, in this case, and what a number of studies have demonstrated in the 1990s

138
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,120
mostly, and the early 2000s, is that the best correlates of consciousness is not the neuron

139
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:40,720
firing per se, but when neurons fire in sync. Though I'll be nearly there to the end of the

140
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,000
where we get to the next moment. But when they fire in sync, you become conscious. Now, that's a

141
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,960
bit of a puzzle, because neurons process information in independent, you know, the shape of my

142
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,400
glasses, the colors of my glasses, all of those features will be processed in independent neurons.

143
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,280
They're all firing, but not in sync. And then they get in sync, and suddenly I'm aware of them. Why?

144
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,880
Informate, they're going through the same neural pathways, as we know.

145
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,560
But there's a feature of electromagnetic waves, which explains it. When electromagnetic waves,

146
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:23,840
like any wave, if they're waving in sync, then they have what's called constructive interference.

147
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,600
The signal is amplified, because all of the waves peak some troughs, match up, and you get a bigger

148
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,720
signal. It's like two waves in the sea. If they're waving in sync, then you're going to get a bigger

149
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,040
wave. Whereas if they're waving out of sync, then the wave will be destroyed. So if consciousness

150
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,000
is the brain's electromagnetic field, then we would expect it to correlate with

151
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,320
synchronously firing neurons. And in the 1990s, that was demonstrated in monkeys and mice,

152
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,800
and later in humans. That is the best correlate of consciousness. So it just made sense to me that,

153
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,520
okay, all we need to do is switch from the matter of the brain to the electromagnetic field of the

154
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,480
brain, you solve the binding problem, all your information is stuck together, and it matches

155
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,680
up with the strongest correlates of consciousness, synchronous firing. And he explains why synchronous

156
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:22,000
firing is associated with consciousness. So that was a revelation to me. And then it all made sense,

157
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,760
and I thought, well, surely someone must have published about this idea before. I searched

158
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,680
around, and no one did. Well, I might as well put a paper or two in, and I did. I met and had published

159
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:41,040
a couple of papers on this idea. And that was more than 20 years ago now. And mostly it's been

160
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,520
not taken seriously for most of those two decades or so. But now it's beginning to gain some momentum

161
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,520
partly because of all the other theories of consciousness have kind of failed to really

162
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,880
make progress in understanding a phenomenon where people say, well, we need something else.

163
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,040
And I think that's what we need. The understanding the brains in field is where our conscious mind

164
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,440
sits. So a very long explanation that gets us to the beginning of the story.

165
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,720
I mean, this is just the very beginning for for all those who are not familiar. Let's let's let's

166
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,240
define it. I mean, you call it the consciousness electromagnetic information theory, field theory,

167
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,000
sorry, so the semi field theory. Do you want to define that for people? Yeah, so it's conscious

168
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,320
information because it's encodes information and information. I mean information about the outside

169
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,160
world. So this excludes EM fields that generated by toasters and stuff like this, which are not

170
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,200
really communicating anything useful about the outside world. So it's information that is from

171
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,080
our senses. And that gets from our memory and neurons, they get transmitted into the brains in

172
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,760
field. And what is interesting about the brains in field that was discovered more

173
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,920
after my first papers on consciousness is that it does influence neuron firing. Because if that's

174
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,720
all that happened, if it was transmitted, the information is transmitted into the brains in

175
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,160
field, then who cares? It's there. It's a reflection of the information in the brain, but it's not

176
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,920
doing anything. But if if the brains in field influences neuron firing, then it can have a

177
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,600
feedback that your conscious mind can start pulling on the levers of the neurons. And that's

178
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,200
exactly what it's done. It's it does lots of studies, including some more recently, my own lab

179
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,160
have looked at the effect of EM fields on neurons and neurons are both transmitters

180
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,280
of information into the brain's electromagnetic field. But they are also receivers of that

181
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,920
information. So it provides a loop of information from the neurons going into the brain's electromagnetic

182
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,160
field where it all gets joined up. And there you can start thinking because that's where your

183
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,360
thinking is happening in your conscious mind. And then your thoughts can influence your brain,

184
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,320
can pull on the levers of neurons to do the kind of actions that we call our free will.

185
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:16,480
That's the fascinating component of this is that you you've taken this complex subject of

186
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,560
consciousness and which is a very deep philosophical question in its own right. And then you've also

187
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,240
managed to now approach another topic that people often discuss in various different debates,

188
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,560
which is free will. You've managed to tie these two concepts together. And it's interesting because

189
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,160
when you first spoke about this, when I first read about it many years ago,

190
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,720
I thought about the fact that people think about electromagnetic fields and they talk about it,

191
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,760
particularly scientists, in a very mystical manner, you know, so like this is, and this is

192
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,880
especially true in medicine as a doctor, I see it when you talk to another biologist or a doctor

193
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
that when you start talking about anything regarding electromagnetic fields, they start to

194
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,400
think that you're going down some sort of spiritual mystical, non-physical realm. Has that been what's

195
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,880
been occurring to you as well? Do you feel like your theory is automatically placed in this group

196
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,760
of mysticism? And that's not the case. Is this not ultimately a physicalist theory, if I'm not

197
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,960
mistaken? Yeah, I think that that is a problem. That's one of the reasons why it's taken a while

198
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,040
for it to become at least partly accepted, because it is grouped along with the wacky stuff, if you

199
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,280
like. Yes, we have crystal therapists who are putting crystals on your body and claiming there's

200
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,000
some electromagnetic field coming in and helping to heal you, and people talk about trees having

201
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,720
these electromagnetic field auras around them, so it kind of plays into all of that, but it shouldn't.

202
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,200
Electromagnetism is fundamentally scientific, since the work of Max Waller who showed that light,

203
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:04,880
the light that we see is electromagnetism. It's a form of energy that comes from the sun. It's all

204
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,400
electromagnetism. In fact, all of the things that happen on our world pretty much apart from gravity

205
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,680
are all down to electromagnetism in one way or another. Chemistry is really all electromagnetism.

206
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,560
It's pretty much everything that happens that we see is about electromagnetic interactions.

207
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:31,040
It's not spooky at all, but it is not physical. Sorry, it's not material. It's not material,

208
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,280
and that's the key difference that makes people kind of hesitant about it, because it's invisible.

209
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,040
You can't see it. When you look at the brain, you see a big lump of matter and say, well,

210
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,120
that's it. That's the brain. That's all that's happening. The dead brain, it's not happening

211
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,000
well, but a live brain has an invisible electromagnetic field, which is just as rich in information

212
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,560
as the brain's neurons. But as I said, it has that extra property of all the information being

213
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,960
joined up as joined up as the information in a single photon or a single electron. It is completely

214
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,640
physically united within the brain's electromagnetic field, and thereby binds the information in our

215
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,280
conscious mind. So, yes, it's not materialist theory, but it is a figureless, physicalist

216
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,400
theory. And that, I think, is when people say they're materialist, after me, it shouldn't really be

217
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,000
saying that I have physicalists, because you can't explain our world with just material. You have to

218
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,680
pretty much everything that happens is an interaction between fields, our current understanding of what

219
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,120
matter is, what an atom is, and electron is. They are perturbations of fields, of electromagnetic

220
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:50,800
field, gravitational fields, nuclear forces. They are all perturbations of fields. So ultimately,

221
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,840
everything is fields. So this isn't a wacky idea at all. It's no more wacky than a materialist.

222
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,720
Just because we can see matter doesn't make it not a field. It really is fundamentally

223
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,520
another kind of field. It reminds me of one of the things you want. I mean, you mentioned this

224
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,920
earlier as well, but the way you describe meat, and just this lump of meat, I mean, when you talk

225
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:26,960
about that way, it sort of highlights this degree of absurdity. And it almost down and brings your

226
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,120
theory back into sort of a normal realm of debate and chat, which is an important way to approach

227
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,320
this. But I have noticed that other people also seem to have semi-field theories as well. And some

228
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
of those do tend to go into the spiritual realms. And I think that's also hindering your own process

229
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,280
and your own research. Yeah, I agree. I agree. There is a lovely story, actually, by a short story.

230
00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,800
You can find it online. It's easily found by Terry Bison called They're Made of Meat. It's a story

231
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:09,760
of aliens who discover in some far distant galaxy an intelligence and sentience. And they're all

232
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,280
excited about this. And then one of the aliens says, but the strange thing about this sentience

233
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,440
is they're made of meat. And they're a gas. What? You mean that's stopped me by a butcher that we

234
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,280
eat and chop and make steaks out of? That can't be sentient. That's just nonsense. And then you

235
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,200
go on and on and on. And essentially, they decide to suppress the idea. It's so bizarre that

236
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,240
consciousness could be made of meat. But that is what everyone else thinks. And it is far more

237
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,640
bizarre to think that meat can be conscious than it is to think that electromagnetic field can be

238
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,040
conscious. The latter is much more sensible and realistic and less wacky than the idea of a lump

239
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,840
of meat is conscious. So, yeah. But yes, you're right. The spiritual stuff, I try to be very

240
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,840
rigorous and not get into those deeply philosophical questions about meaning of life and things like

241
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,080
this and panpsychism and all those kind of things and try to keep to the nuts and bolts of the,

242
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,680
because I think there is a danger in many fields that they can get corrupted by

243
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:29,680
sloppy thinking, sloppy kind of mystical thinking. And I'd like to keep it very scientific,

244
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
scientific and grounded.

245
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,440
John Jo, do you worry about the fact that even when people talk about materialist theories of

246
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,200
consciousness, so whether it's matter, some sort of neuronal firing, whether it's a global workspace,

247
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,640
whether it's integrated information, people are still going to be concerned that these

248
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:58,480
electromagnetic fields are still merely correlates. And do you think that that still satisfies,

249
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,440
satisfies the thirst that some people have for a theory that does not have this correlation

250
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,760
issue? Because as we all know, correlation does not equal causation. The information.

251
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah, absolutely. Essentially, we have to take a jump somewhere, but I think we have to make

252
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:23,520
the jump as small as possible. And ultimately, we have to come around to the idea that something

253
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,680
in our bodies is conscious. Okay, we know that we're conscious or something is conscious. And

254
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,600
that's usually bizarre. I mean, as we said, we just made them out of meat and blood and bones

255
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,840
and all the rest of it. And some part of it is gone. If I told you that your bones were conscious,

256
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,920
you'd say, no, crazy, but it's no more crazy than believing the meat of your brain is conscious.

257
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,720
So somewhere, because we have our own introspective experience of being aware,

258
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,480
that's got to be a property of something in our brain. So we've got to pin it down somewhere.

259
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,200
If we pin it on the matter of the brain, we're stuck with the binding problem. How does it get

260
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,920
stuck together to give us our experience? If we put it in the brain's electromagnetic field,

261
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,520
then that solves that fundamental problem of consciousness. And a lot more, it makes sense

262
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:20,000
in lots of different ways that we haven't gone into yet. But it's got to go somewhere. And somewhere

263
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,920
we've got to take the wacky leap and say that, okay, this thing that we thought was not aware,

264
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,320
not conscious, is conscious. Because otherwise, how are we talking at the moment? Why are we

265
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,400
arguing about it? Consciousness is a thing. Awareness is a thing. It's got to be pinned on

266
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,440
something. The unfilled is the best one.

267
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,760
Judge, some people have new theories of understanding the brain-body connection and sort of

268
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,280
there are these new concepts like embodied cognition. The fact that we have a brain-gut

269
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,760
axis, we've got relationships between our body and brain that are separate entities,

270
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,560
almost like having two brains in a sense. The fields you're talking about are consistent with

271
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,200
the brain. But what does that have to do with sort of serotonin receptors in the gut,

272
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
other areas of the body? Does this entwine into these?

273
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't think it makes any difference from, if you believe consciousness is a matter of the brain

274
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,880
or consciousness is the field of the brain, then we still have, it doesn't differentiate

275
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,800
between the two theories in terms of whether there's a wider consciousness in, say, the gut

276
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:44,240
or anywhere else. I don't think you need to, I mean, I'm a donor, a kidney donor,

277
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:54,000
I gave my kidney. I don't think I passed any of my consciousness to her when I gave her a kidney.

278
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,800
She is not good. She still doesn't like the things I like to eat. She doesn't like the music.

279
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,880
So I don't think, yes, there is nothing about the body consciousness and things like that,

280
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,120
which convinces me that anything outside the brain needs to be conscious. Because all of those

281
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,600
areas that we think we are embodied in the rest of our body and in our gut axis and all the rest

282
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,680
of it, they're all connected by neurons to the brain. So the information is in the brain, you

283
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:32,000
don't need to have a consciousness elsewhere. And I think there's absolutely zero evidence for it.

284
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,080
There's not any kidneys, there's hearts and other organs that have been transferred from

285
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,280
one person to another. And there's no evidence at all that any consciousness is transferred in

286
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,480
that operation. Tell me, John, do you know if any sort of, are there any newspapers, aren't there,

287
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,160
that sort of describe EM fields anywhere else in the body?

288
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:03,920
Well, there's lots of them. Yeah, heart, for example, we use ECG to detect heart arrhythmias.

289
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
Sorry, I think I didn't ask the question correctly. What I wanted to know is,

290
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,240
do you know if there's any sort of relationship between the EM fields that we do have in the body

291
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,760
that link up to sort of the EM fields generated by the brain?

292
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,520
Yeah, I don't know if you've, I think you have, I think I looked on your podcast,

293
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,640
you've interviewed Mike Levine. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, okay. We've actually chatted a few times, yes.

294
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,280
Yeah, fascinating work, him and Wendy Bean. Such amazing work.

295
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,920
I think it's the prehistory of consciousness, the kind of thing that he's looking at. It's that

296
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,200
he is already finding that the EM fields generated by the body have causal efficacy.

297
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,680
They are doing things to help in wound healing and development and some, and those kind of things.

298
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,280
That to me is a prehistory of what's happening in our brain, that the EM fields that were

299
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,040
generated by the brain started in evolutionary history to make a difference to how the brain

300
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,480
works. And instead of being, instead of having an influence on wound healing or development,

301
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,520
they had an influence on our actions. And that's just seems to me a natural consequence of the

302
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:26,560
kind of thing that Mike and Wendy and other people have found in the role of EM fields in other

303
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,080
parts of our body. Once you have EM fields in the brain, then they are in the powerhouse,

304
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,200
they are in the control room now. And they can start doing all sorts of things like making you

305
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,600
making you happy, sad, making you do actions, preventing you from do actions. Suddenly, the EM

306
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,000
fields are not just involved in development or wound healing, they're involved in everything,

307
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,480
every action that you do. Mike actually might watch this episode because he just sent me an

308
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,160
email the other day to say he watched a previous episode. I want to almost speak for him in the

309
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,640
sense by saying, I mean, what he's trying to show at some point is that this bio electricity,

310
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,120
I mean, this electricity, electrical signals can communicate messages, which is something

311
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,560
we never really thought was a thing. And this is amazing work. I mean, he's showing how information

312
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,920
can be transferred in ways that we could never imagine. And the impact this has, do you think

313
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,480
at some point all of those bio electrical signals could perhaps create an EM field for the entire

314
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,480
body that sort of communicates all together? Well, although the brain's EM field is everywhere,

315
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,080
obviously, we know that if you have a transmitter very far away from you, it is less likely to be

316
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,160
detected by your radio, you know, I can, I can detect the times when it was all radio signals,

317
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,640
you can detect, you know, London, say, but I couldn't detect Edinburgh. And very occasionally,

318
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,280
you might detect somewhere like Moscow or something like that on your radio, but very rarely. And

319
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,440
that's because the strength of the signal decreases with the cube or the distance, is it? I kind of

320
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,760
remember my physics, either the square of cube or the difference of distance. So the strength of

321
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,560
the signal drops. So yes, the information, there will be some bit of information that say comes

322
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:26,240
from your toe, that when it's injured, that will also impact the brain. But most of what the brain

323
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,680
is doing is going to be influenced by the nearby EM fields, which are generated by neurons, particularly

324
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:40,560
as neurons are the most electrically excitable, and are the biggest transmitters of, of signals,

325
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,120
and the, and the most effective antennae for signals as well. So I would say, yes, it's possible,

326
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:56,960
but I think the, the influences likely to go down the further and further away, the

327
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,760
organ is from the brain.

328
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,280
Yeah, and perhaps, and perhaps even the Mali nation might also control, because that's

329
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,960
yeah, much more common within the brain.

330
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,400
Yeah, but I'd be interested in Mike's view on this.

331
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,120
We're going to chat about it soon.

332
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,200
So when we have that other chat, I'm going to make a note to actually ask him about this.

333
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,480
You touched on something just now, and I have a note here, just let me just find it.

334
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,360
You said, at some point, I mean, when, when someone's alive, they can have this field.

335
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,840
And then you said, well, unless they did, I mean, but sometimes when someone dies,

336
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,280
you sort of still sort of see an electromagnetic field around them,

337
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,440
there's still some sort of information being carried.

338
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
So what happens when someone really dies?

339
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,960
Does the information store somewhere within the field?

340
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Well, remember that the information is constantly changing in the brain.

341
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,000
It's not that it's not like a hard disk of a computer that would be laid down forever.

342
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,480
We do have memories that are in the Senate, or we believe memory is still one of my

343
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,320
mysterious things about how our brain works, and we don't fully understand it.

344
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,720
But most guesses are that it's, it's maintaining the synaptic connections of our brain.

345
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
Those will be there, still there when we die, but they will start to disintegrate.

346
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,600
So they won't last long.

347
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,720
There is another interesting way of thinking about it.

348
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,960
And I've not really, I've not really thought this,

349
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,320
this is now when, when I go into dangerous, wacky area, but it's fine.

350
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
This is an open space.

351
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
This podcast is exactly what it is.

352
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,320
But there is something that I think, I wonder what that means.

353
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,440
But okay, information, information, according to quantum mechanics,

354
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
information can't be created or destroyed.

355
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,960
It's just moved around.

356
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
So there's a conservation of information.

357
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,240
It's a theorem.

358
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
Or is that what they call it?

359
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,760
No one's proved it as far as I know, but it's fundamentally quantum mechanics

360
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
that information can't be destroyed.

361
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,160
Now the brain's information, what the CM semi-field theory says is the brain's

362
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
information has the quality of awareness.

363
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,480
Okay.

364
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,520
That's what is aware.

365
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,040
The information encoded in the brain's field is aware.

366
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,480
Okay.

367
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,960
So then I have to say, I have to go on, look at that more deeply.

368
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,680
You have to say, okay, well, is all electromagnetic field information aware?

369
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,480
I say, well, you know, what's the electric, what can the electromagnetic field of a

370
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,760
single electron know?

371
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,880
What it knows is itself.

372
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,840
It doesn't carry information about the outside world.

373
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,880
What is normal and interesting about the brain is that the brain's young field

374
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,400
carries this vast amount of information about the outside world and the inner world of the

375
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
person, their memories and everything else.

376
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,400
It's all encoded in the brain, so it's a much richer sourcing information.

377
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,400
But it is information and it's never going to be destroyed according to quantum mechanics.

378
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,000
So what happens?

379
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,640
I don't know.

380
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,320
I mean, every thought that we make is transmitted into the brain's field and some of that leaks

381
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
into the universe.

382
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
So what is that information?

383
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,480
It's not connected in the same way, but it's still there, as I said.

384
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,520
EM field is unified.

385
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,840
There's only a single EM field for the entire universe.

386
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Universe has a single EM field of which our brains, our electromagnetic field is part of.

387
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,360
So when we stop thinking and our brain stops working, do we become part of the universe's

388
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
electromagnetic field?

389
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Do we get any awareness of that state?

390
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,760
I don't know.

391
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,880
I will find out.

392
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,520
Not for a while, I hope.

393
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,160
I was just going to say, hopefully not too soon.

394
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
It is a kind of spooky, kind of interesting idea.

395
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,720
Conservation information is if information, electromagnetic field information has the

396
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,480
property of awareness and that's fundamental to semi-field theory.

397
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,320
That's the only way we can account for consciousness.

398
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,840
Then that information has gone off into the universe.

399
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,200
Every thought that we've had still has that property.

400
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,960
What does that mean?

401
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,440
I don't know.

402
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,400
It's crazy because I remember when I first, this was years ago, when I came across your work

403
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,760
and Jim Alcalilla, I watched one of his, I think it was his, was it a Ted talk, if I recall,

404
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,120
talking about quantum biology and then I went down this rabbit hole,

405
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,800
learning about it, reading about it, then came across your work.

406
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,200
I remember still back then being so fundamentally materialist that to me it sounded completely

407
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,560
absurd and since starting this podcast, the more I've learned about other theories and

408
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,600
understanding other people's perceptions, the way they work, it becomes a lot easier to empathize

409
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:01,040
and sort of see the other person's viewpoint a lot clearer and but then you also don't know

410
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,040
where to draw the line anymore because at this point, as we're discussing this, it's easy to

411
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,120
see how we can tread down territories that are non-scientific.

412
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,600
We can almost go into some sort of bizarre phenomenon that, I mean, it's not a bad thing

413
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,160
necessarily. This is still intriguing things and it's not clear that the work is wacky.

414
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,200
It still is quite cool that you can go down these routes, I think.

415
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah, I think to me, the line is when it's no longer science and when it becomes no longer,

416
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,640
when you can't actually prove what you're speculating about, it is no longer science.

417
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:45,120
So people ask me, well, how do we know that the radio isn't conscious and I would say,

418
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:52,320
how would you ever prove it was or wasn't conscious? And in turn, someone comes up with a way of

419
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,400
answering that question, then I don't think there's any, that is part of science. We just have to say,

420
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,840
well, as far as we know, the radio or my car or whatever isn't conscious,

421
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,200
you know, maybe someday it will start talking to me and I'll disprove that theory. But until then,

422
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm going to take the default simplest way of accounting for the fact that my car doesn't talk

423
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,120
to me, that it is not conscious. And I think we have to take the ideas that I was just saying

424
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,760
about what happens to our consciousness after I don't think I'll ever be able to test that.

425
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,840
So I count that as non-scientific speculation, which is perfectly okay,

426
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,480
as long as we don't think it's science. We can speculate. Philosophers have been doing it for

427
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
centuries and they go away with it. Why shouldn't scientists occasionally get away with a bit of

428
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,240
speculation? I can just see the way someone could take this information and sort of a patient,

429
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,400
maybe in a psych ward, listening to this conversation, now realizing that actually no,

430
00:41:52,400 --> 00:42:01,280
the radio really did say that to me. So I always have to put it in the podcast. I mean,

431
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,840
this is just weird informational purposes only. This is not, I guess a doctor or one patients

432
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,480
to really go around to think, yeah, okay, this is fine. This is purely educational. This is just

433
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,040
a disclaimer for everyone. But tell me, the skull access is almost a Faraday cage,

434
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,080
holds in all these signals, as much as possible, the fields at least. So it can't go too far. I

435
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,920
mean, you briefly touched on that fact. I mean, it's not like you and I could step together side

436
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,720
by side and sort of do almost a telepathic communication with each other. That's what

437
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,600
you're saying either. No, I have a lot of people who ask me, and whenever you've been talking this,

438
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:49,840
someone always pops up and says, does it explain telepathy? And I say, no. Because firstly,

439
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:58,320
is telepathy a thing that can be explained by science? No, because no scientific experiment

440
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,400
that's actually demonstrated telepathy. So it's like saying, does your theory explain aliens on

441
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,160
the moon? No, because there's no need to explain them. There's no evidence for telepathy and all

442
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,760
the scientific tests have shown nothing's there. But we want to expect it from my theory.

443
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,400
You can see the headlines now, Semifield and the Fermi paradox.

444
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,080
Yes. And no, I don't think telepathy can't be explained by Semifield theory. Because of that

445
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,960
problem of the information is diluted as it goes further and further away from you. And also,

446
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,800
your brain has developed, it's like going back to my Levine's work, your brain has developed

447
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,880
to both make its own fields, own EM fields and decode those fields. I doubt if any other brain

448
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,560
is capable of decoding it. It's probably only...

449
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:03,200
Oh, John, I think I've lost you there.

450
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,960
Ask in the brain, there's no fundamental code that all brains use. They're going to be using

451
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,800
all different codes. So I think only your brain can decode the EM field information inside your

452
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,800
head. Sorry, John, for a moment, I lost you, but you're back. Okay. As long as you're back, it's great.

453
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:30,960
Okay, it's in the EM field. I could switch to another, I can see, I should

454
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,520
to prevent it happening again, I could switch to another router.

455
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,720
We'll give it a go. If it fails again, we'll switch over.

456
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,200
Okay, we'll leave it as it is. While we're on that topic, though, I mean, what are the chances of

457
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,320
other sort of electromagnetic fields interacting with ours anyway, not causing sort of telepathic

458
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:58,480
communication, but actually affecting my own EM field? Yeah, people have concerns about this in

459
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,880
terms of whether electrical installations, telegraph wires and stuff like this could influence

460
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:15,520
how we think. It's feasible, I would say, if a very strong electromagnetic field can make a radio

461
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,840
talk as it can when we have a radio receiver, it could interfere with the brain. But it's working

462
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:30,880
on different frequencies, it's not going to be decodable. So by the brain, the brain is designed

463
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,160
by evolution and development to decode its own information, not to decode the stuff that comes

464
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,800
in the radio waves. And as far as I know, no one has ever managed to listen to a radio station

465
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,480
just with their head. So we can't decode that information, whether it can do any harm to us.

466
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:57,200
I think the evidence is very slight, if any, that there is any influence of power stations and

467
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:06,000
stuff like that near us doing any harm. So my guess is not, but because there's been a lot of

468
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,600
research and a lot of contradictory in this area of whether external EM fields can cause

469
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,480
ill effects in people, I prefer to stay agnostic about it as I don't really study the literature

470
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:28,400
enough to be very clear in my own mind about it. I think it's fascinating because you're

471
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:38,000
discussing a theory that is so quote unquote, wacky, but it's not. And yet you simultaneously

472
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,080
write a book that's like slightly simple and talk about Occam's Razor, I mean, William of Occam,

473
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,400
and you discuss how you approach science in a very scientific manner because of the fact that

474
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,520
you understand the difference between taking a leap of faith and then being agnostic when

475
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,240
agnosticism is needed. So I just want to put that out there for you to sort of.

476
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:08,480
Yeah, yeah, I think they, as you said, in my recent book Life is Simple, I make the case that

477
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,160
what differentiates science from other forms of ways of making sense of the world is the science

478
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,360
is committed to take the simplest solution to problems. To me, the simplest solution

479
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,600
to consciousness is the brain's electromagnetic field. It solves so many problems,

480
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,320
such as why synchronous firing should be correlated with consciousness. It gives us a way of

481
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,280
understanding one of the other big puzzles of the brain, why most of what the brain does is

482
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,400
actually non-conscious. And that's something we have to also explain. Because if the brain is

483
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,200
just neural activity, then why isn't most of what the brain does conscious? We do a lot of very

484
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,520
complicated stuff. A lot of people have argued, well, it's only the really difficult stuff that

485
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,960
we do that we're that we need our conscious mind. No, we could be trying solving a really difficult

486
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,120
equation and still on stand on our toe and become highly aware of a very simple stimulus of someone

487
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:13,440
standing on our toe. So very simple stimuli can overwhelm our conscious mind. So complexity

488
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:21,600
and consciousness aren't necessarily related. And yet we have to explain how some parts of

489
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,440
some of the things that we our brain does is we're not aware of, like me waving my hands around

490
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,800
when I talk, I'm not aware of that. And lots of things that we do blinking and all this kind of

491
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,200
stuff, that's all done non-consciously. So we have to explain how the brain can work in two

492
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,640
different ways. One a conscious way and one a non-conscious way. As far as I'm aware, the only

493
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,640
theory consciousness theory really sorts this out is the semi field theory, another a and field

494
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,240
theories of consciousness that says only the activity from synchronously firing neurons,

495
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,600
because the waves of the synchronously firing neurons fire together, only that gets transmitted

496
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:10,160
into the brain's electromagnetic field. If neurons fire asynchronously, and mostly they do,

497
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,480
that information doesn't get transmitted into the brain's electromagnetic field,

498
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,320
because the wave, the top of a wave of one neuron is cancelled out by the bottom of the wave of

499
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:26,080
the other neuron. So it explains why only some information is consciousness, it's only the

500
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,680
synchronously firing neurons, and that's exactly what we find. The rest of what the brain does

501
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,520
is going to be non-conscious, so you get a conscious and a non-conscious mind.

502
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,720
So all of those problems are just disappear once you just move consciousness from the

503
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,480
matter of the brain into the brain's EM field. And I think it's a much simpler theory than others

504
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:56,880
like IIT, which is integrated information theory, which has to propose this massively difficult

505
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,440
mathematical equation is what explains consciousness and, you know,

506
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,800
a level of consciousness can solve this equation for more than two or three neurons

507
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:14,480
at most, and I just can't see that it's needed. So it's a simplest theory,

508
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,440
and I admire that in science, and science has been driven by simplicity right from those early

509
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:27,040
days, as you mentioned, William Rockham was the first modern person to make that claim that

510
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,280
science is all about simplicity, and it has stood the test of time. The Higgs boson was predicted

511
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,320
on simplicity grounds that were more complex theories, but the simplest was the Higgs theory

512
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,000
that predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, and only one of them was the simplest of many

513
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,840
theories to predict. One of them, the only advantage of the one that predicted only a

514
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,280
single Higgs boson was simpler than the others, and that's the way it turned out. So science

515
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,520
looks for simple solutions. Semi-field theory is, in my view, far simpler than any other theory

516
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:11,040
that attempts to account for consciousness. As of mid 2024, are there any sort of labs, other

517
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,920
people's work that you're looking to that are sort of showing support for this theory? How's

518
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:24,960
the evidence looking for this theory, and any updates? Well, yeah, there was work in, I have to

519
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:34,640
my brain is, my brain is useless, digging out names and particular studies, but at least tell us about

520
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,920
the studies. I can send you the reference later if you want. There was a very fascinating study

521
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:50,960
done by a group at MIT, and what they did was look at the brain neurons in the brain of monkeys,

522
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,640
I think it was, that was recorded by multilateral recordings of the brain when they were keeping

523
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:07,040
something in memory. And there's a lot of studies have done this, and they found that

524
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,680
if the monkey is thinking banana safe, okay, when it recalls banana, different sets of neurons

525
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,280
were fire. And there's a name for this, and again, this has escaped me at the moment, it will come

526
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:28,240
to me sometime, it's that memories seem to not rely on particular neurons. A set of neurons will fire,

527
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,440
but it won't be the same set of neurons when a monkey thinks of the banana two or three times,

528
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,960
there'll be different neurons, there'll be five or six neurons say that will fire,

529
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,680
but there'll be a different set of neurons, and that's very hard to explain in terms of memory

530
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,960
when we think of memory in the synaptic idea of memory that I mentioned earlier, that it's to do

531
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,760
with just the connections between neurons via synapses. A temporal drift, I think it is called,

532
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:02,800
that the encoding of a memory drift between different neurons, but what this study at MIT

533
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:09,440
showed is that what was preserved wasn't the neurons, but the electromagnetic field generated

534
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,680
by those neurons. So although different patterns of electromagnetic fields just similar,

535
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,640
yet the electromagnetic field of the neurons was always similar. So whatever was the memory

536
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,080
of the banana was not encoded in neurons, it's encoded in the electromagnetic field

537
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,520
generated by neurons. And that was a very fascinating study that I think could

538
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,400
be very interesting. The other big area that I think, if anyone is listening who wants to try

539
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,920
to make, I think it would be fascinating to make, and I think someone's going to do it, and

540
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,800
I think it should be done despite people having fears about it. A conscious AI,

541
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,560
that's got to be the way that things are going. At the moment we know that chat GBT is fantastic,

542
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,560
does wonderful things, it's not conscious. We still haven't got, with conventional computing power,

543
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,800
we haven't got any closer to consciousness. There's no inkling, there's not even this,

544
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,480
there's kind of consciousness that a little baby will have as soon as it's bought,

545
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,520
that's not no little baby is starting to go, go, go, go, go, go, and be, oh, I'm pleased to see,

546
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:23,200
do spontaneous stuff like that. So despite the fact that modern computers are now competitive

547
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:31,120
with the power of the human brain, but there's no spark of consciousness there at all.

548
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,360
The reason for that, of course, according to the semi-fuel theory, is that all the

549
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:44,000
conventional computers do is simulate what the non-conscious brain is doing,

550
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,960
calculating and computing with the wires. That's what we've said that the neuron,

551
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,720
the non-conscious part of our brain does, but then the conscious stuff, the information that goes

552
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,640
through the brain's electromagnetic field, is where consciousness is, and that's where we do

553
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,800
our conscious thinking, and that's where our creative thinking, that's when we come out with

554
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:13,040
great ideas. We don't come up with them, oh, you rarely, sometimes we do, a non-conscious mind seems

555
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,600
to be able to generate good ideas, but mostly we use our conscious mind to think and to come

556
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:23,440
up with good ideas. That is lacking in computers because engineers, they call it electrical

557
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,760
interference, EMF interference. When they build computers, they engineer them to not

558
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,240
be influenced by their own electromagnetic fields. So they've engineered out consciousness in

559
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,040
computers. That's happened because that's the way all electrical devices work. They don't want

560
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,840
them to be interfered with by their own electrical activity. There's a fascinating

561
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:54,480
experiment that was done over two decades ago. When I was first writing, yes, over two decades ago,

562
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,320
by a chap called Andrew Thompson, a cobb's group, a cognitive science group at the University of

563
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:07,280
Sussex in Brighton. I think one of the most fascinating experiments I've ever done,

564
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,680
and no one's really picked it up and gone forward with it. I started to get funding to do work on

565
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,840
it, but not take me forward. So Andrew Thompson did an experiment of making an AI, this was a

566
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:26,640
long time ago, more than 20 years ago, but not designing it, evolving it. So it took something

567
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:36,080
called an FPGA chip, field programmable gate array. And what these are, are a chip that can be

568
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,920
reconfigured. The electrical connections can be reconfigured endlessly. So you can make lots of

569
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,200
different configurations. So we took a number of them, let's say a hundred of them, and randomly

570
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,000
set them to different configurations, and then tested each one for their ability to solve a task.

571
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,360
And he gave it a simple task, I think it was recognizing musical note. And they're all rubbish

572
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:05,280
at it, but maybe one or two were a little bit good at it, could do just slightly better than

573
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,800
what would be expected from a random guess. So he took those, the best one, and then cloned it

574
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:17,760
across the entire 100, and then mutated them all a bit. Okay. And then repeated the exercise,

575
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,760
and then did it again and again and again for I think about a hundred generations until he got

576
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,920
a chip that worked. It could now recognize musical note. So he had evolved in intelligence that could

577
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:37,280
do this task rather than designing it. But it was weird. There was one feature of it that was

578
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,520
particularly puzzling. It didn't work all the time. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't.

579
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,360
And they worked out eventually, what was the factor? It only worked when the radio was on in the lab.

580
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,840
Now, why would that be? Because this was an off-piste experiment that they weren't paid to

581
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,560
work on. It was something they thought would be fun to do. So they did it at the end of the day

582
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,440
when they finished the normal work as it goes into the evening and turned the radio on to keep

583
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,440
themselves company. And they evolved the chip with the radio being on. So it was picking up

584
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,440
radio waves and using them as part of its computation. And they needed those radio waves,

585
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,840
EM fields, to actually do the computation. And that was one weird thing. The other weird thing

586
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:27,760
about these chips were that there were some parts of the chip. It's a complex microchip,

587
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,040
it's got lots of little circuits and resistors and capacitors here and there. There were some

588
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,920
parts of it that were necessary for the computation. If they removed those completely,

589
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,160
it didn't work. But they weren't connected to either the inputs or the outputs.

590
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,640
But how do you explain that? The only way to explain it is that they're communicating through

591
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,560
EM fields. So EM fields are within the chip are communicating with each other with different

592
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,080
parts of the circuit. And also in that experience, they actually were picking up signals from the

593
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,600
radio as well for the computation. So the fascinating conclusion of that is if you evolve

594
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:14,720
an electrical circuit to do a task rather than design it, you involve an EM field, sensitive

595
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,880
computer, one that computes through fields as well as through standard electrical,

596
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:28,480
neural, and standard electrical connections. I think that has to be built on. And we have to

597
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,200
build an AI that does this. And that also makes an excellent question. At what point

598
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:43,280
were our EM fields generating this sort of potential in terms of our evolutionary journey?

599
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:49,040
A very interesting question. Certainly somewhere in my guess is that the brain went through the

600
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:56,320
same process that Andrew Thompson's experiment did. At some point, it started to, you know,

601
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:01,360
communicating, first of all, the neural communication was all non-conscious. All of the

602
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,960
information was set down the wires. But then as more and more neurons got packed into the brain,

603
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,760
then it started generating and many of them were often seamlessly firing. It started to generate

604
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,880
its own electromagnetic field. And then those electromagnetic fields, and this has been demonstrated

605
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,520
experimentally, EM fields of the strength and structure of the brain's EM field. If you, we've

606
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,360
done experiments in our lab, if you apply them to brain tissue, that brain tissue will twitch if

607
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:39,200
you'd like. There is a feedback onto neurons. Neurons are sensitive to the brain's electromagnetic

608
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:47,040
field. Now, once that happens, then the actions driven by that brain are going to be visible

609
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,520
to natural selection. So natural selection acting on our brain that's now got electrical

610
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:58,000
interference will do two things. If the electrical interference is bad, is bad for us, then it will

611
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,800
insulate it. It will insulate those things. It will dampen down those electromagnetic fields,

612
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,800
will make them fire asynchronously, whatever, get rid of that interference. So part of the brain

613
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:14,320
will evolve in the direction of being non-conscious because things you don't want to interfere with

614
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,680
with your conscious mind, like the heart beating or walking or breathing, all of that stuff needs

615
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:27,920
to be non-interferable. But if there was some capacity that was captured by electromagnetic

616
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,840
field interactions between neurons, then natural selection will kick in to develop that. And my

617
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,040
guess that has happened certainly by the time of primates, probably somewhere in Malamanian

618
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:47,440
evolution, maybe way back in vertebrate evolution, that that gradual takeover of electromagnetic

619
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:54,720
fields in terms of driving actions was selected by natural selection as being an efficient way

620
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,160
of dealing with complex situations by thinking rather than just automatically responding.

621
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:07,280
And certainly primates have it, my guess is higher mammals like dogs and cats also have it,

622
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,440
but those are all guesses. Until we really understand and can prove what consciousness is,

623
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:20,560
it will be speculative. But somewhere, somewhere less than humans, I'm sure, has awareness and

624
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,480
consciousness like us, but it's a very, like us, but probably not very much like us. Can you think

625
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,760
of how you would think without language? That's a tricky thing, isn't it? How you would think without

626
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,600
language? Certainly we do, we kind of feelings and stuff, and that's what I guess animals are

627
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,960
thinking, they don't have language. So they think in terms of feelings, those can't be very complex

628
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,800
calculations and ideas that they can have, I guess they've seen food and say, oh, I'd like to be over

629
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:55,440
there and eat our food. And that's a feeling rather than in our mind where we can encapsulate

630
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,120
the feelings in words as well and start to compute with them by starting to think through

631
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:08,240
problems that I don't think animals have that capability. I just today, I think earlier I was

632
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,640
reading a paper, I can't remember by who, but it was on Orcas and apparently there's this,

633
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:20,720
they're starting to figure out a communication system that seems to be very much structured.

634
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:27,680
I'm not too sure on the details, I just briefly came across this while I was at work reading,

635
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:34,880
and that seems fascinating to me because you're right, linguistics, language, this triumph in

636
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,760
evolution that sort of allows us to shape our views, shape our thoughts and sort of give

637
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,840
this synchronicity that's required to give attention to certain things, changed the game

638
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,520
for humans. This seems to be one of those game changes, I think. So it would be fascinating to

639
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:58,240
do these Orcas speak their specific type of language, because then this gives them a sort

640
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:05,360
of different EM field in that sense. Yeah, I think the experiments could be done once you

641
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,160
commit yourself to the idea that consciousness is the brain's EM field. The key question is,

642
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:17,520
does the EM field generated by a brain influence its own actions? And that's something that can

643
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:24,160
be answered. You can start to, you can imagine experiments that will then determine, you know,

644
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:32,000
what percentage of brain activity in a particular animal is influenced by the animal's brain's EM

645
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,040
field. That will be a measure of consciousness if we could do that kind of measurement. I don't

646
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,800
know how we'll do it at the moment, but I'm sure it will be possible to do that at some stage and

647
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:48,560
find out how much animals are thinking consciously. Would you say this would be taken further with

648
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:54,080
regards to free will? At what point are they making active decisions to either go left or right in

649
01:04:54,080 --> 01:05:02,560
terms of... Yeah, well that does... The other thing that semi-field theory provides is a theory of

650
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:09,200
free will, which provides it for free, because it divides the brain's activity into those which

651
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,720
are non-conscious and those which are conscious. We call our conscious decision making those which

652
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,400
aren't made by the automatic part of our brain. We call it free will when we make conscious decisions

653
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:27,440
to raise my hand or not raise my hand. All of those are driven by our conscious mind. So I think

654
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,520
everyone gets into a muddle with free will because of the word free. I think we have to stick to what

655
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:41,840
the second word which is will. Will is when our conscious mind is willing our actions. It's not

656
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:49,520
necessarily free because it's all determinism ultimately in science. Jumping out of determinism

657
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:55,760
is very difficult. So it's still deterministic, but our conscious actions are those that are

658
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,160
driven by our conscious mind rather than our normal conscious mind. And that gives you a nice

659
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,680
simple explanation of free will. It doesn't require anything deep or philosophical. It's just

660
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,560
the stuff driven by our conscious mind, the free field rather than the neurons.

661
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:16,160
Yeah, so it's sort of just a byproduct of being conscious in itself. So it just jumps along for

662
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:23,040
the ride. Yeah, yeah. Once the brain becomes conscious by having an EM field, then those EM

663
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:29,600
fields influence actions. We call that free will. I mean, if people say, you know, as I said, the word

664
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:38,000
free causes a lot of confusion here. If you think about what we believe our minds are doing when we

665
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:46,400
make purposeful actions, we don't necessarily think that without a preceding thought,

666
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:53,920
when I think, okay, I'm going to phone my brother. It may be because I've seen him put

667
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,640
something on the TV that's reminded of him. I wouldn't think that that idea will just pop into

668
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,960
my head without any precedent. And I think most of what we do, if we think hard about

669
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,640
every action that we do, it's perceived by some other thought. So I don't think determinism is

670
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:18,240
the problem of consciousness. It's never been. And in the past, people didn't think of it as being

671
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:24,560
non-deterministic. They talked about fate, that your actions will be driven by fate, not by,

672
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:30,000
and fate was something you had no control over. So the idea of determinant of being free will

673
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,800
being something or will being free, something that isn't determined by anything that's happened before

674
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,560
comes out of later thought in philosophy and Christianity, really had to be punished for

675
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:47,840
your sins. So that's really the source of where the idea of free will comes from.

676
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,720
But if we just accept that there are some thoughts that we, there's some of our actions sort of

677
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,840
driven by our own automatic brain, and some are driven by conscious mind, and that makes a lot

678
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,840
of sense. And it's predicted by the semi-feel theory. And then you don't need to worry about the

679
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:09,760
philosophy. We touched on a species going from, from let's say, amoeba to humans, and obviously

680
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,800
maybe vertebras have this, perhaps mammals have this. What about humans? What about when we start

681
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:24,000
as embryos working our way upward into adulthood from childhood? When does this become active?

682
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,840
Your guess will be as good as mine. Don't really have any insight. The key thing is that when the

683
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:42,240
brains in field influences the activities that a person is performing. And I think that's when

684
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:49,200
they become less than, more than reactions. So, you know, blinking is a reaction. If a fly flies

685
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:55,440
into your eye, you blink and you've got no control over it. Then you can see a baby, you know, might

686
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:03,200
look this way and that way, and it will do the kind of pause and look at things. And, and,

687
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,640
you know, it can be pretty sure there's some thinking going on in that baby's brain.

688
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:14,080
Once they start toddling around, moving around, and they laugh and stuff like that. I mean, I've

689
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:21,600
hardly any animals laugh. People say that some monkeys laugh, but so they can laugh at themselves

690
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,240
and they can find things amusing. All of those things are conscious things. We couldn't, we

691
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:32,400
wouldn't find anything amusing, non-consciously, for example. So, I think you have to ask the

692
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,280
question, what do we need our conscious mind for? And what can we do without our conscious mind?

693
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:42,400
I can do all this moving around in my hands, non-consciously. I can drive a car pretty well,

694
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,960
non-consciously. I mean, we know that if we have an accident and everyone does that again, and you

695
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,040
think, what was I doing a moment before? You probably not be able to remember, because you have

696
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,080
all emotions that you're doing, I'm going on non-consciously. So, there's lots of things that

697
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:02,720
we do non-consciously. They're this stuff, like, you know, like a long division, we couldn't do

698
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,840
non-consciously. And there's another interesting feature of consciousness, that is, you can only

699
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,520
do one thing at once, really. And that's strange, because you can do lots of things

700
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,040
non-consciously, like me waving my hands around. I could be scratching my head and moving my arms

701
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:26,560
and I could be tapping a tune. All of those things are going on. But you can't say, do a crossword

702
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,960
and talk to someone at the same time, could you? So, your conscious mind is, this has been

703
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,160
established outside of the semi-field theory. But your conscious mind is what's called a serial

704
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:42,720
computer. It can only do one thing at a time. Whereas your non-conscious mind is a parallel

705
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,920
computer. It can solve lots of problems and be working on lots of problems simultaneously.

706
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,840
So, again, you've got to account for that in the brain. Semi-field theory does it,

707
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,600
like that. It's no problem. There's only a single brain-em-field. Unlike the neurons,

708
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,520
which are distributed and there's lots of different circuits, lots of different areas,

709
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,680
the brain-em-field from its perspective is singular. So, it's always going to be

710
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,760
only one thing at a time. Anything else will start to cause interference. So, it's identifying the

711
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,280
things that we do consciously. And certainly, we couldn't imagine talking non-consciously. You

712
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,400
couldn't have a conversation with someone non-consciously. You couldn't do anything creative

713
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,840
non-consciously. So, all of those things that we require our conscious mind for, when we see

714
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:37,920
those happening in, say, babies or in animals, then we've got to admit that they are very likely

715
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:44,080
also conscious. John, Joe, would you see the future of semi-field theory going? What would

716
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,640
you like to be done in terms of other people who watch this podcast, the thousands of people

717
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:55,040
listening? Where do you want some of these future scientists to take this and perhaps?

718
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:02,480
Yes. I think we have to take the brain's-em-field seriously and find out how it functions to,

719
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,320
as a conduit for information transfer in the brain. No one's really done that. I mean,

720
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,000
there's no one's even worked out how you can calculate how the-em-field generated by the

721
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,440
brain will influence neural firing patterns. All of those things need to be calculated.

722
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,880
We need to do a lot more experiments on how neurons can communicate through electromagnetic

723
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:31,280
fields. And we're doing some of those experiments in our lab by applying external electromagnetic

724
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,240
fields. But it's tiny, the amount of work that's going on in this kind of area compared to what's

725
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:42,240
going on in other areas of neurobiology. And I think we need to try to use these principles

726
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:47,600
to make a conscious AI. Ultimately, I think the only way that you'll prove a theory of consciousness

727
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:56,720
is by applying it to make a conscious AI. And the kind of work that I was describing earlier

728
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,960
gives you a route towards doing that. There are lots of other theories which will also give

729
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,200
you a route towards doing that, like IIT. According to IIT, commuters are already conscious.

730
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:14,640
So to me, that's already disproved IIT. Global workspace has also been disproved because

731
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,000
computers can have global workspaces in the global workspace sense. And none of them have

732
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,880
shown any signs of consciousness. So we've got to wake up and kind of say, okay, well, let's

733
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:31,840
try to design a conscious mind based on different principles on, say, IIT or global workspace

734
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:38,560
or semi-field theory and let's see which one talks back to us. So would the goal then be to

735
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:45,440
create this artificial intelligence to match our electromagnetic field?

736
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,880
I think it's more than artificial intelligence. There's a conscious artificial intelligence.

737
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,920
There are, of course, ethical issues there. And those have to be looked at as well.

738
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,200
But the ethical issues will make any conscious being a person. Either way, everyone's trying

739
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,000
to do this. I think it's an inevitability at this point.

740
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,480
Yeah, there is an inevitability there. And every time we have a baby, we make another

741
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:15,680
conscious being. So why not make one? And that would be a murderer and still go around and kill

742
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:23,920
people. So we can't predict what biological conscious beings will do. But I think the

743
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,400
advantage of it would be that we would be able to understand consciousness better

744
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,320
and, you know, going way into the future, we can think about the possibility of transferring

745
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,400
our minds to AI that's much more durable than these bodies are sadly going to decay in

746
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:48,960
not so many decades. So, you know, there are those kind of sci-fi ways of preserving humanity.

747
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:55,520
And I think we will need them in the future. That makes it quite exciting to know that,

748
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,720
I mean, because it's obviously throughout the universe. I mean, we could in some way be

749
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:07,680
completely at the side of the universe if the tech becomes absolutely, if we can transfer our minds

750
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:17,120
into AI, then we could travel a lot easier to travel at sub light speeds to really explore

751
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,360
the universe. And then the question, of course, you mentioned the Fermi Paradox, why hasn't it,

752
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,920
why haven't we already met the aliens who have gone through this stage and developed the very

753
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:32,960
durable forms of themselves? I mean, if a consciousness is an electromagnetic field,

754
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,240
could you transmit it? You wouldn't need a spaceship. You could send the big beam

755
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,560
of electromagnetic information across the universe. You know, there are all sorts of

756
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,720
sci-fi ideas that are so exciting and interesting, bizarre and speculative that we've got to go

757
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,840
and find out what there is there. And if you take the idea that consciousness is an electromagnetic

758
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:01,520
field, then all sorts of interesting stuff starts to emerge from that idea. It's completely

759
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,600
fascinating. And it's super exciting to see so many different theories of consciousness,

760
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,840
people taking leaps, people doing such great work. Thanks to you. Any final words, anything you want

761
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,400
to say or add? Do you think there's anything about semi-feel theory that people might have

762
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,680
misunderstood from this conversation or things you've always wanted to point out?

763
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:28,480
I just think that thinking that our mind is an electromagnetic field, an invisible form of

764
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,040
energy in our brain is, I think, interesting, fascinating, and it feels better to me than

765
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,920
to think my mind is a lump of meat. I think if everyone starts to think of themselves as this

766
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:49,840
entity of energy that is driving their brain, of electromagnetic energy, pulling the levers

767
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,400
of the brain, I think it just gives a different feel of what we think we are. And it makes so

768
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:02,880
much sense and it gives us lots of speculative ideas that we can take forward in terms of thinking

769
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,760
about what happens after death and all that kind of stuff. We're never going to know until we get

770
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:15,200
there, but we can speculate, nevertheless. And speculation is exactly what this podcast is about,

771
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:20,960
because although I call it mind-body solution, I don't claim to have the solution. Nor do I think

772
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:28,720
we'll find it, but hopefully one day it's possible. Absolutely. You've got to have an open mind,

773
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:34,240
but not so much your brain drops out. I'd say be passionately curious but reasonably

774
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,640
skipping at the same time. Absolutely. You've got to be rigorous. If you want to do science,

775
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,360
you've got to be rigorous. You can still speculate as long as you label it as speculation and this

776
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:50,640
is we can't prove this or that, but speculation is fine because it can inspire people to study

777
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:56,960
science and inspire people to do things that lots of speculations have turned out to be true. So

778
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,480
it's okay to speculate as long as we know that's what they are. Just look at how much science

779
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,880
fiction has become reality at this point. Exactly. It's phenomenal. Exactly. Indeed.

780
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,640
Any final words, John Joe? Thank you so much. This has been such a... Well, thank you for talking

781
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:23,040
to me, Tevin. And yeah, anyone who wants to get in touch with me and if you've got any great ideas

782
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:30,080
to test me, feel thoroughly. And certainly, if anyone wants to make an artificial AI and

783
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:40,080
as the resources to do it, get in touch.
