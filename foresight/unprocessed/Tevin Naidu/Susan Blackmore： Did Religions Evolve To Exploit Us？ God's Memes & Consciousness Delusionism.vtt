WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.240
Su, I'm so glad we managed to reschedule this. Is the sound working fine? The internet connection

00:14.240 --> 00:19.200
is great this time. Everything works. Good. I think so, yeah. Okay, my side, it's perfect.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.520
How was the retreat, Su? Oh, the retreat was fantastic. I can't remember whether I told you.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.600
I didn't want to go. I'd kind of signed up half-heartedly and the weather being here and

00:33.600 --> 00:40.800
being over 20 degrees is amazing and sunny and I thought, you know, all this meditating all the

00:40.800 --> 00:47.200
time, I wasn't looking forward to it and it was brilliant. The teacher, I really went because

00:47.200 --> 00:55.360
of the teacher, Fiona Nuttall. She's a Zen master and extraordinary teachings and the Zen interviews.

00:55.360 --> 01:03.600
You know, this is part of Zen retreats is the interviews and she just really rings things out

01:03.600 --> 01:09.920
of you that you don't know are there and then sends you back to work. I can just talk merely from

01:09.920 --> 01:16.720
your energy right now. You look in a great place. The other thing was in these particular type of

01:16.720 --> 01:22.800
retreats, there were two work periods of an hour each in the day where you could be sweeping the

01:22.800 --> 01:28.160
floors, cleaning the toilets, chopping vegetables in the kitchen and this lovely sunny weather,

01:28.160 --> 01:33.760
you know, and you don't have any choice and I got gardening so I'm very happy. That's very

01:33.760 --> 01:39.440
unzen, isn't it? Because you just do what you do because you don't do it and, you know, not care

01:39.440 --> 01:47.120
about the outcome but it meant I was outside at each day doing hard physical labor which I'd much

01:47.120 --> 01:52.720
rather do than chopping vegetables or something like that. So yeah, it was very good. As for,

01:52.720 --> 01:57.920
you know, great insights, well a lot happened. It was, you know, struggling with a koan for

01:57.920 --> 02:03.200
a week. I see. Things happened. Do you feel like philosophically any changes fundamentally in your

02:03.200 --> 02:16.080
views? No but I think my way of thinking about things is kind of loosened up

02:16.800 --> 02:23.040
and I spend quite a lot of time as you realise thinking about the mind-body problem, the nature

02:23.040 --> 02:31.280
of mind, the nature of agency and how we wrongly feel we're controlling things and

02:33.120 --> 02:39.600
this koan work tends to hint at those but I can't say I've got some great philosophical

02:39.600 --> 02:43.920
breakthrough now, sorry. Well, I think while we're on that, it's the perfect time. I think

02:43.920 --> 02:49.840
let's take the listeners and the viewers on a journey soon. If you could give me a history

02:49.840 --> 02:55.360
of the mind-body problem from your perspective, I'm curious to know which aspects of this story

02:55.360 --> 03:02.320
you tell me right now. Gosh, you kind of ask the question is though I'm a philosopher and I'm not

03:03.040 --> 03:07.600
or are you doing something much more personal? No, no, I think in general what if you had to

03:07.600 --> 03:12.880
think of the story of the mind-body problem, which names come to mind, what type of philosophies or

03:12.880 --> 03:18.880
even psychology, neuroscience, which icons or figures in history come to mind when you think of

03:18.880 --> 03:28.480
this infamous problem? I'm going to disappoint both you and your listeners because I don't really,

03:29.120 --> 03:33.040
as I said, I'm not a philosopher. I don't remember the names of all the brilliant

03:33.040 --> 03:39.760
philosophers and I kind of, you know, I know this problem goes way, way back into ancient Greeks but

03:39.760 --> 03:45.760
you know, I don't, I'm not going to pull any names out of the non-existent that's on my head.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.880
I don't think in that way about it. I think about it every day in terms of

03:53.920 --> 03:59.040
what's out there and what's in here and is there a difference between inside and outside and so on.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.200
But if I can twist that around to why it's been so important to me, like so many things in my life,

04:07.200 --> 04:13.760
it goes back to the very dramatic outer-the-body experience or mystical experience both that I

04:13.760 --> 04:20.960
had when I was 19, which is a very long time ago, which convinced me completely of a dualist view

04:20.960 --> 04:25.520
as it convinces so many people. I think it's Thomas Metzinger who said, you know, anyone who has that

04:25.520 --> 04:35.760
kind of experience must become a dualist, a substance dualist indeed. And so that becoming

04:35.760 --> 04:43.280
utterly convinced of a dualist view and then actually deciding to devote my life to instead of,

04:43.280 --> 04:48.880
you know, I had a, what I imagine would have been a very good PhD place at Sussex University,

04:48.880 --> 04:56.400
which now has the, you know, the Sussex Consciousness Lab there. Not that it would have in those days but

04:57.280 --> 05:01.680
you know, I turned that down because I wanted to prove dualism. I wanted to prove, you know,

05:01.680 --> 05:06.560
astral planes and all these other worlds and everything and show that scientists were closed

05:06.560 --> 05:16.080
minded as I'm often being accused of being. And so I set about it experimentally, being really

05:16.080 --> 05:22.880
an experimental psychologist, not a philosopher. And all the evidence I got was suggested I was

05:22.880 --> 05:26.720
wrong and so I had to turn to my mind. And since then, which you were talking now,

05:27.520 --> 05:33.360
late 70s, early 80s. Since then, I've been pondering how on earth to make any kind of

05:33.360 --> 05:40.240
monist, any kind of neutral monism actually work. I think, look, so for me, it's very difficult to

05:40.240 --> 05:46.400
actually have a very skeptical interview with you. And it's because you were part of shaping

05:46.400 --> 05:54.080
many of my own views. Yeah, so a big, a big chunk of my dissertation focused on illusionism. So

05:54.160 --> 05:58.480
illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I used psychiatry to defend illusionism as a

05:58.480 --> 06:03.120
theory of consciousness. I quoted you a couple times. And I've obviously

06:04.080 --> 06:09.760
particular, I cited you many times and particularly the delusion aspect of it all. So there's many

06:09.760 --> 06:14.640
aspects where I want to come as a skeptic, but I just cannot because fundamentally, I think

06:14.640 --> 06:18.640
there's so many aspects of this that we agree on. It's going to make this very difficult.

06:18.640 --> 06:23.360
But I think that's exciting anyway, because what I want to know is when you came to the conclusion

06:23.360 --> 06:28.400
of illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I know so many people in your life influenced you,

06:28.400 --> 06:33.360
people like Dawkins. I know Dennett's part of those people who you support in terms of certain

06:33.360 --> 06:38.000
views. I know nowadays you disagree with many aspects. Perhaps Free Will will be one of them.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.040
No, that's the only, that's really the only one. I mean, basically, I'm a Dennettian and, you know,

06:43.040 --> 06:48.000
I love it when I find something I disagree with him about, we can have a great argument, you know.

06:48.720 --> 06:55.600
Your books, Dennett's books, all together on my shelf. So you guys all come together in a nice

06:56.880 --> 07:00.640
So when Frankish published the paper, Illusionism, and he had all you guys together,

07:00.640 --> 07:05.120
Graziano, yourself, there were many of you guys together. Tell me about that journey. How did

07:05.120 --> 07:13.360
that come about? I think Clive Frankish wrote and told me he had been invited to do this special

07:13.360 --> 07:20.880
issue and asked me whether I'd like to write it, write something. And I was then thinking a lot

07:22.080 --> 07:27.200
about the things that I wrote about in there. A lot of my thinking is taking direct experience

07:27.200 --> 07:32.800
and trying to analyze it. So in that paper that I wrote, I wrote about an experience where

07:34.000 --> 07:40.800
I've been on, I can't even remember what island this was, but anyway, I was on some island walking

07:40.800 --> 07:47.600
up quite steep, rough sort of steps going up. And I really wanted to get to the top

07:47.600 --> 07:50.960
in time to be able to go down and catch the boat back to wherever I'd come from.

07:51.600 --> 08:00.720
And I can remember that as I was walking and and being mindful, somehow or another, I realized

08:00.720 --> 08:05.600
that a few moments before I had, I thought, am I going to get there in time? And I thought, oh,

08:05.600 --> 08:10.560
yes, because it's only five past 12. Hang on a minute. I must have just a few moments before

08:11.040 --> 08:16.960
looked at my watch and I looked at it again. And it was five past 12 without in any normal

08:16.960 --> 08:21.920
sense of the word being conscious of it. And this brought up all the sort of Donetti and kind

08:21.920 --> 08:27.520
of thoughts. Well, what's going on? Right this moment now being mindful, I can say, this is what

08:27.520 --> 08:32.960
I'm mindful of. This is what I'm conscious of. This is what I'm doing. If I cast my mind back

08:32.960 --> 08:38.800
to a moment before it doesn't have to be very long. I really don't know what I was conscious of.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.480
Doesn't make any sense. This is one of the things where Dennett says,

08:42.480 --> 08:47.760
there is no fact of the matter. If you ask what was I conscious of a moment ago, there is no

08:47.760 --> 08:54.640
fact of the matter. And yet we assume that there is an answer to that question that at all times

08:54.640 --> 08:59.600
during the day, when whatever we're doing, we're conscious of something or another. Well, that's

08:59.600 --> 09:09.120
simply not true, I think. So I kind of wrote my article for this around that experience and what

09:09.120 --> 09:17.200
it means for why we're deluded. And the reason I say delusionism rather than illusionism is

09:17.200 --> 09:21.760
illusions brings to mind very much sensory illusions, vision and hearing and so on that

09:21.760 --> 09:25.680
where you get things, you know, there's the difference between reality and appearance.

09:26.400 --> 09:34.000
But the delusion I was more interested in the kind of folk theories we make up about consciousness.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.320
And one of those is that at all the times when we're awake and in that sense conscious, there

09:40.320 --> 09:44.800
must be something we're conscious of and other things we're not conscious of. And that's not

09:44.800 --> 09:53.120
true. And then I think because I tend to write not terribly academically, acceptably, I tend to

09:53.120 --> 09:56.640
write rather personally, oh, I think this and I have this experience and this is what it means.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.280
And so then Keith started to say, well, can you change this and can you change that? And then

10:01.280 --> 10:05.600
actually he tried changing things for me. And then I was like, no, you can't do that. I wouldn't

10:05.600 --> 10:11.760
ever say that. And we sorted it all out. And in the end, I was very happy with it. So that's sort

10:11.760 --> 10:16.240
of how it came about and what happened. And then there are all these other interesting papers in

10:16.320 --> 10:24.720
the same issue, which then became a book. I find Frankish's view too difficult for me to really

10:24.720 --> 10:29.200
understand. You say illusionism is a theory of consciousness. It's not really, it's a whole

10:29.200 --> 10:34.080
bunch, it's more like it's an approach to consciousness. It's a way of thinking about

10:34.080 --> 10:40.480
consciousness, which has many variations. Yes, sorry, continue. No, no, go on. I was going to say

10:40.480 --> 10:44.800
because yes, because you define illusionism very differently from what Frankish is talking about.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.880
Yeah, that's right. You see it more as a way to rectify and clarify other views of consciousness,

10:50.880 --> 10:56.480
whereas Frankish is talking about the phenomenal aspect of consciousness. Do you want to clarify

10:56.480 --> 11:04.800
that in your own words? Well, yes, I think he starts by saying that the phenomenal properties

11:04.800 --> 11:11.040
don't exist. Well, I'm immediately thrown into, but I'm not a philosopher and I don't know what you

11:11.040 --> 11:18.480
mean. The other day, Bernardo Castro said to me, if something exists, it has properties. And I'm

11:18.480 --> 11:24.080
going, well, I don't know about, I don't really know how philosophers define existence or properties,

11:24.080 --> 11:28.720
and I don't want to go through the painful, I've got enough to learn that's really interesting

11:28.720 --> 11:33.520
in neuroscience and psychology. And I try and read philosophical things, but I don't think I'm ever

11:33.520 --> 11:39.840
going to get my head around exactly what Frankish means. And whether it's the same as what Dennett

11:39.840 --> 11:47.120
means or not, going back to what you've already elucidated, it's the way Dennett pulls apart

11:47.120 --> 11:53.360
the mistakes we make, the pits we fall into, the errors that just abound all over the place

11:54.400 --> 12:00.960
that appeals to me. And by calling my approach delusionism, I suppose I'm just trying to say,

12:00.960 --> 12:05.200
look, I'm not, I don't agree with all the other people, I'm not saying I'm right or better,

12:05.200 --> 12:10.240
but I'm more interested in the kind of semi-intellectual ways we get things wrong,

12:10.240 --> 12:15.040
and the assumptions we make, than I am in making an actual theory. Because I don't think

12:15.760 --> 12:21.040
I don't think any of these have an actual theory, except possibly with the exception of

12:21.040 --> 12:26.960
Michael Graziano, who refuses to call himself an illusionist. And it's an illusionist theory,

12:26.960 --> 12:34.240
for goodness sake, Michael. I think he's a bit cowardly, really. I understand it, I get it,

12:34.560 --> 12:40.480
you know, if he calls it an illusion, people will misunderstand. I've had that all the,

12:41.040 --> 12:45.840
all the time I've been working on consciousness. You know, people say, you say consciousness

12:45.840 --> 12:50.880
doesn't exist. I don't say that at all. I say it's illusion. How do you define illusion?

12:50.880 --> 12:56.160
Something that's not what it seems to be. And that's really, if I want to say anything I will

12:56.160 --> 13:03.200
say, 100% sure that I believe, it's only that, that consciousness as normally conceived of by

13:03.200 --> 13:08.160
most people, it's not what it seems to be. Graziano was one of the first people I interviewed

13:08.160 --> 13:13.840
for this podcast. And I remember when we spoke about, prior to that, he helped me out with my

13:13.840 --> 13:18.400
dissertation. And we discussed the fact that attention schema theory is most certainly an

13:18.400 --> 13:22.800
illusionist theory of consciousness. It's, it approaches it fundamentally by saying that what

13:22.800 --> 13:27.920
we seem to believe is consciousness is merely an interpretation of what we think is happening around

13:28.480 --> 13:35.200
it. But he calls it a caricature. And in my own work, I also said, I believe that if some,

13:35.200 --> 13:39.120
if you believe something is an illusion, there's no point in changing the words around it. You

13:39.120 --> 13:44.160
might as well just change other people's perceptions about the actual word. Because

13:44.160 --> 13:50.400
an illusion is defined as an emiss interpretation of a sensory stimulus that does exist. So you

13:50.400 --> 13:55.120
cannot say that it doesn't exist. There is a stimulation that's happening that does exist.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.880
And that's fundamentally where I think Keith and you differ because you agree that something's

13:58.880 --> 14:05.440
happening. I am not necessarily agreeing what you just said that it's a, it needs to be a sensory

14:05.440 --> 14:14.880
stimulus. Yes. Well, does it? Um, I don't think so. It's a misinterpretation of a stimulus that

14:14.880 --> 14:20.480
exists. Okay. But can that be an internal stimulus? I mean, because I'm thinking the whole gamma of

14:20.480 --> 14:27.520
experience, including sensory impressions, where we make a, um, a reality appearance distinction,

14:27.520 --> 14:32.400
that's one sort of illusion. But when it comes to, you know, my own, I'm shutting my eyes,

14:32.400 --> 14:39.600
it's dark. I'm, you know, I'm thinking about something that, you know, I'm thinking to myself,

14:39.600 --> 14:44.320
Oh, what I'm conscious of now, if I think that way, is my own thoughts about whatever it is,

14:44.320 --> 14:48.240
what I'm going to do tomorrow or something, you know, that's not a sensory stimulus. In fact,

14:48.320 --> 14:52.400
it's not really stimulus unless you say this bit of brain is stimulating another bit of brain. So

14:52.400 --> 15:01.120
I just quibble slightly there. Yes. So I would say something is happening. And somebody's responding

15:01.120 --> 15:06.400
to something that's happening. Something's responding to something that's happening. Um,

15:06.400 --> 15:12.800
like Dennett, who begins, um, his 1991 consciousness explained with sitting in his rocking chair,

15:13.760 --> 15:19.120
appreciating the way the light is, you know, fully on the dapples on the leaves and all that.

15:20.480 --> 15:26.560
You know, I take as a similar view. I mean, look, there's this, ha, but

15:28.560 --> 15:33.120
the leap that's so easy to make is there's this out there and there's me in here. And that's

15:33.120 --> 15:39.840
already an interpretation. And that's an illusion. So that's where I take off from. And I, I define

15:39.840 --> 15:44.880
illusion is an illusion much more simply having looked it up in various, you know, OED and other

15:44.880 --> 15:50.560
such places as something that is not what it seems to be. That's, that's kind of vaguer. And I'm

15:50.560 --> 15:56.000
happier with that. Yeah. Now, I think what you're doing is basically it's intuition pumps for

15:56.880 --> 16:00.880
thought thinking about consciousness. It's pretty much trying to show people that, okay, look,

16:00.880 --> 16:04.960
there's something happening. We don't know what it is, but assuming that you can find certain

16:04.960 --> 16:10.480
entities or an Ian Vitale or an answer that's going to come out is just the wrong approach.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.760
So searching for a neural correlate of consciousness is not the right way.

16:14.960 --> 16:21.840
And it's amazing how popular that has, you know, good for Francis Crick and Christoph Koch,

16:22.400 --> 16:30.240
starting the whole framework for consciousness and let's, I mean, Crick said, you know, we can't

16:30.240 --> 16:34.640
jump straight in at causal explanations. We have to start with correlations. So what do we do?

16:34.640 --> 16:40.160
Well, here's this problem consciousness, let's look for the neural correlates. Great, as a starting

16:40.160 --> 16:45.840
point. But when you really start thinking through intuition pumps and delusions and what have you,

16:46.800 --> 16:51.680
it doesn't make sense anymore, because it relies on the assumption we were discussing earlier,

16:52.640 --> 16:56.240
that there are some brain processes that are conscious and there are other ones that are

16:56.240 --> 17:03.120
not conscious. And that is such a tempting illusion. But it's not, in my opinion, it's not true.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.400
At what point did you realize, because there's so many different studies that show us that we're

17:08.400 --> 17:14.160
not seeing reality for what it is. Heuristic adaptations, perhaps, shortcuts in our processing,

17:14.160 --> 17:19.680
limited processing, perceptual experiences. So we can't even see outside the optical window,

17:19.680 --> 17:24.400
we can only see ROYGBIV. At what part were you looking at all this information and finally

17:24.400 --> 17:29.680
concluded, okay, you know what, there is no fundamental entity called consciousness that we

17:29.920 --> 17:36.720
are searching for? Well, you ask that question in a way that assumes that there is some sense in

17:36.720 --> 17:43.520
saying the world as it actually is. Yes, I must say, I'm more tempted nowadays to theories that

17:44.080 --> 17:52.560
don't say that. I'm very tempted by various kinds of panpsychism, none of which I can fully endorse,

17:53.520 --> 17:59.040
by information based ideas, that everything fundamentally comes down to information. So

17:59.040 --> 18:04.320
I've been struggling without enough maths with thermodynamics and other ideas about

18:05.760 --> 18:11.680
energy and information and evolution and how these things work. And really struggling with

18:13.360 --> 18:22.960
some kind of straight idealism doesn't work in the sense that, you know, if everything is mental,

18:22.960 --> 18:27.360
how on earth do you explain why we agree about things about the outside world, what you were

18:27.360 --> 18:32.560
saying, you know, how the outside world really is? Well, I'm not going to go that far, but you

18:32.560 --> 18:36.720
can agree that, you know, you can see my picture, I can see your picture, I can see the cupboards

18:36.720 --> 18:41.680
behind you and the whatever, you know, and I'm pretty sure I could predict, this is kind of

18:41.680 --> 18:46.560
important really, that if you went, turned around and pulled a book out, you know, there'd be a space

18:46.560 --> 18:53.760
in the bookshelf. Interestingly, I've got particularly fascinated recently with predictive

18:53.840 --> 18:58.880
processing and Bayesian brain type theories. And when I'm thinking about all this stuff,

18:58.880 --> 19:03.840
what is the world? What is the relationship between this body and this thinking and everything and

19:03.840 --> 19:12.080
that plant you can't see behind the screen? It's always, well, if I did that, if you turned around

19:12.080 --> 19:18.240
and took your book out, if I picked up these glasses, then I would find they felt like this.

19:18.240 --> 19:24.240
It's always if at last something makes sense, of course, because the predictive processing

19:24.240 --> 19:31.760
theories are saying that that that all all of perception and of thinking indeed, and of, well,

19:31.760 --> 19:40.640
I'll leave Pontius for a moment, but all all that is making predictions. That's what system is. So

19:40.640 --> 19:46.320
I try to work from first principles with that sort of idea. So here's a clever brain,

19:47.280 --> 19:52.640
multiply, it must be a kind of tangled hierarchy. It's not hierarchy with, I think,

19:52.640 --> 19:57.120
with me at the top controlling everything, which is kind of how it seems. But it's

19:57.120 --> 20:02.400
hierarchical, nevertheless. And at every level, there are predictions referring to the lower

20:02.400 --> 20:10.800
level and so on. And that begins to make sense of the world, but brings me right back to, well,

20:10.800 --> 20:17.520
then what's it all made of that's doing this? And it also raises the question of, well, does

20:18.400 --> 20:24.480
Bayesian brain approach actually turn into a theory of consciousness and not necessarily?

20:25.920 --> 20:31.120
So I've been playing in fact, when I was on the retreat one evening, I was, we get a little bit

20:31.120 --> 20:36.800
of free time and I went sat under a tree, and was kind of thinking about this with respect to the

20:36.800 --> 20:43.680
tree that that I was looking at, and trying to think about what can underlie this on any kind of

20:43.680 --> 20:50.720
modest view. And again, coming back to kind of fundamental thoughts about information and prediction.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.320
You see, I can't give any answers. I mean, I'm really struggling with all this stuff. I don't

20:56.320 --> 21:03.040
have my own theory beyond, beyond everyone's else is deluded. And so am I. Look, I completely agree

21:03.040 --> 21:08.160
with you because when I came when I started this podcast, I was so I initially came to it with a

21:08.160 --> 21:13.040
very emergentism approach. So I thought at some point, okay, these layers will eventually

21:13.040 --> 21:16.880
culminate into an experience that we call consciousness. Then I went down the very

21:16.880 --> 21:21.680
illusionist path. And I think fundamentally, my view is most likely aligned with that stall.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.320
But as you're saying, after speaking to so many people and reading so many other philosophers

21:26.320 --> 21:31.440
and thinkers, you start to question reality in general, because materialism as it stands

21:31.440 --> 21:35.520
matter, we really just don't understand what matters. And I think that's the fundamental

21:35.520 --> 21:40.880
problem why we cannot ever talk about reality in a way where we think what reality could ever be

21:40.880 --> 21:45.840
is something beyond. So I completely agree with you. So even when I said that, look, when

21:45.840 --> 21:49.440
there's certain things we cannot see in terms of reality, I still honestly do have no idea

21:50.000 --> 21:57.520
what we should be seeing. So I agree on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get quite annoyed. Got,

21:57.520 --> 22:01.280
you know, bored of being annoyed that people just assume I'm a materialist. And I said,

22:01.280 --> 22:05.040
no, I think materialism doesn't work any better than idealism work. And, you know,

22:05.760 --> 22:10.800
that's why I call myself a neutral monist. But then when I look that up as what it actually

22:10.800 --> 22:14.320
means in philosophical terms, it gets a little bit complicated. I think, God, I'm not that all I'm

22:14.320 --> 22:21.920
saying is all I can say for sure is dualism doesn't work. For me, was Raymond Tellis,

22:21.920 --> 22:26.800
he once said he's ontologically agnostic. And I like that. Oh, that's a nice phrase.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.920
I really do. Yeah, because because ever since he said that, I think that's the

22:29.920 --> 22:34.000
term I go to all the time. I'm ontologically agnostic. But when it comes to epistemology and

22:34.000 --> 22:38.080
the stories we've been telling each other, I think I'm pretty much almost atheist towards

22:38.080 --> 22:45.600
those stories or a whatever that theory is. Yeah, it doesn't have to have God, does it? A

22:45.600 --> 22:49.280
theory story, something or another. Yes. Exactly. But I think it's a beautiful term,

22:49.280 --> 22:54.000
ontologically agnostic. Thank you. When you think about your okay, so your journey,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.600
you obviously at some point concluded, okay, these theories and the way we're approaching

22:57.600 --> 23:03.040
this isn't working. It came down to ask yourself these questions. Am I conscious now? That was a

23:03.040 --> 23:07.200
big part of your paper. Am I conscious now? Marvin Minsky once said, if you asked a computer,

23:08.400 --> 23:12.080
if it's conscious now, it doesn't matter because humans can't answer that question. Anyway,

23:12.080 --> 23:17.120
we spend most of our lives in autopilot. So if we ever expect a computer to really think about

23:17.120 --> 23:21.120
the fact that it's conscious, we really do it ourselves. Is there anything you want to add on

23:21.440 --> 23:26.080
that? Yeah, well, the large language models make that very interesting, don't they? Because

23:27.040 --> 23:32.160
given that, I mean, the terrible thing is that they just amplify the idioses of what humans

23:32.160 --> 23:38.160
say and write. So I imagine I've not tried this out, keep thinking I should spend some time playing

23:38.160 --> 23:41.920
around with one of them. But, you know, given that so many people say, well, of course, I'm

23:41.920 --> 23:47.360
conscious, then presumably picking it up from the massive database of everything people have said,

23:48.240 --> 23:53.680
then these so-called AIs have not really, but, you know, we'll just say the same. Yes, of course,

23:53.680 --> 23:57.200
I'm conscious. I mean, if they can say, oh, I love you and I want to be with you and all those

23:57.200 --> 24:01.280
ridiculous things that they do, they're going to say they're conscious and that doesn't tell us

24:01.280 --> 24:06.720
anything at all any more than it tells us when somebody else says they're conscious. But that

24:06.720 --> 24:15.520
question that you say that I wrote in that paper, that was 2016, I think that illusionism thing.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.680
I've been thinking about this question a lot longer than that. And it kind of began, I suppose,

24:21.680 --> 24:26.640
when I was happily a colleague of mine. In fact, he was also a Zen master. He was a

24:26.640 --> 24:33.920
John Crook, a biology lecturer at Bristol University and a Zen master. And I was learning

24:33.920 --> 24:41.760
to meditate with him. And this is going back to the 80s. And he was teaching a course that was

24:41.840 --> 24:45.600
sort of involved quite a lot of consciousness. And he wanted to leave and devote himself more

24:45.600 --> 24:50.480
to running retreats and so on. And so I took over this course. And I began teaching that

24:50.480 --> 24:57.040
in the late 80s at some point, with a lot of, you know, there's so little was was known then.

24:57.760 --> 25:03.440
And then in 1991, sort of early in my first few years of teaching, it's outcame Dennett's book.

25:04.160 --> 25:09.440
And that really changed things and really forced me to think. And I met him, he came to Bristol

25:09.440 --> 25:17.440
and gave a lecture and that really fired me up. And that made me do the first ever experiment on

25:19.360 --> 25:25.440
change blindness, which worked out amazingly. And he predicted that it would work. And I thought,

25:25.440 --> 25:33.440
well, I can do that, you know, and did with a student. So when I was teaching that course,

25:33.440 --> 25:38.400
I was already asking myself, well, I'm talking about consciousness. Well, what is it? Okay,

25:38.400 --> 25:43.600
I'm conscious now. Or am I? What does that mean? And so I began right from the beginning of that

25:44.560 --> 25:50.320
teaching near the beginning anyway, getting the students to do what I did. In other words,

25:50.320 --> 25:56.800
to ask themselves many, many, many times a day, am I conscious now? The first thing I learned is

25:56.800 --> 26:01.120
that they won't do it. Or most of them won't do it. Or the ones who say they're going to do it,

26:01.120 --> 26:05.440
find it really hard to do. And at the end of the week, when they come back, let's say these

26:05.920 --> 26:09.920
in those days were nice small classes, I have like 30 or 40 students and, you know,

26:09.920 --> 26:16.240
and I could ask them all how many people did it, what happened? Most of them forgot to do it or

26:16.240 --> 26:23.920
tried and didn't really get anywhere. Some had really insightful experiences and began to question

26:24.640 --> 26:31.600
they had this shock, which I've written about as you probably know, but this kind of shock when

26:31.600 --> 26:37.760
you go, are you conscious now? Hey, are you? I don't know whether I can get you to have it. But

26:37.760 --> 26:43.600
you know, you suddenly think, Oh, well, of course I am. But a moment ago, I really don't know was

26:43.600 --> 26:49.440
I it's as though I've woken up by asking the question. And in a way, I think this is a really

26:49.440 --> 26:54.960
important point. I can even go so far as to say, you're not conscious unless you're asking yourself,

26:54.960 --> 27:00.400
am I conscious? Exactly. It's that active awareness of the fact that you are asking yourself at least

27:00.400 --> 27:05.440
it's almost that metacognition of it all. It is a metacognition, but it's a delusion,

27:05.440 --> 27:11.440
isn't it? I mean, it's a word based thing. Am I conscious now is saying, and then you start looking

27:11.440 --> 27:16.320
around and going, What am I conscious of? And, you know, that hence the second question in the

27:16.320 --> 27:22.000
big textbook that I have follows. And I've just my daughter and I've just completed the fourth

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
edition, which will come out in a few months, I hope. And through all of the editions, every chapter

27:28.000 --> 27:32.640
has one of these practices that I wanted students to do. I mean, a lot of them did get in the

27:32.640 --> 27:37.200
hang of it after a while and they and really worked hard on it. But then it becomes, well,

27:37.200 --> 27:42.800
what was I conscious of a moment ago? And lots of other questions of what, you know,

27:43.440 --> 27:48.400
am I conscious of what what I was doing, all sorts of questions that that you can ask,

27:48.400 --> 27:54.080
but they all depend on words. And if you do mindfulness practice without needing any words

27:54.160 --> 28:01.040
by just kind of becoming present, then that gets you away from the wordiness a bit.

28:02.080 --> 28:08.000
And then if you keep doing that a lot, then you're much more alert and open to what's going on.

28:08.000 --> 28:14.320
But you can't really say anything more about it. And what's going on here? This is what's

28:14.320 --> 28:20.480
really interests me. We fall back on these things that there's this thing called consciousness that,

28:20.480 --> 28:26.080
you know, that we might find. And then we're back to the neural correlates of this thing

28:26.080 --> 28:30.400
called consciousness, and it's got to be squirted out of the brain or, or as in the hard problem,

28:30.400 --> 28:37.680
it's got to as Dave Chalmers put it, how does subjective experience arise from

28:37.680 --> 28:43.040
objective activity in the brain. And so you come back to that sort of, to me, deluded idea that

28:43.040 --> 28:46.480
consciousness is something that like toothpaste, it sort of comes out of your head.

28:47.360 --> 28:52.080
You have to give me a definition of delusionism and perhaps compare it to illusionism.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.640
How would you define and differentiate them?

28:55.920 --> 29:04.720
Well, I would say that most versions of illusionism, I would agree with to the extent that they say

29:05.600 --> 29:11.200
that something about our experience is not as it seems to be.

29:12.080 --> 29:19.120
I'm more specifically saying, we are actively deluded about it. Not just that it's an illusion,

29:19.120 --> 29:26.320
but it's a kind of thinking problem, because we jump so quickly to assumptions. And that, and

29:26.320 --> 29:30.960
if you look up delusion and illusion, they're not really that different, but delusion carries more

29:30.960 --> 29:38.160
of a kind of intellectual, wordy thinking thing. And I think that's why I used that word to show

29:39.120 --> 29:45.360
that we make assumptions that we can describe in words. Well, I think consciousness is made in the

29:46.080 --> 29:51.440
anterior of something or whatever. I think consciousness is a product of the brain. I

29:51.440 --> 29:57.760
think consciousness extends beyond the brain into the astral worlds, or I think consciousness

29:57.760 --> 30:03.760
survives death. Whenever we talk about, people talk about these things, they are kind of

30:03.840 --> 30:11.680
reifying with words, this thing. And the word delusionism, I think, gets to that more.

30:12.480 --> 30:17.280
Maybe it doesn't for everyone, but that's what I think is the difference. But it's not a huge

30:17.280 --> 30:24.240
difference. It's just, I think, if people say that illusionism is a theory of consciousness,

30:24.240 --> 30:29.040
you said this, and I think I would disagree in the sense that it's not one theory. It's not

30:29.680 --> 30:36.800
a testable theory, as a whole theory. It's a bunch of approaches that different people have,

30:37.440 --> 30:42.640
and they're all slightly different. And we probably all agree that in some fundamental way,

30:42.640 --> 30:46.880
we've mostly got it wrong about the nature of consciousness, that we probably disagree about

30:47.440 --> 30:53.360
where the origins of the mistakes are. Sorry, that's a bit rambly. I don't know whether that

30:53.360 --> 30:56.720
answers your question. When I took illusion as a theory of consciousness, I was actually

30:56.720 --> 31:02.800
directly quoting Frankish's paper, the headline. I think that's what he called it, illusionism as

31:02.800 --> 31:08.240
a consciousness. So when I approached it, I used psychiatry to try and assist it and defend it.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.320
But at some point, I used a lot of Carl Friston's work. I'm not sure. Are you familiar with Carl

31:12.320 --> 31:18.880
Friston's work with the free energy? Well, I haven't read, I'm just started reading the latest book,

31:18.880 --> 31:23.840
and it's very hard going. As I said, when my daughter and I were doing the fourth edition

31:23.840 --> 31:30.000
of the textbook, I read a lot of the control hallucination sort of stuff, so predictive

31:30.000 --> 31:34.800
processing. I think Carl Friston's work is brilliant, but I do not understand the maths.

31:34.800 --> 31:40.080
I just simply do not have enough of a maths background to understand that. But I mean,

31:40.080 --> 31:43.760
over the years, I've learned something about Bayesian theory, because it pops up in psychology

31:43.760 --> 31:50.640
quite a lot. But I'm very much enamoured of the way that predictive processing is changing the

31:50.640 --> 31:55.040
way we think about all sorts of things in psychology now, or in neuroscience. And I think

31:55.040 --> 31:58.480
that's really going places. I think we're really going to get somewhere with that.

31:58.480 --> 32:04.000
When I spoke to Carl, I actually asked him if he thinks when you apply his view of

32:04.000 --> 32:07.600
Markovian Blankets, the understanding of the free energy principle, Bayesian brains,

32:09.040 --> 32:14.000
does he think this is actually a theory that supports illusionism? And he said it, yes.

32:14.560 --> 32:20.240
He actually said technically, it would, because when you take into account,

32:21.200 --> 32:24.640
in my paper, and when I discuss this with him, if you take into account the prior information

32:24.640 --> 32:27.840
you receive, because that's a fundamental aspect of all of this, you're taking a lot of

32:27.840 --> 32:32.080
prior information, and then you make posterior conclusions regarding your experience. If most

32:32.080 --> 32:37.760
of your prior information tells you things like, I'm a self, I'm a person, I have a conscious entity,

32:37.760 --> 32:44.080
your most likely posterior outcome is going to be, I am a self, I am a person, I have consciousness.

32:44.080 --> 32:49.520
And then at some point, I used your work to say, if you define a delusion, a fixed false belief,

32:49.520 --> 32:54.960
and if already the illusion has promoted a false belief, it becomes fixed at some point because

32:54.960 --> 32:58.960
of all the prior information you've already received regarding this. And at some point,

32:58.960 --> 33:03.600
that's why delusionism is bound to occur. And I think that's how I sort of work.

33:03.600 --> 33:09.040
Great. I must watch this, your discussion with him, which I should, but there are so many things

33:09.040 --> 33:14.640
to watch and listen to. It's a wonderful world, but it's also so difficult to choose, but I will

33:14.640 --> 33:21.280
do that. But you were talking about Markov Blankets and Free Energy Principle and so on.

33:22.160 --> 33:26.480
Again, the maths defeats me when it comes to Markov Blankets, although I do want to pursue

33:26.480 --> 33:30.720
that more. But I have spent quite a lot of time thinking about the Free Energy Principle, because

33:30.720 --> 33:36.160
it relates to what I was saying earlier about my interest in whether we can base an entire world

33:36.160 --> 33:41.280
on some kind of informational theory, and trying to struggle with how that relates to Gibbs Free

33:41.280 --> 33:48.160
Energy. And there are relationships between them. But again, I don't have all the background

33:48.160 --> 33:54.080
skills to do very well with this, but I really think this is important and will help us a lot.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.880
And I agree. I think so as well. I think at this point in your career, which aspects of this problem

33:58.880 --> 34:03.840
or is it free will? Is it consciousness still? What's intriguing you the most at this point?

34:05.680 --> 34:09.360
Well, you say at this point in my career, did you say?

34:09.440 --> 34:13.760
So much. I mean, if you think about it, your work spans on so many different aspects. You

34:13.760 --> 34:18.640
talk about memes, you talk about consciousness, free will, Paris psychology, there's so many

34:18.640 --> 34:22.560
different elements to your career that it makes it quite difficult for one to actually try and do

34:22.560 --> 34:27.280
an interview. Which is why I don't call it a career, because I only had a proper job for a few

34:27.280 --> 34:32.960
years, because I couldn't quite hack it. I prefer to work by myself sitting here, you know. So I,

34:33.040 --> 34:39.520
you know, I always kind of feel a bit surprised. I mean, my initial reaction to that question is

34:39.520 --> 34:44.400
I'm really struggling with, you know, I'm 71, surely. And people are always saying to me,

34:44.400 --> 34:48.480
Oh, you don't need to work anymore. You should be. And I have a big garden on the river. And,

34:48.480 --> 34:52.560
you know, I'm spending a lot of time growing vegetables. And why don't you just do that?

34:52.560 --> 34:56.640
Oh, and I do painting and kayaking and weightlifting and all kinds of things. You know,

34:56.640 --> 35:00.640
why don't you just do those things and forget all that work? When I'm sitting there doing the

35:00.640 --> 35:07.040
email, I'm like, Oh, God, you know. And so you could say at this point, I give it all up. But

35:07.040 --> 35:12.800
that's not true. The more serious answer is it's really we've we've touched on this many times

35:12.800 --> 35:20.160
already. It's really the what is the nature of the world? How does a world sustain what appears

35:20.160 --> 35:27.840
to be dual existence observers and observed experiences and experiences when I believe

35:27.840 --> 35:33.360
and so do you, I think that there is no true observer observing them. And you can have and

35:33.360 --> 35:39.360
importantly, you can have experience without an experiencer with a lot of practice. And that's

35:39.360 --> 35:47.120
really interesting how brains, you know, if you are in the delusion of the self is really in charge,

35:47.120 --> 35:51.920
then it becomes really peculiar to think, Well, I am trying to get rid of myself.

35:52.880 --> 35:57.360
I am trying to not believe anymore in me, you know, those kinds of things you get in all sorts

35:57.360 --> 36:08.160
of tangles. And yet certain processes lead to a brain that is more adept at dropping some kinds

36:08.160 --> 36:13.280
of illusions. So part of the answer to your interesting and difficult question is, that's

36:13.280 --> 36:18.960
why I still go on retreats. This particular one I've just come back from was a co on retreat.

36:18.960 --> 36:26.160
And I had a really, really tricky and interesting co on, which I have not resolved, which is good,

36:26.160 --> 36:30.880
because then I can keep, it can keep working, but has had some quite profound effects on me

36:30.880 --> 36:36.240
with all the struggles going on. So that's one way. And again, that's not a career is it,

36:36.240 --> 36:42.240
but that's one way that I want to engage by doing I meditate every day and have done for

36:42.240 --> 36:49.120
40 years nearly. To practice and train this brain and then thinking sort of memetically and

36:49.120 --> 36:57.840
evolutionarily. It's not me train the brain. It's this person being having picked up

36:58.800 --> 37:04.000
Zen meditation memes over there is somehow thinks it's worth doing and goes on doing,

37:04.000 --> 37:09.200
you know, you when he's tried to dismantle those those prior assumptions about self,

37:09.200 --> 37:16.560
you start thinking in these weird ways. So that's one big streak of it. The other has been

37:16.560 --> 37:20.880
for my daughter and I doing this fourth edition and me getting into the predictive

37:20.880 --> 37:25.040
processing, I'm still really interested in that. And I've got two books at the moment that I want

37:25.040 --> 37:33.440
to read relevant to that. I've also got totally different thread going on, which I started last

37:33.440 --> 37:42.720
year writing a book called, well, it's pretend possible title is God's memes, how and how

37:42.720 --> 37:48.480
religions evolve to exploit us and why we let them. So you can imagine this is, you know,

37:48.480 --> 37:52.080
they are memes out there, horrible meme plexus that get into people's heads and then you can't

37:52.080 --> 37:56.960
get them out. So I'm reading books now about sort of mental immunity and that kind of thing. So I'm

37:56.960 --> 38:03.280
doing that and it's all so I can't give you an answer. Perhaps I should. I think all my friends

38:03.280 --> 38:06.640
and family will say for goodness sake, give an answer just decide what you're going, you know,

38:06.640 --> 38:11.600
but I can't I just get I just keep thinking and being tempted by difficult ideas.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.880
I remember there was a time where I was about, I think I was about nine and and at that point I

38:16.880 --> 38:23.840
became very atheist to a point where I was very anti-theist. And I still remember as the years

38:23.840 --> 38:28.320
went on, where were you living then? What sort of situation were you in? I'm from South Africa,

38:28.320 --> 38:34.240
but I'm from Indian descent. But in South Africa, Indians have been living here for almost I think

38:34.240 --> 38:39.840
about 160 plus years. So we're generations in at this point. And I think I'm like eight.

38:39.920 --> 38:46.240
So did you have religious parents or I'm just I think so they are they couldn't they Hindu

38:47.120 --> 38:53.040
by origin. Some of my family are Islam. I've a Muslim, so they follow Islam. And but I grew up

38:53.680 --> 38:57.600
very much Hindu. But at some point, not really convinced about it. But I think my dad

38:58.240 --> 39:03.280
subliminally just tried to hint me towards non-believing like just not doing it. You know,

39:03.280 --> 39:08.480
he constantly made me watch National Geographic. He made me he wanted me to break away from

39:08.480 --> 39:12.640
it somehow. So it happened very early on. And I remember throughout the years, I was very

39:12.640 --> 39:17.600
anti-theist. And it was when I started coming across a lot of your guys work. So so Dennett,

39:17.600 --> 39:23.360
Dawkins, Hitchens. And I still remember thinking, I mean, this this finally I found this group of

39:23.360 --> 39:28.240
people where they're thinking the same thing. I'm pretty much it's all I've been thinking about.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.200
When you find yourself writing this book at this point, I'm not as anti-theist as I used to be.

39:33.200 --> 39:38.000
I mean, I can understand why we think this and why we get to that point. But I remember you first

39:38.000 --> 39:42.560
break out, it's almost kind of like you want to go all out and and get the best arguments.

39:42.560 --> 39:46.080
Do you feel like that's changed for you over the years where you found yourself constantly wanting

39:46.080 --> 39:50.960
to battle and debate? And now you kind of just like, I might as well just let the person think

39:50.960 --> 39:55.600
what they want until it sort of involves something that's going to directly. Well, this is why I was

39:55.600 --> 40:01.360
interested in where you were coming from, because I was brought up as a Christian. My mother was a

40:02.240 --> 40:06.240
was quite serious Christian. I mean, in the Church of England sort of way,

40:07.920 --> 40:12.560
when she went to church most Sundays, I occasionally went and I had phases. So I didn't

40:12.560 --> 40:18.560
ever have any, you know, really violently. I just remember as a teenager, just I went to the most

40:18.560 --> 40:24.480
horrendous boarding school, and we had to go to chapel every day and twice on Sundays. And I, you

40:24.480 --> 40:28.960
know, it was so boring. And then I began to think, well, it's also rather stupid and doesn't make sense.

40:28.960 --> 40:37.120
And so I became quite quite atheist, but not in an aggressive kind of way. Then at the age of 26,

40:37.120 --> 40:43.680
I fell deeply in love. And both of us became kind of a bit Christian again. And we had to

40:43.680 --> 40:47.680
get married in a Christian church, because that was what you did in those days and where we were.

40:49.280 --> 40:55.360
And that lasted maybe a year or two and kind of gently fizzled out. So I was a very different

40:55.440 --> 41:01.280
kind of experience from you. When I've been trying to write this book, I certainly how I

41:01.280 --> 41:07.760
should admit that I have some times when I'm thinking, and I want to write, this is total crap,

41:07.760 --> 41:12.560
yo, what idiot can believe this, you know, and I think, well, it's not very constructive. And

41:12.560 --> 41:20.560
actually, they're not all idiots who believe these things. Oh, I've had the most twice recently

41:20.560 --> 41:29.120
had time to talk at length with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. And he is such an

41:29.120 --> 41:38.880
interesting man. There is an intelligent kind, as far as I can tell, public spirited, longing to

41:38.880 --> 41:47.920
help people, person who will talk to me as an atheist in a very friendly and open way. And I

41:47.920 --> 41:52.960
try to remember people like that. Now, I think he is completely deluded about the nature of the

41:52.960 --> 41:58.960
universe and how we got here and everything else. But I really like talking to him about it. So I

42:01.440 --> 42:10.400
guess that helps me be a little more flexible in the way I use my atheism.

42:11.360 --> 42:17.360
Yeah, my girlfriend is Christian, and I know she is a believer in it. But I feel like this age,

42:17.360 --> 42:20.480
and at this time in my life, it's no longer a thing, because I know if it was 10 years ago,

42:20.480 --> 42:26.160
it would be something that would be a deal break. Ultimate, it would be done. But at this,

42:26.160 --> 42:29.120
I often think when you're talking about this, I remember the conversation you had with

42:29.920 --> 42:35.680
Jordan Peterson, and you guys discuss this, do you, now while writing this book,

42:35.760 --> 42:40.400
are you looking back at certain conversations like that, and formulating counter arguments to

42:40.400 --> 42:45.040
someone like Jordan, who's very good at arguing and counter points, even though you fundamentally

42:45.040 --> 42:51.120
obviously disagree with? Oh, that was a quite scary encounter. But I saw a little bit of it the

42:51.120 --> 42:54.640
other day, because somebody asked me, I get so confused about all these things, but somebody

42:54.640 --> 42:59.920
asked me to go on their podcast or something. I haven't gone anywhere with this yet. It was

42:59.920 --> 43:04.720
literally yesterday, and that he was putting together some kind of something or other that

43:04.720 --> 43:09.120
included clips for me and Jordan Peterson. And so I watched it, it was very short, you know,

43:09.120 --> 43:14.880
like a minute. I thought, oh, good for me. I actually stood up to him and argued back. I mean,

43:15.840 --> 43:23.120
God, I knew nothing about it. I had not even heard of him. When Premier Christian Radio it was,

43:23.120 --> 43:30.160
the discussion was on. I'd done things for, Justin Briley runs it, and I'd done things for him

43:30.160 --> 43:34.480
before and enjoyed it very much. So I was happy to go along. And I had to look up Jordan Peterson,

43:34.480 --> 43:39.360
but you know, time being what it is. I read his, I read his book most of it on the train going up

43:39.360 --> 43:48.400
to London. It's three and a half hours from here. And it's 12 rules for living, which had quite an

43:48.400 --> 43:55.360
impact on me, because some, you know, ludicrous things in there, and yet it's a bestseller,

43:55.360 --> 43:59.440
and people follow the rules, and one must be nice to cats. And I mean, there's weird things in there.

43:59.440 --> 44:08.000
Like make your bed and small things. Yes, yes, yes, quite good advice. And yet the whole

44:08.000 --> 44:12.160
thing's wrapped up in these weird stuff. And I was sitting there, kind of getting cross with it in

44:12.160 --> 44:16.400
the train. And there was this elderly couple opposite me. Now, I mean, again, I'm interested in,

44:16.400 --> 44:20.480
in where you were when you were growing up, because during my life here in England,

44:20.480 --> 44:25.280
people have got less and less and less religious. So this is typical of me. I don't think first

44:25.360 --> 44:31.760
before I speak. Sorry. But there was this elderly couple opposite me on the table in the train.

44:32.320 --> 44:37.600
And I so went, I sort of looked up at them. I said, Oh, God, this book's doing my head in

44:37.600 --> 44:41.440
or something like that. You know, oh, what is the book? And I said, Oh, that's really interesting.

44:41.440 --> 44:45.760
I said, Oh, he believes in God. And I went to, you know, just that's the sort of thing I would

44:45.760 --> 44:50.640
say. And they said, Yeah, isn't that trouble? And just to completely agree with me. And that is a

44:50.640 --> 44:56.880
kind of assumption I occasionally fall foul of. I was on a group walk up on Dartmoor a couple of

44:56.880 --> 45:01.600
weeks ago. And I happened to say something just assuming that the two people who were listening

45:01.600 --> 45:07.200
to me wouldn't believe in God. And one of them said, Well, I think that something about Jesus

45:07.200 --> 45:12.720
Christ is my, you know, whatever, should be more careful, or should I? And it always raises that

45:12.720 --> 45:18.720
question. I think the fact that I can safely assume almost all the time that other people

45:18.720 --> 45:23.120
around me don't believe in God. They're not thoughtful. I mean, they haven't thought through

45:23.120 --> 45:27.280
their atheism to great deep degree. They just, they just, it's the normal thing around here,

45:27.280 --> 45:32.560
you know, people in my village, we all go and sing Christmas carols at Christmas and thoroughly

45:32.560 --> 45:36.880
enjoy ourselves. And so, and then, you know, those things in the Christmas carols like,

45:37.840 --> 45:43.360
does not abhor the Virgin's womb, you know, I think, Oh, yeah. And so some of us women are

45:43.360 --> 45:50.000
going, Virgin's women, you know, we're just having a laugh. And maybe some people in the

45:50.000 --> 45:54.160
audience in the village, if there's about 100 of us there in the village square, you know,

45:54.160 --> 45:59.600
who are really upset by what we're doing, but that's kind of the atmosphere that I live in.

45:59.600 --> 46:06.960
So it's very easy to be loosely atheist or more strictly atheist and not have to make a big fuss

46:06.960 --> 46:10.880
about it. I still do remember that was quite a long time ago, because at that point, I don't

46:10.880 --> 46:16.720
think Jordan was at this level of, of, of fame and popularity is at this point. It was around

46:16.720 --> 46:21.280
the time I think Sam and him also got into a huge debate and they had that two part series where

46:21.280 --> 46:26.000
they got really into it. In doing your research, I mean, are you rereading books like The God

46:26.000 --> 46:31.440
Delusion or Why God is Not Great by Hitchens? Are you, how's your research process going with this

46:31.440 --> 46:40.640
book? So the specific question, I started reading Hitchens again. And like the first time, I

46:40.640 --> 46:49.280
really disliked it intensely. It's unkind, spiky. Very aggressive, yes. I don't, I don't like it.

46:50.080 --> 46:58.000
The God Delusion, I may well read again. But most of my research has been online finding

46:58.000 --> 47:04.480
things out. I mean, the things I found out like, okay, it seems to me that religions should

47:05.200 --> 47:09.920
make people behave like their religion tells them and therefore be kinder and more altruistic. So

47:10.400 --> 47:17.440
look into all the, you know, research evidence on, on whether it's true and it's not, you know,

47:17.440 --> 47:21.680
and it was, the evidence goes in all sorts of directions, but basically it's not. And then I

47:21.680 --> 47:29.760
got very interested in, in poverty and, you know, it's a very obvious, excuse me, it's a very obvious

47:29.760 --> 47:35.520
fact about the world that the poorest countries are the most religious. Now, why is that? And then

47:35.520 --> 47:42.160
there's Gregory Paul's research showing that if you compare developed countries

47:43.280 --> 47:51.760
on what he calls a dysfunctional society scale against how religious they are, well,

47:51.760 --> 47:56.800
the most religious countries are the most dysfunctional, meaning that the more religious

47:56.800 --> 48:05.440
the country is, the higher rates it has of murder, teenage pregnancy, abortion,

48:07.600 --> 48:13.280
various kinds of serious crime, incarceration rates. I mean, all the things that you would expect

48:13.280 --> 48:20.960
that a religion would improve are actually very much worse. And then there's the question, why? So

48:20.960 --> 48:28.720
we're back to causality and correlation. These are all correlations. Now it looks from the evidence

48:28.720 --> 48:39.120
as though it's not that religions cause depravity, murder, incarceration rates, it's rather the

48:39.120 --> 48:44.400
reverse. It's that living in a dysfunctional society where you are afraid for your health,

48:44.400 --> 48:50.880
for your life, for everything makes you turn to religion. And then the means get hold of you

48:50.960 --> 48:54.480
and you start to believe that you're good because you believe this stuff and you're good because

48:54.480 --> 48:59.760
all of that and you're good because you oppose abortion and you whatever and you think people

48:59.760 --> 49:04.480
should be locked up for whatever it is. And so the United States is particularly interesting

49:04.480 --> 49:11.040
in that respect because it's a very rich country, but it has high rates of religion and it's so

49:11.040 --> 49:17.760
different from the UK speaking sort of the same language, which we have a state religion and

49:17.840 --> 49:22.240
they don't. It's so interesting that. So I mean, I just got myself hooked into, you know,

49:22.240 --> 49:27.760
reading loads of stuff to draw and work out the effects of being captured by religious means.

49:28.720 --> 49:33.200
I haven't read, I know Dawkins wrote a book, I think, it wasn't too long ago for,

49:33.200 --> 49:38.320
was it for young teens, I think, for a book? What is it called? Do you remember? I forgot

49:38.320 --> 49:43.440
the name of the book. No, and I haven't read it either. Maybe I should. There's so much to read

49:43.760 --> 49:47.360
and it's so interesting. The reason why I'm asking about that is, I mean, I know that

49:47.360 --> 49:51.200
Charles Darwin is a big inspiration for you. I mean, I love Charles Darwin. He's one of my

49:51.200 --> 49:56.000
favorite people of all time, possibly. And, and I know Dawkins also up there, these guys,

49:56.000 --> 50:01.600
how have they influenced your way of thinking overall in life? Oh, hugely. I mean, my two greatest,

50:01.600 --> 50:05.760
if you have this lovely sort of dinner party thing, you know, who would you invite from the

50:06.080 --> 50:09.200
Mount Rushmore? Your Mount Rushmore.

50:11.440 --> 50:15.280
Why? I'm sorry, I'm not with you. So, you know, Mount Rushmore, the fourth figures,

50:15.280 --> 50:18.480
the leading figures. It's not all those, yeah, but they're all presidents, weren't they?

50:18.480 --> 50:21.600
But I mean, who would those four people be in terms of the thinkers? You're talking about the

50:21.600 --> 50:25.600
dinner table. It's sort of a similar... Oh, no, yeah, yeah. That's so different, though. They're

50:25.600 --> 50:30.080
not on a pedestal. They are. They are. I would like them, like the Archbishop of Canterbury. I

50:30.080 --> 50:34.080
would like to sit down. I like so, my husband and I went to dinner with him. We sat around a

50:34.080 --> 50:38.720
lovely table in Lambeth Palace and had a lovely chat. So, I'm thinking of that, not

50:41.360 --> 50:48.560
so my top two would be Charles Darwin and William James. Now, we haven't mentioned William James,

50:48.560 --> 50:56.320
but he is such a great hero of mine. Now, his two volumes of 1890, The Principles of Psychology,

50:57.040 --> 51:02.720
has such a profound effect on me. And I keep thinking about him, how way ahead of his time he

51:02.720 --> 51:07.600
was, and the way he thought about things. He clearly was struggling with the kind of problems

51:07.600 --> 51:12.880
we've been talking about here, about dualism, about the nature of the world, the nature of the mind.

51:13.760 --> 51:19.120
Can there be split personalities? And does that mean there's really somebody or not?

51:19.120 --> 51:24.080
And I love one of his thoughts about, and this is all in the textbook, and my son, Julian, did a

51:24.080 --> 51:31.600
lovely cartoon of cows, where he says the owner of the thought, and so the thought with a big T,

51:32.560 --> 51:37.600
is then, in the next moment, passes off the owner of the cow's one, and then the thoughts,

51:37.600 --> 51:43.440
passes them on. It's a new owner, but the same, you know, cows. There isn't a, there isn't a

51:43.440 --> 51:53.120
continuous self. Exactly. I'm sorry about that. James's idea that, I mean, his chat is 100 pages,

51:53.120 --> 51:59.360
his chapter on self, and it's really hard going, and I've read it a few times. I'd love to have

51:59.360 --> 52:05.040
time to read it again, but I don't. But it very much fits with the kind of Buddhist

52:06.400 --> 52:13.920
non-self, or another kind of view that the self isn't what you think it is. And the Buddha was

52:13.920 --> 52:17.520
sometimes saying, there is a self in terms of isn't, which of course fits with the same thing.

52:17.520 --> 52:21.920
There is this illusion, but there isn't the thing that you think the illusion tells you there is.

52:22.960 --> 52:28.160
And William James was really struggling with all of that. So he would be, along with Darwin,

52:28.160 --> 52:35.040
they're my two great historical figures that I so much admire. Of recently, well, I know Richard

52:35.040 --> 52:40.800
Dawkins very well. He's been to stay here a few times. You know, I meet him anyway, so I don't

52:40.800 --> 52:49.440
have to have a mythical dinner table. Then it's same. Yep. We have occasional meme lab meetings

52:49.440 --> 52:54.320
here. We've got one coming up soon, and both of them have been to those, and we've been able to

52:54.320 --> 53:00.880
have long chats about memes and things. And I admire both of them, but they're both still alive

53:00.880 --> 53:05.200
and going strong, which is great. One of the William James quotes that come to my mind, because when

53:05.200 --> 53:09.200
you think about, particularly what you're talking about with religion and how people are influenced

53:09.200 --> 53:14.640
by other people and language, etc. I mean, he talks about how pruning of brains William James

53:14.640 --> 53:20.960
once said, I think he said, for a child, sensory inputs, one great blooming, buzzing confusion.

53:20.960 --> 53:24.080
I think it's something along those lines. Yes, yes, the blooming, buzzing confusion.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.600
Yes. Because at some point, we just take in the information we receive, and then that point,

53:27.600 --> 53:32.880
that becomes your fundamental beliefs. And if everything you, if all the memes you were gathering

53:32.880 --> 53:36.640
over the years were about religion or about a specific view on consciousness, that's what

53:36.640 --> 53:41.280
you're firmly going to believe at some point. But the buzzing, blooming confusion is very

53:41.280 --> 53:46.640
interesting because it led to all these different arguments in psychology about just how much we

53:46.640 --> 53:52.000
have prewired and how much we don't. So he was in the direction of, although not entirely,

53:52.720 --> 54:00.320
in the direction of that it's not prewired, it's all got to be in response to the input,

54:00.320 --> 54:06.480
which was a pretty novel idea then really. And now I think we know that there's quite a lot of

54:06.480 --> 54:13.760
prewiring. But still, that the brain becomes organized by the organization in the, in the

54:13.760 --> 54:20.320
structure of the input. So the visual cortex or auditory cortex get organized in the way the

54:20.320 --> 54:24.480
input comes in. And now this is another thing to think about in terms of predictive processing.

54:24.480 --> 54:30.000
So when you think about a system that is at many levels at once trying to predict what's

54:30.000 --> 54:35.600
coming in the, from the next layer, that fits with it. Your, your baby with buzzing,

54:36.880 --> 54:41.680
blooming, buzzing confusion is, is, you know, struggling. It's got a structure set up that

54:41.680 --> 54:45.600
is capable to do this struggling, that is capable of making predictions, but they're going to be

54:45.600 --> 54:50.720
really simple like to do with, if I put, we're back to, if, you know, if I put my arm here,

54:50.720 --> 54:55.360
ooh, it hit something and then I'll predict and the way babies learn that and the way they blah,

54:55.360 --> 55:02.400
blah, blah, blah, and gradually hone what the noises they make according to the responses and

55:02.400 --> 55:06.880
so on. So yes, I think a lot of William James's ideas, not all, I mean, a lot of things he said

55:06.880 --> 55:11.200
were simply bomb, you know, that he didn't have the physiology. But a lot of those ideas

55:11.680 --> 55:15.360
are still helpful. I think one of my favorite quotes as well has got to be,

55:15.360 --> 55:20.400
then it's illusion. I mean, consciousness is illusion off the brain for the brain,

55:20.400 --> 55:25.040
by the brain. Oh, I've not heard that, but yes, yes.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.160
Off the brain for the brain and by the brain. By the brain. Yeah.

55:29.440 --> 55:33.120
When you hear something like that, what do you think? How do you think then it would approach

55:33.120 --> 55:38.000
a lot of the new idealist theories that are coming out today? Any idea? I've spoken to him by email,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.840
but seems to be relatively unavailable to chat on a podcast lately.

55:43.600 --> 55:50.080
Oh, he's been terribly busy with all this paper on artificial persons and all the

55:50.080 --> 55:54.480
danger of that because he normally replies to my emails very quickly and he didn't this time.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.440
And then when he did replies, I've been totally snowed under with all this stuff.

55:57.440 --> 56:03.920
And you know, so that's probably why I think he would be irritated by it,

56:03.920 --> 56:09.760
but I don't know and I shouldn't speak for him. Now, I must say, I believe that when we fixed

56:09.760 --> 56:16.880
this up a long time ago, I said I could only talk for an hour because you can tell I can't,

56:16.880 --> 56:20.240
this is my problem. I've got chronic fatigue. It's not too bad at the moment,

56:20.880 --> 56:26.400
but I can't not pour out lots of energy. So I've been sitting here really enjoying talking to you,

56:26.400 --> 56:30.400
but it takes a lot of energy and I need to sort of collapse pretty soon.

56:30.400 --> 56:33.920
So I completely understand. I know so much, but thank you. I really appreciate it. I've

56:33.920 --> 56:36.720
been waiting a long time and hopefully in the future we can chat about something in a bit

56:36.720 --> 56:39.120
more detail because there's so many topics I want to discuss with you.

56:40.080 --> 56:44.240
Well, you asked brilliant questions. I do quite a lot of podcasts and they vary so much.

56:45.280 --> 56:50.480
And you know, this is one of the fun ones where some of the questions are fun because I can

56:50.480 --> 56:55.520
answer them easily. Others are fun because I can't answer them and you're really making me think

56:56.320 --> 57:00.240
I'm pushing me and that's that's good. So thank you.

57:00.240 --> 57:03.760
I really appreciate it. I mean, it's great to hear that. I feel much better

57:03.760 --> 57:06.240
leaving this conversation knowing you feel that way. Thank you so much.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.640
It's great. Have a great evening, Sue. And yeah, and we'll chat again.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.800
Oh, let's do that. I would enjoy that. Thanks very much. Cheers.

57:14.800 --> 57:20.800
Bye.
