1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Phillip, I want to frame this conversation the same way I did with Keith. I even did

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,720
this with Helen, actually, her idealist view, Keith's illusionism, and not with you and

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,640
panpsychism. But before we get into that, the question I asked them, which is what I'm

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,080
about to ask you is, can you give me a philosophical history of the mind-body problem? How you

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,800
conceptualize this, how you started reading about this topic, and how you got to where

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,160
you are today? The reason why I ask this question is, I believe it allows us to understand

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,160
your views and how it's changed over the years, and how you sort of came to the view you have

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,160
today or the conclusion you have today. So if you had to give me that philosophical history,

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
what would it be?

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Thanks, that's a great first question. Yeah, I mean, the mind-body problem has been wrestled

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:13,080
with for centuries, and I think it arises because there are two things we know about

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,760
in very different ways. There's the physical world around us that we know through our senses

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:28,320
and which we learn more about through scientific investigation. But there's also the world

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,840
of our own experiences, our thoughts, our feelings, which we know about in a quite different

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:45,240
way, I think. I can't look inside your head and see your feelings and experiences. Each

16
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,240
of us knows about our own experiences just through being directly aware of them. If you're

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:02,280
in pain, you're just directly aware of your own feeling of pain. So there are these two

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,200
things that we think are real, namely the physical world we know through the senses

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,480
and our own minds. We know through our immediate awareness of our own conscious experience.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,320
And the challenge is, how do these fit together? How do these seemingly very different things

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,800
fit into a single unified theory of reality? I mean, suddenly nowadays people call it the

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,400
hard problem of consciousness and think of it as the mystery of how do brains make consciousness?

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,040
I mean, that's one way into it. I suppose I think maybe that way of setting it up might

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,600
limit our options somewhat. But I think more generally, that's the question. How does consciousness

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,800
and the physical world fit together? And it's a problem I've been obsessed with as long

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,440
as I can remember, really, because all of the available options seem to have such deep

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000
challenges associated with them. So it's sometimes say it's a little bit like Churchill

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,040
famously said about democracy. It's the worst theory of government apart from all the others.

29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,360
So I sometimes think that's what it's like trying to find a solution to the mind-body

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,800
problem. You're sort of trying to find the least worst option. But yeah, that's the core of it,

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,840
I think. So if you had to look back at the philosophers, the scientists, perhaps, who

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,880
influenced your views the most leading up to this point, who stands out for you? Who were those

33
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,800
people who actively changed the way you perceived this problem?

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,280
I think Descartes has to be a huge influence. Going back to studying Descartes at high school,

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,760
Mr Foley was my philosophy teacher. I didn't do that well, actually. I would keep me to go

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,600
about and visit him one day. But I mean, what I think Descartes got dead right is that the mind

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,120
is better known than the body and the external world. This is what we find in the first two

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,680
meditations. Descartes' famous work is set up as six meditations where the narrator is sort of

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:20,560
philosophizing to himself or herself. I suppose himself if it's Descartes. And the method is to

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,520
try and doubt everything that we can doubt, to see where we end up, to see what, if anything,

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,600
can't be doubted. And the narrator, namely Descartes, concludes that the body, the brain,

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,680
the physical world, all these things might not exist for all we know for sure. But the one thing

43
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,040
we can't doubt is the reality of one's own conscious mind. So I mean, again, just to come to a vivid

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,320
case of if you're in pain, you can't really doubt the reality of your agony because you're

45
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,640
sort of directly in touch with it in a way that makes its reality totally evident to you.

46
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,360
So I think Descartes was right about that. After those meditations, it goes a bit

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,880
sketchy, sort of, tries to prove the existence of God and then prove the existence of everything

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,800
else on that basis. It goes a bit awry there, I think. But I mean, in more recent times,

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,760
the philosopher David Chalmers was a huge influence on me. You know, when I studied philosophy,

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,160
we were taught the two traditional options, dualism, Descartes view, that the mind is

51
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,000
separate from the body or the brain. At the other extreme, materialism, the view that all that

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,840
really exists is the physical world, bodies, brains, physical processes in the brain.

53
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,960
And I came to find deep for both of those traditional options. But we were just taught

54
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
that's what you've got to choose from, like in a lump bit. And I got really disillusioned and I

55
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,560
actually left my first degree just wanting to stop thinking about consciousness, thinking there was

56
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,880
no resolution. That's actually what I argued for in my end of degree dissertation. But I later

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,880
discovered the writings of David Chalmers, who really brought back to life, I guess,

58
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,200
something like the Cartesian project. Also, Thomas Nagel, his famous paper, What's It Like to Be a

59
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Bat, where he argues that no matter how much we learn about the neurophysiology of a bat, we'll

60
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,800
never fully understand what it's like to be a bat, what it's like to adopt a bat's perspective.

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,360
Galen Strawson, actually, so I wasn't taught these things as an undergraduate. And then

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,480
when I started my MA, finally at the university, there was a professor who thought all the same

63
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:00,320
things I did who adopted this crazy view known as panpsychism that I that I adopt. And so this

64
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,160
was Galen Strawson. And he was a real confidence booster. I hadn't met another professional

65
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,920
philosopher who thought anything like the kind of views I was attracted to in the philosophy

66
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,880
of mind. So he, from personal interaction, he was a very important influence. And later also,

67
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,680
David Chalmers has been an important mentor as I got to know him personally. And finally,

68
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,400
someone who has a very opposed view to me, David Papineau, who was a physicalist with a total

69
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,680
opposite view to me, but was very kind in guiding me and and help him helping me argue against him

70
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,880
and understand his view and argue against him. And was really a model for I think, really set

71
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,360
me a model of how intellectual interaction should happen through civilized respectful

72
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,240
disagreement. So there's probably more than I can mention, but that's that's a handful of the

73
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,600
influences, I think. I mean, you mentioned so many great names, the legends in the field.

74
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,640
But something that captures my attention is exactly what you concluded with is that having this

75
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,840
discourse and disagreement actually helps us move forward. And I think you and Keith are doing that

76
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,440
wonderfully at the moment. I mean, mind chat, the fact that you guys are such esoterically

77
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,520
different views, opposing different opposites in a sense. I mean, to keep consciousness, phenomenal

78
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
consciousness is an illusion. Whereas for you, consciousness is the fundamental basis of reality.

79
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,480
So let's go through panpsychism. Let's run through this. Give me your definition of panpsychism,

80
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,880
how you see it, how you interpret it, and how it's different, perhaps from other views

81
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,280
of panpsychists out there who are perhaps popular in the field.

82
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Brilliant. I mean, just to say on your last point, you know, I've just always loved to engage

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,800
with people with radically different views to me, just try and get into their mind and think,

84
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,120
how are they thinking these crazy sounding things? And I really do think that's a really productive

85
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,040
thing to do and something me and Keith have tried to have aspired to. Don't always achieve it.

86
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,760
Sometimes we get a bit annoyed with each other. But yes, but turning to panpsychism,

87
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,320
so I mean, in our, you know, I guess, in our standard way of thinking about things, consciousness

88
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,560
only exists in the brains of highly evolved organisms. And so only exists in

89
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,200
a tiny part of the universe and only in very recent history, at least in terms of the

90
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,840
cosmic history of the universe. But for the panpsychist, consciousness pervades the physical

91
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,680
universe and is a fundamental feature of it. Contemporary panpsychists don't necessarily

92
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,600
think that literally everything is conscious, despite the meaning of the word pan means

93
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,520
everything psyche mind. So the word literally means everything has mind. But contemporary

94
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:07,440
panpsychists tend to think that the basic building blocks of reality, perhaps fundamental

95
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,440
particles like electrons and quarks, or perhaps universe wide fields, many theoretical physicists

96
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,280
tend to think that fields rather than particles are the things that make up reality. But whichever

97
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:29,680
way you go on that, these basic constituents of the physical universe have very rudimentary forms

98
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,840
of subjective experience. So not the very rich, complicated experience that you and I have,

99
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,040
not just you and I or the human beings or their animals, which is the result of millions of years

100
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:53,040
of evolution. So the idea would be that that's what evolution does with consciousness molds

101
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,840
very simple forms over millions of years into much more complex forms that you or I enjoy.

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,800
But the thought was in the beginning, as it were, all there were were these very rudimentary

103
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,040
forms of experience at the level of fundamental physics and everything else is kind of built

104
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,920
up from there. So in essence, you're saying that let's say quarks, bosons, well, the most

105
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,280
fundamental particles that exist have experience in a sense, it's got some sort of an experiential

106
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,600
aspect to it, not necessarily a thinking cognitively engaging sort of experience,

107
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,240
but an experience nonetheless, this comes down to some sort of a qualitative phenomenon.

108
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:46,240
Absolutely. So, yeah, it's hard because people all automatically think of something like human

109
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,760
experience that I think of the electron feeling existential angst or wondering if it's Tuesday

110
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
or something. But, but you know, think about, I mean, as a way into this, I often like to

111
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,440
go down the spectrum of life from very complicated organisms, as we move to simpler

112
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:12,400
forms of life, mice, bed bugs to bed, but if bed bugs have experience, it's presumably

113
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,320
much more simple than we can conceive of. And as we move to simpler and simpler forms of life,

114
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,160
we find simpler and simpler forms of experience. For the panpsychist, this just continues right

115
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,960
down to the basic building blocks of the physical universe. But you said that an aspect of it is

116
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,680
experiential. And I'm not sure how you intended that exactly, but that can almost suggest a sort

117
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:46,800
of dualism like particles have physical properties like mass and charge, and also these invisible

118
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,480
consciousness properties. But that's not actually the the view as it's standardly defended these

119
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,760
days, the view is rather that all there really is at the fundamental level of reality is forms of

120
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,120
consciousness. And what we think of as particles or fields or physical properties like mass,

121
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,280
spin and charge are just ways of describing these fundamental forms of consciousness.

122
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,320
So it's a radically non dualistic picture of reality is not mined on the one hand matter on

123
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,600
the other. In some sense, all there is is mind. And what we call matter is just a way of describing

124
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,800
these fundamental forms of consciousness did not intend for for it to have that dualistic

125
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,360
aspect. But so in essence, what you're actually saying is that the charge, the the movement of

126
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,360
the particle, these are the things it's doing. It's not what it is fun. That's that's the basic

127
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
difference here. These are merely the way in which it's behaving. But it's not it doesn't explain

128
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,120
what it actually is. Yes. And this is the reason panpsychism after being

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,080
laughed at for so long in so far as it was thought about at all. I think for a long time there was

130
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,840
maybe just this guy Timothy Sprig in Edinburgh, who defended panpsychism. I

131
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,520
earlier my undergraduate career, I went to a conference they had just after he died

132
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:22,240
to to to to remember him. That was my one of my first conferences. But it's recently again,

133
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,480
come to come to attention, largely through the rediscovery of really important work by Bertrand

134
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,840
Russell from the 1930s. And very much as you said, Bert, heaven, Russell's starting point

135
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,880
observation was that for all its virtues and wonders, physics is confined to telling us about

136
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,440
what stuff does physics tells you what an electron does, what a quark does, how it gives us

137
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,200
detailed equations to predict how fields are going to evolve over time. And that's really

138
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,160
useful information and allows us to manipulate the world in extraordinary ways and build

139
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,800
incredible technology. But as a, you know, as a philosopher interested in the

140
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:18,480
ultimate nature of reality, you might want to know, okay, that's interesting, very interesting

141
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,440
what an electron does. But I'm also curious about what an electron is. And about that physics,

142
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,760
as it were, isn't really interested. It's just interested in the behavior.

143
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,000
So there's a kind of a hole in our scientific story of reality there. And then Russell's

144
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,960
observation is, well, we're looking for this, we're looking for a place for consciousness,

145
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,920
this mind body problem we started with, how the hell do we fit consciousness into our scientific

146
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,880
story? We've got this big hole, maybe we can stick consciousness in the hole. So I sometimes

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,040
put it by saying, on this view, matter is what consciousness does. So there's just conscious,

148
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,160
there's just very simple forms of consciousness interacting in simple predictable ways.

149
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:15,360
And what physics does is give us equations to describe how that stuff behaves. So in this way,

150
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,920
physics emerges from underlying facts about consciousness. So typically, people try and

151
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,080
do it the other way around, they can start with physics, or physical science, more generally

152
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,400
neuroscience, and try and work out how you get consciousness out of that. I think that's

153
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,240
impossible, incoherent even, for reasons we could perhaps discuss. But actually, it turns out to

154
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,400
be pretty easy to do it the other way around. To start with some facts about very simple forms of

155
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,000
consciousness, and get physics out of that. And that's very easy, because physics is just

156
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,560
purely mathematical. So as long as you've got, it's just about patterns, really. So as long as

157
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,920
you've got some kind of stuff, whatever it is, interacting in the right way to get the right

158
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,800
patterns, you've got physics. Yeah. And I think something we often don't, well, most physicalists

159
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,480
don't comprehend and think about more than they should, is that we even speak about the fact

160
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,760
that physics claims that 95% of the universe is inexplicable. It's not, it's something we don't

161
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,720
know anything about. So physics is so thoroughly incomplete, that it's, you shouldn't, it's like

162
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,600
almost a clue that you should not be a physicalist, because we, in essence, understand almost

163
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,840
nothing about the universe. Yeah, that's a good point as well. I mean, well, one thing I said,

164
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,040
I guess, it could go a few different ways. I mean, if you're talking about dark matter,

165
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,160
I suppose that's distinct, as I understand, at least from the matter that makes up our bodies

166
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and brains. So someone like Sean Carroll, who I've argued with a great deal, thinks, oh, yeah,

167
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,640
physics is far from complete. But in terms of the matter in our bodies and brains,

168
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,200
in normal terrestrial conditions, so not in very high energy, or the kind of high gravity when

169
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,760
you're about to step into a black hole, he thinks, you know, in those conditions, it's very well

170
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,520
understood. And he uses this as an argument against the kind of view I adopt, where consciousness

171
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,680
is a fundamental feature of reality. But there are, I mean, there are two problems with that. I

172
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:42,160
mean, one is that although we do have some kind of consensus about physics at those energy levels,

173
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,440
the kind of experiments we use to support our theories in that region, as Sean Carroll agrees,

174
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,920
are all conducted with very small numbers of particles. You know, for example, in particle

175
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:01,920
colliders, we just have no idea, I would argue, whether the equations would look exactly the

176
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:09,520
same in incredibly complex systems like living brains, you know, one of the most, you know,

177
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,640
with 85 billion neurons, you know, we've never done any experiments to test that I feel, I think

178
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,360
it's a kind of zeitgeist of the moment that people assume some kind of very reductionist story.

179
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,440
But given that our physics is based on experiments of small numbers of particles,

180
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,560
I think we really just based on the experiments ought to be quite agnostic about that. But of

181
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,280
course, the more fundamental reason is, okay, even if, even if Sean Cowell right, for example,

182
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:46,240
we do understand the physics of the matter in our bodies and brains, that's only telling us

183
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:54,880
what matter does, not what it is. So even in that case, there's still the option of

184
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,680
the panpsychist hypothesis. Of course, you'd have to look at what, you know, what are the

185
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:08,560
reasons for accepting that hypothesis. But I don't think really what we currently know about

186
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,720
the physical world scientifically casts any doubt on that story.

187
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes. I mean, when people talk about panpsychism, a lot of people sort of say it as if it's some

188
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,720
spiritual claim, because it was often associated with spirituality, a lot of people who meditate,

189
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,440
for example, people perhaps in Eastern traditions, they they've made this claim before many years

190
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,840
ago. So for thousands of years, many people have been saying, I mean, this entire universe is

191
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,280
conscious. If someone has a, an LSD trip or an asset trip, that they start to see things in a way

192
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,960
as if the universe is sort of palpating or has a heartbeat or sort of some sort of a living

193
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,480
system. So this has always been part of the conversation. But yet when people talk about

194
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,840
panpsychism, a lot of physicalist reductionists have this dark, they look down upon these people

195
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,080
as if they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. What do you think they most

196
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,280
misinterpret about this?

197
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
In terms, so in terms of the connection to spirituality, I always say two things.

198
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,800
Firstly, that there is no necessary connection with panpsychism and anything spiritual.

199
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Many of the contemporary proponents, like Angela Mendelovich, or Luke Rolos, or indeed David

200
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
Chalmers, you sympathetic to panpsychism, these people are the most, you know,

201
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,640
atheistic secular reductionists, but they reject the coherence of a materialistic

202
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,760
kind of consciousness. And they think consciousness obviously exists. So they don't believe in any

203
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,760
sort of transcendent realm. They just believe in pain and seeing red and think, you know,

204
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
look, we need an explanation of that. In many ways, I think there's perhaps a

205
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,440
division in the panpsychist contemporary community between people who are more secular and people

206
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
who are more open to spiritual ideas, a little bit like maybe you had in the psychoanalytic

207
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,640
community between Freud and Jung, you know, Jung was very open to spiritual convictions,

208
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,160
whereas Freud is like, this is supposed to be science. Get all this mumbo-jumbo out of my face.

209
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:34,320
But anyway, so firstly, there's no necessary connection. But if for independent reasons,

210
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,480
perhaps as you say, on the basis of mystical experiences, maybe through meditation or maybe

211
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,280
through psychedelics or whatever, you independently have certain spiritual convictions, then

212
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,640
probably a panpsychist worldview would be more consonant with those convictions. So,

213
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,160
you know, if you have the kind of mystical experience you just described where that

214
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,920
it seems to you that reality is filled with consciousness, well, if you're a panpsychist,

215
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,200
you already think that. And so, you know, whereas if you're a materialist and you just think

216
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,680
at the basic level of reality, it's just, it's just what you get from physics, then

217
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,480
it looks like you have to think the mystical experience of that kind is a sort of

218
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,600
delusion of some kind. You don't have to think that. Of course, it's a further deep philosophical

219
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,800
question, even so, whether it is rational to trust mystical experiences. I mean, on that score,

220
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:38,480
I am somewhat persuaded by the argument of William James in his chapter on mystical

221
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,520
experiences in his great book, The Varieties of Religious Experience. Most of this is a

222
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,680
psychological study of mystical experiences, just as a psychological kind. But at the end, he says,

223
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,480
you know, would it be rational for someone having that kind of experience to trust it?

224
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,280
And he says, well, look, if we say it's okay to trust our ordinary empirical experiences,

225
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,520
you know, there's a table in front of me, but it's not okay to trust the mystic to trust her

226
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,360
apparent mystical experiences, then there seems to be a double standard there. You know,

227
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,360
yes, a mystical experience could be a delusion, could be just something funny in the brain.

228
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,600
But our ordinary empirical experiences could be a delusion. We could be in the matrix, right?

229
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,480
This could be a long dream as Descartes made vivid to us. So, you know, I think all

230
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,200
knowledge is rooted in trusting experience, trusting how things seem to be. And

231
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,320
I don't see why you can say what the argument would be, that it's okay to trust

232
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,120
empirical experiences, but not okay to trust mystical experiences. What's the relevant difference?

233
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
I don't think anyone's ever answered that.

234
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah, I mean, even when you take into account, I mean, certain physical is someone like, let's

235
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,520
say, Anil Seth. I mean, the way he describes reality as a controlled hallucination and yet,

236
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,720
in a dream, it's sort of an uncontrolled hallucination. So, in a sense, when we're awake,

237
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,160
where our hallucinations are more attuned to the reality. So, although I am hallucinating this

238
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,880
experience, the fact that I do pick up the pen and it does feel like I'm picking up the pen means

239
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,480
it's a little bit more controlled, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm hallucinating,

240
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,400
in essence, the fundamental nature hasn't changed whether I'm asleep or awake.

241
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,040
They're both still hallucination. So, in what you're saying, it makes so much sense because the

242
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,880
truth is, whether it's mystical, whether it's some sort of a thought or whether it's reality,

243
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
they're both still inexplicably different. They're the same.

244
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah. I mean, Anil Seth's work is really, really interesting. We've debated a lot of times where

245
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,000
due to debate again in November of the Royal Institute of Philosophy annual debate.

246
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,800
And I'm always saying to him, I totally agree with all your scientific work. But I think

247
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:19,040
the scientific work on consciousness just leaves open all the philosophical positions.

248
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:27,680
You could be, Anil is a materialist, but you could have a dualist version of Anil,

249
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,560
a panpsychist version of Anil. We've got to distinguish the philosophical

250
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,080
aspects of the problem from the scientific aspects. Some people think, oh,

251
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,320
science is proving materialism. But no, materialism is a philosophical hypothesis

252
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,040
as is panpsychism, as in dualism. And we need to assess all these on philosophical grounds.

253
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,040
But actually, I've digressed slightly. Coming back to your point, which was an excellent one,

254
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:04,960
I think. Yeah. I mean, some philosophers get a little bit not annoyed by the word hallucination

255
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,640
there. It sort of seems to suggest that the external world is not real in some sense. But

256
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:18,880
if it just means that our experiences are in our own minds, in our heads, they don't put us in

257
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,920
direct contact with the world around us. We can't get outside of our own consciousness

258
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:33,440
to see if it corresponds to reality. So what do we do? You just, all you have direct contact

259
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,000
with is your own conscious experience right now. You don't even know

260
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,640
know whether you existed a few seconds ago. You can only do that by trusting your memory,

261
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,400
which is itself another kind of seeming, another kind of experience.

262
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,720
You know, of course, we can, you know, then people say, well, we can, we can check our memories,

263
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,200
we can check our senses, we can get precise with science. But only once you decide to

264
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,080
trust them in the first place, if I don't decide to just trust without any reason, my senses or

265
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,880
my memory, I can't get out of the present moment. I can't do any science. So although in a sense,

266
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,640
we can verify our senses, what our senses are telling us, only that's only in a kind of circular

267
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,880
way once we've already trusted them. So it seems to pretty, pretty much the same in the mystical

268
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,560
experience. You can't totally rule out it's a delusion, but it's the same in the case of

269
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,840
sensory experiences. And if anything, people who have mystical experiences claim that it seems

270
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,720
more real than their ordinary experiences. So I think I once, I think I once heard you mention

271
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:54,720
the fact that when someone claims to have some sort of experience in whatever way they have it,

272
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,120
what makes that any less true than anything that they've experienced otherwise. Like in

273
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,880
the normal realm, when you speak about this quite often, I feel that when I first started out reading

274
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,640
about consciousness, when I first entered the field from med school, when I thought about it,

275
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,680
I mean, I always wanted to study this, I was materialistic all the way through. I even wrote

276
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:25,520
an essay, my dissertation, Keith read it. He gave me comments. It was, but I defended illusionism

277
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,800
as a theory of consciousness using psychiatry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm going now.

278
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm really joking. But prior to that, I had the emergentism view of consciousness.

279
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,880
Then I somehow slipped into illusionism. Sorry. Had the flu last week, I'm just, I'm slowly

280
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,320
recovering. And for everyone who's watching, and every time you see Philip looking down,

281
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,280
it's because he screens at the bottom. So don't, he's, he's just looking at me basically.

282
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,160
You give him a secret. So I, I'm in some context in case they're wondering,

283
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,560
is he reading something? What's going on? Well, I was turning my emails off actually that bleep

284
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,280
to one point. Anyway, but anyway, so yeah, as I was saying, when I started out, I started out as

285
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,200
someone who believed in emergentism, I mean, slowly you work your way up, then I went into

286
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,960
illusionism. And from starting this podcast and listening to people's coherent logical

287
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:27,520
arguments, philosophical arguments, I don't know anymore. I have absolutely no idea what I'm so

288
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,440
agnostic at this point that to me, if anyone approaches me with some sort of a cogent coherent

289
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,520
argument, I'm willing to listen all the way. And I think that a lot of scientists per se,

290
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:47,440
because of scientism, just look down on certain views like panpsychism, idealism, in fact,

291
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,000
we should talk about those two and how they're different or similar, because they both somehow

292
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,720
talk about the consciousness as being fundamental. But I think that link as we spoke about earlier

293
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,720
between spirituality and panpsychism is exactly why scientists or scientism hinders listening to

294
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,720
this philosophical argument. Do you agree with that? I do very much. I mean, I think

295
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,760
we're going through a strange period of history where people are understandably

296
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,400
totally blown away by the success of physical science and the wonderful technology it's

297
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,400
produced. And that has such a visceral effect on you think, oh my God, we can put someone on the

298
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,640
moon, we can have these tiny mechanisms that you know, just such incredible technology.

299
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:48,720
But it doesn't follow from that that experiments and observation is the only way of finding out

300
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,720
about reality. Clearly, experiments and observation are a very important, very successful way of

301
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,000
finding out about reality. But their success does not entail that there are not other ways.

302
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,400
And the least controversial way of finding out about reality, independently of observation

303
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:15,760
and experiments, is the reality of your own feelings and experiences. If you strictly follow

304
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,360
the kind of methodology of Daniel Dennett or my good friend Keith Frankish, and you only believe

305
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,840
in what can be established on the basis of observation experiment, then you're led to

306
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:39,680
disbelief in your own feelings and experiences, or at least you're not allowed to believe in

307
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:49,680
anything known on the basis of introspection that doesn't also come from external observation.

308
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,560
So Keith often says, oh, I believe in consciousness, I believe in feelings and experiences.

309
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,120
But when you dig into that, he totally agrees with Dennett. And Dennett says the

310
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,360
data for a science of consciousness or what he calls hetrophenomenology, which is

311
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,600
explicitly restricted to what you can know from the outside, including reports, when you

312
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,680
say something about your consciousness. But Dennett isn't taking that as testimony about an

313
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,080
inner realm of your inner life. He's just taking the report as a physical act that we need to

314
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,160
explain in terms of brain mechanisms or whatever. So the only things Dennett believes in, and Keith

315
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:43,520
believes in, are what can be established from third-person public observation experiment.

316
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,920
Why? I've never, my hours and hours and hours of talking to Keith, why can't I? Yes, of course,

317
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,960
experiments and observation are very important, but what about my immediate awareness of my pain?

318
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:04,080
Why isn't that another fundamental way of knowing about reality? So I think, you know,

319
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
someone like Keith is at least consistent. I think I'm consistent, but I think most people

320
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,840
in this confused middle way where they think, of course, my consciousness exists,

321
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:23,360
but they don't follow through and realize, in that case, there's a fundamental data point here

322
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,920
over and above experiments and observations. So you can't just say, we can only find out about

323
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,040
reality through observation experiments, because no, there's something else we need to plug in here.

324
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,120
And so that's the least controversial example, but I think there are other examples,

325
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:47,440
like our experience of value, you know, our experience of the human trafficking is abhorrent.

326
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,920
We think there's something objectively bad about this. And you could say, well, that's just our

327
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:02,240
subjective reaction. Well, it doesn't seem to be. Why? Why, if it's okay, I mean, that's just like

328
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,640
saying, oh, my experience at the table might be hallucination. I might be in the matrix. I might

329
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,000
be, but it's rational to trust my experience of the table. And it seems to me similarly

330
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,360
rational to trust my deepest moral experiences. So I think there are many different ways of

331
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,480
knowing about reality. And the task of the philosopher, which we've kind of forgotten about

332
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,440
in recent times, in my view, is to put them all together. It's the job of synthesis. Take what

333
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,000
we know from science, what we know from our careful ethical thinking, what we know about

334
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,160
mathematical reality, excuse me, the world of numbers and logic that necessary structural

335
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,200
reality mathematicians and logicians tell us about what we know about our own conscious experience

336
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,360
and synthesize it all together in a single unified theory of reality. So that, you know,

337
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,760
that's what I'm most passionate about is moving us on from this scientism, where we think,

338
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,480
no, it's just, you just got it, all we can really believe in is what we know from experiments,

339
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,800
and everything else has to be squeezed into that. And if it can't be, it doesn't exist.

340
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,960
Because that leads to this really impoverished picture of reality where really, there's,

341
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,920
that our official worldview is doesn't allow for the reality of consciousness, doesn't allow for

342
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:33,120
the reality of moral facts about good and bad and human dignity. And I think that's

343
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,440
a weird, unhealthy, difficult way to live. I mean, if it was the truth, it'd be the truth,

344
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,560
and we'd have to get used to it. But once we see that there is no good reason, philosophically

345
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,840
speaking, not to take seriously these other, these other ways of knowing about reality,

346
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,240
because all knowledge, including scientific knowledge is just rooted in trusting experience,

347
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,960
then I think we can, we can come to a more expansive conception of the world we live in,

348
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
and one that's a little bit better for our mental and spiritual well-being, I think.

349
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,480
I mean, you paint, it's a bit long-winded. No, no, it's fine. The more long-winded,

350
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,160
the better. I think the listeners, they want to hear you've used them. This is all about,

351
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,960
I mean, it's your episode. This is about you. But along all the lines of what you were talking

352
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,520
about, Dennett, how would you respond to something like this? Because Dennett once

353
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,880
said something about idealism and panpsychism in a way, describing them sort of as a

354
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,120
modern-day version of the Ian Vitale. I mean, I mean, we're always looking for something deeper.

355
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,400
We always want that little extra thing that makes us a little more special somehow.

356
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,560
And for humans, from it being life, being at the center of the universe at some point,

357
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,800
Copernicus ruins that, then Darwin takes us off the top of the food chain,

358
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,360
and now all we have left is consciousness. So we're going to find whatever way we can

359
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,200
to make this the most important thing. What do you think about that? How do you respond to

360
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,640
something like that? Well, it's an ad hominem argument, isn't it? Which means it's not engaging

361
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,440
with the argument. It's speculating, psychoanalyzing about the motivations of the person defending it.

362
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,480
You know, I think we're used to, we're very culturally used to the idea that

363
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,120
people who have religious or spiritual ideas, it's because they can't face the reality of

364
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,120
science or something, that they need to believe in something. But actually, for my own case,

365
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:54,240
I mean, I think I'm more subject to the motivations that lie behind the Dennett picture,

366
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,600
which are very seductive as well. You know, it's very seductive to have this simple picture that,

367
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,760
you know, experiments are giving us the truth, like the kind of Ricky Gervais story, you know,

368
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,920
listen to Ricky Gervais. I think Ricky Gervais, it's very important to his identity and his sense

369
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,120
of who he is, and his sense of security, that I think he needs to believe in this very simple

370
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:24,480
story. The experiments give us the answers, and we're on the right side of it. And these

371
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,400
superstitious fools, they're on, you know, I think that's, you can psychoanalyze people's

372
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,280
motivations in that way. And I mean, that's the, I feel often very silly defending the views I do,

373
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,280
because in the kind of, you know, culture that I was grew up in, and that I hang around in,

374
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:57,760
these things are, don't fit in. And so, you know, if I need to be, I need to constantly

375
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,840
analyze why I'm thinking what I'm thinking, and I'm constantly critiquing my arguments.

376
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,080
But I'm actually, I actually think I need to be more on guard about the seductions of

377
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,720
scientists, than the seductions of some need to believe I'm special or something.

378
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,320
You know, look, oh, I mean, at the end of the day, one can only speak for oneself,

379
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,200
that, you know, I'm sure I do have motivations, but fundamental in lots of ways. But fundamentally,

380
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,160
I've always just really wanted to know what's true. That's just been my job. I want to know the

381
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,760
answers here. And, and, you know, I've changed my mind a lot. I constantly,

382
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,080
sort of talking to myself in my head, trying to find the best argument, because I want to know,

383
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,240
is this right? Is this, I just, you know, I just want to know the truth. So, you know,

384
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,160
and then if Dennis says he doesn't believe me, then what can you do? But at the end of the day,

385
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,800
we should just engage with the arguments and, I mean, hatred phenomenology, as you say,

386
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,040
I mean, Keith calls it quasi phenomenal experiences. So this, so they're, they're sort of

387
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,040
implicit that it's implicit that it's existing, but it's just not what we think it is to these

388
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,720
to, to these thinkers. It's almost, it is there. It's just how we interpret it that's different,

389
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,040
and a bit misleading. So that, that doesn't sound too radical, does it?

390
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,040
You know, when you say our consciousness is just different to how we think of it,

391
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,760
what you've got to know about Keith and that, that it's position, I should be, he's probably

392
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,920
going to be listening, might listen to this bunny, is just come back to this point,

393
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,960
the heterophenomenology idea that the only data for a science of consciousness are what you can

394
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:49,120
know from the outside, right? That is the only things we can take seriously. So again, you know,

395
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,360
that includes what people say, but it's not what they say, because then you can, I think,

396
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,440
I think most people, when they, when they, you know, when they trust what someone says,

397
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,920
they're in pain, they trust, they're taking that as testimony and evidence about what can't be seen,

398
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,200
like I can't see your pain, but you tell me about it, and I thereby indirectly know,

399
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,160
that's not how Keith sees it, right? He sees the report, the act, the physical act of your

400
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,520
mouth moving as the datum. It is the first person objective, quantitative experience,

401
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,960
which that's everything, that's all that exists, right? First person's objective,

402
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,640
qualitative experience, which to you is the fundamental experience. And to Keith is the

403
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,760
complete opposite. Yeah, I mean, well, it's both, isn't I mean, of course, I agree with Keith that

404
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,920
that we, of course, who would deny that we do know a lot from the outside. And that's part of

405
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,880
the data, but I've just, I've never seen a good argument from Keith about why I can't just take

406
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,360
it as a starting point. Introspect, my feeling of, you know, then it's, then it's noticed,

407
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,120
you know, then it's got fascinating arguments about how introspection can lead as a stray.

408
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,520
Eric Schvitzkabel, one of my favorite philosophers who's a materialist,

409
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,520
has got some great stuff on that. But okay, introspection makes some mistakes.

410
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,960
Doesn't mean the whole story's wrong. Like, you know, that

411
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,840
yeah, Eric gives objective qualities we seem to experience are just not real at all. So,

412
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,000
so that, yeah, the challenge is, I think the more conventional

413
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,320
physicalist picture you refer to any of the emergentist picture that they want to try and

414
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:43,360
reduce or account for, they say, oh, yeah, we believe in subjective experience.

415
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,840
We want to account for it in terms of the purely third person quantitative science.

416
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,960
I think Keith and I both agree that just doesn't make any sense. That's just

417
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,280
thinking you can't even, you know, you can't even articulate these subjective private qualities,

418
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,120
like the redness of a red experience in the language of physical science. So,

419
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,840
you know, your neuroscientific theory couldn't even articulate the data. So it's not going to

420
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,800
be able to explain it if it can't even articulate it. So we both agree that doesn't make sense.

421
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,080
But he thinks, well, just believe in this stuff, you know, about through the third person way.

422
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,640
And if you can sort of translate your talk of consciousness into

423
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,160
the stuff, you know, about in third person terms and okay, that's fine. But

424
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,280
you're only allowed to do that. Why? Why? It's just, I think it's just over-enthusiasm with

425
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,560
science. But you mentioned Eric Schwitzka. I think I interrupted you there.

426
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,200
Yeah, sorry. No, we, I mean, Eric and I also chatted about it.

427
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,480
Oh, brilliant.

428
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,760
He is very skeptical. I mean, he's got that skeptical mindset that leads him to think of

429
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,640
so many creative different ways that you can interpret reality and the way we live.

430
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,520
I mean, some of his philosophy of science fiction is very intriguing,

431
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,000
very diverse writing. And I think that only happens when you are sort of

432
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,000
someone who can think metaphysically about things without necessarily having a religious or

433
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,080
spiritual view on it. There wasn't, there's almost no dogma towards it. You're just

434
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,600
naturally skeptical. Keith and I actually had a three hour conversation about illusionism.

435
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,160
We went into the ethics of it all. It was quite a long chat. But I just spoke,

436
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,760
I think about three days ago to Helen, yet to Chappelle, am I saying the surname correctly?

437
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:35,040
But we spoke about idealism and your view, panpsychist, the panpsychist and the idealist view

438
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,440
sort of overlap in certain ways to some people. And to some people, they believe it's completely

439
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,000
different. How would you differentiate between these two views? I mean, there's a lot of new

440
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,720
people out there. Bernardo Castro is Donald Hoffman with conscious realism slash idealism in a sense,

441
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,080
because he is taking consciousness to be fundamental. How do you differentiate your views?

442
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,800
Good. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, to start off with, obviously, I mean, I think of

443
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,120
all of these views as very much on the same side of the debate and close in all sorts of ways.

444
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:18,480
It's just wonderful that from both science and philosophy, people are really exploring these

445
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,040
ideas that start off with consciousness and build up on that basis instead of starting off with

446
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,600
matter and getting to consciousness starting off with consciousness itself. So, you know,

447
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:38,320
it's great all these views on the table. People define terms in different ways. The way I tend

448
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:46,960
to think about it is that the panpsychist, although they think consciousness is fundamental,

449
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,840
they also think the physical world is fundamental. But without being due list because

450
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,120
how do you square that circle? Well, the physical world is just somehow made up of

451
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:05,920
consciousness or infused with consciousness. Whereas the idealist, I think, tends to think

452
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,280
there's something more fundamental than the physical world. Either the physical world is

453
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,400
some kind of illusion, or there's some deeper reality underlying the physical world.

454
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,880
So I think Bernardo and Donald Hoffman fit into that camp. It's a little bit difficult with Helen,

455
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:40,240
actually. But her view is inspired by George Barclay, the great 18th century idealist who,

456
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,760
yeah, thought that the physical world is real, but it's not fundamental tables and chairs and

457
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,320
mountains and so on or constructions out of ideas. At the fundamental level of reality, we've just

458
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,800
got kind of immaterial minds. And the physical world is constructed out of ideas in those minds.

459
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,840
And she sort of relates God from that picture. So to her, it's the ideal, the Berkeley and

460
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:12,320
idealism without God. Yeah. So then God was central to Barclay's picture,

461
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,440
because it's a question, well, what happens to a table when we're not looking at it?

462
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,280
Yeah. And Barclay's idea is what God's looking at it. And then Helen's idea building on that was,

463
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,120
well, why does it have to have, why does this cosmic mind or whatever it is,

464
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,480
have to have all the attributes of God? Why does it have to be all powerful? Why does it

465
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,960
even have to be a sort of thinking agent in order to sort of experience the table when

466
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,360
no one's looking at it? So she instead of thinks of it as a sort of tapestry of experience,

467
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,240
lots of threads of experience. So, but if we, I think the problem is, I think she's

468
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,040
problem in terms of distinguishing her view from panpsychism is, I think she wants,

469
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,640
maybe does she want to identify that tapestry with the physical world?

470
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:10,320
Yeah. Helen is idealist in the way she thinks. There's almost, she's just defending a sort of

471
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:20,000
idea within idealism without actively calling herself an idealist. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

472
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:29,520
that's a good point. And, and, but why that view that she explores should counters idealism rather

473
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,360
than panpsychism? I'm not totally sure actually. But after having such a lot conversation,

474
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:43,920
I'm still not entirely sure. Yeah, because it's not, it doesn't fit the most standard understanding

475
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:51,040
of idealism where there's something underlying the physical world. And, and that's, I mean,

476
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,960
that's the argument I have with Donald Hoffman. I'm not sure the motive, I never understand

477
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,040
the motivation for thinking there's something deeper than the physical world.

478
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,880
You know, so in a way you can think of panpsychism as a sort of middle way between

479
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,480
materialism and idealism. So there's for the panpsychist, you know, in some sense,

480
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,320
there's just the physical world, particles and fields. But that's filled out with consciousness.

481
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,880
And I don't see why we want a place for consciousness. Why can't we put it as it

482
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,040
were inside the mathematical structures of physics? Why do we have to put it at a,

483
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,200
at a deeper level than that? I've never really understood the motivation.

484
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,920
Sorry, this is going to digress, but it's going to go back to something you mentioned earlier,

485
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:49,520
which was, I mean, values inherent morals and ethics and how these all play a role.

486
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,440
I would like to ask, what about cultural differences? Because, I mean, if we have this

487
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,680
objective truth about ethics and morals, I mean, we clearly see a difference in culture. I mean,

488
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,560
and to some cultures, perhaps human trafficking might just be the way the culture has just

489
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,480
grown up over time. And to many people, maybe they don't see it as bad. I obviously,

490
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,800
though I'm not one of those people, but how do we differentiate them? Because then we have to

491
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,360
agree that we don't have objective morals or values. What are your thoughts on that?

492
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:32,240
Yeah, it's a very important challenge to the moral objectivist position. And,

493
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,600
you know, I introduce this by saying, if you're going to be skeptical about

494
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,040
moral objectivity, you need to say, well, why is it okay to trust your sensory experiences,

495
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,920
but not your moral experiences? Otherwise, there's a double standard. But actually,

496
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,040
you've just potentially answered that question by saying, here's the difference, you know,

497
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,120
with our empirical experiences, we get a great commonality, but then there's this disagreement.

498
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,120
And that's a very important challenge.

499
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:10,160
I said, why else have I thought about this? I'm trying to remember what my view on it is.

500
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,400
I mean, so one thing is, I think there's a lot more, I mean, I would say not so much,

501
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,360
I'm a realist about morality, but a realist about value, that there are facts about

502
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,720
what is objectively valuable. And when you think in terms of very, very general claims about value,

503
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,120
there is a hell of a lot of commonality and universality. For example,

504
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:39,920
pleasure is good, suffering is bad. Understanding is good, ignorance is bad, creativity is good,

505
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:49,440
apathy and banality are bad, right? Does many people disagree with those general value claims?

506
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:56,480
Now, where you get disagreement is when it gets into the how it all fits together,

507
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:07,200
you know, more specific value claims about justice or the ethics of abortion or whatever.

508
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:14,240
But then that's, to my mind, that's to be expected, given that things just do get,

509
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:21,440
hey, things just do get very complicated when the value equation gets so, so many different

510
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,920
factors are at play. So you sort of expect people to evaluate them in different ways,

511
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,320
just as you do in philosophy or any complicated topic. When there's complicated considerations,

512
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:38,720
and you've got to sort of do some highfalutin abstract thinking, people end up disagreeing,

513
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,280
that's kind of to be expected. The other factor, of course, is that there's a lot of

514
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,440
self interest with morality and people wanting to believe certain things and

515
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:59,840
in our modern times, corporations influencing how people think and so on. If you don't

516
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,280
want to believe equality is an important part of, economic equality is an important part of

517
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,200
justice. If you're very wealthy and you don't want to be taxed, you've got a motivation not to

518
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,200
believe that. Of course, there's that, you know, people coming out of certain religious cultures

519
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:23,200
or certain traditional views. So for all these reasons, you know, you'd expect, I think, there

520
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:34,640
to be diversity. But on these very, very general sort of axioms of value, like pleasure is good,

521
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,640
pain is bad. I think there's actually a lot of agreement which is consistent with value realism.

522
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,240
So within the psychos view, if you take, I mean, you mentioned something like abortion. So ideally,

523
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,400
that draws a lot of like philosophical questions with it. Because in essence, this is an experiencing

524
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,920
system, part of reality. And now we're drawing the line using scientific methods saying, okay,

525
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,320
12 weeks is the cut off line, because this is what has developed since then. How do we work

526
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,760
around these things? How do we work around perhaps life after death? I mean, there's so many aspects

527
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,880
to this where we, what does panpsychism tell us about these things? Wow, we're getting these

528
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:30,240
very deep and difficult ethical questions. I mean, in a way, panpsychism might not make

529
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,880
that much difference insofar as panpsychists tend to think at the macro level of reality,

530
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,680
not everything is conscious. And so they might, you know, the view is that the fundamental,

531
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,880
at the level of fundamental physics, everything is conscious. But at the higher level, they,

532
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,200
a panpsychist might hold the same as anyone else. It's a sort of open question. So they might not

533
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,080
think this, they don't necessarily think the table is conscious. They think the bits it's made up of

534
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:04,400
are. But I suppose panpsychists will naturally think spread consciousness,

535
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,200
think it's more spread throughout the biological world than other people may.

536
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,680
And I mean, for one thing, it makes it very difficult to think about the ethics of eating.

537
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:24,720
I argue a lot on Twitter with vegans about, you know, if you don't think plants are conscious,

538
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:30,400
then you've got a nice moral cutoff point. I'm just not going to eat. I'm going to eat things

539
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,120
that aren't conscious. I'm not going to eat things that are conscious. But I think panps

540
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,160
probably are conscious, or at least are communities of conscious entities. And

541
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:47,040
so you've got to eat something. It's hard to know what the moral draw off comes pretty

542
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:54,400
difficult. I mean, maybe same with the fetus. I mean, for anyone, it's very difficult to establish

543
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:06,560
that there were exactly consciousness emerges in pregnancy. But a couple of things, I mean,

544
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,360
I suppose, for that reason, I'm more inclined to place a lot of moral weight on

545
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,520
self-awareness, awareness of one's own existence, the capacity to understand

546
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:28,240
one's self and the world around one, which, for example, pigs have more than newborn babies.

547
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,680
So you might think in some sense, this was great. I'm not saying we should kill babies, but

548
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:43,520
there is, we've got to bear in mind that I mean, I think a pig is much more intellectually,

549
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:52,800
cognitively, sophisticated than a very early fetus. So I think those kind of things play heavily

550
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:00,320
for me. I was always very influenced as well by the argument of Judith Jarvis Thompson,

551
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,600
it's not so much necessarily denying a fetus a right to life, but thinking about

552
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:19,520
the right of the pregnant woman not to be forced to have her body used to sustain that life.

553
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,280
So Judith Jarvis Thompson, this wonderful analogy of you wake up, you've been kidnapped and knocked

554
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:36,400
out and you're hooked up to a famous violinist, it's a bizarre story really, the musical society

555
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,480
have hooked you up to this violinist because you're a rare donor and unless you stay hooked up to

556
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,440
this violinist in this hospital room for nine months, the violinist is going to die. Now,

557
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,920
everyone thinks the violinist has a right to life, but that doesn't mean you're obliged to allow your

558
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:01,120
body to be used to sustain that life. So I think for those two reasons, that would be my motivation

559
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:08,320
for being pro-choice that the lack of cognitive sophistication of a very early fetus and also

560
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,760
that the right for a woman to choose where the hair body is used in that way. That's a great

561
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,040
answer. Very difficult though. Just going back to your story about the vegan argument, just today,

562
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:28,000
I mean, my receptionist told me that she doesn't like vegans, but she's just joking around and

563
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,280
she's like, my main argument is that if you're eating all the plants, you're technically stealing

564
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:44,320
all the animals food. So in essence, you are still killing the animals. That is quite a ridiculous

565
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,280
but yet still quite fair, fair enough. I mean, the position I've come to is what I call

566
00:59:51,360 --> 01:00:02,000
humanitarianism of just not eating any animal products that are factory farmed. A lot of people

567
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,720
say, oh, I don't agree with factory farming and maybe they'll buy meat that's not factory farmed,

568
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,320
although that can be very expensive. But very few people ask in restaurants, is the meat factory

569
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:23,680
farmed? Don't eat chocolate unless the milk is not factory farmed. Dairy is often one of the worst,

570
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,240
most cruel forms of factory farming. So it's strange to me in some ways being vegetarian if

571
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,240
you're happy to eat chocolate because milk, chocolate, dairy products. So my thought is if

572
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:43,920
more people did that, then that could really have an impact. But I'm going to read George

573
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,560
Mombio's new book, actually trying to persuade us all to be vegan for environmental reasons.

574
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,040
Maybe I'll end up vegan. He's, but anyway, let's not get into that. The main thing here is

575
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:03,360
let's tell me about some of, Philip, some of the best counter arguments you've heard

576
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,200
for pants against panpsychism. If you're to play devil's advocate on yourself right now,

577
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,440
what has really gotten your attention? Well, you really thought I might not be able to argue this

578
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,240
as well as I wish, but perhaps one day someone will.

579
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:26,080
That's a good question. I mean, probably the most discussed challenge is the so-called

580
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:36,000
combination problem, which is okay, it's all very well postulating particles having consciousness

581
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,720
or whatever. But ultimately, what we want to explain is our consciousness and

582
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,320
how on earth do these little conscious things come together to make our consciousness?

583
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:55,440
And on the face of it, it seems to be something very hard to make sense of. Is it even coherent

584
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:02,160
for lots of little minds to make one big mind? And this is something I've changed my mind about

585
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,000
a lot and thought about a lot. I think where I've ended up with, though, is I think that

586
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:17,040
the challenge is really is at its strongest, at least, if you're going for a very reductionist

587
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:24,960
panpsychist story where you say, really, all there is is conscious particles. And

588
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:32,560
what I think of as my mind is just a complicated collection of conscious particles.

589
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:40,960
So someone like Luke Rolofs tries to defend this very reductionist kind of panpsychism.

590
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,120
That is hard to make sense of. There seems to be a deep unity about my own conscious mind

591
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:57,760
that resists that kind of very, very reductionist story. It's hard to deny that my mind is

592
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,840
something over and above just a very complicated collection of particles, whether they're conscious

593
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:09,760
or not. But actually, and this comes back to my dispute with Sean Carroll,

594
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,480
I now no longer think there's much of a motivation to go for that very reductionist story.

595
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,040
You only feel pressured to do that when you start from the conviction that

596
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,600
everything that happens is ultimately explicable in terms of known chemistry and physics.

597
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,840
And I used to think that. That's kind of what I got taught as an undergraduate. But just from

598
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,560
talking to neuroscientists, really, we've got an interdisciplinary consciousness group at my

599
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:51,840
university here. And I just, we really don't know anywhere nearing up about the brain.

600
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,360
What we know about the brain, really, we know a lot about the basic chemistry. So like the bottom,

601
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,120
we know, we know a fair bit about large scale functions, what big bits do.

602
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,720
But what we're pretty almost clueless on is how those functions are

603
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:16,880
realized at the cellular level, how it works. And we'd have to know a lot more about that

604
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,640
before we could confidently say, you know, everything that happens in my brain is

605
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,000
explicable in terms of currently known chemistry and physics. I think we just don't know that.

606
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,400
So so I'm more attracted to at least not such a reductionist story. You know, once you're freed

607
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,080
from that, then you can just think that let's just stick with particles, the zegazemblissity,

608
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:49,520
just have basic capacities to, in certain circumstances, combine into more complex,

609
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:57,360
unified forms. And we should look to neuroscience to guide us in, in when that happens. I'm quite

610
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:03,440
attracted to the integrated information theory, which is one proposal as to when consciousness

611
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,800
arises in the brain. So I actually wanted to ask you about that at some point, your view

612
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,400
on integrated information theory and how do you feel it plays a role with the sort of explaining

613
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,360
or adopting a panpsychist view, because obviously they're starting off with phi and moving upward.

614
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,960
Do you feel as that that represents a panpsychist attempt at philosophical thinking?

615
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,120
So my view is we need to distinguish very sharp, not very sharply, quite sharply,

616
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,320
scientific bit of consciousness research and the theory and the philosophical bit. So the scientific

617
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:48,800
bit is to work out what kinds of brain activity go along with what kinds of experience. That's the

618
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,320
scientific bit and integrated information theory is one proposal on that. It says that

619
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:01,200
you get consciousness in a system when there's more phi, as you say, or integrated information in

620
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,760
the whole system than in its parts. So probably this glass of water isn't conscious because

621
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,800
there's probably more phi in the molecules than in the liquid as a whole. But in the brain,

622
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:18,320
there's hue in certain parts, the brain at least, there's huge, even though there's a lot of

623
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,880
fine and neuron, there's even more in the whole system. So that's why I get conscious. So that's

624
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,920
one interesting proposal. What I like about it is that it gives us, allows for kind of sharp

625
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,480
cutoff points between systems that are conscious and systems that aren't conscious. And

626
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:46,960
on philosophical grounds, I don't think it makes sense to have fuzzy boundaries around

627
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:52,560
consciousness. Like you think of a cloud, there's no sharp cutoff point between the

628
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:59,360
where's the edge of the cloud, which is this a little bit of water vapor outside the cloud,

629
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,280
or is it part of the cloud? There's probably no factor the matter there. But if we're thinking

630
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,520
of my consciousness, either something is part of my experience or it isn't, I don't think it kind

631
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:16,480
of makes sense. And for there to be fuzzy boundaries around my mind, that's something

632
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:24,320
we could debate. But IIT integrated information theory can make sense of that. But that's just

633
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:31,040
the scientific bit. And I think that like any philosophical theory, it's sorry, like any scientific

634
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:38,320
theory, it's neutral on all the philosophical options. So you could be a materialist proponent

635
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:46,000
of integrated information theory and think, just have an identity between consciousness and

636
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:55,520
Phi. Or you could be a dualist like David Chalmers and think Phi and consciousness are different

637
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,880
things, but there are special laws of nature that tie them together. Or you could be a panpsychist

638
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,400
and you could think, you know, consciousness is the fundamental level and that bubbles up when

639
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:13,920
you've got Phi or something. So yeah, so Phi, I think I like for certain specific reasons to do with

640
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,200
you can't have fuzzy consciousness, fuzzy boundaries and consciousness. And I suppose it fits

641
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:25,040
upon psychism in that it predicts that there's more consciousness than we ordinarily expect.

642
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,600
Are there any other neuroscientific theories that you sort of are attracted to?

643
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:41,600
Not really for that reason, because I mean, look, there's a lot. It's very early days,

644
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:49,920
there is no consensus in neuroscience. Some people thought it would be all wrapped up by now,

645
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,400
but it's very hard because consciousness is not publicly observable. And so

646
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,880
where you've got a human being, you can ask them what they're experiencing, but the more distance

647
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:10,320
you get from the human case, it's very speculative. Eric Schvitzkabel now thinks we will just never

648
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,600
know whether snail is conscious, because it's just too distant from the human case.

649
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:29,280
But I think we can try and look for philosophical signposts. And I think this important,

650
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,800
what we can look for, what we know about consciousness from the inside. And one thing

651
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:41,520
I think we know about consciousness from the inside is that there can't be fuzzy boundaries

652
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,840
when it comes to consciousness. And I think I'm happy to be corrected on this, but I think the

653
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,360
integrated information theory is the only scientific proposal that can accommodate that

654
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:58,320
philosophical data point. So to my mind, it's whatever its flaws are, very far from a final

655
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,160
theory of consciousness. To my mind, it's the only philosophically credible one.

656
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,880
Yeah. What are your thoughts on, like, let's say someone like Penrose and John

657
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,920
Bovecki and quantum consciousness, where's your head at with that?

658
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,760
I mean, Penrose thing starts with a fascinating argument to do with girdles and completeness

659
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:29,040
theorem. And it's interesting, though, that that is really when you think about it, it's not so much

660
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,240
to do with consciousness, it's to do with cognition, it's to do with understanding,

661
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:40,960
because what Penrose is thinking is he's wrestling with how to make sense of mathematical

662
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,400
understanding, given girdles and completeness theorem girdles and completeness theorem seems to

663
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:56,160
show Penrose thinks that, you know, a computer couldn't do the kind of mathematical and have

664
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:03,840
the mathematical understanding we have, because you can't reduce mathematics to a system of axioms

665
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,280
where you can prove everything with those axioms. So he thinks mathematical understanding must be

666
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,080
sort of non computational. And that's why he thinks there must be some kind of quantum,

667
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,240
non classical physics coming in here. So, you know, that's fundamentally his motivation.

668
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:28,560
I want, you know, I wonder whether again, this comes back to the need to connect everything to

669
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,920
kind of currently known physics or closely related to currently known physics. I mean,

670
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,320
in terms of that problem, I think I'd be

671
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:49,280
much more open to supplementing macro level physics with the idea that there are just new

672
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,880
causal dynamics that kick in in complex systems. This is sometimes known as strong emergentism.

673
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,680
So we don't have to go down to the quantum level. We can just say, look, there's new causal dynamics

674
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:07,520
that emerge in human cognition. And this is actually what I talk about like my new book I'm

675
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:15,120
working on that's much more about conscious understanding and conceptual meaning. When

676
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,240
philosophers and scientists talk about consciousness, they always talk about

677
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:25,680
pain and seeing red and itchers and these kind of very animal sensations. But I think consciousness is

678
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,200
permeated with meaning and understanding what things are and what they mean

679
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,120
fills my experience, you know, I don't experience colors and shapes, I experience tables and chairs

680
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:47,840
and faces and stuff. So I think Penrose is spot on and he's one of the few to be wrestling with

681
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,200
these deep mysteries about conscious understanding. But I think I would go a slightly different way

682
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:02,320
with that and just say go for stronger emergentism rather than trying to hook everything up to the

683
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:09,520
quantum level. And then people like let's say Rupert Sheldrake. What are your thoughts on someone

684
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:16,080
like his view on consciousness? So I'm quite good friends of Rupert Sheldrake and we're doing a debate

685
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:23,360
or a discussion rather in the near future on religion without belief. Because I guess

686
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:35,520
we're both kind of practicing Christians who have very unorthodox views of what it means,

687
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,760
what is involved in being a Christian and then we're hooking up with

688
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,640
oh what's his name? My mind's gone blank. Wonderful poet and environmental activist who

689
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,120
recently surprised everyone by converting to quite conservative Christianity and anyway we're

690
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,200
going to be having a chat with him. But anyway, coming back to yeah so Rupert's got very interesting

691
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:05,520
views. You know, I think he can defend them very very articulate, he can articulate them and defend

692
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:12,080
them very well. But so I suppose Rupert is defending his views as a scientist on empirical

693
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:18,400
grounds rather than strictly philosophical grounds. So I suppose it's kind of this may be a bit of a

694
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,160
cop out but it's sort of outside of my skill set in a way. I think you know knowledge is very

695
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:30,400
specialized now and I'm jealous to people in the 16th century when you could sort of understand

696
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,360
the cutting edge science, the cutting edge of mathematics. But you know in a way when it comes

697
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,240
to imperial questions I sort of have to because it's not my skill set I sort of have to trust

698
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:48,320
the you know the consensus and I suppose for better or worse the consensus is against Rupert.

699
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,680
But I suppose he would say that's for cultural reasons and people aren't taking him seriously

700
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:59,600
for cultural reasons and I'm very much open to that argument. I've experienced in philosophy

701
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:08,000
which is my area you know how ideology stops certain views being taken seriously and so I can

702
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:14,800
I'm open to that possibility but because it's not my skill set I just don't think I can assess

703
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,600
whether he whether he's right or not. It's absolutely fascinating views though and

704
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,000
you know I certainly you know he's had his TED talk banned and everything. I certainly don't

705
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,200
think he should be as ostracized as he is. I think you know yeah again there is a sort of

706
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:36,000
fear there isn't there about I suppose people worry about losing control you know being open to

707
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:43,760
any old stuff but look if someone can defend their views with rigor and seriousness then you know

708
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,760
they should be given a hearing and I think. I think but do you think that some people

709
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,680
are now mysterious regarding consciousness because there there are just that many convincing

710
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:05,200
arguments and we just don't know. Yeah mysterious is again a position we should take seriously and

711
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:11,680
I'm to some extent open to it myself. I mean you're asking for challenges to panpsychism.

712
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,160
I suppose another one would be well just the position of

713
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,720
shouldn't we be agnostic you know. Yeah I can't look into an electron to see whether it's conscious

714
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,720
or not. Maybe we should just be agnostic. Maybe we should just say there's a view that's very

715
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:38,160
closely connected to mine that just says so agrees with this Bertrand Russell starting point

716
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:47,760
that physics doesn't tell us what matter is only what it does and agrees that you know

717
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:54,880
whatever manner is it's it's somehow explains consciousness so you might say it's proto-conscious

718
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,200
that it's it's somehow has a nature that makes consciousness but it's not itself conscious

719
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,800
and you know I'm very much owned opposition that the philosopher Daniel Stoljar and his review

720
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,760
of my academic book conscious to some fundamental reality was sort of pushing this line you know

721
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,280
that there's something right about this Bertrand Russell position but we just don't know enough

722
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:23,680
to be able to say panpsychism is good so I'm kind of open to that but at the end of the day my current

723
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:32,720
thinking is what why go for mystery when there's an intelligible hypothesis as an alternative and

724
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,960
all we can ever do is science and philosophy I think is try and work out

725
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:46,720
you know the most simple parsimonious hypothesis compatible with the data if we can account for

726
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:54,560
not only consciousness but the facts of physical science and natural science more generally

727
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:02,000
by postulating basic simple forms of consciousness then that seems to me by normal scientific

728
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,920
criteria of you know the simp going for the simplest theory that can account for the data

729
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,520
that's the view we should go for we don't know for sure we'll never know for sure and we should

730
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:17,680
be open to other possibilities but I still think panpsychism is is just a bit more likely

731
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,840
to be true than I think other options on the table I think you give a great great coherent

732
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,320
argument for it I mean I've read Galileo's era of red consciousness fundamental reality and that

733
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:35,760
one's a lot more in depth and in detail for so like for all the people who read Galileo's era I

734
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:41,280
think I highly recommend you go read the other one because you're going to far greater detail and

735
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:45,840
it's obviously meant for a different group of people but if people have some sort of a view

736
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,760
on your view of panpsychism they should definitely read both before making a conclusion on that

737
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,960
oh thanks for who do you think because obviously I would recommend your books to someone who wants

738
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,000
to read about panpsychism who are the people you'd recommend people should read in order to get a

739
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,760
greater understanding of panpsychism um oh well it's just that yeah there's there's so much going

740
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,200
on at the moment I mean it's difficult isn't it because I guess a lot of academic philosophic

741
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:22,880
philosophy work now can be so inaccessible um I think this is you know again it's a reflection

742
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,520
of knowledge being so specialized and and often philosophers I think we're trained to try and

743
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,680
have these watertight arguments and so yeah you try and cover all bases and then it ends up getting

744
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,320
really complicated and the jargon comes in so that's why in a way you know I wrote my academic

745
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:46,480
book first because once you write a more accessible version you've got to be a bit looser with the

746
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:52,560
argument you can't cover all objections so then philosophers read it and say oh you haven't considered

747
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,480
this you haven't considered this and so then I could say well read the academic book if you want the

748
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:03,120
full story the full argument but um yeah so Luke Roloff's book combining minds is a wonderful book

749
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:09,920
um a little bit challenging I guess Hetahassel Merle great philosopher she's got a she's got a

750
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,040
great piece with Nautilus that I would recommend giving the basic panpsychist position something

751
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:22,800
on the integrated information theory for philosophy now she wrote for a special issue I edited um

752
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,680
and she's working on on on a book on antiphysicalism actually for Keith's series in philosophy of mine

753
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:34,160
Keith told me about recently um another resource people might want to look to is there's this

754
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:43,200
there was a special issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies um on on 20 years how many

755
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:50,480
was it now 19 essays by philosophers and scientists and theologians responding to my book Galileo's

756
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:55,200
Era um and this is going to be coming out as a book actually later this year called

757
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:04,080
is consciousness everywhere so there's essays by Anil Seth and Sean Carroll and uh Giulio Tenoni

758
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:12,160
for the use of topics all coming up yeah I yeah but I mean well in in a way usual suspects but uh

759
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:18,880
I don't think there's I can't think another time these kinds of scientists have uh responded to

760
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,480
panpsychism so it's it's in a way it's I can't I personally can't wait to read this this is it's

761
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,400
quite um there is a development I mean these guys don't agree with me but you know I think

762
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:38,480
taking the view is seriously enough to engage with it I think is um is it is an achievement so that's

763
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:45,280
oh there's loads of stuff what is I suppose Miriel Bahari's a very good Australian philosopher who

764
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,840
defends it a more spiritual version of panpsychism inspired by Hindu mysticism

765
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,400
and partly based on arguing that we can trust the testimony of experienced meditators

766
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:09,280
she's been working on a book for a while I hope to come out soon um my blog yeah um yeah so tell me

767
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:15,680
for the book that you've got prepped and ready to go what's the goal here well what's the next

768
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,000
mission because I mean you've read you've written the academic one you've written Galileo's era

769
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,920
what do you hope to show us next I hope this book actually is going to be

770
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:33,840
I come both academic and accessible I've wrestled for a long time about which to do I can't

771
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:42,320
so tough to crack yeah I'm hoping maybe it's not possible but so each chapter at the moment

772
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:47,760
is divided into a more accessible bit and and the more technical bits and but the whole thing I

773
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:54,000
try to make quite accessible but it's it's it's a different book in content as well but it's

774
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:02,320
I guess the big idea is exploring the middle ground between God and atheism so I think

775
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,960
in the West people think you have to fit into one of those groups you either believe in the

776
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:14,800
Omni God all powerful knowing perfectly good or you think we're in this meaningless universe

777
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,280
where you know meaning only arises at the end of evolution or whatever

778
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,280
and I I've come to think that both of these views are are pretty implausible

779
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,520
both have data they can't handle

780
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,920
in terms of the Omni God it's the familiar problem of evil and suffering

781
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:46,960
why would an all all powerful loving God allow or create a world of so much suffering in it

782
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:54,480
in terms of atheism the meaningless universe I think one thing I discuss there is is the

783
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,160
that the fine-tuning of physics the discovery in recent decades that

784
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:04,960
for life to be possible many numbers in physics had to fall in a quite narrow range such that

785
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,880
it's it's incredibly improbable that that would happen just by chance I think on the

786
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,880
on the face of it if you just look at it this passionately that is very strong evidence for

787
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,880
some kind of goal-directed activity some kind of directiveness towards life

788
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,600
in the very early universe and I think I basically think is a cultural

789
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:32,080
indenial about this I think it's reminiscent of the 16th century where there was this growing

790
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:38,320
evidence for the earth not being in the center of the universe that didn't fit with the picture

791
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:44,960
that people have got used to and people couldn't accept it and they tried to think of these

792
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,400
ways of avoiding it you know they postulated these epicycles so they thought everything

793
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,600
went around the earth the sun and the planets and the stars they postulated these extra little

794
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,560
orbits of the planets in addition to their orbits around the earth and that didn't do it so they

795
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:08,000
postulated these orbits around orbits and um and we think oh god they were so stupid they

796
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,480
couldn't just accept the evidence and we're so enlightened now but I think every generation

797
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,800
has got used to a picture of how things are supposed to be and you get laughed at if you

798
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:25,680
don't fit into that and I think you know I think I think it's just culturally impossible

799
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:32,880
for people to take this evidence at face value which is that I think what we might call cosmic

800
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,400
teleology there's but so I think there's strong evidence for cosmic teleology for some kind of

801
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:44,560
directiveness towards life but also strong evidence against the omniguard and so I'm

802
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:49,920
exploring positions in between so Philip sorry to cut you off there but within this cosmic

803
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,440
teleology where do you think it's headed then after humans and life do you think artificial

804
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,040
intelligence is sort of the next step and then we're going to move forward from there what what

805
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:08,560
do you think is happening god knows nobody knows so look it so I as I say I think there is there is

806
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:14,640
very strong evidence and could change tomorrow but science as we have it now is very strong

807
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:20,320
evidence for a sort of directiveness towards life maybe that's the end of it maybe maybe maybe this

808
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:26,960
is this is this is the end of the cosmic purpose as it were but in a way you might think that's

809
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:34,400
kind of improbable to think that you know we're the culmination of this cosmic story so you might

810
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,400
you know we might speculate that there's that it's it's it's still unfolding some kind of

811
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:50,720
greater reality is yet to come but that would that that would be somewhat speculative I always

812
01:26:50,720 --> 01:27:00,400
like a hero of mine growing up the heretical Catholic priest Tyre de Jardin who had this

813
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:07,280
you know he was you know early days after Darwin and parts of the church were sort of

814
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,560
worried about what to do at Darwin but he was inspired by the idea of evolution and the idea

815
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:22,880
of an evolving cosmos and you know he thought this these great leaps of life and sentience and

816
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:31,440
self-consciousness and he he thought the next stage would be people humans getting more informationally

817
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:36,800
connected up and this bringing about a new form of life and consciousness that he called the

818
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,280
new sphere so some people think you know if you look at the way we're all connected up with the

819
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:48,400
internet and what's up and stuff maybe he was under something but I mean he could have knows

820
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,800
I think that still might be possible we don't even know but I think but I you know I think it's

821
01:27:52,800 --> 01:28:01,440
I think it's I think it's a it's a good life to live in hope that there is some point to it all and

822
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:08,640
that what we do contributes in some way to some greater purpose I find doing that helps me keep

823
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:14,400
my ego in check that I'm not just thinking of my success I'm just thinking I'm just contributing

824
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:21,280
in some way to some some some greater purpose and you know maybe there isn't a greater purpose and

825
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:28,480
you know but we'll never know and I think it's it's it's it's it's a good way to live to live in

826
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:35,280
hope of that I think it's a happiness conducive form of life so would you describe your religious

827
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,680
of if you had to pick on would it be more of a deistic god rather than theistic sort of omniscient

828
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,600
omnipotent interactive god would yours be more deistic you started off let the cosmic

829
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:54,640
teleology just roll and whatever happens happens so we need some kind of explanation of

830
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,800
why the source of cosmic teleology you know why things aren't better

831
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,480
we need a plausible hypothesis that explains can explain the you know the directness towards

832
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:14,720
life but can explain it why things aren't better why this source of cosmic teleology is not more

833
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:22,480
evident so look I explore a variety of options one is just teleological laws that Thomas Nagel

834
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:28,720
explored in his 2012 book mind and cosmos just so this isn't a kind of mind it's just impersonal

835
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:36,720
laws of nature that with sort of purpose is built into them another is is some kind of

836
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:43,440
something closer to the to the the traditional god as a sort of mind but a non-standard designer

837
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:48,960
maybe of limited power so maybe they really care maybe they're trying to do stuff but maybe they

838
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:55,120
yeah maybe all they could do is kick things off or maybe they've got limited powers of of intervention

839
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:04,720
or maybe it's it's the simulation hypothesis maybe they're just some you know scientists in

840
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:10,320
the next universe up trying out a simulation to see see what comes of it that would be a cosmic

841
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:16,960
teleology hypothesis one more naturalistically inclined people tend to like or cosmic psychism is

842
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,880
the other one I consider that the you know if we already think the universe is a kind of mind

843
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:29,600
because of our panpsychist views then it starts to be less mysterious that there might be some kind

844
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:35,120
of limited gold erectedness in it so I'm open to all those possibilities you know in terms of my

845
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:43,360
religious practice I think for me it's more about bringing the community together you know

846
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:52,880
marking that the seasons and the the big moments of life you know given my kids a moral example

847
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:59,600
connecting individuals in the community up to something greater and

848
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:06,800
you know inspiring moral action in the community things like that and so I think you know all

849
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:13,440
these things are all these matters are very uncertain and but you've got to live your life

850
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:20,400
and I think people are too folk when it comes to religion a lot of people are too focused on

851
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:26,880
is it true is it not true and I think you know I think I personally think for some people at least

852
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,840
are religiously engaged life with the community and the spiritual practice and is a wonderful

853
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:37,280
way to live your life and you know if it turns out all to be nonsense you've I still think you've

854
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:43,760
gained much in terms of a rich life and lost little really it's but you know rather than sort of

855
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:50,000
you know some people have no interest in religion and I'm not interested to persuade them

856
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:56,160
but I suspect there are many liberal minded people who would get a lot out of it but think it's kind

857
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:01,920
of Richard Dawkins has told them it's stupid or you know how do we know it's true and you know

858
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:08,800
whereas I think you know engaging with community and tradition can be a wonderful thing and

859
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:15,600
people can focus. He mentioned he's a fan of your work is Raymond Tellis and something

860
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,720
I like that he said well this when we spoke he actually told me now that I realize I realize

861
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:26,160
if he asked me a couple questions to ask you and I forgot to take them down before this interview

862
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:31,200
but then again we were meant to do it tomorrow so I was I was planning on doing that but

863
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,680
nevertheless he's a big fan of your work and he finds it very fascinating and something he said

864
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,680
that I really liked was he's he's ontologically agnostic about everything but there are certain

865
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:49,040
epistemologies that you can tell are just really just incorrect but when you when you're talking

866
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,600
about religion when you're talking about life all of this you have to be ontologically agnostic

867
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:59,520
we don't have the answers that's just the bottom line and I think that's a really cool statement

868
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:08,000
to make. Yeah absolutely absolutely and my wife's text me I think I'm gonna have to

869
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,160
uh attend to some family matters in the not too distant future but but just sorry just to throw

870
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:21,920
that in but um yeah no I I I totally agree with that I think I think a lot of people on both

871
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,200
we we use again it's come back to we're used to the the epistemic vices of the religious we're

872
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:32,480
used to the idea that religious people might be clinging to certainties but I think that's very

873
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:38,320
present for a lot of people on the scientific side as well I you know I think Daniel Dennett

874
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:45,120
he needs to believe this stuff for it you know he believes to believe it's obvious and it's

875
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:50,240
you know for a sense of identity and I think so like Ricky Giberti he has to sort of have this

876
01:33:50,240 --> 01:34:01,280
easy picture that's painted I think I think you know yeah just um this kind of uncertainty

877
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:11,840
is unsettling to a lot of people I think um uh you know I just you you'll never know you've got one

878
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:20,640
life you know and um you have your best yes diagnostic I think that's yeah let's do it put it

879
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:28,320
or you can have your best guess and you know it doesn't have to be um you know I'm certain

880
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:34,080
or it's a load of nonsense I mean I I've never had a mystical experience but I have I have

881
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:39,120
what I would describe as spiritual experiences to the some often with morning or evening light

882
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:48,000
or you know watching my kids play or something you know a sense that there's a way things are

883
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,160
supposed to be or there's a greater reality at the root of things and most people think you've

884
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:58,960
I've got to think oh yeah that's definitely right or you've got to think no that's nonsense but

885
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:09,600
a middle way is to sort of engage with that take it seriously work with it in your spiritual

886
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:16,400
practice and you'll never know one way or the other but you can maybe live a richer life through

887
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:25,200
engaging tentatively those experiences beautiful Philip you're already touching on that but like

888
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:32,480
concluding this is obviously called mind body solution I mean you're already touching on it but

889
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:38,080
how would you say we should move forward in order to get one step closer to that mind body solution

890
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:48,080
we're a long way from the final answer humans always think they're at the end of history and

891
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:54,400
we're kind of there we just need to you know dot a few i's and cross a few t's you know so I think

892
01:35:54,400 --> 01:36:01,040
that that needs to be the starting point what I'm most passionate about and here's we're going from

893
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:07,120
what we what we don't know here's one thing I feel most confident about is that

894
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:15,440
consciousness is not just another scientific problem and the reason it's not another scientific

895
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:24,000
problem is that we're not dealing with some public observation and experiments we're not

896
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,560
dealing it's a very different kind of data we're dealing with something that's privately known

897
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:38,960
and trying to explain this privately known reality you know science is used to dealing with

898
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:46,800
things you can't observe but that's in that's we postulate things you can't observe to explain

899
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,760
what you can observe in all other cases the task of science is explaining the data of

900
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:57,200
experiments or observation this is a totally different explanatory project we're trying we're

901
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,560
not trying to do that we're trying to explain this privately known reality so we're not even at

902
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:08,560
first base we've got to get on to that this isn't just another scientific problem it's a

903
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:15,200
philosophical problem it's how we bring together what we know about scientifically and what we know

904
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:22,160
about privately trying to meld them together and you know so we're still about you know debate

905
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:27,680
Nanel Seth and he's saying oh well what are the predictions of panpsychism what does you know what

906
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:33,280
scientific experiments result but that's that's not at first base because that's seeing it that's

907
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:38,640
seeing it as just a scientific problem and it's not just a scientific problem you panpsychism

908
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:43,280
might be wrong there are lots of good challenges but treated as a philosophical problem not a

909
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,160
scientific problem so we've got to understand the nature the philosophical underpinnings

910
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:53,520
we've gone from pretend you know in the latter half of the 20th century people pretended consciousness

911
01:37:53,520 --> 01:38:01,280
didn't exist to avoid the problem since the 90s the 1990s we take the problem seriously

912
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:06,480
but too many people still think just do more neuroscience and we'll solve it we need to

913
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:11,040
see the philosophical underpinnings of the problem we need to see that it's fundamentally a task of

914
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:18,160
how we bring these things together as philosophers ultimately scientifically informed philosophers

915
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:25,440
once we get there I think we'll be at least on or at least on the first stage and I think just

916
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:32,400
that first stage actually will in itself necessitate a kind of revolution in how we think about

917
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:39,920
science how we think about the way we know about the world around us so so yeah exciting times ahead

918
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,920
I think that's a beautiful way to end Philip thank you so much for your time

919
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,960
it's been an absolute pleasure thanks tab and it's been lovely finally speaking with you hope

920
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,840
we get to chat yeah I mean I'm looking forward to it hopefully after your book comes out we can

921
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,640
have another chat but I really appreciate your time I mean this is and please just continue

922
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:03,520
doing the work you're doing because as I said the more diverse the views the philosophical

923
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,920
arguments as we as we spoke about not neuroscience but philosophy the more diverse and the more

924
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:13,840
people like you come out and speak about it the more we can engage in this topic and this podcast

925
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:19,760
would not exist without people like you so thank you so much for that thank you very much we'll see

926
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:40,000
you again
