WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.200
How are you doing? It's been such a, it's been a long time. It's, it's been a while.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.440
Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm continuing to improve. It's, you know, this,

00:22.000 --> 00:30.240
I, the long COVID really did a number on me. So I'm still, still recovering. It's been years,

00:30.240 --> 00:38.160
but I'm still recovering. But a couple of doctors contacted me from Australia and said that they,

00:38.160 --> 00:41.920
they thought from my symptoms, they heard me on a podcast and they said they thought from my symptoms

00:41.920 --> 00:46.880
that the heart wasn't the primary thing that had been attacked, but it was my gut that the,

00:46.960 --> 00:55.200
the, the viruses of bacterophage and that it destroyed the, the bacteria that produce GABA

00:55.200 --> 01:01.280
and serotonin and other calming kinds of things and, and promoted bacteria that produce amines

01:01.280 --> 01:09.120
that sort of overdrive the heart and lead to the failure that I had. And so that's, so they put me

01:09.120 --> 01:14.560
on this really strict diet, vegetables and, and no, basically almost no guys, almost like a total

01:14.560 --> 01:18.960
no carb kind of diet. Has that, have you seen an impact?

01:20.320 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, it's completely changed my gut. And I actually, it's making a huge difference. So,

01:26.640 --> 01:31.680
so this is, I mean, the virus attacks you wherever I guess you're weak. And it got me on the gut

01:31.680 --> 01:37.440
in the heart. I'm glad you're doing better though. It's, it's always great to know someone's doing

01:37.440 --> 01:42.320
better. And I mean, we need you out there to continue doing such great work. Well, thank you.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.480
And then we need you to continue to do this great podcast. And, and of course, the medical work that

01:46.480 --> 01:52.720
you do. Thanks so much, Don. I mean, we've covered so much. We've chatted twice already. And both,

01:52.720 --> 01:58.320
both times we went through various different aspects of all your work. And the first podcast,

01:58.320 --> 02:03.360
we spoke about user interface theory of perception. We spoke about conscious realism.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.680
We touched on conscious agents, but in the second one, we went very in depth,

02:07.680 --> 02:11.760
conscious agents in the subatomic world. We went into that paper, we dissected people,

02:11.760 --> 02:17.840
loved it by the way. Yeah, and it's been, it's, it's been quite a hit. For this podcast, I thought,

02:17.840 --> 02:22.400
let me curate a bunch of questions from the audience so far from the first two. And we're

02:22.400 --> 02:28.800
trying to each of them. But before we do that, I think since conscious agents of the subatomic

02:28.800 --> 02:32.480
world, what's happened since, because I'm assuming you guys are having a lot of fun. And

02:33.120 --> 02:37.760
it's always exciting to when someone jumps and gets outside the box to know what's,

02:37.760 --> 02:42.720
what's really outside the box. That's right. So we have made a couple,

02:43.840 --> 02:51.920
for me, very fun discoveries. So one has to do with the notion of observation.

02:53.040 --> 02:59.040
What does it mean to observe? What will it mean in our theory to, for one system to observe

02:59.040 --> 03:06.560
another? In, you know, classical physics, the observer is not much mentioned. And if they're

03:06.560 --> 03:10.800
mentioned at all, they're assumed to be objective and don't really interfere at all with whatever

03:10.800 --> 03:16.000
it is that they're, so they, they don't disturb whatever they're observing. In quantum mechanics,

03:17.440 --> 03:21.280
there isn't a theory of the observer, but, but it's known that, you know, somehow the measurement

03:21.280 --> 03:26.640
process is a destructive process. I mean, things are different when you measure than, you know,

03:26.640 --> 03:32.800
when you don't. And so there's this feeling that, you know, the observer has to play a role, but

03:32.800 --> 03:38.560
it's not formalized, right? The, the measurement is formalized, you know, it's some kind of,

03:40.320 --> 03:45.440
there is a formalization there in terms of positive operator value measures and so POVMs

03:45.440 --> 03:50.160
and so forth. But, but, you know, even someone like Chris Fuchs, who's saying, you know, that,

03:51.200 --> 03:57.520
that quantum mechanics is really just a description for the agent, how it should update, update their

03:57.520 --> 04:03.520
beliefs in, in, in light of experimental data and so forth. But when you ask him, so, so what is your

04:03.520 --> 04:06.560
theory of the agent, he says, I don't know you a theory of the agent, I'm just telling you that

04:06.560 --> 04:09.840
quantum mechanics is the manual that the agent should use. And I don't know what an agent is.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.920
And I respect, I mean, you can't do everything. And he's doing quantum mechanics, and he's not

04:13.920 --> 04:18.400
doing the agent, he's not doing the observer. But he does say that the agent's important.

04:19.120 --> 04:24.000
So, so then in our theory, then, you know, the question comes front and center, because we're

04:24.000 --> 04:29.360
talking about conscious agents all the way down. So we can't avoid. So when we talk about a measurement,

04:29.920 --> 04:36.400
we have to actually have a theory of what does it mean for one system of conscious agents

04:37.120 --> 04:41.920
to make a measurement on another system of conscious agents, right? What does that mean?

04:43.360 --> 04:52.480
And we use, so I have to be a little technical to, to explain the idea, but I'll try to be as

04:52.560 --> 05:00.320
un-technical as possible. But we use Markovian kernels. So a Markovian kernel basically says,

05:00.320 --> 05:05.680
suppose you have a system that, that can see three colors, red, green, and blue. Now that's,

05:05.680 --> 05:11.200
that's what it experiences. There's a kernel that we call the qualia kernel that describes

05:11.840 --> 05:16.960
the sequence of color experiences that this observer might have. So maybe if I see red now,

05:16.960 --> 05:20.800
the probability is that the next time I see a color, it'll be green, but maybe it's,

05:20.800 --> 05:27.040
maybe it's half. And it's also a third that I'll see blue, but it's also, you know, whatever is

05:27.040 --> 05:31.920
left over, probably that I'll see red. So I can say for, for each color I'm now experiencing,

05:31.920 --> 05:36.640
what is the probability of the next color I might experience? And you can, so when you write down a

05:36.640 --> 05:42.240
matrix, a table of all those probabilities, in mathematics, we call that a Markov kernel.

05:42.880 --> 05:49.840
And it's actually a linear operator. And, and you can actually study the properties of a linear

05:49.840 --> 05:56.160
operator. It can rotate vectors, it can exchange, you expand and contract vectors, it can do all

05:56.160 --> 06:02.560
sorts of things. So, so that's the, one of the models we're using to represent observers and the

06:02.560 --> 06:09.200
conscious experiences that what they have. What we discovered was, and this is a new

06:10.000 --> 06:15.200
contribution to Markov chain theory, apparently, to the mathematics of it, is that,

06:15.920 --> 06:20.560
well, first, first, what I'm about to say is not a new contribution, it's a standard notion,

06:20.560 --> 06:25.680
but we're going to use it for the, for the new contribution. If you take one Markov chain,

06:26.240 --> 06:30.400
like it has three colors, and you've got the Markov chain on it, but then you say, what if I,

06:30.400 --> 06:34.480
you know, don't look at the red, I don't care when the red, I'm only going to look at the green and

06:34.480 --> 06:41.440
blue. And I'm going to look at those two colors. What Markov chain gets induced on those two colors

06:41.440 --> 06:44.800
from the bigger Markov chain and red, green and blue, right? There's some probability

06:44.960 --> 06:48.320
of going from red, green, blue. But what happens if I only can see the green and the blue,

06:48.320 --> 06:52.000
I'll get some chance, you know, if I'm, if I see green now that I'll see blue next,

06:52.000 --> 06:56.560
for see green now, I'll see green next. So, so I can actually, you can intuitively, you can say,

06:56.560 --> 07:01.200
well, yeah, you should be able to induce a Markov chain on the smaller number of states, right?

07:02.560 --> 07:07.040
But it would somehow respect the bigger, the bigger Markov chain, right? So that's the idea

07:07.040 --> 07:13.840
of a trace, it's called a trace chain. Well, what we proved, this is work with Chaitan Prakash,

07:15.040 --> 07:21.280
so he and I worked on this together. And what we found is that the relationship of being a trace

07:21.280 --> 07:30.720
chain to another Markov chain is a partial order. That means that we found a, this is an entire

07:30.720 --> 07:36.960
logic on the space of all Markov chains, all Markov kernels. So this is a brand new logic.

07:37.520 --> 07:46.560
One, one in one chain entails another, if it's a trace chain of the other. That's, that's,

07:46.560 --> 07:51.440
so I can, the actual definition is simple. Once I've told, I can actually say the depth. So one

07:51.440 --> 07:59.920
Markov chain P is less than or equal to Markov chain Q, if and only if P is a trace chain of Q.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.160
And you can prove that that is actually a partial order. And it's a logic. So it's actually a logic

08:06.160 --> 08:11.760
on the space of all Markov chains. It's not Boolean. It's more general than Boolean. It's more

08:11.760 --> 08:21.360
general than quantum logics, ortho complimented lattices. This is more, it's more general than

08:21.360 --> 08:28.320
that. It's locally Boolean. So every particular Markov kernel, if you look at all the ones that

08:28.320 --> 08:33.360
are less than it, all the ones that, that are less than it, they form a Boolean logic. So this

08:33.360 --> 08:40.960
is a locally Boolean logic of observation. And then we proved that this, if you take,

08:43.120 --> 08:48.560
so by the way, then this is our notion of observation. If one observers

08:50.720 --> 08:56.880
kernel or Markov chain is less than or equal to another, then it observes the bigger chain. So

08:56.880 --> 09:01.920
that's, so that's how that's what, so notice our notion of observation is not this objective,

09:02.480 --> 09:07.600
you're outside the system. No, no, you're immersed in it. You are part of the system.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.920
You're an integral part of the system that you're observing. So, so at the top level,

09:11.920 --> 09:19.040
that's the take home from this. Our theory of observation is the observer is no scientist

09:19.040 --> 09:24.800
that's separate from everything and not involved in anything and completely separate and can't,

09:24.800 --> 09:30.000
and can be ignored. No, no, no, no, you are intimately part of the system. And you must be

09:30.000 --> 09:35.360
understood to get a real theory of observation in science. You have to understand what an agent is

09:35.360 --> 09:41.120
and how it's embedded in the systems that it's observing. And this is, this gives a mathematical

09:41.120 --> 09:47.120
logic for doing that. So it's really, we're pretty excited. But, but then each Markov chain,

09:51.120 --> 09:57.040
if you have Markov chains that are like recurrent communicating class, so they're in some sense,

09:57.120 --> 10:01.760
they're nice, they're nice Markov chains. I'll just use the word nice as a non technical term,

10:01.760 --> 10:06.160
but I gave you the technical for those who want the technical recurrent communicating one current

10:06.160 --> 10:12.240
communicating class. They have been a probability measure that tells you long term, what are the

10:12.240 --> 10:16.000
probabilities of the different states that you'll see like, what was the probability of seeing red,

10:16.000 --> 10:20.720
maybe long term, you see red a third of the time, blue two thirds of the time and green,

10:20.720 --> 10:25.680
you don't see hardly at all. Maybe, maybe that's the long term problem. That's called the stationary

10:25.680 --> 10:33.600
measure of the Markov chain. And so it turns out that when you have a big measure and then a trace,

10:34.400 --> 10:41.440
sorry, a big chain in a trace chain, that the stationary measure of the trace chain is exactly

10:41.440 --> 10:48.080
the restriction of those of the stationary measure of the bigger chain to that subset of states.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.400
In other words, it's all compatible. So you have a big measure for the stationary measure of the

10:52.400 --> 10:57.600
big guy, and maybe three of the states are what you trace on. Well, if you look at the big guy's

10:57.600 --> 11:02.320
probability measure on those three states, that's exactly what you get on the little guy, just

11:02.320 --> 11:05.920
renormalize so that it's a probability measure, you have to renormalize it so it's probability.

11:05.920 --> 11:13.120
So all of these stationary measures are, they follow through this logic. And so it turns out,

11:13.680 --> 11:18.400
this then means that there's this logic that we discovered on probability measures

11:18.400 --> 11:28.080
that I published 30 years ago. And it's, I published it with Bruce Bennett, who's a,

11:28.080 --> 11:34.080
he's now dead, but a brilliant mathematician, and Parish Murthy, who's a graduate student

11:34.080 --> 11:40.640
of mathematics. So it's two mathematicians and a flunky me working on this. And what we published

11:40.640 --> 11:45.440
it in the Journal of Math Psych, and what we, what we proved is that there was a logic on

11:45.440 --> 11:51.520
probability measures where one probability measure implies another or entails another

11:51.520 --> 11:56.800
probability measure, if and only if it's a normalized restriction. So I get the bigger

11:56.800 --> 12:01.200
probability measure, I take a subset of its states, renormalize the probability on that,

12:01.200 --> 12:05.360
and that's the probability of this guy down here. It turns out that's, so it's a simple idea. You

12:05.360 --> 12:09.680
know, I'm just a normalized restriction of the bigger measure, but then that's the implication

12:10.240 --> 12:16.880
that gives you a non Boolean logic. That's, there's no global compliment, just like in,

12:16.880 --> 12:21.920
by the way, this trace logic, there's no global compliment. Okay. Locally, there is,

12:21.920 --> 12:29.440
because you have a local Boolean logic, but globally not. So it turns out, this last thing

12:29.440 --> 12:34.080
I'm about to say, we haven't proven it, but we're going to try to do that. There's a homomorphism

12:34.080 --> 12:38.560
of the logics, that the trace logic is essentially homomorphic to the what we call the Lebesgue

12:38.560 --> 12:45.760
logic, probability measures. So this gives us the trace logic gives us a formal theory of

12:45.760 --> 12:51.840
observation. And the Lebesgue logic of probability measures gives us a formal mere theory of

12:53.680 --> 12:59.280
probabilistic belief. And so putting them together with this homomorphism shows how

12:59.280 --> 13:05.120
observations are formally related to probabilistic beliefs. Okay. So this is for us,

13:06.080 --> 13:14.000
a major breakthrough in terms of the formalism. And we had to go after this because you mentioned

13:14.000 --> 13:20.160
our paper on the subatomic world, you know, so conscious agents in the subatomic world. Well,

13:20.160 --> 13:28.080
we have to say what we mean when we're talking about modeling observations of quarks and gluons

13:28.080 --> 13:34.000
inside the proton. What do we mean? Well, so now we have this, we mean that we're going to be

13:34.000 --> 13:40.960
positing some bigger Markov chain. And our observations will be some trace chains, right,

13:40.960 --> 13:49.120
of that bigger chain. And the trace chain will have two ways that it's doing this observation. One is

13:50.640 --> 13:54.720
the number of states that is tracing on, right? So that's going to be one parameter.

13:55.920 --> 14:01.200
The more states you trace on, in some sense, the better spatial resolution you've got, right?

14:02.080 --> 14:09.360
Right. So the, so if I have, you know, if my big chain has 1000 states, that would be a very big

14:09.360 --> 14:16.800
chain, at least for my computer. And suppose I have a trace chain that's only 10 states versus

14:16.800 --> 14:21.760
another one that's 100 states versus another one that's 500 substates of the big chain, right?

14:21.760 --> 14:27.280
The one that 500 substates is in some sense a higher resolution observation than the one that

14:27.280 --> 14:34.720
only has, you know, 50 states. The 50 state one is observing the big 1000 state one. It is observing

14:34.720 --> 14:40.720
it, but not nearly with the resolution of the, you know, 500 state one. Almost like quantifying

14:40.720 --> 14:47.040
that sort of objective. It gives you complete quantification. And for the physicists, this

14:47.040 --> 14:51.520
would be our quantification of what they call Q squared, which is their technical thing for

14:51.840 --> 14:59.040
spatial resolution. It's tied to the amount of energy that they use, when higher energy

14:59.920 --> 15:04.640
leads to better spatial resolution. So what we're basically now doing is identifying

15:05.280 --> 15:10.640
higher energies with greater spatial resolution in our trace chains, which is that itself is

15:10.640 --> 15:16.560
a non-trivial statement. There's a lot that's said there, obviously, because it's very complex

15:16.560 --> 15:20.720
and a lot of people find it very difficult. I've noticed a lot of people find your theory

15:20.720 --> 15:25.120
so fascinating and want to jump on board so badly, but the math and the physics

15:25.120 --> 15:31.920
become so complicated that they just can't do it. And the only way I can is when, is by first,

15:31.920 --> 15:36.320
obviously chatting to you, watching, reading your content, but then chatting to friends or

15:36.320 --> 15:40.560
physicists, trying to get their opinion on all of this and trying from their perspective to

15:40.560 --> 15:45.360
understand what you're talking about. And the more I do, the easier it gets. It gets to sort of

15:45.360 --> 15:51.440
understand it. But I still feel left in the dark knowing that you have access to more information

15:52.000 --> 15:57.120
based on the base of knowledge you have within physics and mathematics. Have you felt that it's

15:57.120 --> 16:02.080
a bit of a struggle to try and get this out there because of the complexity of this topic?

16:02.080 --> 16:07.200
Do you feel people find that you're hiding behind these sort of fancy words? Because I've noticed

16:07.200 --> 16:13.200
that a lot of people comment about that saying that, okay, once you mention decorated permutations

16:13.280 --> 16:18.480
or permutations, or once you mention Mark of Blankets, you're just trying to sound smart.

16:18.480 --> 16:23.120
But that's not the case. Because when I chat to my physicists, friends, they seem to know what

16:23.120 --> 16:29.920
you're talking about a lot better than the layman. If someone thinks that, I mean, we have a paper

16:29.920 --> 16:34.480
called Fusions of Consciousness. So you can just go look at the paper Fusions of Consciousness.

16:34.480 --> 16:42.480
And we don't just mention the word decorated permutation, we actually create a new mathematics

16:42.480 --> 16:47.920
of decorated permutations for Mark of Chains. So it's not just handwaves. I only talk about it

16:47.920 --> 16:52.880
because we're using it and we're using it to good purpose. I'll put a link to Fusions of Consciousness.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.840
And I think that one came out in January, if I'm not... Yeah, in January, that's right.

16:59.120 --> 17:06.560
So I'll just mention that. So I agree with what you're saying that it's difficult and I try to

17:06.560 --> 17:13.280
talk about this stuff in a way that's generally accessible. But the problem is, of course, if

17:13.280 --> 17:18.000
you do that, then people say, well, it's not serious. And if you do it seriously, then I

17:18.000 --> 17:22.880
can't understand it. He's just throwing out these technical words. So it's a catch 22. But my attitude

17:22.880 --> 17:29.840
is what I do get potential graduate students. And this is one reason why I do these podcasts.

17:29.840 --> 17:35.040
And I'm interested in getting young people who are young enough that they can start to learn

17:35.040 --> 17:41.600
the math and make contributions, get them excited and get them studying this stuff. I spent an hour

17:41.600 --> 17:46.640
and a half with one student, potential student yesterday talking about and gave her a bunch of

17:46.640 --> 17:52.960
math to read. And so that's what I'm doing it for, is to actually get graduate students working on

17:52.960 --> 17:59.440
their PhDs in this field. That's my goal. I've noticed someone else who has this problem because

18:00.240 --> 18:05.520
it's Carl Friston. When I chatted to Carl, and we spoke about his approach to the free energy

18:05.520 --> 18:11.520
principle, he has exactly the same issue. He's often accused of hiding behind fancy talk, they

18:11.520 --> 18:18.400
sort of say. So you really are stuck between a rock and a hard place. How do you dumb down

18:18.400 --> 18:24.880
something that is so complex? Do you find that there's a specific way you think that's best to

18:24.880 --> 18:30.320
approach this so far? Have you hacked the code yet? Well, for communicating it,

18:33.840 --> 18:41.360
probably the best approach that I've seen so far to get people to take this idea seriously and to

18:41.360 --> 18:49.840
not just dismiss it, is to point out the failure of physical hysteries. That seems, because I'm,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.200
some of my say, look, the brain does it. Forget all this stuff about

18:55.200 --> 19:00.160
consciousness. I mean, look at all the physical hysteria. It's clear we have all these neural

19:00.160 --> 19:06.560
correlates of consciousness. We're almost there. We're getting these neural, we got lots of neural

19:06.560 --> 19:11.520
correlates of consciousness. We have all these nice integrated information theory. We have

19:11.520 --> 19:17.600
orchestrated collapse of quantum states of microtubules. We have attention to schema theory.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.160
There's, I think I already mentioned integrated information. So there's just a bunch of these,

19:26.160 --> 19:33.360
oh, global workspace theory is another big one. It's a global workspace theory. So why do we need

19:33.360 --> 19:38.640
someone who's clearly off and moving land and talking to the same consciousness is fundamental

19:38.640 --> 19:44.080
and so forth? And so for me, the thing that I think is the most grabbing thing to say is,

19:44.320 --> 19:50.720
if you ask any of these theorists, opponents of these theories, okay, you're integrated

19:50.720 --> 19:56.240
information theory. This is the theory about conscious experiences. Okay. So you're starting

19:56.240 --> 20:02.320
with some substrate, maybe it's physical or some other substrate, and you have this causal

20:02.320 --> 20:06.480
architecture that's got the right pattern of integrated information. And you're saying that

20:06.480 --> 20:12.720
that will explain the qualia of specific conscious experiences called the color green,

20:12.720 --> 20:21.360
color green, the taste of chocolate, the smell of garlic, the experience of auditory space versus

20:21.360 --> 20:28.080
the experience of visual space or the experience of haptic space as conscious experiences. So

20:29.200 --> 20:35.520
which, so clearly you've been at this for a couple of decades. So you must have a whole

20:35.520 --> 20:40.080
bunch of conscious experiences that you can now say this is the pattern of integrated information

20:40.080 --> 20:48.960
that must be the taste of chocolate. So give me what have you got? Zero. And you go to every

20:48.960 --> 20:54.560
theory and you ask them, so what have you got? How many qualia have you given me the global

20:54.560 --> 20:59.840
workspace architecture for or the orchestrated collapse of quantum states with neuronal microtubules

20:59.840 --> 21:07.120
or integrated information, what they call the Q shape? How many do you have? Zero in every case.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.880
So we have these theories that have been out there for decades, decades now that are batting

21:12.880 --> 21:21.040
zero. And I'm saying they're batting zero for principled reasons. Spacetime, the physicists,

21:21.040 --> 21:26.160
the high energy theoretical physicists are telling us, spacetime is not fundamental and

21:26.160 --> 21:33.920
reductionism is false. These theories are failing because they're not listening to modern high

21:33.920 --> 21:39.280
energy theoretical physicists that are telling us that that game is over. We're playing an old

21:39.280 --> 21:44.240
game. It's like someone after Einstein trying to play the Newtonian game in understanding chemistry.

21:44.240 --> 21:50.640
Yes. Good luck. You can't understand chemistry using Newton. You have to use quantum mechanics.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.360
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said Einstein, I should have said quantum theory.

21:53.360 --> 21:58.080
Yes. So done before you move on from that. I've because one of the questions one of the

21:58.080 --> 22:02.240
questions from the audience. So I gathered a bunch from YouTube, Twitter, etc.

22:02.960 --> 22:08.240
Unfortunately, sometimes I forgot to actually write on the person's name. So I've just left

22:08.240 --> 22:12.320
them all out together. So I'm just going to ask you them at random. But one of the questions was

22:12.960 --> 22:16.640
directed at one of your statements, because you've said this before, you're talking about the taste

22:16.640 --> 22:22.240
of chocolate, you're talking about the smell of garlic. This person says that whenever you mention

22:22.240 --> 22:30.320
those specific states, they want to know why do you want such a direct portion of consciousness.

22:30.320 --> 22:35.200
So let's say when you're asking for that qualitative qualia experience of the taste of

22:35.200 --> 22:41.040
chocolate, why go after a specific state? Because everything in the mind is so blurry,

22:41.040 --> 22:45.600
so mismatched, there's so much going on, there's so much, let's say heuristics involved.

22:46.720 --> 22:51.840
Wouldn't that be a bad approach to trying to provide proof of a theory?

22:53.600 --> 22:59.200
Well, all I'm doing is saying to the people who are offering these theories, like the integrated

22:59.200 --> 23:02.960
information theory or global workspace, whatever, they're the ones that are saying,

23:02.960 --> 23:06.800
we will start with neural activity or this Q shape, and we will give you

23:07.680 --> 23:12.640
conscious experiences. We will give you these experiences. I'm saying, okay,

23:12.640 --> 23:18.000
that's what you're promising to do. So I'm just asking you, since that's what you said you're

23:18.000 --> 23:25.360
going to do, I'm just asking you how is it going? By the way, I asked Julia Tononi this back in

23:25.440 --> 23:30.480
late 1990s, he came to UC Irvine to our Helmholtz Club meeting, and I asked him that,

23:31.520 --> 23:38.400
and he didn't have any done, and I asked him a few years ago in Canada at a conference,

23:38.400 --> 23:46.160
asked him again, and he admitted he needed to offer one, and he couldn't. And same thing with

23:46.800 --> 23:51.520
Stuart Hammerhoff, I mean, I had him at a conference in front of 400 or 500 people,

23:51.520 --> 23:56.160
I asked him, you know, so Stuart, how's it going? I mean, you're promising that we'll start with

23:56.160 --> 24:00.320
these orchestrated collapses, and you'll give us specific conscious experiences. So which ones,

24:00.320 --> 24:04.800
I mean, that's what you claim that you're doing. So how many conscious experiences have you nailed

24:04.800 --> 24:09.600
down? And I had to push him for three or four minutes before he finally said, because he was

24:09.600 --> 24:14.400
hemming and homing. And I said, no, no, no, Stuart, give me one. No, Stuart, give me one.

24:14.400 --> 24:21.040
And he finally said, no, I can't give you one. So I'm just, now, if they want to say, you know,

24:21.040 --> 24:24.880
we have these wonderful theories, integrative information theory, and they have nothing to do

24:25.600 --> 24:30.800
with the taste of chocolate and the smell of garlic, fine, then I won't ask you the question.

24:30.800 --> 24:37.360
But if they do say that, then hey, the science is science, where's the beef? So that's why I do it.

24:37.360 --> 24:41.520
Don, I'm curious about your opinion. Was it about, it was about two months ago, I think,

24:41.520 --> 24:49.440
about the IIT. Swaray, I mean, that was such a major issue within the philosophy community here,

24:50.320 --> 24:54.080
and science community in general. What were your thoughts on that? Just for the context for

24:54.080 --> 24:59.120
the listeners, it's the whole debacle way IIT was accused of being pseudoscience.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.960
Right. That's right. And when I looked at the letter that was put out there and the references

25:06.960 --> 25:11.360
that they gave, one of the things they referenced was Michael Graziano on a paper of his on

25:12.800 --> 25:18.960
attentional schema theory, where it basically says theory of consciousness is either mechanical

25:19.040 --> 25:25.520
or it's magical. And so the, the signers of that were basically signing on to look at theory of

25:25.520 --> 25:30.400
consciousness is either mechanical and presumably neuro mechanical, but maybe AI kind of mechanical,

25:30.400 --> 25:38.080
but, but most of them are thinking neuro mechanical, right? Or it's magical. And so what, what, so the

25:38.080 --> 25:47.200
argument is that IIT is claiming some kind of substrate independence. There is a substrate,

25:47.200 --> 25:50.880
so that it doesn't say that consciousness is fundamental. It says there is a substrate to

25:50.880 --> 25:55.360
consciousness, but the substrate might not be physical. Of course, they're, they're thinking

25:55.360 --> 26:00.640
it's physical, right? That's, I mean, ask them, so what is, so how many non physical substrates

26:00.640 --> 26:04.800
are you, you know, have you concentrated everything? So what are you going to say,

26:04.800 --> 26:09.680
ectoplasm? I don't know. So, so, but anyway, they're, they're, they're saying that there's a

26:09.680 --> 26:14.320
substrate, but they're not committed to a neural, put it this way, there's not necessarily a neural

26:14.320 --> 26:19.120
substrate. It could be some kind of computational architecture that's completely non neural. So,

26:19.120 --> 26:24.240
so I don't think they're going non physical, but they could be going non neural. And

26:27.280 --> 26:33.680
so that means that they're, they're dealing with something that is, it looks like a disembodied

26:33.680 --> 26:40.160
mathematical causal structure, right? Although the IIT people would of course say it has to be

26:41.120 --> 26:49.920
instantiated and something. So the substrate is, is, is important. But somehow they think that because

26:49.920 --> 26:58.160
it's not, they're not tying, they're not starting with neurons. They're not starting with, with

26:58.160 --> 27:04.000
neural circuitry or something like that and trying to show that that leads to consciousness. They're

27:04.000 --> 27:09.600
starting with something more abstract and not necessarily mechanical. It's not like this fires

27:09.600 --> 27:14.880
and that fires and we have this circuit and so forth. It's more abstract mathematical kind of

27:14.880 --> 27:20.800
thing. So I'm just trying to explain the kind of get in the heads of the people that are,

27:20.800 --> 27:29.360
they're worried about this. They're, and so they're, they're concerned about that. Now my,

27:30.560 --> 27:39.280
my attitude is, I think that all of these theories have the problem that I just mentioned, which is

27:39.360 --> 27:46.240
there's no beef. There's no, no success in the, in terms of specific conscious experiences. And,

27:46.240 --> 27:51.840
and what's happened is all the physicalists, I think that they're starting to understand

27:52.960 --> 27:58.880
that they're not, they have nothing in terms of concrete conscious experiences that they can explain

27:59.760 --> 28:07.520
without hand waves. They're zero. They're forming a circular firing squad, right? They're, they're,

28:07.520 --> 28:12.880
they're shooting at each other and, and everybody's vulnerable to the, the objection that I just gave.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.480
The objection is you claim that you'll start with integrated information or I start with,

28:18.480 --> 28:23.040
you know, higher order theory. Now, now we're doing the neural stuff, higher order theories or

28:23.040 --> 28:28.320
first order theories or global workspace theory. And I'm going to give you specific conscious

28:28.320 --> 28:32.880
experiences. Which one? Oh, I can't give you any right now. How long we've been doing this? Decades.

28:32.880 --> 28:38.720
We've been doing this for decades and can't give me one. So, so at some point people get impatient

28:38.720 --> 28:46.000
and go, you know, no, no, I should say I'm good friends. These are, these are my friends and

28:46.000 --> 28:52.320
colleagues, right? So they're brilliant. Some of them are geniuses. All of them are brilliant. And

28:52.320 --> 28:58.560
some of them are geniuses. Why are they not making progress? There is not because they're not smart.

28:58.560 --> 29:04.560
They're brilliant. They're not making progress because we're not listening to what the high

29:04.560 --> 29:11.120
energy theoretical physicists are telling us. Space time is doomed and reductionism is false.

29:12.000 --> 29:20.160
We have to listen to our best current science. It was fine 30 years ago to assume that space

29:20.160 --> 29:23.600
time is fundamental and reductionism is the way to go. In fact, it was the right

29:24.560 --> 29:29.840
approach given our current science at the time. But it's no longer, it's no longer feasible. It's

29:29.840 --> 29:35.440
ignoring, it's frankly just ignoring our best science. And that's not what we want to do.

29:35.440 --> 29:42.160
So my prediction is as soon as these brilliant colleagues and friends of mine

29:42.960 --> 29:48.880
really understand that we need a new framework and they switch, I think all of a sudden we'll make

29:48.880 --> 29:53.440
some serious progress on this field. And we'll look back and realize that we're in sort of the

29:53.440 --> 29:59.440
Flat Earth period of this field. And as long as you assume Flat Earth, you can't do a space program.

30:00.080 --> 30:05.600
As soon as you let go of Flat Earth, then you start to have the tools that you need to actually

30:05.600 --> 30:11.680
start doing a space program. You mentioned Michael Graziano. He was the first person I

30:11.680 --> 30:16.960
interviewed on this podcast. And this feels like ages ago. But I remember him saying that

30:16.960 --> 30:22.480
if you take attention schema theory and you plop it on top of global workspace theory,

30:22.480 --> 30:29.760
he believes that together it actually would provide a very complete theory of consciousness.

30:29.760 --> 30:34.640
But I can't help but think based on the fact that he's saying that based on the fact that

30:34.640 --> 30:40.560
they used it's either mechanical or magical. Do you think it would be similar to compare

30:40.560 --> 30:46.480
Michael's theory and global workspace if they continue to do as well as they do separately and

30:46.480 --> 30:52.960
maybe even together to be the Newton's theory in physics or Newtonian physics of the brain?

30:53.600 --> 30:59.680
And then while you guys are going on to sort of do the Einstein's theory of consciousness,

30:59.680 --> 31:02.480
do you think you guys are going to approach consciousness in that sort of way?

31:04.240 --> 31:08.800
Yeah. Now, I should be very, very clear that I think that the work that they're doing

31:08.800 --> 31:15.280
on getting models of the neural correlates of consciousness is brilliant and useful and that

31:15.280 --> 31:21.920
will survive. But it's not a theory of the generation of consciousness. It's a theory about

31:21.920 --> 31:30.720
how we see consciousness correlated with parts of brain activity. So I'm all for that. Now,

31:31.360 --> 31:36.320
my understanding about Graziano is at least in some of his writings, I've gotten the impression

31:36.320 --> 31:43.840
that he thinks that the conscious experiences is in some sense an illusion. There aren't really

31:43.840 --> 31:50.000
quality, but we have the illusion. He calls it a caricature. He actually intentionally avoids

31:50.000 --> 32:00.000
the word illusion. Right. So if he doesn't want to use the word illusion, Keith Frankish does.

32:00.000 --> 32:07.280
So Keith does use the word illusion. And if Michael wants to use caricature, that's fine.

32:07.360 --> 32:11.920
But as a scientist, my feeling, I'll say first about the illusion approach.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.680
And I've said this to, I mean, Keith is a great guy. I really enjoy talking with him. I feel

32:17.680 --> 32:25.120
he's a friend and so forth. But I've pointed this out to him and he hasn't demurred that saying that

32:25.120 --> 32:30.720
it's an illusion doesn't get him off the hook because we now need a scientific theory about what

32:31.920 --> 32:36.320
specific pattern of brain activity must be the illusion of the taste of chocolate and could

32:36.320 --> 32:40.880
not be the illusion of garlic. So you might think, oh, well, now that they said it's an illusion,

32:40.880 --> 32:43.920
they don't have the problem, the problems bring up. No, no, no, no, no. They have,

32:44.880 --> 32:49.760
we have to do science here. If you're saying it's an illusion, I want to have a precise scientific

32:49.760 --> 32:54.800
theory about why that has to be that illusion and couldn't be, you know, this illusion.

32:57.280 --> 33:03.360
They call it the illusion problem. That's right. And I would say the same thing,

33:03.520 --> 33:10.240
you know, from Graziano, if it's a character, then why should this particular brain activity be

33:10.240 --> 33:15.760
the caricature of the color green and not the caricature of the color red? I mean, I want to,

33:15.760 --> 33:19.280
again, as a scientist, I don't want to hand wave and I don't want to say because I called it

33:19.280 --> 33:26.480
caricature. I don't owe you a scientific theory. I mean, I'm not interested. I'm interested in

33:26.480 --> 33:34.080
results. I want a theory where the existence of illusion or a caricature or the real qualia.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.800
I want a theory that gives me the beef and says this pattern must be this caricature and it couldn't

33:38.800 --> 33:44.320
be that caricature. Otherwise, I mean, I'm philosophy is fine. I have a joint appointment

33:44.320 --> 33:49.680
in philosophy. I love philosophy, but I'm talking science here. And so I want a scientific theory.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.800
So that's sort of my attitude about that whole thing.

33:52.800 --> 33:58.160
Yeah. And I think what I was trying to get at was, it will still be very useful and it will

33:58.160 --> 34:03.200
actually work in the sense that in the same way Newtonian physics works, because we still use

34:03.200 --> 34:09.200
it, it's still very practical. It's just doesn't go away. So in that sense, it will still be very,

34:09.200 --> 34:18.080
very good at its job. I agree. But also, you'll have some, with Newton, you have some misconceptions.

34:18.080 --> 34:22.000
You have the idea that, well, I should be able to get the position and the momentum

34:22.000 --> 34:27.360
at the same time to arbitrary accuracy when I'm looking at stuff. So you're led to believe

34:27.360 --> 34:35.120
certain things. Well, that turned out to be false. And so the absolutely Newton is great

34:35.120 --> 34:39.440
if you want to send a rocket to the moon, it'll work. And for a lot of everyday stuff.

34:39.440 --> 34:45.920
But sometimes it leads you into conceptual errors, like position momentum. And something like

34:47.200 --> 34:50.640
these physicalist theories, I think they will be very, very good for the neural correlates

34:50.640 --> 34:55.600
of consciousness and so forth. But they're going to lead to some, they are leading to what I think

34:55.600 --> 35:01.840
are fundamental errors. And I'll name one that I think is a crucial error. They want to make

35:01.840 --> 35:06.720
a distinction between which circuits of the brain or which physical objects in general

35:06.720 --> 35:13.600
are conscious, which ones are not. So they want to use IIT in hospitals to determine whether

35:13.600 --> 35:19.920
someone's a vegetable or not. You know, should we pull the plug or not? So that's something that

35:19.920 --> 35:26.400
you as a doctor are quite interested in, I'm sure. And so they're making the assumption

35:27.280 --> 35:33.600
that some physical systems are associated with consciousness and others are not.

35:34.800 --> 35:42.720
That's their assumption. Now, if it turns out that space time isn't fundamental,

35:43.280 --> 35:47.520
and objects in space time are not fundamental. In other words, if we listen to what the high

35:47.520 --> 35:51.840
energy theoretical physicists are telling us, and they're saying that there are structures

35:51.840 --> 35:56.480
outside of space time, and they're finding them like amplituhedron and decorated permutations.

36:00.960 --> 36:05.360
What is space time? It's not the fundamental reality anymore and objects in space time are not.

36:06.080 --> 36:10.800
So now we have to understand what is that. And so what I'm proposing is that space time

36:10.800 --> 36:16.720
and objects in space time are just a headset, just an interface. So think about it that way.

36:16.960 --> 36:23.040
Here I'm using an interface to talk with you. And I see I'm using Zoom, we're talking about Zoom.

36:23.040 --> 36:27.440
And I see a bunch of pixels on the screen. And I see pixels of Tevin's face.

36:28.800 --> 36:36.080
And I see also pixels of a wall behind you. Now, I'm getting a lot of conscious input from the

36:36.080 --> 36:40.720
pixels on your face. I mean, I can see your expression. I can see if you're interested or not.

36:40.720 --> 36:47.200
The pixels on the wall, not much. Now, I could say, aha, so I want to have

36:48.160 --> 36:53.600
the pixel correlates of consciousness. So these are the conscious pixels,

36:54.400 --> 36:58.320
the ones on and those are the conscious pixels in Tevin's face. And the ones on the wall, those

36:58.320 --> 37:03.840
are not conscious pixels. And so now I'm going to have my little mathematical model. These pixels

37:03.840 --> 37:08.160
are conscious and those pixels are not because these have some complicated pattern of interaction

37:08.160 --> 37:15.680
and those do not. Well, that's completely wrongheaded. Pixels are pixels, period. Some

37:16.560 --> 37:22.400
they're not conscious or unconscious. They're they're a merely a headset, an interface.

37:22.400 --> 37:28.960
Some pixels give me access to a conscious consciousness behind the Zoom. And others don't.

37:29.760 --> 37:35.120
And so when you realize that that's so that is a fundamental difference here.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.760
Right. If we use something like integrated information theory, which is saying certain

37:39.760 --> 37:47.040
physical systems are conscious and others are not, I'm saying that claim is absolutely false.

37:48.400 --> 37:54.880
And it's dangerous to assume it in hospital settings. So this is the academic.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.800
Yes. So now this goes beyond this is very practical. This becomes very important

37:58.800 --> 38:03.120
for us as a society. And that's actually the main when I started the podcast.

38:04.080 --> 38:10.320
One of the one of the description layers was this podcast is function is to show just how

38:10.320 --> 38:15.680
difficult intellectually and practically the mind, body problems, because the moment you

38:15.680 --> 38:20.640
do finally figure out whatever theory of consciousness you want to develop and grow,

38:20.640 --> 38:25.760
it has so many practical implications. And in this case, I mean, you're touching on a very,

38:25.760 --> 38:28.640
very big one. I mean, debt that we're talking life and death of this.

38:29.600 --> 38:38.240
Absolutely. And pulling the plug or not. And it's if the foundation is so wrong that it's

38:38.240 --> 38:42.400
actually it's at the level of saying these pixels are conscious and these pixels are not is that

38:42.400 --> 38:48.960
kind of error. Then we have to be very, very careful about it. So, so, so this is not just

38:48.960 --> 38:53.840
academic anymore, saying that space time as a headset has real, real implications,

38:53.840 --> 39:00.720
moral implications, and technological implications. And it also has implications for the whole debate

39:00.720 --> 39:06.480
about can AI be conscious, right? This gives you the standard way that that's considered. And again,

39:06.480 --> 39:10.720
it brings up all sorts of moral questions that people are worried about. But the way it's thought

39:10.720 --> 39:18.800
about is we have a physical system that a priori is not conscious. Somehow, if we give it the right

39:18.880 --> 39:26.320
kind of complexity, computational complexity, it will be conscious. Well, that's exactly the same

39:26.320 --> 39:31.280
mistake as saying if I get the right kind of complexity in the zoom pixel activity,

39:31.280 --> 39:37.360
it'll be consciousness. No, it's not. It's just so certain zoom pixels give me a portal into

39:37.360 --> 39:43.280
Tevin's consciousness. And other zoom pixels on my screen don't give me any portals into Tevin's

39:43.280 --> 39:50.400
consciousness. The pixels are not conscious or unconscious. It's about the headset and how it's

39:50.400 --> 39:57.360
engaged to what's beyond space time was outside the space time and how it's effectively or not

39:57.360 --> 40:02.640
effectively giving us access to what's beyond space time. The whole point of a headset is to

40:02.640 --> 40:08.160
simplify things. And at some point, you're going to simplify things so, so much that you can't really

40:08.160 --> 40:16.320
say much about it, right? When I look at you, my interface has given me a portal into your

40:16.320 --> 40:22.160
consciousness that's good, not perfect. Even if you've lived with someone, you've been married to

40:22.160 --> 40:26.720
someone for 30 years, you find out that there's things you don't know, right? So it's not a

40:26.720 --> 40:31.280
perfect portal. But when I look at my cat, the portal is even worse. And when I look at an ant,

40:31.280 --> 40:37.200
it's even worse, and a microbe, it's even worse. When I look at a rock, my headset is given up.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.280
Because headsets are there to simplify things. At some point, it has to give up.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.400
So it's not that the rock is, it's not that like the Tevin human body is conscious or not

40:48.400 --> 40:53.440
conscious, and the rock is conscious. It's just that these are symbols that give us portals into

40:54.000 --> 40:58.880
a preexisting consciousness or not. In the case of the rock, my idea is that we're interacting

40:58.880 --> 41:04.080
with consciousness all the time. But when I see a rock, I'm not getting much insight into the

41:04.080 --> 41:07.840
consciousness that I'm interacting with. It's not, so I'm not saying the rock is conscious,

41:07.840 --> 41:13.520
it's not panpsychism. So I'm not, I'm not a panpsychist. Headset is a headset, consciousness is

41:13.520 --> 41:18.800
consciousness. I'm not saying that, you know, the most panpsychists are thinking that that

41:18.800 --> 41:25.040
space time is fundamental. Particles are fundamental. But behind the equations of physics and behind

41:25.040 --> 41:30.160
the particles, what breathes fire into the equations and life into the particles is consciousness

41:30.160 --> 41:34.960
inside space time. But we'll keep the same laws of physics and so forth, you know. So

41:35.680 --> 41:40.400
consciousness is sort of almost along for the ride, but the laws of physics are really doing all the,

41:40.400 --> 41:46.080
I'm having, I'm good friends with Philip Goff and we have good discussions on that. And Philip

41:46.080 --> 41:52.480
has said to me that he's willing to let go of space time, but we'll see, you know, I'll push

41:52.480 --> 41:59.520
to let go of that. And if he does, I think we'll be very, very close in our views. But so, you know,

41:59.520 --> 42:04.160
I think that, well, I think I'll just stop there. I'm going to chat to Philip and I think

42:04.160 --> 42:07.920
Jan of Feb, I can't remember when we scheduled it, but I'm going to ask him about this. I'm going

42:07.920 --> 42:13.200
to see how close he's gotten to that sort of conversion. But I'm glad you're touching, as it

42:13.200 --> 42:17.600
stands, Don, you're touching on some practical stuff at the moment. And this is what I sort of

42:17.600 --> 42:21.760
premised a lot of these questions on, which is great, because I think that these practical

42:21.760 --> 42:26.480
implications of understanding this headset or understanding this virtual reality, this matrix,

42:26.480 --> 42:31.440
whatever people want to call it, it's pretty much the same thing. You are saying that this world

42:31.440 --> 42:36.480
we're living in is a sort of simulation in that sense, it is a virtual reality. Some people love

42:36.480 --> 42:42.160
you using the word matrix, just to be clear, it's not the same type of matrix as from the movie,

42:42.160 --> 42:48.560
but nevertheless, the word matrix seems to be now synonymous with simulation. In this virtual

42:48.560 --> 42:55.440
reality, you just go to this question that I have for you. How do mental health or mental

42:55.440 --> 43:02.720
disabilities work within this sort of framework? Does your work now give you a sort of, I know

43:02.720 --> 43:08.640
you have to now almost become a philosopher and sort of maybe even guesstimate certain aspects

43:08.640 --> 43:13.200
of this, because it's very difficult to go outside this box already. And to go even further beyond

43:13.200 --> 43:19.200
space time to now give me mental health theories is going to be even more difficult. But just out

43:19.200 --> 43:26.640
of curiosity, what is it? Is it a bug in the actual virtual reality? What's going on here?

43:32.240 --> 43:37.280
So the way I think about it is that there's space and time and what we see in space and time is

43:37.280 --> 43:43.440
just a headset. And behind the headset is this realm of consciousness. So that's another part

43:43.440 --> 43:47.440
of the ontology that we're proposing. I'm not saying I'm right, I'm just saying I'm trying to be

43:47.520 --> 43:52.480
precise. And I've got to say something specific. So I'm saying that there's a vast social network

43:52.480 --> 43:58.800
of conscious agents that in some sense, probably are ultimately, I'll realize that there's one

43:58.800 --> 44:03.920
conscious agent and this network is just a nice analytic tool that I have to use as a scientist.

44:03.920 --> 44:09.120
So I'll talk about there's one conscious agent, but I'm using this network, because that's what

44:09.120 --> 44:17.440
I need to use to do mathematics. So that one conscious agent, what is it up to?

44:19.680 --> 44:26.240
And why, right? I don't know. So I guess, but one possibility is

44:28.480 --> 44:31.440
it's a theorem that no system can ever understand itself completely.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.760
If I have a computer system and it wants to understand itself, it has to build a model of

44:37.760 --> 44:41.520
itself. Well, as soon as it builds a model of itself, now it's more complicated. So now to

44:41.520 --> 44:45.840
understand itself, the new self of the model is going to have to model itself with a model,

44:45.840 --> 44:55.360
and you get in this infinite recursion. So maybe what the, maybe the one infinite consciousness,

44:55.920 --> 45:02.640
which transcends any particular instantiation, like a spacetime instantiation or whatever,

45:02.640 --> 45:06.320
you know, we have a three dimensions of space, one dimension of time, what about a 50 dimensions

45:06.320 --> 45:13.120
of space in one dimension of time? I can see seven million colors. Why not 20 trillion colors?

45:13.680 --> 45:21.680
And new, in other words, this is just one possible form instantiation that the consciousness can use

45:21.680 --> 45:29.600
out of an infinite potential to look at itself. So what consciousness is up to is looking at itself

45:30.080 --> 45:40.880
from different perspectives, and then losing itself in the perspective, identify. So I'm now

45:40.880 --> 45:45.280
identified with the Hoffman body. I think I'm only, you know, I'm just that, and I'm nothing more,

45:45.280 --> 45:50.000
and I'm afraid of death and the whole bit. And then slowly waking up and realizing, oh, no, no,

45:52.000 --> 45:59.280
I now know myself because I know I'm not Hoffman. So all the stuff that I thought I was,

45:59.600 --> 46:03.840
and I immersed myself, you know, both feet, I jumped in with both feet on this thing,

46:05.440 --> 46:14.080
and spent 70 years, 80 years, 90 years, and then woke up. And now I know myself because I know,

46:15.040 --> 46:21.280
I know myself better because I know I'm not that. So knowing yourself by a bunch of negations.

46:22.080 --> 46:30.320
And so now, from that point of view, the one can know itself by being a paraplegic,

46:31.920 --> 46:42.080
or having, you know, Alzheimer's, or you're having, you know, any kind of mental disease

46:42.080 --> 46:45.600
you want, some kind of nervous breakdown. I just have nervous breakdowns all the time,

46:45.680 --> 46:52.720
or whatever it might be. Or I also experienced myself as being, you know, the world's fastest

46:52.720 --> 46:59.200
Olympic runner, and the world's Einstein, and then I'll wake up, but I'm not that either.

47:00.880 --> 47:08.080
So in other words, essentially, even behind someone who looks completely debilitated

47:08.960 --> 47:14.400
is this infinite consciousness, just looking at itself. So in that point of view,

47:14.400 --> 47:20.320
everything deserves equal respect, right? So there's, there's a moral aspect to this, which

47:20.320 --> 47:27.280
says when I see someone who has an IQ of 50, there's no difference between me and that.

47:27.280 --> 47:33.040
When I look at my cat, is I am the same one consciousness that's also looking at me through

47:33.040 --> 47:37.600
the cat. Those are just different avatars of the one consciousness from this point of view.

47:38.160 --> 47:44.160
So what happens from this point of view is there is no grounds for

47:50.080 --> 47:57.200
putting barriers between me and anybody else. This actually says I am that just looking at it

47:57.200 --> 48:03.280
through a different interface. And this I think is the foundation for a genuine love,

48:03.280 --> 48:08.000
that love is recognizing is not just loving the other as yourself, it's recognizing that

48:08.000 --> 48:12.480
the other is yourself. It's you, the infinite consciousness looking at yourself through a

48:12.480 --> 48:18.960
different avatar. You see this sort of play out in a lot of ancient cultures as well, where

48:19.760 --> 48:24.400
let's say someone goes out and hunts for food, they kill the animal and they sort of pray to it,

48:25.840 --> 48:31.440
hug it, do a sort of sing songs around it, because they know they have to eat this being

48:31.440 --> 48:39.200
that is sort of still part of them. And this is quite a recurring theme with religions,

48:39.200 --> 48:47.600
with sort of spiritualists. And I've noticed a lot of idealist theories in general tend to lead

48:47.600 --> 48:53.600
to this. That's right. I didn't intend to go there. Yeah, which is quite fascinating.

48:56.320 --> 48:59.760
I mean, I was just sort of led by, you know, if I'm going to assume that consciousness is

48:59.840 --> 49:04.720
fundamental, and I started this one step after another, and I sort of led kicking and screaming

49:04.720 --> 49:10.640
to this, but now that I've gone there, it starts to make sense. It's so counterintuitive,

49:12.080 --> 49:18.560
but that counterintuitiveness might just be the one jumped in with both feet, and it let

49:18.560 --> 49:22.560
itself get completely lost in it. In other words, if you're really going to know that you're not

49:22.560 --> 49:27.520
that, you have to believe that you are it for a while. You really let yourself believe it and

49:27.520 --> 49:32.400
then wake up. And then you really, you took that very, very seriously. You really understood what

49:32.400 --> 49:39.760
it meant to be a Tevin or a Don or, you know, Michael Graziano or whoever it might be. You

49:39.760 --> 49:45.200
learned what it meant to be that, and you realized, I'm not that. I am this consciousness that transcends

49:45.200 --> 49:52.080
that. It's like when Bernardo talks about this dissociated altars, I mean, off a universal

49:52.080 --> 49:56.080
mind, Bernardo Castro, when he says, it's pretty much the same in that universal mind. And we're

49:56.080 --> 50:03.040
just these avatars or dissociated altars of the same sort of entity. There is no separation here

50:03.040 --> 50:10.560
at all. That's right. So I'm pretty much on the same page with Bernardo on most things. One little

50:10.560 --> 50:15.920
wrinkle that we add though, and it may not be just a little wrinkle is that this trace logic that I

50:15.920 --> 50:24.080
mentioned at the start is the first formal structure I found outside of space time about

50:24.080 --> 50:30.080
the structure of the one. And it's a non-bullion logic. And there's no global complement.

50:31.440 --> 50:37.840
So this is the first hint I've gotten of a structure. And I'm not saying that this is

50:37.840 --> 50:42.880
the final word about the structure of one. Absolutely not. But it's the first baby step.

50:43.440 --> 50:49.280
And the first baby step in terms of a mathematical model of, quote unquote, God of the one

50:49.840 --> 50:56.720
is already blowing my mind because it's not clear what the word one even means. If this thing

50:58.400 --> 51:06.480
is not a bullion logic, there is no like one top Markovian kernel. So I use the word one,

51:06.480 --> 51:11.440
but right now when I use it, already my math is telling me, Don, you're gonna have to think

51:11.440 --> 51:18.880
deeper that the word one doesn't, whatever kind of unity that is, is not a trivial unity. And it's

51:18.880 --> 51:25.600
not a bullion logic by any means. So what do you mean by the one? So already the math,

51:26.480 --> 51:31.280
I might be using the same words that the religious people are using have used for thousands of years.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.240
But already the math is telling me this goes way, way deeper than I'd ever imagined. And

51:39.920 --> 51:44.320
probably way deeper than the human mind because of the interface limitations we have.

51:45.280 --> 51:50.320
Because that's another one of my questions at some point. I mean, how far do you think you're

51:50.320 --> 51:57.680
going to get on knowing that we are limited, in essence, and we're never really, we never

51:57.680 --> 52:02.080
really evolved the capability to perceive truth. I mean, we know the difference between proofs and

52:02.080 --> 52:07.200
truths, the verticality. How close do you really think that this will take you?

52:17.120 --> 52:20.800
So sorry, I was going to say that's always a tough question. I mean, when we know that

52:20.800 --> 52:26.640
we're so limited, it's so difficult for us to really go beyond anything further and deeper.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.200
Does that ever keep you up at night?

52:30.320 --> 52:36.880
Well, I think about it quite a bit. I tried to do it during the day.

52:40.720 --> 52:44.240
Here's one important aspect of it, though, and that is what is the nature of scientific theory

52:44.240 --> 52:50.400
building? What are scientific theories? What do we mean by scientific theory? A theory in science

52:51.040 --> 52:56.560
says, please grant me these assumptions. And if you grant me these assumptions and I can make

52:56.560 --> 52:59.920
them mathematically precise, so I'll make these assumptions mathematically precise,

52:59.920 --> 53:04.320
then I can derive and predict all these wonderful things.

53:06.800 --> 53:12.880
And so that's, and if you do it right, the mathematical description of the theory will

53:12.880 --> 53:17.840
tell you the scope of those assumptions, how much that they can really do, their power,

53:17.840 --> 53:22.800
and it will also tell you the limits, like Einstein's special theory and general theory

53:22.800 --> 53:27.600
of relativity. They tell you this great scope of the mathematics tells you it's incredible,

53:27.600 --> 53:31.280
predicts black holes, and all of a sudden it's amazing that it works really well.

53:31.280 --> 53:37.040
It also tells you when you combine it with Einstein's contribution to quantum theory,

53:37.040 --> 53:44.320
E equals H nu, you combine that with that, it tells you that space time is doomed at 10 to the

53:44.320 --> 53:51.280
minus 33 centimeters. So it tells you that Einstein's theory is beautiful theory, it tells you the

53:51.280 --> 53:58.160
scope and the limits, 10 to the minus 33, that theory dies, 10 to the minus 43 seconds, it's over.

53:58.880 --> 54:03.680
So now you might say, well, of course, that's true of any theory, but I can now give you a deeper

54:03.680 --> 54:08.400
theory that explains those assumptions of the theory that you just saw give you a deeper

54:08.400 --> 54:12.720
theory. Absolutely, you can always get a deeper theory, but your new deeper theory will have

54:12.720 --> 54:21.280
its own assumptions. And this goes on ad infinitum. So my take on it is science is one of the best

54:21.280 --> 54:30.080
tools we have. I'm doing science, I love science. And science, after billions and billions of years,

54:30.080 --> 54:36.080
if we continue to do it for billions and billions of years, the fraction of knowledge that we would

54:36.080 --> 54:44.880
have about reality is precisely measure zero, precisely measure zero. And yet, we have to do it.

54:46.320 --> 54:52.000
We can never, with science, write a theory of everything. So when we talk about a theory of

54:52.000 --> 54:59.600
everything, real scientists do it with a week and a nod. It's a theory of everything so far,

55:00.400 --> 55:09.280
and so far is pretty trivial. So I think it's, in principle, the case that scientific theories

55:10.320 --> 55:15.920
can never be a theory of everything. But what they can tell us their limits, that's what's

55:15.920 --> 55:20.640
powerful about science, that the theories of science tell us their limits, like the theory of

55:20.640 --> 55:26.560
evolution of natural selection actually entails that spacetime isn't fundamental. And Einstein's

55:26.560 --> 55:30.800
theory of spacetime entails that spacetime isn't fundamental. These theories tell you

55:31.520 --> 55:36.640
their limits, right? Because evolution of natural selection, the way Darwin was thinking about it,

55:36.640 --> 55:41.600
is talking about organisms in space and time, competing for resources in space and time.

55:42.800 --> 55:48.720
And when you look at evolutionary game theory, it tells you that the very categories of space

55:48.720 --> 55:53.680
and time and objects are not the fundamental reality. Those are just headset categories.

55:54.400 --> 56:02.880
So it tells you its limits. I think what our theories do, that's essential, is they do tell us

56:02.880 --> 56:12.320
truths about the particular perspective that our headset gives us. So science can give us

56:12.320 --> 56:20.480
truths about our headset. There's an infinite reality of consciousness that transcends any

56:20.480 --> 56:26.800
scientific theory. But we can look at different perspectives on that, different possible headsets.

56:26.800 --> 56:31.600
Right now, all of science has been looking at a particular spacetime headset, three dimensions

56:31.600 --> 56:37.360
of space, one dimension of time, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, it's over with. It's a fairly cheap

56:37.360 --> 56:42.560
headset. We thought it was the final reality. It just turned out to be a knockoff cheap headset.

56:43.680 --> 56:48.000
But now we've learned the tools inside the headset. We studied the headset, we thought we

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
were studying the truth, it was just the headset. But now that we have the tools, we can step outside

56:52.000 --> 56:58.160
the headset and imagine other headsets and imagine, and that's all my theory of consciousness is.

56:58.160 --> 57:04.880
It's just a projecting model of consciousness. There's no longer taking spacetime as fundamentals,

57:04.880 --> 57:09.360
taking consciousness as fundamental, but I'm recognizing I can never get a theory of the

57:09.360 --> 57:14.000
ultimate consciousness. Let me start off with little networks of consciousness, because I can

57:14.000 --> 57:18.640
model that, and that's just going to be a projection at best of the deeper reality.

57:18.640 --> 57:22.560
So every question you ask, I mean, the answer is not trivial.

57:26.720 --> 57:33.520
We, science can never get a theory of everything, but we can get good theories of projections of

57:33.520 --> 57:41.360
reality. And then just to put a spiritual twist on it, but you are that reality. You are,

57:42.320 --> 57:48.080
from this point of view. And in some sense, you can know at first hand, by just letting go of any

57:48.080 --> 57:54.640
theory and letting go of and just being. So when you just sit in meditation, that is the closest

57:54.640 --> 58:03.200
you're going to get to what transcends any scientific theory. It's incredible because

58:05.280 --> 58:09.600
I've chatted to you many times and I know how you think and I can tell, well, I don't know exactly

58:09.600 --> 58:17.040
how you think, but I know how science minded you are and how much it must perhaps annoy you when

58:17.760 --> 58:23.040
you're clumped into categories of thinkers when you are actively doing science. Because I know that

58:23.920 --> 58:26.960
there are many people I've spoken to on this channel who have the same problem. The moment

58:26.960 --> 58:32.400
you step outside any sort of status quo, you're automatically grouped together as either some

58:32.400 --> 58:36.720
sort of a hippie scientist or a spiritualist thinker. And they give you these labels that I

58:36.720 --> 58:43.360
think are unwarranted and for the most part unfair. And someone who has a similar issue is

58:43.360 --> 58:47.840
Thomas Campbell. Because when I spoke to him, your theories are very similar. And one of the

58:47.840 --> 58:52.400
questions I wrote down here, and he radiates this because he's trying his best to not be

58:52.400 --> 58:58.720
associated any form of religion sort of dogma because he does try and explain things outside

58:58.720 --> 59:04.800
of the realm of what we say quote unquote is normal. The question I have here is, and this is not

59:04.800 --> 59:10.960
from me, this is from one of the viewers. Where does Thomas Campbell's theory start and

59:10.960 --> 59:17.680
Donald Hoffman's theory end? They're just trying to ask, what's the difference between these two

59:17.680 --> 59:22.240
different types of virtual realities you guys are talking about? Because they're both very similar.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.840
And yet they are very different. I think this person obviously just does not see the greater

59:25.840 --> 59:33.200
detail in them. Right. So I did have a conversation with Tom and so I could actually

59:33.280 --> 59:37.440
point out there is a podcast where Tom and I go into this in great detail. So I can

59:37.440 --> 59:42.000
give you the link to it. Yeah, I'll give you the link to it. So I'll just give a short answer

59:42.000 --> 59:48.800
because that's, I mean, Tom and I go at it for an hour or two. So it's very friendly, of course,

59:48.800 --> 59:56.320
very friendly. But so he calls it my big toe because there's a big theory of everything.

59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.480
And so I just given you my theory of everything, what that means. And so

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.440
at the very end of our conversation, I pushed him on it. I said, look,

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.000
there is no such thing as a theory of everything. Wouldn't you agree? And ultimately,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.480
he agreed. There is no theory of everything. Initially, I thought that that might be a big

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.680
difference between us. But I really wanted to find out. I mean, do you really believe, Tom,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:28.080
that you've got the final word on truth with your theory? Because I don't. If you do believe

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.520
that, then my theory is utterly different from yours because I think all I've got is a little

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.200
tiny baby step outside of our headset. And that's all I've got. And I'm never going to have a

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:50.560
theory of everything. So the difference I see between us just in terms of practical theory

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:58.640
building is he's using a lot of quantum theoretical ideas in his approach, right? A lot of it is

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:04.320
using, I mean, he's got advanced, I guess he didn't get his PhD, but he's done advanced research

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.600
and advanced study, a graduate study in physics. You know, I think he does. I think he's in New

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.480
York. Does he have a PhD? Yeah, in New York. Okay, so he does have a PhD in nuclear physics. Okay,

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:21.120
good. So he's a genuine PhD in physics. And I think that he's trying to use

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.720
quantum theory, sort of quantum ideas that are foundational in what he's trying to build.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:39.680
And from my point of view, again, the high energy theoretical physicists in the last 20 years

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.720
are telling us that not only is space time doomed, quantum theory is doomed.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.320
They're saying that quantum theory will arise joined at the hip with space time.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.280
You might say, well, you know, there's all this weird stuff about quantum mechanics. There's no

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.080
cloning theorem. You can't clone quantum bits. There's superposition. There's entanglement.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:10.000
This is all weird stuff. And this is surely showing us something deeper about, you know,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.400
maybe a conscious reality beyond space time. And the answer appears that

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:26.400
from the work of Chris Fuchs on quantum Bayesianism and Robert Speckens, his toy model of quantum

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.640
physics, all those weirdnesses of quantum theory, no cloning theorem, superposition,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.840
entanglement, all that stuff, is simply a symptom of incomplete information.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:44.480
If you have incomplete information about the state of a system, those all follow as theorems.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:52.400
Well, when I say that space time is a headset, that means incomplete information. Your headset

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:58.720
is there to chop down the information. That's the whole point of an interface is too complicated

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.360
out there. So let's dumb it down. Well, so quantum mechanics and all the weirdness of quantum

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:10.640
mechanics is merely a symptom of the fact that space time is doomed. So it's not going to give us,

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.200
so quantum theory by itself is not going to take us outside space time. Quantum theory has its

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:22.560
weirdnesses because it's tied to the limits of space time. So what's different between my approach

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:29.520
and Tom's is, and by the way, most people who are trying to use some kind of modern physics

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:37.040
to do some kind of exploration of consciousness, they're tied to many of our arts. Quantum is it,

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.640
right? And I'm saying, not if you believe the high energy theoretical physicists,

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:49.440
it's not it. It's going to arise from deeper structures. And by the way, it's not a hand wave.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:57.200
So they found like the amplitude hydrant is, is the structure outside of space time. It's a real

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.720
structure is published, you can go read about it. Its volumes give you the scattering amplitudes

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.880
of real processes in space time, much easier than doing Feynman diagrams in space time.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.280
Hundreds of pages of Feynman diagrams, two or three, turn into two or three terms,

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.120
you can do by hand. And there are no Hilbert spaces to be seen anywhere in the amplitude hydrant.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.520
And therefore, there is no quantum theory. And in the physics like Neymar, Connie,

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.760
Hamed and these guys who are doing this are very, very clear. There is no quantum theory here.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.120
This is beyond space time and quantum theory. Uniterity, which is one of the key things we

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.040
can talk about Uniterity. I mean, there are some who argue that Uniterity is not essential to

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:48.480
quantum theory, but most physicists say it is. Uniterity and locality are products of this

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.400
thing, but they're not built into the thing. They, they can give it to you in the projection,

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.800
but they are, they are outside of space time, and they're outside of quantum theory.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:04.640
So, so it's, you can see that the difference, maybe at a, at some level, Tom and I are,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.680
our concepts are similar, but the spirit in which we're doing things is very, very different.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.840
I'm saying, I'm, I'm letting go of quantum theory entirely, I'm letting go of space time entirely.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.560
And I feel like Tom is still saying, let me use the tools of quantum theory and the most

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.520
advanced physics we have of, of space time to get my model of consciousness. I'm saying,

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.400
we really have to jump outside of the headset altogether.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:36.320
Yes. No, I agree with you because I found that question quite redundant in the sense that

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.560
there are clear differences in the way you guys approach it. I think where you guys do start to

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.000
sort of become similar is when it starts becoming a virtual reality and when,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.920
and when you start talking about that. But then I have another question from someone,

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.240
and this question is directed at both of us, actually,

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.480
for critique for the two of us. It says, in our last conversation on conscious agents and

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:05.520
the subatomic world, Tev, you and Don, do not define information. And this, so the person's

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.480
basically, it's a very lengthy comment goes on to say that we didn't clearly define the term

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.400
information. And since your, the work eventually goes so much into a sort of a virtual reality,

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.400
a sort of matrix simulation, information becomes a key word here. Do we, should we clarify that for

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:32.000
this listener just to make sure they understand? Right. I used Shannon information. So people

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.280
who've studied information theory, if I have, it's all about probabilities and basically,

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.120
if something has probability P, then it's minus log P is so Shannon information. Now,

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.200
I've been, when I use entropy, I'm using the standard, you know, Shannon notion of entropy

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.960
from information theory. So, so this is, I'm just using standard and

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.480
standard information theoretic stuff. I've explored

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:10.240
solace entropy. So there's, there are generalizations of Shannon entropy and some arguments for this.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.480
So I've been exploring them, but I haven't used them yet. And if I'm forced to, I may, there are

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.320
arguments for, for showing that, that the notion of entropy that's used in Shannon information

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:28.560
theory may not be as general as we need in certain cases. And there are more, and one is called solace

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:35.040
entropy, I think. So, so I am playing with that. But in my conversations with you, when I've said

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:43.440
entropy or, or, or information, it's Shannon. Okay, good. The next one is, if we're just avatars

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:52.160
within this virtual reality, what is the concept of procreation? What, what purpose does this

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.200
serve in the creation of other avatars? And does this even work inside of space time?

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:09.440
Right. So, what's, what's interesting is that from this point of view, our headset gives us

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.560
certain portals into the deep consciousness beyond. That's what the headset is for, too. So right now,

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:23.120
my Tevin icon in my headset is giving me a portal into Tevin's consciousness or that, that, that

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.800
projection of the one consciousness, the Tevin projection of the, of the one consciousness.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:34.160
So we know that our headset does give us portals into consciousness. And the question is, what

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.880
technologies might there be that we could use to create new portals into consciousness? Right.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.240
Well, we have one technology that we know, and that is having babies. That is, that's one technology

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:55.360
for opening up new portals into consciousness. So, so why would from, so there are a couple of

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:01.520
questions related to this. So why would the one consciousness use this procreation kind of approach

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:10.560
toward, toward, toward, you know, doing this? And I would say that it's, first I should say, I don't

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.720
know, but, but I'll give you some ideas. Right. Humility is, is, is required at every step of

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.320
this, right? I mean, until we have a scientific theory where we're making predictions, you know,

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:27.120
disclaimers, but at some point, I think we'll, we'll be able to reverse engineer the headset and

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.160
understand this notion of portal that I'm talking about quite precisely. We'll understand a little

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.840
bit more how procreation works in terms of booting up new, new, new portals. And we'll be able to

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.080
build artificial portals. We'll, we'll get the technology to build artificial portals to the

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.920
consciousness behind. We'll, we'll actually understand what kind of networking of conscious

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.520
agents is required to effectively bridge into our interface and toward, into our common headset.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.360
So, but, but at the top level, why is the one doing this? It goes back to what we talked about

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.320
before, which is the one is trying to, to know itself and it can only know itself by knowing

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.960
what it's not. So to keep having experiences and having an opening this up to a sort of

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.800
multiplex of different experiences overall, which goes into the other question that I have here,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:21.920
which is, did in this framework then, where dinosaurs and all sort of extinct species and

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:27.040
creatures fall into this sort of process, have these all been avatars as part of an experience

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.680
of the one? Exactly. They would be, and you might say, well, why did the, you know, the one do that

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.520
and then throw them away? And, you know, what a waste of time. And that gets the whole notion of

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:48.240
time itself is an artifact of our interface. So in our, so, so a lot of our intuitions are tied to

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:57.040
artifacts of our headset. So in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents, the dynamics

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:05.200
need not have increasing entropy. There need not be an arrow of time in the dynamics outside of

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.000
our headset. But it's a theorem that if you take this Markovian dynamics in which the entropy is

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.120
constant, it doesn't increase. And you make a projection by conditional probability. So you're

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.000
losing some information, you see the dynamics, you see a dynamical system, but it's lost some

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.680
information over the deeper dynamics. The projected dynamical system will have increasing entropy.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:36.080
And so it will have an arrow of time as not as an insight into reality. It's not an insight.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:43.680
It's entirely an artifact of the loss of information. And so, by the way,

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.960
time is the fundamental limited resource in evolution. If I don't get food in time, I die.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.320
If I don't mate in time, I die. If I don't run away from that dinosaur in time, I'll be eaten.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:04.240
So time is the fundamental limited resource. And what I'm saying is that time is an illusion.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:13.840
It's an artifact of the headset. So on the one hand, I've published papers on

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:20.720
evolutionary game theory. I love the theory of evolution. It's an incredibly powerful theory.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.400
Evolutionary game theory is beautiful. And inside the headset, there is no better theory

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:30.080
of biological organisms than evolution by natural selection. It's brilliant.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.160
That's being said. The theory itself, all of it, is an artifact of the projection.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.040
None of it is deeply true. It's only true in our headset. And for understanding dynamics in our

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.960
headset, there is no better scientific tool than evolution by natural selection. And I've used it.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:59.040
But our mathematics tells us that the whole thing is an illusion. So I should maybe stop there.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:05.120
There was a question some people asked me, which is I use evolution to show that we don't see

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.120
reality as it is. But then that means that evolution wasn't true. So how am I not shooting

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.680
myself on the foot? So if we have time at the end, we can go after why I'm not shooting myself on

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.880
the foot. So within this headset and having this headset on, can I take it off?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:36.800
I think yes. I think in the meditation process, when you literally, and myself included,

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:45.520
are not great meditators, but I do hear about people that I trust,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:53.840
that go to places where you let go of the headset for a while. You just literally let go of death,

01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:03.760
the near death experiences that people report, the Raymond Moody, I guess, and the tunnel,

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.840
the light tunnel, and life review, and that common thing. I'm not saying that that's right,

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:16.960
but it's suggestive that, and it certainly fits in with the ontology of this conscious

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:24.720
agent dynamics that I'm working on, that in some sense, everything that I perceive is just a headset,

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:32.560
and death is just taking the headset off. That's all it is. I tried that. But if you're playing

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:40.080
a virtual reality game, and you believe, and you've got an avatar in the game, so it's a first-person

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.840
perspective. If you identify with that avatar, if you really believe that that avatar is you,

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.040
you're going to be nervous and scared and everything that happens to the avatar is going

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:55.840
to be. But if you don't identify with the avatar, you can enjoy the game. And if your avatar gets

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:02.560
shot up, who cares? You just take the headset off. And so I think that it is possible, maybe in

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.840
meditation, the Hoffman hasn't done it. So I'll just tell you upfront, I've not gone there.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:14.000
I've meditated quite a bit. So maybe I'm just a spiritual flunking, who knows.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.920
Science flunking and spiritual flunking.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:27.120
But the people that I trust seem to have had those experiences. And in my own theory,

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.320
it says it's possible even though I myself haven't experienced it.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:36.960
So let's say within those kernels from the physics, from your mathematical side,

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.840
let's say you leave the headset. Would you have to first go via each pathway in order to get

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:48.000
to sort of the one? Or would you see someone else between them? I'm not sure if you understand

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.480
what I'm trying to say. A really great question. And I've really wondered about that myself,

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.600
because there are some spiritual traditions which talk about, I mean, I was some Tutu warrior in

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:05.040
my previous life or something like that. And so I've wondered if there's any way that I could

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.480
make sense of that in my framework of conscious agents. Is there some kind of, if I take the

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:16.000
network idea seriously, are there parts of the network that I could say that are sort of closer

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.960
to this particular headset, the Hoffman headset? Maybe there are other headsets that are closer

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:30.640
to that headset. And it may be possible that they're, and even though ultimately time is an

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:37.520
illusion, it could be like, we might be able to explain that illusion in terms of projections

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:44.400
of these headsets and so forth. So I can't rule out the possibility that our theory will eventually

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:54.560
take these non-precise ideas and make them mathematically precise and maybe even interesting.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:01.920
So I can't rule that out. That's very fascinating. That can be quite a rabbit hole to go down through.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.960
Do you think that, well, another thing that could lead to sort of reincarnative experiences in

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.440
general? I mean, let's say you just sort of leave that headset and maybe just enter another one

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.360
altogether. I mean, it opens up the door to sort of all those spiritual claims that let's say

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:25.840
Hindus or Buddhists sort of have. It kind of provides a scientific grounding for these beliefs in a sense.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.040
That's right. It's basically, what I was saying earlier is what you're saying is basically

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:43.680
the one looks through the headset of an amoeba and of a virus and of a bacterium and of a Hoffman

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.480
and a Tevin and every possible headset, a cat, they're all legitimate ways of the one looking at

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.480
itself and enjoying that view and then recognizing I'm not that. I'm more than that.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.760
And Don, how would you differentiate between something that's an avatar and something that

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:07.120
isn't? So like a virus, for example, we're not a lot of doctors kind of in the world. People

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:14.240
can't even agree whether it's life, living or dead. At what point is an avatar an avatar in this

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.440
framework, would you say? What is the minimal amount needed to be an avatar?

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.040
That's a great question because it really exposes an important concept here. And that is,

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.440
in this framework, the distinction between living and non-living is not principal.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.760
Just as the distinction between conscious and not conscious is not a principal distinction.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.960
The distinction that we make between living and non-living is an artifact,

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.320
entirely an artifact of the limits of our interface.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.840
Okay. It's not principal. So I'm always interacting with living consciousness.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:01.360
I'm always interacting with it. And my headset is dumbing things down because I'm not,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.040
that's what I'm doing. I'm looking at myself to a projection. So when I see a rock,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.680
it's fair enough within my headset to say it's not alive. It's perfectly fine. For everyday

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.720
practical purpose, I'm not going to try to eat the rock and so forth. I'm not going to worry about

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.880
the rock chasing me. And so for practical purposes, I can say it's not alive. But the

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.440
distinction is not principled. I'm always interacting, when I interact with a rock,

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.400
I'm interacting through a headset interface icon, namely the rock. I'm interacting with consciousness.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.920
I'm not saying the rock is conscious. So there's not panpsychism of that kind. The rock is not

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.480
conscious. The rock, like the zoom pixels, right? The zoom pixels are just zoom pixels. They're

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:48.160
not conscious or unconscious. They're just zoom pixels. The rock is just a rock. What am I interacting

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:59.280
with a living consciousness? Always. So now my interface can give me more or less information

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:06.400
about someone else's interface with other humans. Yes. I know firsthand what a human interface is

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:13.200
like. So I have some idea of what it's like to be you. And then you as a doctor, if you're

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.920
dealing with patients with psychological problems, you have some insight. Whereas if you're dealing

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.520
with a mouse, you might not trust your insights from the human experience in terms of understanding

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.200
the psychology of a mouse, right? You just don't have the insight into their headset

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.120
that you have into the human headset. Well, so when I see something that I call a virus,

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:43.280
I have some hint in my interface of something that's like alive. But my interface is giving me

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:50.960
almost no information about another interface. So interfaces have information about other

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:58.400
interfaces that are more or less complete. And so with the rock, my knowledge of interfaces

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.680
is basically gone to zero. Okay, yes. So that's just beyond that interfaces

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:11.680
access at that point. That's exactly right. That's also mine. But by the way, things that

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.200
look really stupid to us, like I see some worm crawling around, it looks like it was really

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:21.920
stupid. Hey, for all I know, what I'm interacting with there, if I could actually if I could get

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:27.280
inside and understand what it was experiencing, what it might, it might, I might just want to

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.000
fall down on my knees and worship it because it's so much smarter than me and brilliant than me.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:40.080
Again, what I can see about others is just due to the limitations of my own headset.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.800
And there what they are in themselves and what they're experiencing could possibly

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:51.360
blow me away by if I ever. So you can see this this this point of view leads to all sorts of

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:58.720
radical that took me decades to even understand what what it could mean because I'm so used

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:06.160
to thinking inside the headset. And it's very, very mind bending. It's, it's almost like sort of

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:13.440
taking the blooper at some point. And like leaving reality altogether, because there's

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:19.040
someone as people to people who firmly love science so ingrained within it. And if someone

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.040
just has to pop in right now and just shadow and watch us, I mean, they'll think we're completely

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.640
out of it. It's completely out there. And all we'll be on all you can think is that you just

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:37.920
haven't taken the blue pill yet. That's right. But what's led me down this this blue pill path

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.200
is the mathematics and the science. I've been lead kicking and screaming the whole way.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:50.000
I mean, but and so I understand when when anybody has an objection, I completely understand I had

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.040
that objection. And the only reason I'm saying what I'm saying is that I had to go with the science.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.920
It's just plain the fact that our best science tells us this space time isn't fundamental.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.800
And when you wrap your head around that space time and objects in space time are not fundamental.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.080
That's what our best science when you that is the start of the rabbit hole and that's not

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.600
an LSD induced rabbit hole. That is a scientific based rabbit hole. And I've been chasing the

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.920
mathematics and going wherever. And that's what you have to do as a scientist, you have to be

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:29.040
intrepid and be willing to let go of Flat Earth, be willing to let go of Newton, be willing to

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.040
let go of Einstein, we'd be willing to let go of quantum mechanics and be willing to let go of

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:40.480
space time. You've got to be willing to let go of all of it and go into it. Yeah. At what point

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.520
you mentioned that the the one, I mean, you spoke about this earlier. And I think we should

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.040
have at some point get round back to that and just touch on it more because it seems like quite

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.320
some fun work that's happening at this very moment. But you mentioned that at that point,

01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:00.720
you and Bernardo just diverge a little. What at which point exactly does it happen? Why is it

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:07.840
that your version of the one in this trace chain is something that would make you two guys clash

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.720
in your views? Well,

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.680
I'm not sure that we would clash too much, but I'll say where we might have some

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:23.520
differences. And again, you know, Bernardo's brilliant and a good friend. And if there's

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.760
something where we differ philosophically, I defer to him because he's a real philosopher,

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:36.880
I'm not so right. But Bernardo has recently been saying that there is a way of interpreting

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.000
integrated information theory that would be compatible with analytic idealism.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.720
And I'll look forward to having a conversation with Bernardo about this because, you know,

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.560
he's brilliant. And so I'll probably stand corrected with what I'm about to say. But it

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.200
seems to me that that integrated information theory

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.680
does assume that there's a substrate and they're very explicit. I mean, one of their

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:16.320
in the four their IIT 4.0 paper. I mean, I looked and substrate is mentioned dozens and dozens of

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.200
times and not just, you know, it's not a minor thing. Substrate is is front and center.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:27.920
Now, if I gave you a theory of space time, and I said, but there's a substrate

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:35.680
to say space time, then then I would assume from that that you're saying that space time

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:42.080
isn't fundamental because there's a substrate to it. Right. So if I if space time is fundamental,

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.360
then I'll just talk about space time. I don't need to talk about anything deeper than that,

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.960
no substrate to it. So if I'm talking about a theory of consciousness,

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.600
and I want to say consciousness is fundamental, well, then I don't need to really be talking

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.760
about any substrates. I mean, consciousness is the final substrate in that theory. So so this

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.640
is what I would like to talk with Bernardo about. And I'm sure I'm sure he'll have some something

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.640
that will, you know, make me think deep. But so I'm so so with all, you know, he's a good friend

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.240
and he's brilliant. So I'll be interested to do it. But my attitude right now is

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:24.160
a theory of consciousness that's scientific and in the spirit of analytic idealism

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.800
doesn't need any substrate for the consciousness. You just posit

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.880
the nature of that consciousness and know you don't posit any substrate. And you don't need to posit

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.400
some combinatorial properties of that substrate, like integrated information,

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.080
causal properties of that substrate that quantify how much consciousness there is.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.920
Consciousness is consciousness. You don't quantify this. You can quantify how much

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.000
access you might have to the consciousness through a particular headset. But consciousness

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.960
itself is just consciousness. It is fundamental. And so so to so in IIT, there's always this thing

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.160
we talked about earlier that these circuits, there is no consciousness in them and these

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.080
brain circuits and these circuits, maybe they do have consciousness. The whole thing

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.880
of assigning consciousness to substrates, neural substrates in this case, is wrong headed.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:33.840
It is just completely wrong. So so that's where again, I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot when

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.240
I talk with Bernardo about this. I really just learned about his views in the last couple,

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.400
three, last month or so on this. So that's why I've had a chance to really talk with him.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.720
It also called me by storm because I'm scheduled to chat to him, I think,

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:55.520
in a month's time. And we spoke about a few months ago. And when we spoke, I had no idea that he

01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:02.240
would, that I also had no clue that he would go down there either. It was quite strange to me as

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:07.040
well. And I'm curious and I'm keen to ask him as well. Yeah, I'm going to ask, I'll ask him as

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.440
well. And I'm sure he'll have something really good to say. And I'll try to push back on this.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.240
You don't need a substrate and see what it says. I'll try the same. And I'll also let him, if I

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:23.120
speak to him first, I'll let him know without causing any sort of debate. But Bernardo loves

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.800
to debate, by the way, he prefers when when someone actively debates in a respectful manner, though.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.800
As long as it's respectful, he loves, he loves the debate. He enjoys it. He actually told me

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.680
the last time, please actually be more, more stern and strict with the questions.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.640
But well, I like sharp discussion in the sense that it's intellectually on point and deep.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.000
Having it be personal, I don't, I'm not interested in having it be personal at all.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.680
Me neither. I told him that I'm just trying to just be nice and relaxed for the podcast.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.560
I just try and make it a nice calm environment.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:06.000
But I'm Bernardo, I'll just say that he's brilliant mathematically. And I've asked him to

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.320
join us and work on the mathematical side of this. And I want to do that. I would love to get

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.760
Bernardo because he's got the mathematical chops to actually work with us on the third

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.640
conscious agents and show analytical idealism through the through the math of conscious agents.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.920
But I mean, yeah, I mean, to get a PhD in engineering and philosophy, you must,

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.960
know your stuff. There must be something going on there that you're able to kind of bring these

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.200
two fields together and give you and give people quite a unique perspective, at least

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.400
on reality. Yeah, I think he's very busy with the essential foundation. So I see them doing

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.920
quite a lot of work lately. So probably just like you, probably a lot of on your plates

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:52.400
done in this virtual reality, in this reality, is there anything you want to call it, by the way?

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.600
Do you prefer calling it the virtual reality? What do you prefer calling it?

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:04.800
I think headset is the easiest for most people. So it's just a headset. I say that because

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:10.800
it's everybody can sort of relate to that. Okay, within this headset, how does this headset account

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.240
for, I mean, we know time now based on this is an illusion. But then how do we count for the

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:22.720
beginning, let's say, let's say the big bang within this headset. How is that conceptualized

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:28.800
within this framework? Well, so the time itself of the big bang is an illusion.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.360
So what we have is a Markov dynamics in which the entropy is not increasing.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:41.760
Then we say, so we have this big Markov chain, there is no time. But now let's look at it from

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.880
a perspective. Let's do a trace chain. So I talked about, we started off talking about,

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.320
so let's take a big chain. Let's do a trace chain. Well, we've lost information.

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:57.680
Well, so now we're going to induce an arrow of time. And it's going to look,

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.200
depending on which trace chain you use, it might look like the big bang, and then

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:08.480
lifeless evolution of galaxies and stars and so forth, and then life and then consciousness

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:14.720
might look like that. But that's the entire story is an artifact of the projection and

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:22.000
is not a deep insight. It's fascinating because me trying to ask you what happened

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.160
before the big bang is kind of like me asking you what happened before the one.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.160
Is that something you're even thinking about at any point?

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:41.520
Well, absolutely. And by the way, I should say that what I was, the answer I just gave about

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:48.480
the projection and big bang just being an artifact, I actually want to actually do that.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:53.600
I want to actually write down a big Markovian kernel in which the entropy is not increasing.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.000
Choose a projection and then show, wow, when I look at it through this projection,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.520
look at that. I do get this weird thing seem to be evolving and growing. In other words,

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:12.400
this is not a hand wave. I am proposing computational model. There is a Markov dynamics

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.320
beyond space time in which the entropy is not increasing. Take any projection of it

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.880
where by conditional probability, you know, like trace chains or something like that,

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:30.640
the entropy will be increasing. Study those. Study all the different ways that that can happen.

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.320
Our universe with the big bang will just be one of the possible kinds of ways in the universe.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:40.320
So in other words, we can study cosmology from this point of view. We understand, you know,

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:46.720
right now, if you take space time as fundamental, then the notion of the big bang and the singularity

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:54.560
is an unsolvable problem. What do you do with it? But if you realize, no, no, that's just a

01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:00.240
headset projection of a deeper thing in which there is no singularity. I've erased the singularity.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:05.520
That's what this mathematics is. I've erased the singularity and showed you, you get the singularity

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.640
because of a projection, not because of the deeper, the truth of the deeper reality. So this is not,

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:15.040
so I don't want people to think. It might have sounded like it was just a hand wave. No, I'm

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:22.720
offering a technical computational program. Exactly. I mean, that's, I mean, that's the

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:30.560
biggest difference between a lot of other idealist theorists is that you're using computational,

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.360
I mean, you're using mathematics and physics, you know, in a very precise manner to try and

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.280
show people what you're talking about. I mean, conscious agents in the subatomic world,

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:45.200
you came with that very strategic knowing that this is the core layer of reality,

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.800
according to us and the way we perceive it. And that's why you guys want to touch that

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.120
base reality. And you said you don't want to go straight for the neuron because that

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.200
that is a bit, it's a lot harder. There's a lot, there's probably a lot more

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.360
that's going to have to go into that. Do you have a sort of a hierarchy of what you

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:06.720
think you want to go after from the subatomic world? I mean, we just mentioned going into

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.440
cosmology at some point, anything in particular that you're kind of taking these maths into at

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:22.880
some point, or spearheading into the future? Yes, right now, what I'm working on is a specific

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:29.440
technical problem, which is we've mapped a Markov dynamics into decorated permutations.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:38.240
Physicists have mapped decorated permutations of positive gross monions into scattering amplitudes.

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:45.200
So I want to tie that whole thing together. So what I'm working on right now is interfacing

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.840
our decorated permutations with the decorated permutations and the gross monions of the

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:56.400
physicists. I've got to get that map absolutely precise. So and I've been working on that and I

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:03.120
gave two proposals to my colleagues in the last three weeks, and they're both wrong,

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.600
but they're both a piece of the puzzle. But I put them out, I thought, no, no, it's wrong.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.920
So I'm realizing I have to dig deeper. I'm going to have to really study these positive

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.360
gross monions more deeply and write down a more serious. So that's what I'm working on right

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:27.520
now is because I then want to be able to, once we have that, then we can do our computational

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:37.440
experiment about quarks and gluons. We have to show how we can go all the way from the dynamics

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.240
of conscious agents through the decorated permutations to scattering amplitudes and properties

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.480
of particles. So that's why I'm focused on this technical issue right now. Markov decorated

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:55.920
permutations mapping to gross monion decorated permutations. Clean technical problem. And I'm

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.920
working on it. And I'm not a mathematician, so I'm having to learn about positive gross monions,

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:05.280
and I'm just learning as I go. But but I'm motivated. So that's what I'm going after now.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.840
But then my guess is I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and I would love to be going after the brain,

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.560
but the brain is, I don't know, 10 to the 50th or 10 to the 60th quarks and gluons,

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.000
whatever. Maybe I should start with two or three quarks and gluons,

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:27.840
you know, and work there and then and then work up to, you know, protons and protons,

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:33.680
electrons or so, do the nucleus and atom and then maybe some simple molecules.

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.840
Then maybe by the time we get to molecules, maybe we'll know enough to actually know, for example,

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:47.840
about neurotransmitters. What does a neurotransmitter mean in terms of the

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.120
dynamics of conscious agents? But ultimately, we'll have to get then to, you know,

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:58.240
axons and neurons and synapses and

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:06.480
and you can see we have a we have to reverse. So the problem is we have to reverse engineer

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:13.760
a headset. So neuroscience is far harder than we thought. We thought that we look inside

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.560
through microscopes and we see billions of neurons and trillions of synapses.

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.760
And that's really complicated. And we think that that's the truth. No, no, no, that's a thin

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:30.640
veneer on the complex, the true complexity is far, far greater. Let me give you just a taste

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:39.440
of the complexity. If I have a conscious agent that has just 10 color experiences,

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.880
I'll say 50 color experiences, 50 color experiences.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.680
You can actually, you can perceive six million or seven million different color,

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.520
you can discriminate six or seven million. So this is trivial. 50 colors is nothing

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.840
compared to what you can do. In our theory of conscious agents, the set of

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.280
possible Markov chains for consciousness is dealing with just 50 colors is the Markov polytope

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.160
on 50 states. Okay, so it's called a Markov polytope in 50 states. And this is a polytope,

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:21.440
it's a geometric object that we have to study to understand all the dynamics of consciousness.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.480
And it has little vertices on it, like a diamond, it's got little points on it, right?

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:31.760
It's got facets and edges and points. You know how many points this, with only 50 colors,

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:40.000
you know how many points this geometric object has? It has 10,000 times more points than the

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.440
number of particles in the known visible universe. That's incredible. That's only for 50. So I'm

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.440
going to need a bigger computer to simulate this stuff. So consciousness, so we thought that the

01:38:53.520 --> 01:39:00.880
brain was complicated. It's trivial compared to when we when we let go of the head to see the

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:06.560
headset was there to really dumb things down. And it succeeded. It really dumb things down. We

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:13.600
thought we were seeing truth that in all of its glory. We got the really dumb down cheap version.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.960
As soon as we start little steps outside of our little space time headset,

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:23.440
holy smoke, the thing just blows wide open. Consciousness is unbelievably complicated.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.640
And I'm going to need a new desktop computer. And I think the worst part about it is that

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.400
even as you go on, because I mean, the irony is that you'll probably need quantum computers to

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:42.160
try and help you prove that you can go beyond quantum, which is funny. But I think that makes

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.400
it even worse is that you have people like Mike Levin, who are even showing you that you don't

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.840
have to even go to a neuron to show people what intelligence or a possible mind even is in that

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.400
sense. I mean, he's blurring the lines completely with his work. His bioelectric fields are truly

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:05.280
stunning. It's amazing. His work is so brilliant. I've enjoyed talking with him. I have a couple

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.480
podcasts with Mike. And now you you're lifting this position where these bioelectric networks

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:16.960
also have to sort of some at some point be explained now. Absolutely. And he's leaving

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:23.520
you with much harder tasks, I would say. That one sounds like a little very fun task to understand

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:30.320
the bioelectric fields and how they would arise as an interface projection of dynamics of conscious

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:37.040
agent networks, right? So, so absolutely, this is, it's going to be fun to reverse engineer

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.960
our heads, our space time headset and why electric fields will be part of it, neurons will be part

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:51.520
of it, DNA, all all of that. So, all in some sense, science is just now taking off the headset. In

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.880
some sense, we're just now beginning the real task of science. Right now, we just polished the tools

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.040
on our little headset. We thought we were seeing the truth. No, we were just sharpening our tools.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.560
Now it's time to take the headset off and really get to work on what's beyond.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.880
It's pretty exciting. Yeah, it's almost like a post realism. It's a, there's going to be some

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.000
term for it. Post realism, there's going to be something where people are now moving beyond

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.880
this headset, if they're going to try and figure out reality in this way. Something, sorry.

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:28.080
Or maybe it'll be pro realism in the sense that we thought that the headset is not the real thing.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.640
That's just a that's just a headset. Now we're getting into the realism. But but but even but see,

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:40.080
but our discussion on the limits of scientific theories means that even though I'm saying we're

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.520
going outside the headset and science is really just beginning, still, scientific theories will

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.560
never be a theory of everything. Humility is going to be required at every step because yeah,

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.480
we're stepping outside the headset. But effectively, we've just moved to a bigger

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.680
projection of the one. All we can never deal with are bigger and bigger projections of the one.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:08.000
And no matter how big our projections are, they will be literally measure zero of the one.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.120
So it is required. I'm glad you brought I'm glad you brought it back to that because I wanted

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.560
to ask you, I mean, you started off by talking about the stress chain, figuring out the one and

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:24.880
this new information. If you can just try and sort of conceptualize this, what you think this is

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:31.440
the one, what what type of is there any way for you to wrap your head around this? Do you think you

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:41.440
can? In a way, I think we all can in the in the following sense, if it's true that you are the one

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:50.640
experience itself through a headset. And the reason that you don't feel that is because

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:57.120
you're in with both feet on the headset, you really believe that you are the avatar in the headset.

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.840
And that's part of the whole game. I mean, the part of the whole game is to completely for the

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:08.320
one to completely lose itself in the headset and to slowly wake up. If I don't really believe it

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.800
for a while, it's not going to be real for me to say I'm not that because I never really took

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:20.160
it seriously. So I need to take it seriously and then let go. So I think it is possible

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:29.360
even while we're still having these avatars in the headset through meditation to let go.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.480
But to the mind, so this is now where it starts to sort of go with what spiritual traditions

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:45.360
some have said, and that is that the truth can't be understood by the mind. So no words are

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:51.520
adequate. No scientific theory is adequate. But you have another access to that realm.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:58.560
That's not a conceptual access. It's direct. You are that infinite intelligence. That's what you are.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:09.920
And any concept that you have of yourself is only a projection necessarily. So the only way

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:17.520
to answer your question is to, of course, I do my science, but to answer your question,

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.800
to really go deep, I have to let go of all of my concepts, including all of my scientific theories

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:33.920
completely. No thoughts at all. So literally a space of no thoughts, no conceptions,

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:41.760
and just aware of aware, awareness of awareness. And then I think that's where you then

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:47.600
begin to know yourself, not as you know an external object, but you know yourself directly.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:53.520
And my guess is that that goes infinitely deep. In other words, if you do that for five minutes,

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:02.640
you experienced that for five minutes, you've not scratched the surface yet. Try it for 500 years,

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:10.560
you've not scratched the surface yet. That's how deep you go. So that, so somehow the deep answer

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.160
to your question is on the one hand, we know the one by looking at this projection and doing all of

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:22.400
our science. And we know the one by doing that really, really carefully and then saying, I transcend

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:29.120
it. I'm not that I'm that is a lower limit on my capabilities. And I that's not that's not the

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:36.320
limit of who I am. Then we could go beyond that by letting go of all thoughts and just being the

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:42.960
awareness of awareness. And that goes infinitely deep. And so you can know it directly. But the

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.440
mind will say, because there's no concepts for the mind to deal with. So the intellectual mind

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:57.600
will say that's there's nothing there. But frankly, my own experience is that if I want new ideas

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.520
to do my science, I need to go into the space where I let go of all concepts, I need to actually tap

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:09.120
into that infinite intelligence and just be in absolute interior science. That's where all the

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.040
good ideas come from. Then you bring them back in. So so the mind really isn't I mean, it has this

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:20.560
all little limited intelligence and you can do you can do mathematical computations and so forth.

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.760
But if you want deep insights, you got to let go of the mind. Yeah, so we so we are one infinite

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:34.000
intelligence. Yes. Well, when sorry, then I'm not sure if I haven't really picked up on you

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.120
saying this much. But when did you start calling it the one?

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:47.760
I was into Federico Fajin. So Federico is a good friend and

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:56.640
really, he's a wonderful man. And he helped support this research for and he talked about

01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:02.160
the one he didn't give a mathematical model of the one. And of course, you can't. But he talked

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:08.800
about the one and and I you know, at first, I didn't use the term, but then I realized that

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:15.280
my mathematics was pointing me toward the idea that there was going to be not just a network

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.680
of separate consciousnesses, but I was going to have to recognize that, you know, they can combine

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:27.120
and ultimately, there's there's some notion of one. And so I decided that that was sort of the

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:35.200
least tendentious word that I could use. And but I don't think right now that I have a mathematical

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:39.520
model of the one, I have a mathematical model of projection of the one in terms of conscious

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:47.280
agent networks. So so that's why I started using the term the one and maybe the last few years

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.240
after they are sort of filtered in when I started thinking more and more about the deeper

01:47:52.880 --> 01:48:00.480
structure of this network of conscious agents. So do you think the there is so the ultimate purpose

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:08.240
at this point, then is the one the one sort of experiencing while having multiple experiences

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:15.680
via us, the avatars in this infinite sort of some essence beyond space time.

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.640
That's right. Enjoying those experiences and then learning what it is by by learning that

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.840
no matter how exotic and impressive those experiences are, they're trivial compared to

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:34.720
what the one is. Yeah. And then do you think done with that in mind, if you take certain

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.920
other theories that are physicalist like the malt walnut, they go a bit beyond that when they

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:48.000
think about a multiverse, what would a multiverse in this context to be the others? And maybe there's

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.400
one in this universe, and then there are others, you know, sort of other universes. Do you think?

01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.360
Well, good. So there is, of course, a technical meaning of multiverse, you know,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.280
that some physicists have, and also many worlds, there's different kind of technical thing there.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:17.760
But one, just at a top level, one could say the idea that I have a multiple headsets could be

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:25.280
sort of like multiple universes, multiple multiverse kind of thing, possibly. But

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.360
when you get real technical about it, I mean, like Max Tagmark has, you know, his level four

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:38.880
multiverse, which he, so it's different now from what I just said, right? Because I was saying we

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.120
could think informally about all these multiverses being just different headsets, and there's an

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.720
infinite variety of them. So that's top level connection to your idea. But getting down more

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:53.520
to brass tacks, like what real physicists are using multiverse for, like one concrete example

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:59.040
is Max Tagmark at MIT, his level four multiverse, he's saying that mathematics is fundamental

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:05.440
reality. Okay, so the fundamental nature of reality is entirely mathematical. And there's

01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.240
an infinite variety of possible mathematics. And so there's an infinite variety of mathematical

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:20.640
universes. And so he, and I agree that there's mathematics is endless. It's infinite. But I

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:26.880
don't think that mathematics, you know, of course, I think Tagmark is brilliant. And, you know,

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:34.480
in this realm, I would probably be set straight by him. But anyway, here's my idea as it is,

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.640
that when it comes to the nature of reality consciousness, what is the relation between

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:48.880
mathematics and consciousness? My feeling is that mathematics isn't the whole thing.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:54.800
That the consciousness, the living, put it this way, the living organism of consciousness

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.520
has mathematics is like the bones. But the bones are just the bones, they're not the whole

01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:04.880
living organism. And they're, they're essential. Mathematics, I think is essential, but it's not

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:14.400
the whole of the living organism of consciousness. So that's sort of my feeling about how my views

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:22.400
fit with like multiverse kinds of it. It's fascinating to me how it's becoming so poetic

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.200
over time. I mean, the more you're obviously talking about this so much more lately, and you're

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.000
trying to get people to understand it, and it's, it's starting to slowly develop its own sort of

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.560
moral practical significance as you have to hold on it and apply it. Did you ever foresee yourself

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:48.800
becoming someone who will sound so spiritual, almost guru like in your life? No, I mean,

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:54.480
it's, it's sort of, I've been pushed kicking and screaming. I can tell it was kind of thing by,

01:51:54.480 --> 01:52:00.320
by the mathematics. And, but on the other hand, you know, at some point, it's time to quit kicking

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:06.320
and screaming and just say, Hey, this is what the next step in, I mean, physics is telling us

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:13.280
the space time is over. And quantum theory is not fundamental. So get over it, move on. And so

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:19.600
physicalism is dead. Okay, get over it. You know, it's time to get over it. And now on the other

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.280
hand, you might say, am I jumping in full, you know, with both feet to spiritual traditions and

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:31.360
just buying what they say? Absolutely not. I'm having respectful conversations. So I listen

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:38.560
respectfully and carefully. And I treat what I hear from spiritual traditions the way I treat

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:44.240
what I hear from scientists, scientists, I listen respectfully with a big grain of salt

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:52.000
in science and in spirituality, that there is nonsense in both realms, and there is deep wisdom

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.320
in both realms. And it's up to us to take what looks good, turn it into so spiritual traditions,

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:04.560
I think have a lot of insights. And there's clearly not nonsense. I mean, they're famous for

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:09.520
wars that kill each other for for thousands of years. So so they have deep insights, and there's

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:17.040
deep dysfunction. And the issue is to understand which is which, and to, and maybe for example,

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:21.200
and maybe that many of the spiritual traditions traditions themselves are very deeply

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.880
onto something. But the practitioners don't understand, and they're the ones that are doing

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:30.880
the killing, right? It's not that it's not the philosophy or it's not the insights that the

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:36.320
gurus have had, it's the misuse of them by the followers that that's the problem. So we have

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:42.560
to be very, very careful. And don't dismiss the philosophy based because some some followers

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:49.760
start doing some nasty things. So so there's pitfalls everywhere. So so as a scientist, what I

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:58.960
want to do is to listen respectfully to the ideas, then look for mathematically precise statements

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:04.960
of the ideas, ones that look interesting, right? And then turn them into testable theories.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:14.640
Ultimately, spiritual traditions tell us that their words are just pointers, right? Like the

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:20.160
Tao De Ching, the very first sentence in the Tao De Ching says, the Tao that can be spoken

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:27.200
is not the true Tao. Once you understand that, then you can go ahead and read the rest of it

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:32.400
because now you understand that everything that's said is not the truth. It's not to be taken

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:39.920
dogmatically. It's to be taken as a pointer for you to explore for yourself. So it's not about,

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:45.360
so you better say it exactly this way, or you go to hell. No, no, no, no, no, these are all pointers.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.840
Take them in the spirit of pointers, you you have to explore for yourself. So so the spiritual

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:58.960
traditions have said that. But wouldn't it be nice to have pointers that tell you their own limits,

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:06.720
right? And that's what science gives you. Space time. It's mathematically precise. And you know

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.760
what? It falls apart at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. We can tell you where that pointer

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.680
falls apart. This is the antidote to dogmatism. So what I would love to see

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:25.120
is that the precision that we've gotten in science is brought over to spirituality so that we now

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.040
can have pointers in the spiritual traditions that are that are that are evolving. It's nothing

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:35.680
to boast about that I'm using the same pointers that they used 3000 years ago. I wouldn't brag

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:41.600
about that. I would say that's a problem. I mean, we would like to have this thing evolving and get

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:48.640
better pointers and pointers that in themselves tell you the limit, the scope of the pointer,

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.280
how it's going to be useful to you and the limit of the pointer so that we then fight over the

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:58.320
pointers and kill each other over the pointers. You don't believe my pointer. Well, you go to

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.720
hell or that kind of thing. I mean, this is this has been such a fascinating conversation because

01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.960
I mean, it's different from the first two in the first one, we went into a lot of detail

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:14.160
all the theories second one, we went into a paper directly. As I said, I tried to make this one as

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:22.800
practical or almost a moral philosophy aspect of all of us. And I mean, you even you're brave enough

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.720
at this point clearly from all the work you've done to even mention the word the L word. I mean,

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:31.040
the love word in science people, you know how some scientists get when you say that.

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.840
Just talk to me about this bigger picture meaning and how people can take all this

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.040
information because now we've got two podcast episodes they can look at. They've got all the

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.240
others you mentioned as well. You speaking to Tom, you speaking to Bernardo, everything else.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.720
How can they bring all of this information together and and fulfill this purpose of the one

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:57.680
or make it a more let's say a better process for all of us together?

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:05.200
Right. Well, I think that one way to think about what's happening with humanity is

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:14.400
part of humanity for thousands of years has said, this is just a headset, the spiritual part.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.560
They said, you know, the space of time is not fundamental consciousness is fundamental,

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:24.320
but but but they've said that with only the tools of natural language.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:32.000
They've not had mathematics. There's another group of people who have been saying, no, no,

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.760
the headsets, everything there is the physicalists, right? This is this is it.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:41.600
And we're and but they develop these mathematical tools and careful experiments and

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:48.160
they gave us the technology. So we have one group, but then within the group that's developed

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:54.720
all this technology and and all the mathematical stuff. And all of a sudden, their own theories

01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:00.480
came back just in the last couple of decades and slapped them in the face and said, wake up,

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.480
space time is just a headset. And it's a cheap headset. It falls apart at 10 to the

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:11.440
minus three centimeters. So so so now scientists, very few right now, but but some,

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:16.320
you know, I think more as we really understand the slap in the face that space time is doomed.

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.360
A lot of scientists are going to be waking up going, well, we need to.

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.360
Okay, we have to go outside of space time. It's this big group of people that are already out

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:28.880
there. They're saying, well, welcome, late comers. We've been here for a long time.

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:35.120
They've done a lot of exploring there, but they don't have the tools

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:40.800
that science has. So there are two groups that have half of the puzzle.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:46.560
This one group has a big part of the puzzle. They've been doing meditation and they have

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:52.320
informal descriptions. This group is just coming late to the party, but they have incredible tools

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:58.480
and precision and experiments. Let's get the two together. And let's

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:07.760
spirituality and science are just two aspects of human exploration. It's all human exploration

01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:12.480
and understanding who we are. They're not separate. We've assumed that they're separate.

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:17.040
There's been this division, especially since Galileo, you know, his house imprisonment

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:24.560
by the Catholic church, right? There has been this huge division. It's time for us to grow up

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:30.960
and bring the two halves together. It's going to be painful. Any marriage like this is going to

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:38.800
be painful because there's dogmas. I think the spiritual gurus don't have dogmas,

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:45.040
but the followers do. Many followers of spiritual traditions get tied up in the

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.120
pointer saying, that pointer is the truth. This pointer is the truth. No, no, it's just

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.120
the pointer to the moon is not the moon. The Buddhists will say it's just a pointer. It's not

01:59:53.120 --> 02:00:00.720
the moon. But the many followers just don't get it. And that's just human nature. So it'll be

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:05.280
painful on both sides because scientists are going to have to let go of physicalism.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:13.120
And for most scientists to let go of physicalism is to not be a scientist. But science is not

02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:19.040
a particular theory, namely space time. It's not a theory. Science is a

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:28.960
method of careful experiments and careful theory building and testing and a cycle

02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:34.160
of experiment and theory. That's what science is. Physicalism is one theory that was helpful

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:39.680
for several centuries and has outlived its usefulness. It's time to let go of that. And you

02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:45.280
don't let go of science by letting go of physicalism. In fact, if you don't let go of physicalism,

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:50.960
then you do let go of science because you refuse to go where the science is telling

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:59.120
you to go. You've got to go beyond space time. So it's painful because something that we've

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:05.920
both sides have deeply believed will turn out to be deeply false. And other things

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.760
will turn out to be true. And we'll have to pick what are the true things or I wouldn't say true.

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.160
The next useful steps, ultimately the truth is just you without any concepts. That's just the

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:24.960
only truth I can talk to as you without any concepts about it. But in our efforts as human

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:30.960
beings to put together pointers on the spiritual side and on the science side, the two can work

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:36.720
together. And so that's to integrate what we've been talking about. I would say that that's the

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:47.360
top level picture. Let's have respectful but not credulous. So not stupid, but respectful

02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:52.720
conversation and to find what are the good insights from both sides and what are the stupid

02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:58.960
things from both sides and bring the good insights together and have a scientific spirituality

02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:05.120
that's rigorous and human. Yeah, now I completely agree. I've always thought that as well. I mean

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.480
East meets West almost in Yang and Yang. You have to sort of bring these concepts together

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.840
because there's so much different types of knowledge and bodies of knowledge that

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:21.360
even the general Western sciences did not understand a lot of Eastern science or Asian

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:25.920
philosophy, African philosophy. There's a lot to it that a lot of them just have never had

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:34.400
access to and don't get, but found things to say. I agree with you. I agree. And I think that

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:41.680
in the dialogue, the informal natural language descriptions of these traditions

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:49.120
can be translated into mathematics. And at that point, then we can start to get the real power

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:56.640
of the ideas. I like to use the example of Einstein when he's developed the theory of

02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.200
general relativity. The big idea came like in 1907 where he realized that if I was

02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:07.120
in an elevator standing on a weighing scale and the cord of the elevator was cut and this went

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:10.800
into free-fraw, all of a sudden I would weigh nothing on the scale. I would weigh nothing.

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:15.520
That was his big insight that led to general relativity, but it took him years and he was

02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.400
Einstein, so he was brilliant. It took him years to turn that into mathematics. But when he turned

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:28.320
it into mathematics, a year later or a few months later, Schwartzschild, some German soldier,

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.000
actually, but brilliant, solved his equations and proved that there were black holes. Well,

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.040
Einstein had no idea that his equations would lead to black holes. He didn't like it. He didn't

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:48.720
believe in black holes. So what happens is your theories become smarter than the person who wrote

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:55.040
them down. You become a student of your own theory, even if you're an Einstein. You're not smart enough

02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:00.640
to know everything that your theory is going to teach you. So that's what's going to happen with

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:06.880
spirituality does not have that yet. They don't have the benefit of taking the ideas, making them

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:14.640
so precise that you can become students of those ideas where even the teacher who wrote them down

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.960
doesn't know all the implications and has to become humble before their own mathematics

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:29.360
and let it teach them. When spirituality gets to that point, sign me up. I'm really interested.

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:36.720
Well, sign me up too, Don. I'm also keen to go on that journey as well. It's been another

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:42.000
pleasure for me. It's been such an amazing journey. Chatting to you is always so much fun

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.120
and I still can't wait for us to have many more along the way. Anything on your mind? Anything

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:55.440
else you want to say? One thing I'd like to say, and that is one question that people always bring

02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:03.200
up is you use the theory of evolution to show that we don't see the truth. We don't see

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.640
reality as it is, but then that means that evolution isn't true and so you shot yourself

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:17.040
in the foot. So I should address that just briefly. The idea is this. This is the way

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:24.240
science progresses. This is nothing special about me. This is the way you put down a scientific

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:31.600
theory and you make it mathematically precise. When you do that, then the mathematics tells you

02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:38.880
what the theory can do, but it also tells you where the theory ends. Einstein's theory ends at 10 to

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:46.560
the minus 33 centimeters. Well, I'm not doing anything weird or special. This is just the way

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:51.760
science works. You take the mathematics of the theory and you ask the mathematics what's the

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:56.000
limit of this theory and the mathematics comes back and says, here's the limit, 10 to the minus

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.000
33 centimeters. Well, in the case of evolution, it also says the same thing. The limit is the very

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.680
assumption of space time and objects in space, organisms in space time competing for resources

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:17.200
in space time. That ain't true. In Einstein's case, the mathematics comes back and says,

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:23.200
space time, that ain't it. It's not fundamental. In fact, it falls apart at 10 to the minus 33.

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:29.200
You're going to need to find a structure outside of space time. Evolution is saying the same thing.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.600
So we're not shooting ourselves in the foot. You have to understand this is the way

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:42.000
science progresses. The mathematics doesn't prove that the assumptions are right. The

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:50.640
mathematics tells you the limits of the assumptions. So it's not a minor point.

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:56.640
So it's how science progresses. It's almost like going back to the old way of thinking like

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:03.280
falsification in a sense. It's kind of you're looking for that sort of that cap, that end point,

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:09.680
where it does end. Well, and in fact, if you think about it, that's what scientists should

02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:14.080
be looking for all the time is like, we know that this is not the theory of everything, right?

02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:20.080
We know it. If I can write it down, it's not the theory of everything. So do I want to be

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:29.600
an idiot? Or do I want to be the explorer? So let me be the explorer. Where's the limit? So let's

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:33.600
find as soon as possible what the limits of this theory are and then go to the next one and then

02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:40.720
explore its limits. That's fun. It's boring to just get stuck in the same paradigm the whole time.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:45.680
And I would say one short thing too. And this question always comes up.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.840
Alright, take your time done. I've got time. Don't worry.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:55.200
Okay. I won't perseverate though. Just one last thing. A lot of people will say,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:07.360
look, you're saying that the moon is just an object in my headset, and it doesn't exist

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:13.360
when no one looks. And you create it when you look. Give me a break. Everybody goes,

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:22.800
give me a break. So suppose I take, I don't know, an apple and I stick it in the ground

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:29.360
and leave it there for five weeks. And then you come and dig it up. You're going to find a rotten

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:35.760
apple. Well, doesn't that prove that the apple was there the whole time? And it existed even

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:43.200
when you weren't looking, right? And rot was going on when you weren't looking. And so this whole

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:50.800
nonsense. Well, and all I can say is if you, questions like that one, and there are many,

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:59.520
many, I get dozens of questions all the time. Right. In all those questions, the way to answer

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.880
it for yourself is to just put it into virtual reality. So imagine you're playing a virtual

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.320
reality game, a multiplayer virtual reality game, and try to put your question into that realm.

02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:18.240
And then you'll see how it works. So for example, I'm playing multiplayer tennis.

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:26.160
And I hit the tennis ball to my partner over on the other side. And I say, you know,

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:32.720
the tennis ball only exists when I look. It's just pixels in my headset. And the other guy says,

02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:39.440
oh, no, no, no. The tennis ball is real. So, and he takes, so both guys are in virtual reality.

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:42.640
He takes the tennis ball and he drops it and looks away. I can't see it. But Don,

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.080
can you see the tennis ball? And I say, yeah, I can see it. So that proves it really exists.

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:52.320
No, I just doesn't prove that I turned my head and I'm rendering it because I'm looking at it.

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:58.720
So it doesn't exist. Well, well, then he says, well, but when I hit the tennis ball to you,

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.600
you hit the same tennis ball back to me. So it proves that there's just one. No, no,

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:06.640
I have a tennis ball that I'm experiencing in my headset. You have a tennis ball that you're

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:12.640
experiencing your headset. So all the questions that people have before you, before you write me

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:18.400
an email about it. First, try it out yourself. See if you can solve the problem yourself by

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:25.520
putting it into virtual reality, a multiplayer game, and see if you, here's the key, here's the

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:29.680
key idea. There is something that exists independent of what you see in your headset.

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.320
There is something in that analogy, it's some supercomputer that's coordinating the game.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.720
But there's no tennis ball in that supercomputer. There's nothing green or fuzzy

02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:43.600
or round in that. So there is something that exists independent of you, but it's utterly

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.000
unlike anything that you see or experience, utterly unlike that. That's the only thing you

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.680
have to wrap. Once you wrap your head around that idea and use the VR and supercomputer analogy,

02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:01.440
you'll be able to solve your own puzzles and then you'll see how fun this approach is. But until

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.800
then, I see people, they can't really start to explore because they just see these obvious

02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:13.520
contradictions that they think make the whole thing a non-starter. So just put it into virtual

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.240
reality and then you can start to really explore the space. Another way to sort of see that,

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:24.320
well, another way I had a question on, and I forgot to ask you about that, was also when

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:30.800
as two perceivers are sort of seeing something, the fact that they're able to render the sort

02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:36.160
of same thing within your theory is actually because, in essence, this is still coming from

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:43.520
one sort of the one. So it's not like they wouldn't have access to the same information at some

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:49.680
point. It's kind of like you do have this shared access to information within the reality.

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.560
That's absolutely right. It's like the supercomputer and the VR analogy is the shared access.

02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:02.400
The one little proviso I would give is that we actually don't know that others are perceiving

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:10.560
the world like us. There's something called synesthesia. You know better than I do, where

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:18.800
people have experiences that, like Carol Steen, everything that she hears, every bit of music

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:25.600
that she hears, she sees a geometric object with a specific shape and a specific texture to the

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.400
surfaces and colors and so forth. And I've actually met her and talked with her in person about this.

02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:36.800
So I mean, she's living in a world that I wouldn't have imagined was possible. She hears music

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:43.120
and every time she hears the same piece of music, she sees the same object doing a complicated movement

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:50.880
with a beautiful surface on it and so forth. Well, and there was a guy named Michael something

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:58.480
rather who everything he tasted with his mouth, he felt with his hands. So meant for like a tall,

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:05.920
cold, cool column of glass. Yeah, you get some patients who can, when they read, they can smell it

02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:13.280
or hear sounds. It's incredible, some of the synesthesia patients. That's right. So you're

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:19.760
right that because we share this, the one, we can have some expectation of understanding what the

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:25.440
other world, what the other person's world is like. But I just want to put out this proviso that

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:30.320
don't think that you know everything. It may be that their world is very, very different than you

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:37.600
would ever. We have good experimental reasons to believe that our visual sensory worlds vary

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:43.280
from person to person and sometimes dramatically. I was going to say, because in that case,

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:52.720
someone who's schizophrenic or has fully blown psychosis has almost left that headset in a different

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:59.200
way. How would you sort of explore that within this? Like a fully blown psychosis where the

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:05.600
person is completely out of touch. There is no link at all to what you and I are experiencing

02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:13.440
within our headsets. How is that sort of explored within this analogy? Of course, now I'm a complete

02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:19.440
amateur. I'm not a psychiatrist or anything like that. So everyone knows this is a philosophy slash

02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:26.560
podcast. That's not really a mental health podcast directly. Exactly. Right. So then I'll

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:31.120
speculate given that. So I'm not a professional psychiatrist. But it seems to me that

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:41.120
going back to the idea of the one and the one plunging in with both feet and losing itself.

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.400
But giving itself, we didn't talk about this, but I think the one gives itself little

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:53.600
nudges to wake up. And that's the suffering that happens when I get identified with myself and

02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.960
I'm trying to be important. And my ego is trying to clash with other people. I'm trying to show

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.680
I'm smarter than you or better than you or faster than you or have more money or better cars.

02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:14.160
All that competition that we do is painful. It causes suffering. The very act of me being

02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:19.360
in any way hostile to anybody else causes me suffering. And to be competitive in any way

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:25.760
like that is causes me suffering. And that suffering is the wake up call to the truth,

02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:33.200
which is that person that I'm competing against or that I'm angry with is me. That is me under a

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:42.000
different avatar. Now, but and I'm gently I've got the suffering as a gentle way of and sometimes

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.960
not so gentle as later on of getting me to wake up and and and to but that's part of the whole

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:54.800
thing of waking up to who I am. And so the psychoses I think are cases where the suffering has

02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:00.080
gotten in many cases that sometimes it's you can say this person had a tumor and that's why I mean

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.640
really we look in there and there's a tumor, right? So that the tumor is sort of the headset

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:07.360
version of saying that there's something wrong in the network of conscious agents,

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.920
something went, you know, something with haywire and that the headset construction.

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:16.400
But in this other approach I'm thinking about is that the

02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.920
the extreme psychological pain that you get with extreme psychiatric patients is really the one

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:35.600
using suffering of an extreme kind to wake itself up to wake that particular itself in

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:45.360
that avatar to wake up and to recognize that there's nothing to worry about, right? If you're in

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:49.680
the virtual reality game and you believe you're the avatar, if someone's shooting up the avatar,

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:54.720
it's scary as hell. But if you're if you go into the game, you know, my avatar is just an avatar,

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:59.200
you know, they can shoot up all it's a completely different game. There's no reason to be upset.

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.040
So, so that is that kind of it's waking up to Oh, this is just a VR game.

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:09.920
And the psychosis patient in the one I'm talking about is the one who hasn't

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.880
who's who needs to wake up but is still so identified with the avatar that they're in

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:21.440
they're in a world of pain and a world of fear and a world. So that's again, amateur hour from

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:27.200
Hoffman. I'm not a psychiatrist. Yeah, just kind of don't worry. I always put at the bottom of my

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:34.960
video is a disclaimer to let people know that this is more of a an educational podcast rather than a

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.280
and something you apply to your life. This is not us trying to be gurus everyone. So just

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:46.000
and as a doctor myself, I'm not this is not me coming out trying to give people advice either.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.680
This is my intellectual pursuit of trying to understand these questions that I love so much.

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:56.880
So everyone knows that's just our disclaimer for the moment. Don, would you

02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:01.360
have professional advice? Yes, this is not professional advice at all. Don, do you get

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:08.080
worried or concerned about the fact? Maybe even I don't know, do you even like it? But maybe that you

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:14.960
maybe Bernardo or you guys within this idealist. It's almost like a new wave of idealism that's

02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:20.000
taking place right now. It's quite fascinating to see as well from from my perspective, doing this

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:26.080
podcast and taking part in these conversations. Do you ever get concerned that you guys are slowly

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:33.440
growing a cult or maybe that there's the people are going to take some of this and and take it way

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:39.280
beyond you guys like to to a point where they form their own sort of dogma type groups. Do you

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:42.960
does that ever concern you in any way? Well,

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:52.400
that's a very question I know, but I guess it does in the sense that my efforts are to make it

02:18:53.040 --> 02:19:00.720
a mathematical science, which still doesn't preclude a cultish kind of approach, but it

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:08.480
really helps to avoid it when when when you don't just have words that you're pushing around.

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:15.040
But you have a mathematical theory that can slap you in the face when when you misinterpret it,

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.040
right? And when it actually says no to you, like when Einstein thinks that there are no black

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:25.360
holes and the theory comes back and slaps them and says, no, there are black holes, live with it.

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:33.200
So so that's so that's what I want is is a mathematically precise idealism. I call it

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:38.480
conscious realism because of some philosophical baggage that ideals and brings. But so I call

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:45.760
it conscious realism, but it's a version of idealism. I want to mathematically precise.

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:50.720
My goal is to get this thing launched with enough mathematical rigor and enough

02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:58.000
momentum that it will take off and be a real science, a real mathematical idealist science.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:04.800
I see idealism in the past has had something of an anti science

02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:14.240
flair to it. I mean, Berkeley, in some sense, brought up his idealism as a reply to the

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:20.880
physicalism that he perceived of Newton's science. And yeah, and Berkeley had God

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:27.840
as part of as his main sort of core to the to the thesis. That's right. And it was sort of a

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:38.480
it came out of an opposition to the Newtonian science. And in many idealist theories, in fact,

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:45.760
I'm not really sure if I know of any like idealists who have said, let's go make this a

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:51.360
mathematical scientific theory. I mean, this is this is not. Yeah, there are there are some

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:56.880
quantum physicists who are early on who interpreted quantum mechanics in idealist ways.

02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:03.040
Von Neumann and others give idealist interpretations. But that's not what I'm

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:07.440
talking about. Someone's saying, let's take idealist ideas and make a mathematically

02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:12.720
precise scientific theory out of idealism. And you know, Kant, of course, did a lot of

02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:17.120
deep philosophical ideas about idealism, but that's different from making

02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:26.400
mathematically precise theories. And so there's been this anti science flavor to a lot of idealist

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:33.200
thinking. And and this is, it's, I think, not necessary. And in fact, it's, it's, it's not

02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:38.640
helpful. I think that idealism is the next step. And we need to make it mathematically precise and

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:46.160
show that physicalism emerges as a as a headset, as a projection of a much, much deeper theory. So

02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:50.640
by the way, we don't throw away our physicalist theories, we show them as special cases of

02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:57.440
deeper theories. And we use our physicalist theories as tests for, you know, we're making new

02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:03.280
theories beyond space time. How do we test them? We test them in space time. We test them like

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.680
with scattering experiments, where we know the physics of the scattering. So so we don't throw

02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:13.200
away our old theories. We are grateful for quantum field theory and general relative, we're grateful

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:18.240
for evolution by natural selection. These are wonderful theories. They are going to tell us

02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:23.440
when we make mistakes with our theories outside of space time, they will come back and slap us

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.960
in the face, because we have to protect them back into their domain. And they say, well, now

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:34.000
you're in our domain. And I say, no, or I say, maybe, maybe you can continue in that direction,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:40.960
you're not wrong yet. So so so that's the so ultimately, I think idealism

02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:49.120
needs to be and I'm trying to work toward that end to make it a mathematically precise

02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:52.640
science. And then I won't have to worry about the cold thing that we talked about earlier.

02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:58.000
The reason why I asked that is because you see it when you look at the comments and the way people

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:05.360
talk about your work, Bernardo, etc. I mean, the way some people are really, really in love with

02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:11.360
it, you know, they it it is their anti anxiety cure. They listen to you guys to kind of get

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:18.240
the to get themselves out of tough situations. They they use this as a spiritual escape. And

02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:22.960
I've seen comments and I like them I always tell them like, it's great. It's great that you guys

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:28.160
have such an impact. But at that point, you do come with a lot of power. And I recently read a

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:35.120
paper by someone it, I can't remember who it was by, but it was about Bernardo Kastrop's idealism

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:40.800
and and and I can't remember who wrote it, but it very it spoke about this. It was it was against

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:46.960
it, of course, but trying to dissect the fact that it's almost cult like it. It's kind of like a

02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:54.160
group of thinkers coming together forming this new wave. It's almost like the new age atheism

02:23:54.160 --> 02:24:00.160
movement that happened with Dawkins, Dennett back in the day, but accepting it in a shift towards

02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:07.760
a positive sort of like love universal mind is one very, very cult like and I'm not accusing you

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.600
of this, but I'm just saying you can actually see it in the comment sections, you can tell people

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:17.040
do really love your work and there's a big there's a big need for it and want for it clearly.

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.680
Well, I would I would say for those who who love it.

02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:30.800
The best thing that you can do is if you have the talents is to study the mathematics of it and

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:36.800
contribute to the mathematics and push it forward. Or if you don't yourself have that talent and

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:49.040
few of us do find a friend who does get them. The way to really to really help this is to

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.280
move the science forward. As we move the science forward, if it continues to give us

02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:00.480
psychological comfort, fantastic. If it prods us in ways that we're not comfortable with,

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:07.280
so be it. We have to go wherever truth leads us or at least the projection of truth that we can

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:15.600
see leads us. So that's what I would suggest is is I absolutely will say my thoughts on this

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:23.920
are baby steps and everything that I've said your baby steps. It's in just a few years,

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:28.880
hopefully, even within my lifetime, everything I'm saying will be seen in this trivial compared

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.240
to what we've discovered. Let's move the science forward beyond my trivial ideas right now. Let's

02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:41.200
get this thing into a real substantial science. And I mean, it would be crazy. I mean, the more

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:48.800
you guys find out, the more you see you, you could almost be seen as as the link between us and the

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:58.320
one. You're going to take us closer to us all together. It's just the one talking to itself.

02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:05.280
Yeah, pretty much you're taking us closer to us. That's right. It's beautiful all together and

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:11.520
done. Thanks so much, man. It's always a pleasure. So much fun. Anything you want to say? Anything

02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:17.280
else that you think that you really just want to put up? I squeezed in all the all the extras I wanted

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:22.080
to at this point. But next time, I'll probably have some more things that you know, I got emails

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:26.000
where people have questions. So next time, absolutely. I would say that I would love to

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.320
talk with you again. I'm eager and every time I'm going to try to do something different. And

02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:33.600
obviously next time, if there's any new papers, if there's anything else you want to chat about

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.800
specifically, we go back in, do another dissection. It's always fun done. It's such a fascinating

02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.760
journey for me personally. Watching from the outside, watching your work, it's always a

02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:48.160
pleasure. And I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thank you. And Tevin, I just love the way that

02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:52.720
you guide the conversation. It's beyond expert. Well done.
