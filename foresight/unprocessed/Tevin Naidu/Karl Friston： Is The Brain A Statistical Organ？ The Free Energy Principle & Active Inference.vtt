00:00.000 --> 00:15.760
I've been reading your work for many years and you are someone who's managed to incorporate

00:15.760 --> 00:21.440
so many different fields together. At this point, your free energy principle can be discussed

00:21.440 --> 00:25.520
in fields of mathematics, physics, biology. It seems you've managed to cross all these

00:25.520 --> 00:29.840
borders and I think it's perfect for this show. One thing I want to start off with is

00:30.720 --> 00:35.040
when you think of the topic of the mind-body problem, you think of Rene Descartes and he

00:35.040 --> 00:41.920
often said, I think therefore I am and you've now become synonymous with I am therefore I think.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.200
I think let's start off with that because I think it's beautifully poetic considering this

00:45.200 --> 00:54.160
podcast is called Mind-Body Solution. Yes, I do like that homage to Descartes.

00:54.160 --> 01:05.040
So the cheekiness of the reversal is based upon the free energy principle read as a physicist

01:05.040 --> 01:13.120
and effectively this is a description, a principle that will be applied to anything that exists

01:14.560 --> 01:22.800
and the maths tells you that if something exists in a certain sense then it can be read

01:22.800 --> 01:31.680
or interpreted as making inferences. So if you allow me to equate inferring with thinking,

01:31.680 --> 01:40.480
that means to exist is to infer. So if I am therefore I think. So that's the genesis. It's

01:40.480 --> 01:50.480
one of those down that it's strange inversions. Speaking to the slightly sort of deflationary

01:50.480 --> 01:56.880
aspect of the free energy principle, it's a slightly tautological aspect. I think at that

01:56.880 --> 02:03.040
point it would be a perfect opportunity to let's play with definitions. Let's talk about free energy

02:03.040 --> 02:08.480
principle, a Bayesian brain and perhaps active inference. Let's play around with these definitions

02:08.480 --> 02:16.080
before we move to a formalism of the free energy principle. Right, so they're all very closely

02:16.080 --> 02:23.120
related. So defining the free energy principle, first of all, what is it? It's just a principle

02:23.680 --> 02:29.360
of the kind that you would remember at school in physics like Hamilton's principle of least action.

02:31.360 --> 02:39.840
And as such it is effectively a mathematical method. It's a method or a tool that you would apply

02:39.840 --> 02:47.760
to a particular situation. And when applied to things like you and me, or in fact many other

02:47.760 --> 02:56.720
animate things and biotic things, one gets an interpretation of the behavior of such things

02:56.720 --> 03:05.840
in terms of active inference. The inference part is just a statement of sense making and

03:05.840 --> 03:11.840
representation on the inside of the thing, where the thing in question can be a person

03:11.840 --> 03:18.880
or a particle, it could be you or me. And that sense making speaks to making sense,

03:18.880 --> 03:26.800
representing, explaining, inferring the causes of sensory impressions from everything else,

03:26.800 --> 03:35.040
from the outside world. And the best or the most, if you like, inclusive way of understanding

03:35.040 --> 03:40.640
that kind of inference and sense making, when applied to the brain would be the Bayesian brain

03:40.640 --> 03:49.840
hypothesis. So the Bayesian brain hypothesis is the notion that we can understand our sense making

03:49.840 --> 03:57.440
and to a certain extent with one commits to neuronal process theories, the underlying neurophysiology

03:57.440 --> 04:05.520
neuronal dynamics, in terms of Bayesian belief updating, basically changing our physical,

04:05.520 --> 04:12.400
biophysical states by neurodynamics to represent probabilistic beliefs, Bayesian subpersonal

04:12.400 --> 04:18.640
beliefs, probabilistic beliefs about the causes of sensations. So that's inference, inference

04:19.760 --> 04:25.200
loosely described under the Bayesian brain. Active inference is the simple move that you

04:26.160 --> 04:34.000
acknowledge that the sensations upon which you're basing your inference are actively

04:34.000 --> 04:41.280
sampled. You are in charge of the data that is subtending your inference. And that sort of

04:41.280 --> 04:47.040
closes the loop between you as an inference machine, a statistical organ, or your brain,

04:47.040 --> 04:53.600
at least as a statistical organ, and the world supplying that sensory evidence of those sensations.

04:54.560 --> 05:01.520
And that story, that sort of closing the loop, an action perception kind of cycle,

05:02.080 --> 05:09.520
a description of sentient behavior, appealing to the notions of active sensing and active learning

05:10.880 --> 05:17.280
is one way of reading what comes out of the Fienta principle. So that's in my mind how

05:17.760 --> 05:22.080
those things, how you triangulate amongst those three notions.

05:23.360 --> 05:28.000
When we think about, I mean, obviously, as you said, they're all very linked. When you think

05:28.000 --> 05:33.440
about the free energy principle, the formalism of it, do you think of energy minus entropy? And

05:33.440 --> 05:38.240
then you obviously go into different aspects, surprise, divergence, then you discuss obviously

05:38.240 --> 05:44.880
your internal states, hidden states, action perception, talk to us about how this formula

05:44.880 --> 05:49.280
actually works. And how you, because a lot of people have noticed when they question you about

05:49.280 --> 05:54.800
this theory, everyone comes from a specific field. So someone often tends to attack you from a

05:54.800 --> 06:00.320
psychological perspective. Someone tends to talk to you from a biological perspective. How do you

06:00.320 --> 06:05.840
navigate all these territories? And I think with that, I'd like to say that you, one of the few

06:05.840 --> 06:11.200
people that I've noticed, who seems to be a genuine polymath in that regard, because you're always

06:11.200 --> 06:17.200
able to answer these questions succinctly with a lot of definitions. And just beautifully, how do

06:17.200 --> 06:23.760
you manage to do this? I have a lot of naughty and inquisitive students, so you get used to

06:25.040 --> 06:33.360
answering questions after a while. Again, very gracious of you to say that. But it's not,

06:34.240 --> 06:43.520
I don't think it's my wisdom. I think that ability to jump from different disciplines or just take

06:43.520 --> 06:49.760
different perspective or views on what is probably the most important thing to all of us, which is

06:49.760 --> 06:57.360
how do we work and why are we here? And is the gift of things like the free energy principle,

06:57.360 --> 07:01.280
and the free energy principle, I'm not claiming that the free energy principle is just the current

07:01.280 --> 07:08.080
formulation of millennia of thinking and physics and psychology and philosophy,

07:09.200 --> 07:15.040
and probably nearly every other field, including behaviorism, economics and the like. So the whole

07:15.040 --> 07:24.400
point of the free energy principle is that it is there to try and unify and to try and encompass

07:24.400 --> 07:30.960
and thereby endorse all the various perspectives you could take upon scented behavior or choice,

07:32.160 --> 07:41.200
the imperatives and write our decisions right through where do I look next in the next few

07:41.200 --> 07:51.200
hundred milliseconds through to which school should I send my children to? And so the eclectic

07:51.200 --> 07:56.000
aspect that is brought to the table by the free energy principle is just due to its fundamental

07:56.000 --> 08:02.240
nature. It's a first principle account. And by definition, if it is a first principle account,

08:02.240 --> 08:08.400
if it is applicable, then it should be applicable widely to various phenomena read or looked at

08:08.400 --> 08:16.640
through the lens of an economist or a psychologist or a physicist or a philosopher. It's interesting

08:16.640 --> 08:26.320
you say, oh, I talk about things like surprise information theory and entropy and intrinsic value.

08:26.320 --> 08:34.240
You didn't actually say that, but I do talk about that. The whole charm of having a first

08:34.240 --> 08:41.440
principle account that is sufficiently simple to write down mathematically is that you can see

08:41.520 --> 08:47.040
that the same mathematical quantities mean different things to different people,

08:47.040 --> 08:52.800
but they're all the same thing. So perhaps you're just to give you a couple of examples of them.

08:52.800 --> 08:58.320
Underneath all of this is just basically a description of the states that I exist in,

08:58.320 --> 09:04.800
those states that are characteristic of me. So how would I express that mathematically?

09:04.800 --> 09:12.240
Well, I could just write down a function of any particular state that reflected how

09:12.240 --> 09:18.720
characteristic it was of me. And that would be most commonly written down as a log probability

09:18.720 --> 09:23.280
of me being in this state. Now, any log probability is basically a potential.

09:24.240 --> 09:30.000
And if it's a potential, you can now read it in by analogy to thermodynamics.

09:30.480 --> 09:37.120
That log probability of being in a particular state via me can also be read as a statistician,

09:37.120 --> 09:44.720
and you can call that model evidence or in statistics marginal likelihood. If your information

09:44.720 --> 09:48.560
theory would be called self-information, and the average of self-information is entropy.

09:49.920 --> 09:56.000
If you were an economist, it would basically be the states that I aspire to. It would be description

09:56.080 --> 10:03.280
of my attracting set, written as if you were a theorist dealing with vandal dynamical systems.

10:04.160 --> 10:11.840
So now this same quantity now becomes an expression of utility or value. If you were

10:13.440 --> 10:18.960
ET James, you would call it a constraint on the imperative to maximize the entropy,

10:19.760 --> 10:26.720
and so on and so forth. So the key thing is that everybody's talking about exactly the same thing.

10:26.720 --> 10:33.760
It's just that they've got different words from it. So the joy of sort of seeing that

10:35.120 --> 10:43.120
central quantity under the hood being able to make sense to lots of different people

10:43.120 --> 10:51.280
just is an expression of the explanatory scope of this kind of first principles account.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.840
So everybody's right. They've just been using different words.

10:55.200 --> 11:01.040
I think you're absolutely right. I think when people try to develop any theory or hypothesis,

11:01.040 --> 11:07.040
it's always very important to sort of realize that we don't exist in a vacuum. There's so

11:07.040 --> 11:12.560
many different fields of study that are studying the same things, but just defining them differently

11:13.760 --> 11:17.920
discussing them very differently. But they all come together at some point and any good

11:17.920 --> 11:23.840
theory needs to be able to explain these various expertise as well. There needs to be some sort

11:23.840 --> 11:28.800
of a full explanatory version of all of these and there shouldn't be a gap and you manage to

11:28.800 --> 11:34.400
bring these all together. When you talk about hierarchal Bayesian inference, it plays a very

11:34.400 --> 11:39.840
central role in your work. And I remember when I was reading about this and doing computational

11:39.920 --> 11:44.400
psychiatry as part of the blocks during my masters, I remember coming across your work and

11:44.400 --> 11:48.640
thinking, this is so beautiful. This is the way you've managed to sort of incorporate this into

11:48.640 --> 11:53.520
psychopathology is even more intriguing. Because I remember the first time I read about it and you

11:53.520 --> 11:59.440
spoke about posterior and priors and the way it will dictate how someone experiences hallucinations,

11:59.440 --> 12:05.440
delusions, and just general differences in their field of vision, etc. How did that come to you?

12:05.840 --> 12:10.160
At what point did you manage to realize that this theory has a very active role to play in mental

12:10.160 --> 12:22.000
health? Well, the answer is another strange inversion, I'm afraid. I started as a psychiatrist

12:23.120 --> 12:29.680
and what used to be called a sort of mathematical psychologist or what I wanted to be a mathematical

12:29.760 --> 12:34.640
psychologist. I think a clinical version of that is exactly as you say, a computational

12:34.640 --> 12:40.000
psychiatrist. That phrase introduced by my friends, Reed Montague and Peter Diane,

12:41.040 --> 12:46.240
has only been around for about half a decade. But now we're all computational psychiatrists.

12:46.240 --> 12:51.120
So as a young man, I aspire to be a computational psychiatrist. So the free energy principle is

12:51.120 --> 12:58.000
the denouement of that formalization. But I think it's a really important point you bring to the

12:58.000 --> 13:07.440
table there. And I think there are two moves you have to make to appreciate the potential

13:07.440 --> 13:14.000
applicability of things like the Bayesian brain of the free energy principle to the suffering

13:14.000 --> 13:19.520
of patients that you might see in the health patients. The first move is to have a physics

13:19.520 --> 13:25.520
of beliefs, a physics of inference, a physics of sense making, if you like, a physics of basic

13:25.520 --> 13:30.800
sentence that is inactive. So it has to be sentient behavior. So it's all about choices

13:30.800 --> 13:37.440
and decisions and how I move and indeed, how I control my autonomic reflexes, you know,

13:37.440 --> 13:43.360
respond to my gut feelings and exert some sub personal control over my physiology and internal

13:43.360 --> 13:49.680
learning. So that's the first thing that you have to have. You have to have a physics of

13:49.680 --> 13:58.960
sentence. You have to have a mathematics that connects the foundations of our dynamics in a

13:58.960 --> 14:06.800
physical world to the world of beliefs and inference and sense making and representation

14:07.440 --> 14:14.320
in this inactive sense. So that's the first thing. Then once you've done that, you can then say, well,

14:14.320 --> 14:21.360
okay, under what circumstances or what would it look like if this inference

14:22.000 --> 14:29.120
went awry, was in some sense not fit for purpose with a particular world or eco niche or environment

14:29.120 --> 14:37.760
or direct interpersonal relationship that this person was having to infer and to learn and to

14:38.320 --> 14:44.880
actively navigate to deploy or active inference, for example. And then you get, I think, to

14:44.880 --> 14:53.200
computational psychiatry. But that does depend upon committing to a view of all psychopathology

14:54.080 --> 15:00.480
as intrinsically some kind of false inference. But it's a very natural view that if you just

15:00.480 --> 15:06.560
think about hallucinations and delusions, for example, I mean, what are they? They are effectively

15:07.120 --> 15:13.440
inferring something is there when it's not. So if you were a statistician, you'd say, oh,

15:13.440 --> 15:17.200
yes, that's a type one error. That's just bad inference because you've got something wrong

15:17.200 --> 15:22.320
with your standard error. But of course, you know that the standard error corresponds to the precision

15:22.320 --> 15:28.480
in, say, predicted coding variants and the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which itself then

15:28.480 --> 15:35.120
relates to synaptic gain and neuromodulation and the action of certain drugs. Similarly,

15:35.200 --> 15:41.920
all neglect syndromes or in the old days would have been called dissociative or hysterical

15:41.920 --> 15:48.640
syndromes. You know, again, read as false inference would simply mean I'm inferring

15:48.640 --> 15:55.760
something is not there when it is. It's a type two error. And if you think about all the different

15:56.320 --> 16:03.760
disorders and ways of suffering that people present within psychiatry and indeed quite a

16:03.760 --> 16:08.000
lot of neurology as well, they can all be cast as some kind of false inference, you know,

16:09.280 --> 16:15.760
dysmorpho-phobias, say, anorexia nervosa having false inferences about my body.

16:16.880 --> 16:24.000
And even simple things like parking not simple, but awful things, but simple in the sense that they're

16:24.000 --> 16:30.560
more motor and neurologically oriented conditions like Parkinson's disease, you could think of a

16:30.560 --> 16:38.800
failure to infer and to realize my inferred intentions that I am now about to move. So

16:39.760 --> 16:45.040
you would make two moves. First of all, we've linked physics to belief updating and inference.

16:45.040 --> 16:54.560
And then we've taken psychiatry as instances of a kind of aberrance or a kind of failure

16:54.560 --> 17:00.640
of the inference and belief updating process. But I repeat, put it in an inactive context.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.400
So you couldn't explain Parkinson's disease unless you talked about

17:05.520 --> 17:12.880
aning as inference, you know, treating movement and an active engagement with the world as the

17:13.440 --> 17:20.080
realization of inferred plans, things that I am likely to do next in this moment or indeed

17:20.160 --> 17:23.360
again, choosing which school to send my children to.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.920
I still remember there was one specific line that I quoted from one of your papers. I can't

17:29.920 --> 17:35.520
remember the name of the paper, but you actually spoke about that phenomenon way. Someone who's

17:35.520 --> 17:40.560
acutely psychotic, schizophrenic, when you look at these patients and you show them visual illusions,

17:41.520 --> 17:47.200
you're able, they're able for some reason to see the reality of the situation, whereas we fall for

17:47.200 --> 17:52.800
this trick. So in those cases, people often say that they're seeing the real reality, the vertical

17:52.800 --> 17:56.640
truth, and we're not. Talk to me about this phenomenon, because I think it's quite intriguing

17:56.640 --> 18:00.720
that they don't fall for it, but you, with the free energy principle, with your theory, you're

18:00.720 --> 18:08.560
able to explain this with the brain as well. Yeah, no, it's a fascinating area. So there are

18:08.560 --> 18:18.480
rare instances where psychopathology or any pathology can actually improve certain performance.

18:19.040 --> 18:24.960
Of course, one has to qualify what one means by improved performance, but the particular example

18:24.960 --> 18:28.880
you're talking about, I think is absolutely fascinating. And it's a resistance,

18:30.240 --> 18:35.200
characteristically shown with certain people, either people on the spectrum or people with

18:35.280 --> 18:46.560
schizophrenia or schizo-type approaches to life, that renders them uniquely resistant to the kind

18:46.560 --> 18:53.920
of illusions that we all experience. And it's just worth noting, well, what's an illusion?

18:53.920 --> 18:58.880
Well, it's a false inference, but why is it false? It's perfectly good from the point of

18:58.880 --> 19:05.920
view of the person having the inference and having the presumed percept and qualitative experience.

19:07.680 --> 19:14.960
However, the experimenter, the naughty experimenter who's deliberately crafted this stimulus

19:15.520 --> 19:21.840
in a way which is so unlikely that they can now say, no, no, this is a false percept because

19:21.840 --> 19:27.680
I know how it was caused. And the subject, I, for example, have completely the wrong idea,

19:27.680 --> 19:35.120
the wrong inference about how it was caused. So it is a wonderful tool for people in psychophysics

19:35.120 --> 19:44.080
to actually test how our inferences can fail in relation to the actual causes of our sensations.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.920
But to put that another way around, what it does, it's a beautiful pro

19:48.560 --> 19:54.000
of the prior beliefs that we bring to the table. So that, you know, going back to the notion of

19:54.000 --> 20:02.240
the Bayesian brain, read simply, that means that we have at hand a number of hypotheses

20:02.240 --> 20:07.360
that can explain the causes of this pattern of sensory, for example, visual information.

20:08.080 --> 20:12.960
And we generate these hypotheses actively, say predictions in predictive coding,

20:12.960 --> 20:19.840
and then we look at the adequacy of these predictions in explaining the sensory data.

20:19.840 --> 20:26.000
So we're effectively little scientists. We are testing hypotheses against sensory data.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.040
And if they're not good hypotheses, we will reject them and revise our hypotheses. And this is the

20:33.040 --> 20:41.680
Bayesian belief updating that we were referring to previously. But that adjudication and that

20:41.760 --> 20:47.760
updating rests upon your prior beliefs before you see some sensory data,

20:49.840 --> 20:56.480
relative to the precision of those data that are going to move your prior beliefs to making

20:56.480 --> 21:01.360
it to posterior beliefs after seeing the data. So we come back again to this notion,

21:02.320 --> 21:08.960
and a key notion of the precision afforded your prior beliefs, the way that you think the world

21:08.960 --> 21:15.280
works, or the way that these particular sensory, panther sensory stimulation are generated,

21:15.840 --> 21:22.320
relative to the evidence at hand through that you're accessing through your sensations.

21:22.960 --> 21:31.040
So when people, well, certainly when people like me and you talk about this resistance to illusions

21:32.000 --> 21:37.200
in people separate from schizophrenia, what we are effectively saying is that they

21:37.920 --> 21:46.000
have less precise or imprecise prior beliefs that they're more sensitive to any sensory evidence

21:46.000 --> 21:55.040
at hand. So if illusions are the things that reveal our prior beliefs, and people with schizophrenia

21:55.040 --> 22:00.160
are resistant to illusions, that means they don't have very precise prior beliefs. And that tells

22:00.160 --> 22:07.840
you an enormous amount about the message passing the dynamics and the sense making in people who

22:07.840 --> 22:14.480
are resistant to illusions, particularly in relation to how we think the brain encodes

22:14.480 --> 22:18.080
that precision, because you have to estimate the precision, it doesn't come for free.

22:18.080 --> 22:24.320
It's very much like a statistician computing the standard error, which is the inverse or the

22:24.400 --> 22:30.880
component of precision, it has to be evaluated. And if you get that wrong, you can produce your

22:30.880 --> 22:36.160
type one, your type two errors, all that false inference and the rights and these nations and

22:36.160 --> 22:43.760
delusions. And in this instance, a resistance to a particular kind of, not a pseudo hallucination,

22:43.760 --> 22:49.280
but a particular kind of illusory person. I think I'm glad we're touching on this,

22:49.280 --> 22:53.840
because this leads me into my next question, which which is surrounding illusionism as a

22:53.840 --> 22:59.600
theory of consciousness. When you think of an illusion as a misinterpretation of a sensory

22:59.600 --> 23:05.120
stimulus that does exist. And you think of the theory of illusionism, Keith Frankish, Daniel

23:05.120 --> 23:10.480
Dennett, Susan Blackmore, lots of people working. And to an extent, when you take into account

23:10.480 --> 23:15.520
certain things that someone like Anil Seth says with perceptions being active hallucinations,

23:16.800 --> 23:22.000
you sort of come to this conclusion that, okay, the sensory stimulus we're receiving

23:22.000 --> 23:26.960
sort of gives us an idea, a posterior belief at some point that we have what is known as a

23:26.960 --> 23:32.400
conscious experience, a phenomenal first person subjective experience. Sorry, I'm going to head

23:32.400 --> 23:38.400
into philosophy at this point and then we'll try to get back into the neuroscience, but and the

23:38.400 --> 23:44.160
physics, etc. So when you think of Dennett and all these philosophers who discuss illusionism as a

23:44.160 --> 23:50.240
theory of conscious, the basic premise is that we are experiencing something. However, because

23:51.040 --> 23:57.200
let's say someone like you or Donald Hoffman who takes fitness payoffs over reality. The fact is

23:57.200 --> 24:02.720
we are never really perceiving what is actually out there. We're just perceiving what is meant to

24:02.720 --> 24:08.640
allow us to survive long enough, perhaps to breed to whatever we have to do. And in this case,

24:08.640 --> 24:13.440
consciousness believing we have some sort of an entity, something similar to an Ian Vitale.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.160
I mean, the fact that we believe this allows us to go through life and successfully reproduce

24:20.160 --> 24:25.120
and continue to thrive. Do you think this has a lot of value? And do you think that these theories

24:25.120 --> 24:31.760
of illusionism as a theory of consciousness has value using your theory of free energy principle

24:31.760 --> 24:39.920
and the Bayesian brain to back it up? Well, in the way that you articulated them, absolutely, yes.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.160
Okay. Do you have any rebuttals against that?

24:46.000 --> 24:56.080
Not whatsoever. No, I think you phrased it in a compelling way and it fits exactly with the view

24:56.080 --> 25:04.560
of a Bayesian brain and more generally the free energy principle. Your controlled hallucination

25:05.520 --> 25:12.480
is just an expression of the way that sensory impressions somehow control our sense making

25:12.480 --> 25:17.440
on the inside and the degree to which we let them control depends upon the precision that we afford

25:18.480 --> 25:24.560
the sensory impressions. By definition, we'll never actually know what's going on on the outside.

25:24.560 --> 25:31.040
So the whole point of inferring is you don't know the answer. You're just left with the best belief,

25:31.120 --> 25:37.120
the best probabilistic guess as to what's going on out there. There will never be any

25:37.120 --> 25:44.960
true access to the causes of that. And in a sort of complementary fashion, I will never know

25:44.960 --> 25:48.960
what you are thinking. I can never know. So I'm on the outside looking at you.

25:50.160 --> 25:56.960
So you're all including the free energy principle, but as applied to your brain, this is just a

25:57.040 --> 26:04.080
hypothesis. It's just a belief. There is a fundamental divide that in the physics application,

26:04.080 --> 26:09.680
the free energy principle rests upon something called a Markov blanket. But there's a fundamental

26:09.680 --> 26:17.040
divide, an informational barrier, or probably beyond information, an existential barrier

26:17.040 --> 26:24.720
between the inside and the outside of any thinking thing, which means that the question

26:25.680 --> 26:32.320
is what is reality? Is there a metaphysics? Is unanswerable? All you can do is, I think in

26:32.320 --> 26:40.080
itself, as inference to the best prediction as opposed to explanation. But inference to the

26:40.080 --> 26:45.440
best explanation is perfectly okay in terms of explaining the world to yourself as you

26:46.240 --> 26:55.920
sample it and as you sense it. So I am not a philosopher, so that's the one area that I am

26:55.920 --> 27:05.680
very naïve in. However, I did want to make a philosophical point here that you use the phrase

27:05.680 --> 27:14.960
that we believe in some aspect of ourselves, including the fact that we believe that we

27:14.960 --> 27:21.840
have experiences. There is an argument that this is just another illusion. It's just another hypothesis

27:21.840 --> 27:28.160
that in fact, selfhood in and of itself is just another hypothesis, that these are sort of illusions

27:28.160 --> 27:35.280
that we bring to the table to make parsimmonious sense of the fact that there appears to be some

27:35.280 --> 27:41.520
coherence in mind-bodied interaction with the world. But it's not a necessary belief for

27:42.320 --> 27:48.960
living and surviving and adapting. I'm sure if viruses could tell you, they would deny

27:48.960 --> 27:57.440
having a sense of self. You might argue that consciousness, either the kind of self-consciousness

27:57.440 --> 28:05.360
that you refer to, or just the notion that I am having a qualitative experience. The kind of

28:05.920 --> 28:13.520
experience that people like Thomas Mixinger would associate with opacity or phenomenal opacity.

28:14.480 --> 28:20.320
These in and of themselves are still just hypotheses. They're just ways of explaining

28:20.320 --> 28:26.880
my sense-making and this instance on the inside, as opposed to explaining what caused my external

28:26.880 --> 28:32.720
sensory states. Does that make sense? But all of this I think is entirely consistent with the

28:32.720 --> 28:40.480
views that you expressed. I think it's, sorry, were you continual? Well, no, you asked for a pushback.

28:41.440 --> 28:48.880
The only pushback I can think of, and again, forgive me if I'm using the wrong words, but

28:52.880 --> 29:00.480
the free energy principle inherits from the theory of sparsely coupled random dynamical systems.

29:01.360 --> 29:09.200
And the special case that emerges when you have a particular kind of sparse coupling between

29:09.840 --> 29:18.240
something and everything else. If that is true, it does have, if you like, a metaphysical commitment

29:18.240 --> 29:24.880
that there has to be something else out there. So there is a sense that you can

29:25.840 --> 29:35.040
be a complete skeptic. There is no reality from the point of view of applying the free energy

29:35.040 --> 29:42.400
principle to my sense-making or indeed applying it to your sense-making, your sentience. But

29:43.280 --> 29:49.920
the free energy principle in and of itself starts from a very metaphysical position that

29:49.920 --> 29:56.640
there is an outside and there is an inside. And what we are looking at is quite simply a

29:56.640 --> 30:01.680
generalized synchronization between the dynamics on the inside and the outside. That can be read

30:01.680 --> 30:06.960
as inference and belief update. That's a pushback I can think of. I think that's exactly where

30:06.960 --> 30:10.800
someone like Daniel Dennett would break away from someone like Donald Hoffman. Exactly what you're

30:10.800 --> 30:16.080
talking about. Where Dennett would suppose that there is a reality, there is an external reality.

30:16.080 --> 30:21.200
However, there's still no such thing as phenomenal experience or conscious experiences because we

30:21.200 --> 30:25.760
are crafting this as we're going along or interpreting it that way. That might not be the

30:25.760 --> 30:30.160
best way to say it anyway. Whereas Donald Hoffman then goes to the assumption that all conscious

30:30.160 --> 30:35.360
experience is the reality we're talking about. And that might take it a bit further because now

30:35.360 --> 30:40.880
there is no external reality. We're sort of creating reality from conscious experience.

30:40.880 --> 30:46.400
But yeah, he takes a different physical route. Just called briefly what I wanted to say was,

30:46.400 --> 30:51.840
I mean, I've got tons of notes here. Just want to show you a lot of different things. I've got a

30:51.840 --> 30:56.560
bunch of equations here. The main goal was because I've seen so many different talks with you and

30:56.560 --> 31:01.360
so many different interviews, I've noticed how people tend to, as I said, ask you questions

31:01.360 --> 31:06.400
based on their expertise or their field of expertise. And I didn't want that to happen because

31:07.120 --> 31:13.200
for the most part, I'm so on board with your view. And I love the theory so much that I used it in

31:13.200 --> 31:19.200
my own master's dissertation to defend illusionism. So I, the dissertation is called psychiatry's

31:19.200 --> 31:24.720
defense for illusionism as a theory of consciousness. And a huge chunk of that actually

31:24.720 --> 31:31.920
incorporated your work, yourself, Chris Frith, many others. But I was worried that when I get

31:32.000 --> 31:36.320
into this interview, I'm going to start defending it even more. And I did not want that to happen.

31:36.320 --> 31:42.080
So I made very specific notes to sidetrack me off that path. But before I do leave that part,

31:42.080 --> 31:47.280
the last thing I do want to say is, if someone does ask you what consciousness is,

31:47.920 --> 31:52.160
how do you actually go about answering that question? Do you find that you go down a

31:52.880 --> 31:57.520
philosophical route? Or do you stick to a neuroscientific slash psychiatric route?

31:58.400 --> 32:05.840
Well, I think very much like you, it would depend upon who I'm talking to and who is listening.

32:08.080 --> 32:16.640
It would be very context sensitive. If you're talking to

32:16.880 --> 32:30.480
people who are in a more physics-y world, and they are interested in the naturalization of

32:30.480 --> 32:38.800
consciousness, I would appeal to this, well, go right back to the Cartesian dualism. How would

32:38.800 --> 32:45.600
you repair that? Or should you repair that? There is actually an argument I've heard recently from

32:45.680 --> 32:54.160
very valued colleagues that there is a neo-Cartesianism that emerges from, specifically,

32:54.960 --> 33:00.000
the free energy principle on the one hand, and quantum information theoretic formulations on the

33:00.000 --> 33:06.720
other hand. This is due to things like the inner screen hypothesis by Chris Fields, which is a

33:06.720 --> 33:14.400
fascinating resurrection of the Cartesian theater of a particular sort. But if I was talking to

33:14.400 --> 33:22.720
somebody who wanted to naturalize in relation to the laws of physics written as usually differential

33:22.720 --> 33:29.040
equations or in quantum information theoretic terms, I would be looking to answer their question in

33:29.040 --> 33:38.800
terms of how do you bridge these two? How do you arrive at some kind of dual aspect monism

33:39.360 --> 33:46.320
that still preserved the duality that explained it? And I would be talking about

33:47.120 --> 33:58.320
the difference between a posterior belief, a Bayesian belief that is encoded by the states of

33:58.320 --> 34:05.760
a brain, for example, and the probability distributions that are entailed by the states

34:05.760 --> 34:14.720
of those brains. So you've got on the one hand an intrinsic information geometry that inherits from

34:14.720 --> 34:20.080
the probability distributions that somebody in thermodynamics, a physicist, would understand

34:20.080 --> 34:25.040
the kind that we use in brain imaging, for example, to look at brain activations through

34:26.240 --> 34:33.120
the expenditure of thermodynamic energy in order to support neural dynamics,

34:34.000 --> 34:42.000
but exactly the same by physical states are those that parameterize another kind of information

34:42.000 --> 34:47.440
geometry, which is the information geometry of beliefs, the space in which I do my belief

34:47.440 --> 34:52.560
updating, moving one belief from this point to this point. And of course, that moment is important

34:52.560 --> 35:00.160
because most of the much of the arguments that I would engage with in terms of consciousness

35:00.160 --> 35:06.880
would frame consciousness as a process. I think you mentioned that explicitly. What does that mean

35:06.880 --> 35:13.760
from the point of view of trying to naturalize a conscious process that was quintessentially

35:13.760 --> 35:19.360
believed basis movement on statistical manifold. So you do get that for free from the free energy

35:19.360 --> 35:27.680
principle. So that's why I and a number of at least close friends and collaborators use the

35:27.680 --> 35:33.440
phrase, you know, a physics of sentience. Sometimes we don't want to be quite so bold.

35:33.440 --> 35:37.360
Sometimes you get told off for using the word sentience. So but at least you can talk about

35:37.360 --> 35:44.080
a physics of information. And it is that sort of link between the information theoretic, the belief,

35:44.080 --> 35:53.760
the statistical aspect of neural dynamics, and the thermodynamics that underwrite that,

35:53.760 --> 35:59.360
which does, I think, provide that link between the, you know, the mensuric, well, you know,

35:59.360 --> 36:11.760
the Cartesian dual aspects of certain things like the brain. If I was talking to people

36:12.640 --> 36:19.280
in philosophy who are more interested in, you know, phenomenology, I think you have to address

36:19.280 --> 36:26.400
some hard questions about, you know, what would be the necessary properties of a

36:27.120 --> 36:33.360
self-organizing, self-evidence free energy minimizing system that could possibly support

36:35.120 --> 36:42.400
qualitative experience or qualia as and then you have to ask other questions about

36:43.360 --> 36:50.160
when would there be some self-awareness of this and, you know, issues of self-modelling of the kind

36:50.160 --> 37:00.480
again, addressed by people like Thomas Metzinga. Those kinds of conversations would take a slightly

37:00.480 --> 37:05.360
different route and would focus on the phenomenology. And interesting, they come back to the precision

37:05.360 --> 37:11.600
we were talking about before. If you remember, we were talking about having to estimate the

37:11.600 --> 37:22.160
precision, which means that you've got, well, for those kinds of systems or creatures or

37:22.160 --> 37:31.120
particles that have the capacity to estimate the precision of their implicit beliefs and

37:31.120 --> 37:39.200
the sensory evidence that is updating those beliefs, that the very act of deploying those

37:39.280 --> 37:43.200
estimates of precision and inferring that precision becomes a kind of mental action.

37:43.760 --> 37:53.280
So now you've got a way of linking mental action, red as people like Jacob Nynowski and Thomas

37:53.280 --> 38:00.400
Metzinga and that kind of philosophizing and with the psychological reading of this mental

38:00.400 --> 38:06.400
action, which is just attention, it's just basically deploying or affording more attention

38:06.400 --> 38:15.440
to this level of representation in a hierarchical context or this sensory stream, thereby selecting

38:15.440 --> 38:23.200
that for belief updating, giving those sources of evidence privilege access to your deeper,

38:23.200 --> 38:31.280
higher level belief updating. So now you're in the world of building bridges between attention,

38:31.920 --> 38:39.200
mental action and phenomenology. Then you start to talk to people who like to think about

38:39.200 --> 38:47.040
selfhood and self-modeling and self-awareness and you start to think about how do these things

38:47.040 --> 38:55.760
unpack in terms of the kind of generative models that are necessary to define model evidence,

38:55.760 --> 39:01.520
margin and likelihood, variational free energy. What kind of models would you need and you normally

39:01.520 --> 39:08.240
get to your very, very deep models, hierarchical models where we normally have in mind a sort of

39:08.240 --> 39:15.120
heterarchy or a centrifugal hierarchy. So your deeper is usually sort of more abstract and slower

39:16.480 --> 39:22.720
and what normally starts to think about what kind of depth would be required

39:23.680 --> 39:29.600
for me to have a sense of self. Well, first of all, I have to be an agent. To be an agent,

39:29.600 --> 39:35.280
I have to have a generative model that entertains the consequences of my action, otherwise I can't

39:35.280 --> 39:43.680
plan. So immediately we're talking about generative models entailed by certain creatures or people

39:44.560 --> 39:49.760
that escapes the moment simply now because I've got a generative model of the future.

39:49.840 --> 39:55.120
Unlike a thermostat or a virus, I've now got a very deep generative model of a particular sort

39:55.120 --> 40:00.720
which goes into the future. It's future pointing, but crucially, it's my future. It's not your

40:00.720 --> 40:07.280
future or anything else, it's just my future. What will happen if I do that? So that makes me

40:07.280 --> 40:14.640
to an agent. So immediately you're talking about a very special class of self-organization,

40:14.640 --> 40:22.240
self-evidencing. And then you have to ask the question, well, at what point do I recognize

40:22.240 --> 40:28.080
that it is me that is actually doing the planning? And why? If you want to apply the

40:28.080 --> 40:33.280
free energy principle, you have to ask the question, well, what licenses this kind of deep

40:34.400 --> 40:41.440
generative modeling? And that's a pressing question because you have used the phrase

40:41.440 --> 40:46.880
self-evidencing. I should just very quickly qualify that, which is a philosophical term,

40:46.880 --> 40:52.960
which I know nothing about in philosophy. But I do know that Jacob Hoey, my friend in Melbourne,

40:52.960 --> 41:00.080
is a philosopher, thinks it's quite apt to use as a description of the Bayesian brain minimizing

41:00.080 --> 41:05.600
its free energy. Because if you remember, the free energy is synonymous with technically a lower

41:05.600 --> 41:11.920
bound on surprise, surprise is self-information, but it's also the negative model evidence or

41:11.920 --> 41:19.840
log-bottle evidence. So as you're doing optimal inference, you are implicitly trying to maximize

41:19.840 --> 41:27.120
the evidence for your models of your nipped world, so you're self-evidencing. So the interesting twist

41:27.120 --> 41:38.000
here is that you can easily show, literally on the back of a matchbox, that the log evidence

41:38.720 --> 41:47.600
is equal to accuracy minus complexity, which means that every move I make and every aspect of my brain

41:48.320 --> 42:00.160
that is engendered during neurodevelopmental need evolution has to pay a price for every more accurate

42:00.160 --> 42:12.720
explanation, illusion that it deploys. And that price is the complexity cost. So it means you're

42:12.720 --> 42:20.640
trying to minimize the complexity. So why in earth would, say, evolution equip you and me with this

42:20.640 --> 42:25.680
really deep generative model, where I've got all this extra complexity that I can be in this state

42:25.680 --> 42:29.680
of mind, on that state of mind, I can be anxious, I can be in that, I can be frightened, I can be

42:29.680 --> 42:37.040
embarrassed. Why would it do that? Well, of course, if it provides a parsimonious explanation

42:37.920 --> 42:46.880
of my sense making and my active engagement with the world, then it pays its way in terms of the

42:49.360 --> 42:54.320
increase in accuracy of the kind of things I can explain and engage with,

42:56.880 --> 43:04.240
pays its way or compensates sufficiently for the increased complexity. And then you ask yourself,

43:04.240 --> 43:12.960
what kind of worlds would potentially justify this kind of modeling, this kind of very

43:12.960 --> 43:19.920
sophisticated hierarchy, deep modeling? And usually one ends up, and now I'm talking to people

43:19.920 --> 43:27.360
in your ethology and social neuroscience, you end up with, well, the only kind of worlds in which

43:27.440 --> 43:35.280
I need to infer I am me and I am in this dispositional state is in a world in which there are lots of

43:35.280 --> 43:40.160
other things that are exactly like me that have certain dispositional, intentional states in

43:40.160 --> 43:47.040
relation to me. Otherwise, I don't need this. It would be an overly complicated model. So you argue

43:47.040 --> 43:54.320
yourself into a situation where this kind of consciousness, it can only be present, or is

43:54.320 --> 44:00.400
any licensed under the free energy principle, in a world full of conspecifics and creatures,

44:00.400 --> 44:06.400
and usually N and N functioned eternally, that depends upon lots of other people. So that now

44:06.400 --> 44:14.000
becomes a slightly relational aspect to this kind of consciousness. So I haven't talked about the

44:14.880 --> 44:20.000
inner screen hypothesis, but there is another quantum physics version of this. So there's lots

44:20.000 --> 44:23.840
of different stories you can tell depending upon what people want to hear.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.000
Carl, you touched on so many different ones there. I love the last one because

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
it reminds me of Chris Fritz's work, and he loves to talk about this social and relational

44:32.000 --> 44:36.400
aspect of consciousness. You guys have written many papers together, and someone else you've written

44:36.960 --> 44:40.960
with is a colleague of mine from South Africa, a very good friend, Mark Solms.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.800
You guys have also written together, and I know Mark takes us down to a more basic level of

44:45.760 --> 44:50.320
existence in terms of conscious experiences coming from more basic parts of the brain.

44:51.440 --> 44:55.040
What got you guys to write together, and how did you guys sort of get together and do this?

44:55.040 --> 45:00.400
These beautiful papers together. Right, well I'll just mention both Chris and Mark in that.

45:00.960 --> 45:06.960
So interestingly, when I, as a young psychiatrist, got into brain imaging,

45:07.840 --> 45:16.160
it was exactly at the same time that Chris was, Chris Frith, came from basically clinical

45:16.720 --> 45:22.080
psychology and neuropsychology. Those were the worlds, certainly the UK's experts in schizophrenia

45:22.080 --> 45:28.240
research. He came to join us at the MRC Cyclotron Unit, the very first brain imaging, also an

45:28.240 --> 45:34.720
emission tomography studies of people with schizophrenia. So he's been my mentor and friend

45:35.360 --> 45:42.080
since the inception of my academic career, and he's still meant to be writing the last paragraph

45:42.080 --> 45:50.480
of the last paper that I'm trying to submit at the moment. Mark, but there's an interesting

45:50.480 --> 45:59.120
connection and comparison between Mark and Chris. Mark, I met later in life at international

45:59.120 --> 46:07.040
conferences, and we're very impressed with, in those days, his encyclopedic and very embracing

46:07.040 --> 46:14.160
knowledge of Freudian ideas in relation to psychoanalysis, but also neuropsychology.

46:15.040 --> 46:23.360
So he's one of those polymaths who can transcend different fields. He can write volumes on Freud,

46:23.360 --> 46:32.000
and yet bring the most informative and puzzling neuropsychological cases to the fore

46:32.000 --> 46:38.560
to evince some very deep questions about how we experience our world and how that can be

46:38.560 --> 46:45.200
expressed via things like neuropsychanalysis. So the interesting thing is that Chris really

46:45.200 --> 46:51.600
hates Freud, whereas Mark loves Freud, but they're both, they're both committed to understanding the

46:51.600 --> 47:00.560
brain as an organ, as a social organ. But as you rightly say, Mark is much more on the sort of,

47:00.560 --> 47:06.480
you know, it predicates his work on the neuropsychology and the neurobiology,

47:07.680 --> 47:12.960
whereas Chris is much more in terms of the dyadic and the social and social neuroscience aspects

47:13.920 --> 47:21.360
that underwrite sense making where it matters. But both of them at the end of the day are trying

47:21.360 --> 47:26.400
to understand the, you know, the patients they saw as young men, and perhaps Mark is still seeing

47:26.400 --> 47:34.800
patients, I don't know. So that's how I got involved. Mark's ideas, you know, I think you're

47:34.800 --> 47:47.840
absolutely right. They are more grounded in the wetwear that would have this,

47:48.800 --> 47:56.960
that would endorse certain psychoanalytic, psychotherapeutic, neuropsychological and

47:56.960 --> 48:05.280
psychiatric readings. And interestingly, he's happened upon exactly the same

48:07.520 --> 48:11.280
focus that I suspect to your computational psychiatry thesis

48:13.040 --> 48:19.520
focused on. So again, we come back to this key notion of precision and uncertainty. And of course,

48:19.600 --> 48:27.280
you know, if you want a, you know, to naturalize psychopathology, it's all about beliefs. And

48:27.280 --> 48:35.600
if you want to, what is definitive of a belief? Well, it has clearly, when thought of or when

48:35.600 --> 48:41.040
read as a probability distribution, it has an attribute of content in terms of the location

48:41.040 --> 48:46.640
parameters. But more importantly, it's got an attribute of uncertainty of dispersion.

48:47.600 --> 48:52.720
That's the whole point about a belief as opposed to a point estimate. So if we are creatures that

48:52.720 --> 49:01.360
deal in beliefs, then the, you know, the challenge that we face is basically evaluating and knowing

49:01.360 --> 49:07.360
and representing our own uncertainty, either personally or subpersonally. You know, and indeed,

49:08.640 --> 49:12.560
you can see this throughout, say, in economics, you know, the markets of lost confidence,

49:12.560 --> 49:17.760
there's in, you know, things that matter, I usually knows the confidence and the uncertainty

49:17.760 --> 49:25.280
that I hold my beliefs with. So that, that I keep using the word uncertainty, because there's a

49:25.280 --> 49:30.480
lovely little phrase that Mark has celebrated in his most recent book that you know, The Hidden

49:30.480 --> 49:36.080
Spring and Subsequence and Academic Publications, which is a notion of felt uncertainty. So he thinks

49:36.080 --> 49:46.320
that feelings are all about the estimation of and deployment of precision uncertainty in exactly

49:46.320 --> 49:52.160
the same way that we ended up trying to naturalize the resistance to illusions in people with

49:52.160 --> 49:58.800
schizophrenia. It's all the same thing. So he puts a very heavy weight on that. To the extent he

49:58.800 --> 50:04.640
gets very cross when people become cortical centric, you know, they think he's all in the

50:04.640 --> 50:12.400
frontal lobes. He's literally deep in the hierarchy, literally deep in the cells of origin

50:12.400 --> 50:18.240
of these really powerful neurotransmitter systems that do the attentional game, they do the

50:18.240 --> 50:24.720
neuromodulation, they set the precision, they balanced and coordinate our belief updating.

50:24.720 --> 50:28.560
And of course, that fits very comfortably with what we've talked about before, which is a mental

50:28.560 --> 50:38.400
action read as attention, being able to get some control over those dynamics and belief updating

50:38.400 --> 50:42.800
processes, that Bayesian mechanics that's going on inside our head.

50:44.320 --> 50:50.720
So, I mean, you guys, both of your papers, I remember, you all sort of culminate and get

50:50.720 --> 50:55.280
together with this idea that this Bayesian brain, this is fundamental to what we do.

50:55.360 --> 51:00.320
When you think about perceptive experiences, we realize that at some point, my red sunset and

51:00.320 --> 51:05.280
your red sunset are not the same. It's a very two different experiences, both comprised of

51:05.280 --> 51:10.160
different neural, neuro factors, different social factors, different experiences in the past. So

51:10.160 --> 51:14.960
even time plays a big role. This comes along well when you think of Markov blankets, because you

51:14.960 --> 51:20.640
think of these different internal states, different active states, perhaps for each person who's

51:20.640 --> 51:26.560
thinking, how do you find Markov blankets play? Well, let's first talk about how Markov blankets

51:26.560 --> 51:31.600
play a central role in the free energy principle, and how this sort of navigates across different

51:31.600 --> 51:37.280
areas from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology. Let's go to economics, etc.

51:39.040 --> 51:44.400
Right. I thought you were going to talk about synchronization across Markov blankets and

51:44.400 --> 51:46.960
communication. I wasn't sure you can get that at some point.

51:47.520 --> 51:58.000
Excuse me. So, yeah, as you say, the Markov blanket plays a foundational role in the physics

51:58.560 --> 52:04.960
reading of the free energy principle, where you have to, before you can start to talk about anything,

52:05.600 --> 52:12.160
you have to be able to demarcate and define what you mean by something. And the first move is

52:13.120 --> 52:19.360
to individuate that thing from everything else. How do you do that? Well, you simply identify

52:19.920 --> 52:24.960
those states that intervene between everything else and the thing in question. They separate the

52:24.960 --> 52:34.560
internal states, dynamics, paths, narratives. Technically, these would be states in a state

52:34.640 --> 52:41.680
space, from the point of view of, say, a Langevin equation or some kind of statistical physics.

52:45.840 --> 52:53.360
What transpires is that if you want to individuate the state's internal to something,

52:53.360 --> 53:00.000
from the state's external to something, then one way of doing that, and one could argue the only

53:00.080 --> 53:04.880
way of doing that, is to demonstrate that they are conditionally independent. If you want to be

53:04.880 --> 53:10.480
able to separate, there has to be some kind of probabilistic separability. There has to be

53:10.480 --> 53:15.520
some kind of independence. But it's conditioned upon the Markov blanket. So what does that mean?

53:15.520 --> 53:22.400
Well, it basically means that you and I, almost specifically your brain and my brain,

53:23.840 --> 53:29.040
are not closed systems. We are open systems, and our systems are open to our niche, our

53:29.120 --> 53:39.920
environment, or our heat bath, if you were a physicist. But that kind of openness is a kind

53:39.920 --> 53:45.200
that preserves that conditional independence between me on the inside and everything else

53:45.200 --> 53:52.880
on the outside. And that's where the Markov blanket comes in. And then you can, for most things,

53:53.840 --> 53:58.720
partition the Markov blanket into two sets of states, the active states and the sensory

53:58.720 --> 54:04.320
states. The semantics are rather obvious in the sense that it's just making a distinction

54:04.320 --> 54:11.680
between those states that mediate the exposure of the inside to the outside. So the influence,

54:11.680 --> 54:16.880
the vicarious influences of the outside on the inside and those of the sensory states.

54:16.880 --> 54:22.320
And then to complete the circle, to induce the necessary kind of circular causality we need

54:22.320 --> 54:27.440
for the synchronization we're going to talk about, you have to have the other side of the street,

54:28.320 --> 54:35.120
which is the active states that mediate the influence of the internal states on the external

54:35.120 --> 54:42.800
states. So you've got this rather delicate, fundamental sparsity structure where the sparsity

54:42.800 --> 54:49.200
is read in terms of the influence that one state has on another state. The foregrounds

54:50.160 --> 54:56.320
a special set of states that are called blanket states that can be divided into active and

54:56.320 --> 55:02.960
sensory states that intervene between the external and internal states. The inner screen

55:02.960 --> 55:08.880
hypothesis we were talking about before inherits from a quantum information theoretic formulation

55:08.880 --> 55:16.800
of this notion where you can look at this blanket as a screen onto which I can write,

55:16.800 --> 55:23.600
say the environment or the world out there writes onto this blanket, writes onto this

55:23.600 --> 55:29.360
holographic screen and those become my sensations and I can then read those sensations from the

55:29.360 --> 55:35.680
holographic screen on the inside and then I can couple back so that the environment senses me

55:35.680 --> 55:40.640
through my actions. So there's a, if you like, one level of perfect symmetry between the two

55:41.280 --> 55:52.960
and that symmetry is just, sorry, that symmetry is evinced by the minimization

55:54.320 --> 56:00.720
of free energy in the sense that if I can predict what's going on out there and what's going on

56:00.720 --> 56:04.960
out there is at the same time in some sense trying to predict what's going on inside my head,

56:05.680 --> 56:11.440
the ultimate free energy minimizing solution, the most likely solution just brings us back to

56:12.480 --> 56:18.000
being in characteristic states for the environment and the mean. So we're talking just about a

56:18.000 --> 56:25.120
description of a generalized synchronization or a synchronization of chaos between two

56:25.120 --> 56:31.280
sparsely coupled dynamical systems with a special sparsely structure that allows me to preserve

56:31.280 --> 56:38.560
my conditional independence. So in a sense the illusionist perspective we were talking about

56:38.560 --> 56:45.840
before is a must, it can't be any other way if you define existence as conditional independence

56:45.840 --> 56:50.720
from the world in which you are immersed, but of course there has to be a world in which you are

56:50.720 --> 56:56.240
immersed so you can't take that too far in terms of a skeptical position. Yeah, when you think of

56:56.240 --> 57:03.120
Markov blankets, in the context of let's say neural networks, how could the concept of Markov

57:03.120 --> 57:11.440
blankets be used to better understand flow of information or computations within a neural network?

57:12.160 --> 57:15.680
Is this applicable and are there any specific applications we could

57:16.320 --> 57:21.520
utilize this concept to enhance our understanding of consciousness, neural connections, etc.?

57:21.920 --> 57:28.720
Yeah, I think there are, it's interesting that you should ask that and what you should do is get

57:30.000 --> 57:34.880
Maxwell Ramstead and Chris Field and possibly even Mark and then Mark Serms has also been

57:34.880 --> 57:38.960
involved in these conversations and another other people I'm sure they will also suggest.

57:40.000 --> 57:49.040
So this group have been thinking for a year or two and are currently submitting papers to things

57:49.040 --> 57:57.200
like the general consciousness studies and elsewhere that rest explicitly on arving the

57:57.200 --> 58:04.240
internal dynamics of a brain in terms of nested Markov blankets and trying to ask the question,

58:04.880 --> 58:12.720
is there something unique about a Markov blanket on the inside in your brain which

58:12.720 --> 58:18.080
may be physically very distributed but statistically well defined that could possibly

58:18.080 --> 58:23.040
support consciousness? So this is the inner screen hypothesis that I mentioned before.

58:23.040 --> 58:27.200
So your question, perhaps you've actually seen a preprint.

58:30.080 --> 58:35.520
Well, it's a very prescient and astute question then because this is exactly what people like

58:35.520 --> 58:41.040
Maxwell and Mark and Ken and David and everybody else would love and Chris would have loved to

58:41.040 --> 58:46.640
have been asked. Yeah, so that's the whole premise that well, first of all, it's a spin back.

58:47.360 --> 58:55.120
So you're right to ask, are Markov blankets useful? I think that they are foundational and

58:55.120 --> 58:59.520
they're used implicitly everywhere. I mean, not only are they foundational in the sense that they

59:00.640 --> 59:06.400
define your existence and my existence and anything that we engage with or we think we engage with

59:07.200 --> 59:14.160
but they are implicitly used whenever you start to simulate or reproduce

59:15.600 --> 59:19.840
or emulate any kind of sense making or intelligence, artificial or natural.

59:21.120 --> 59:26.640
Whether you're playing with neurons, neural cultures in a dish, the cell membrane is a Markov

59:26.640 --> 59:33.840
blanket that defines the cell, the connectivity of the neurons defines another scale of Markov

59:34.560 --> 59:37.120
blanket or another scale, which says that this is a network.

59:39.040 --> 59:44.880
And exactly the same maths applies to neural networks in machine learning and artificial

59:44.880 --> 59:49.600
intelligence research and the operation of your iPhone or Google search machines.

59:50.480 --> 59:55.680
So these things become practically really important in defining the network of a thing

59:55.680 --> 01:00:02.240
that's doing the computations or the information processing in a pragmatic sense.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.360
And indeed, you can read these active and sensory states as the inputs and outputs to

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:14.640
anything that is doing some kind of computing. So they are essential in defining things like,

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.160
say, von Neumann architectures. You and I don't use a von Neumann architecture,

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.000
but you can still use Markov blankets to define them. But even if you look at the kind of architectures

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:34.800
that we use for sense making in the hierarchal Bayesian brain or hierarchal predictive coding

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:45.360
story, then the message passing that is required to do the brief updating becomes tremendously

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:53.040
efficient due to the presence of these carefully self-maintained, self-evidencing Markov blanket

01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.160
structures. So remember the Markov blanket rests upon a sparsity structure. It's what the connections

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.160
and the influences that are not there. So that means that you can now do local computations.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.680
If you can define the Markov blanket of you, you may be just an element of your dendrite,

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.120
dendritic tree, you may be a synapse, you may be an entire dendritic tree, you may be a cell,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.600
you may be a brain region, you may be the campus, you may be an entire brain,

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.280
you may be an entire person, or you may be a family, you may be a species, you may be an institution,

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:36.400
you may be a biosphere, and every scale the same rules apply whereby you get the efficiency from

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:44.240
the sparsity where the sparsity underwrites the very structure and the ability to actually dissect

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:52.880
every scale, the system at hand. So that leads to, I repeat, that's practically really important

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.000
when you're designing your networks or chips. You need to keep all your computations as local as

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.840
possible and you do that by using your Markov blanket. If you wanted to, if we return to

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:18.000
the implications for belief updating in a brain, then just saying the phrase hierarchical predictive

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.160
processing or hierarchical Bayesian inference immediately connects you to a certain class

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.800
of Markov blankets because the hierarchy is just defined in terms of the connections that are not

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:38.720
there. So each hierarchical level possesses a Markov blanket that separates its superordinate

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.560
level from its subordinate level. So just talking about hierarchical structures is just one special

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:53.920
case of a particular kind of nested Markov blanket. And then we get to, is there a special

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:59.120
Markov blanket? So now this is the crux of the paper that you haven't read, but I thought you had.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.160
I'm looking forward to it. Well, I'll send you, well, I asked, you know, if you email Maxwell

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:12.320
Ramstead and Montreal, he'll send you, he'll send you, I've only got a copy with all the authors

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.720
redacted, so I'm not quite sure who the authors are. I'll take up that off, I'll take up that

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:29.920
off and definitely do that. No, he'd be delighted. So the idea of one of the key ideas that fits very

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:37.200
comfortably with the ideas from Chris Field and people like Jim Laysbrook and Mike Levin,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.840
which is this inner screen hypothesis, is that there is one irreducible Markov blanket.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.880
There is one that you can't get inside and find any hierarchical structure or any partition.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:58.320
So what would that mean if there was one or more possibly, but there was certainly at least one

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:04.160
irreducible Markov blanket in my brain? It would have some quite profound implications.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:11.760
It would mean that it could never see itself other than acting on the outside, which is the

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.640
rest of the brain. So the only way it can solve evidence is by engaging in mental action.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:24.640
And now you ask, well, what kind of mental action would it engage? What are the executive

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.320
systems, the active states of this particular minimal Markov blanket? They are precisely

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.800
the cells of origin of the neurotransmitters that implement precision control and attention.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.920
So we're right back with Mark Soames again, but we're in a very comfortable position because

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.080
not only are we friends with Mark Soames, but we're also friends with everybody who talks about

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.440
things like higher order thought theory. So predicate the entire argument on this hierarchical

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.880
structure, which means that at some level, and usually it's the higher level or the deeper level,

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:06.080
do interesting metacognitive things start to happen that you could associate with

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.640
conscious processing. But this is exactly what the minimal Markov blanket, irreducible Markov

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.320
blanket would say. It is something that is deep within the hierarchy that there is no higher

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.520
or deeper level. Because if there was, you'd be able to partition the internal states within

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.840
that minimal Markov blanket. It also fits very comfortably things like the global neuronal

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.600
workspace theory. I mean, what is global? And what is a workspace? Well, it's something where you

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.400
can share stuff. So you can't further subdivide it and it's global because it sees everything.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.160
So it has, it has a lot of constructability in relation to a game where we started,

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.920
everybody's right, but they just got their own way of expressing it. But in this instance, we are,

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:57.520
or one is expressing it explicitly in terms of individuation, separability, read through the

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.920
lens of the free energy principle in terms of Markov blankets, crucially in a scale applied

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.760
to a particular scale, this scale is the scale of brains. So this wouldn't work when you're

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.760
trying to describe the weather or evolution. It wouldn't work when you're trying to describe

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:24.640
things at a quantum level or indeed at the level of a single neuronal, neural population.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:31.040
This argument is scale is tied to a particular scale, but it has, if you like, a scale free

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:41.360
aspect in the hierarchical partitioning that induces the notion of a non partitionable or

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:48.880
irreducible Markov blanket. So, funnily enough, that notion of the irreducible Markov blanket

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.320
being the inner screen is exactly the new Cartesian theater that we're talking about.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.520
That's very fascinating. I mean, I'm scheduled to chat to Mike Levin soon,

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.400
and I had no idea. I think I should send him an email to chat about this. You said it was Mike Levin,

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.000
Mark Sorms, Chris Fields, who else was, there was one more name you mentioned.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:20.720
The inner screen hypothesis that, if you like, provides a cornerstone for this more collective,

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:27.200
inclusive effort to try and get at, you know, what Vanya Weiss would call a minimal unifying

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:36.400
model of consciousness. That includes people like Mark Sorms and David Rudolf and lots of people.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.640
Organized by Maxwell Ramstead, and Chris Fields is a really important player in that,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:55.840
but the inner screen hypothesis in and of itself is indeed due to Chris Fields and his

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:03.360
friends, and particularly Mike Levin and people like Jim Glacebrook. So, that formulation is

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.480
another, if you like, access, which you'll have some great conversations with both Chris and Mike.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:16.640
So, they come at this from the point of view of sort of basal cognition, the notion that

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:26.320
everything is effectively, can be cast, and possibly even is, just a process of information.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.120
It's just information processing, and self-organization just is

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.920
the processes that evolve that effectively do believe updating or process information,

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:48.000
usually classical information, you know, when it comes to sort of kind of biotic self-organization

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
that Mike Levin deals with. So, he's famous for Xenobox and all sorts of really insightful

01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:05.440
takes, new takes on cellular and biological self-organization.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.560
You know, some of my favorite ideas are, you know, if you'd, you might like, is that, you know,

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.000
when you appreciate that sort of, you know, physics, and this is a Chris Fields quote,

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.720
there is no bright line between sort of physics, biology, and psychology. They're all the same

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.720
things, just using different words. And Mike takes this to his extreme, what he used to,

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.600
he's got more sophisticated in the past review, but several years ago, he had this notion that

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.000
cancer was a delusion, a delusion that arose from a pathology of basal cognition, which I think is

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.480
why your cells are failing to infer, know their place, they're failing to infer that, no, I shouldn't

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.600
be growing in this context. They've got this delusion, oh, I should keep on growing. And of

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.520
course, he's absolutely right. So you can even get a computational psychiatry of cancer out of this,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:13.360
but it does require a commitment to think about all self-organization as basically a process that

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:20.000
can be read as an inference process or a belief of basic dating process, the right kind of

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:29.360
processing and bounding self-information and entropy read from the point of view of information

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:38.000
theory. Chris Fields' particular take comes from his skills with Jim Glacebrook in quantum

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.520
information theory. So that's where the information theoretic aspects come, and then you can start to

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:49.280
talk about the relationship between the principles of unitarity and entanglement and the like,

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:58.560
and what that means when read or what it means in terms of a quantum formulation of the classical

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.840
reading of the free energy principle that doesn't normally deal with quantum, you know, it usually

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.720
starts with, you know, classical mechanics with all the kind of formulation of the like.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:16.240
I know, I love so much about what you just said, because when I talk about it, I often think about

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.720
the same thing. I often call ourselves receiving persons organized by organelles, crafted by cells,

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.560
designed by DNA, manufactured by molecules, assembled by atoms, forged by fusion over,

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.400
forged by fusion via stellar supernovae. So this is a saying, because I think if you don't

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.240
incorporate all these things together, you're just, you're missing out an opportunity not to

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.480
reduce things to the nothing but aspects, but rather to grow the complexity of what we're talking

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.920
about. You just increase the scope of the conversation so much more by discussing every realm of reality.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.800
And I think you get that, and you seem to be working on that from that perspective as well.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:04.960
Absolutely. That Gail, I think that's a lovely way that you actually expressed it.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.520
You should definitely get Chris Fields on your podcast, because his big thing is that scale

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:19.440
freeness, that scale invariance. And in fact, I was on a call literally about two hours ago,

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.080
where he made, I thought, a delightful point that because the free energy principle is by

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:32.000
construction scale free, it cannot be reductious at the same time. So it is quintessentially

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.280
anti-reductionist. So what you just expressed, I think, covered all those scales. And I think

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:47.280
that's part of the saying, your formalism has to be scale free. It has to be deployed

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.840
for me, mathematically, in the spirit of the renormalization group. It has to be deployed

01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:01.200
time and time and time again. And as soon as you realize that, then you start to ask deep questions

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.160
about bottom-up and top-down causation between scales. So as soon as you've got a scale free

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:16.160
theory that can apply either to gamma oscillations in your hippocampus, or it can apply to natural

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.520
selection, led as Bayesian model selection. Then you start to ask big questions, well,

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:29.600
how does this very slow self-evidencing process contextualize and be informed by this very fast

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.360
self-evidencing process or information processing in a way that is emergent from just having these

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:43.360
same kinds of processes unfolding with a separation in this instance, temporal scales. So, you know,

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:48.080
Chris would wax lyrical for a long time about this. So you should perhaps you can get Chris and

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.640
Mike together. I think that's a very good idea. I think I should start doing that. I know the

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.680
last, I think you Kurt and Mike, I think spoke together as well, if I recall correctly, I can't

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.360
remember. Yes. Yes. I wanted to ask you, when you think about this project that everyone's talking

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:10.800
about, and Markov blankets, do you think that because some systems are so complex, do you

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.800
find, do you think there will be any sort of indirect or hidden causal relationships that

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.800
might hinder this from happening? What sort of applications or techniques should be employed

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.280
to effectively identify Markov blankets within complex systems?

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:37.760
Ah, right. Yeah. So this is a very sort of practical issue. And it would be very nice to be able to

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:47.680
sort of parcelate the brain, for example, or parcelate an institution or an economy to be able

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:56.720
to identify the different Markov blankets given some empirical data. There is a worked example

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.160
of this, which is little known because it's just so complicated. It's almost impossible to read,

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:09.600
but I wrote it and I'm quite proud of it. And I think it was in network science, but it was

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:19.040
exactly the challenge of taking brain imaging data with thousands, hundreds of thousands of

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:25.200
measurements of activity over time, and then parcelating it at different scales. So it was

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.680
exactly what we're just talking about. It was creating Markov blankets and Markov blankets

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:38.320
and doing it in a way that was empirically constrained by measuring the connectivity

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.160
and its sparsity to imply where the Markov blankets were. And then once you've got a Markov

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.760
blanket, those now constitute the Intel states of a bigger Markov blanket. And then you can sort

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:57.920
of carve up the entire brain at successively course from course spatial scales. And what was

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:08.320
really interesting is a phenomena that is, I was going to say emergent, but in fact it's actually

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:16.480
baked into the normalization group that you would access mathematically, or you would use to access

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:23.200
the scale free behavior, at least formalize or naturalize it, that things get slower as they

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:32.240
get bigger. So we could actually estimate the time constants of the neuronal fluctuations

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:40.640
and implicit belief updating associated with different spatial scales ranging from a cubic

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:46.640
centimeter or millimeter or so of the brain through to entire frontal lobes. And then we can

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:53.600
extrapolate out to very, very big things and very, very small things and look at the characteristic

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.440
time scales. It was just implicit by scanning through the time scales by having lots and lots,

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:06.160
you know, literally hundreds of thousands, well at least a thousand, a thousand little Markov blankets

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:12.800
all jostling together, partitioned and then moving to say a hundred of them and then to ten.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.040
And just by extrapolating, you could then think about sort of collections of brains,

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:26.080
ten brains, or a tenth of a cubic centimeter of the brain right the way down to the quantum scale.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.080
And just look at the different time constants that were engaged. So that was a really interesting

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:36.880
academic exercise, but it did rest as the same, being able to identify Markov blankets. What

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:45.760
you're asking though is a key issue in terms of complex system analysis and modelling, being able

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:53.200
to carve the system in the right kind of way in order to usually to simulate it in a way that

01:17:53.200 --> 01:18:00.640
allows you to do forecasting or scenario modelling and the like or projecting a response to a

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:07.760
therapeutic intervention in say clinical neuroscience or psychiatry through to weather forecasting.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.680
You know, getting the right course-graining, the right Markov blankets in plain is absolutely

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:19.120
essential. There are lots of people working on that at the moment. One email exchange I've had

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.320
this week is from a gentleman called Jeff Beck who's taken on the very deep challenge

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:32.240
of considering Markov blankets that wander around. So one interesting aspect

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:41.120
of a simple definition of a Markov blanket is that it depends upon a probability distribution

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:50.400
that exists over a non-trivial amount of time. But if you think of something like a candle flame

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.600
that is moving and furthermore the constituents, the molecules and the irons that constitute

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:06.560
the plasma that is the surface of the flame, is it fair to say that the flame has a Markov blanket

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:13.600
given all its constituent molecules, i.e. other small-scale Markov blankets, are continually

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:23.120
being exchanged and moving and wandering around. So he's taken on the challenge of taking Markov

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:30.320
blankets into this sort of more liberal domain and dynamic domain and see if one can still apply

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.480
the free energy principle in a practical way. But to do that, he has to have at least simulations

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:44.080
on numerical studies that allow him to actually identify Markov blankets that move like waves

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:51.040
in certain media. So that's still an outstanding problem which a lot of people, when I say a lot,

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:57.600
a few key postcomings are looking at and I think it's a very useful ability to be inquiring.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.040
That's quite fascinating. It's great to see that so many different people are working on this at

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.120
this point because when you look online and you look at the amount of citations, I mean you are

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.400
one of the most cited neuroscientists on the planet and it's great to see that a lot of people

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.040
are taking these concepts seriously and trying to roll with it. Looking ahead to the future,

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:22.640
what directions or advancements do you anticipate in the study of Markov blankets, for example,

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.840
except for the one you just mentioned? Where do you think the free energy principle is going from here?

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:38.000
I think there are probably three directions of travel and we've implicitly already covered

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:48.400
the most important ones in our conversation. So the first one is indeed computational psychiatry

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:56.720
and computational neurology. I mean in a sense all the work that Chris Frith and I and many other

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:04.560
colleagues put in decades ago into understanding functional brain architectures via brain imaging

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:10.800
was in the service of ultimately asking questions about neurology and psychiatry and much of the

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:18.880
theorising that led to active inference and the free energy principle inherited from the data

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:26.160
analytic and modelling that we were applying to make sense of brain imaging data and realised

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.960
exactly the same principles could be applied to the brain or when I say realised we're told by

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:36.880
people like Geoffrey Hinton you can apply the same principles to the brain, the Helmholtz machine.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:45.680
So that's one direction of travel I think. Again, I use the word naturalising. I recently

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.160
learned what it means and I think it's a useful phrase to naturalise psychopathology in a way

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.800
that you can write down the laws and the maths and you can start to create in silico patients

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:04.320
and digital twins and intervene on them without actually giving drugs or psychotherapeutic

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:10.640
interventions to patients until you've shown. To a certain extent that style of approach is

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:16.880
already starting to bite not in the context of the free energy principle explicitly but certainly

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:25.520
in the modelling of things like epilepsy. Having naturalised a pathophysiology say the

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:31.200
transmission of epileptic discharges and seizure activity in the brain to the extent you can

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.040
actually put it in the computer and start to do weather forecasting of this particular person's

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:42.480
brain and what might happen if we did this and that. I think that's one very exciting way forward.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:50.080
Another complement of that sort of applied application of the free energy principle

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.880
would be the ability to phenotype people. So there's a phrase computational phenotyping which

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:04.720
I quite like which basically means being able to characterize this person or this cohort

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:12.080
in terms of the parameters of their generative models that they use to explain their world

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:20.160
and that provides a really powerful and efficient summary on this person and in terms of their beliefs

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:26.400
and their belief updating and their prior commitments and being able to be able to measure

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:32.320
and quantify somebody in that kind of way can be very very useful not only in terms of tracking

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.160
the responses to therapy but also just getting the right nosologies the right way of carving up

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.480
various psychiatric conditions and their etiologies because now you've got a naturalised

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.760
process theory under the hood. So that's one kind of thing. The other direction of travel I think is

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:56.960
in artificial intelligence just actually building see practically what the free energy principle

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:09.040
brings to the table is not really a pretty first principles account of existence and sentient

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:16.480
behaviour but practically another strange inversion another denit strange inversion

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.640
instead of having to instead of having to understand the system in terms of its dynamics

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.640
as you would the complex system modelling you're trying to understand the underlying mechanics

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.400
by saying well these dynamics this set of say differential equations looks as if

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.600
it's performing a gradient flow on this light who not functional this

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:49.360
Lagrangian and I'm going to try and estimate what this what this underlying potential function

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.960
is that causes my dynamics and it's best a simple explanation for the complex system I want to

01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:06.720
understand. For me of course that's always going to be this surprise or the log marginal likelihood

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:13.920
or the free energy bounds on that but what you can do is if you know that the dynamics of your

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.960
complex system can always be expressed as a gradient flow on a free energy functional

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.800
of a gerative model where the gerative model just scores or articulates characteristics states of

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:34.880
being that you want to emulate then what you can do is you can just write down the free energy

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.040
functional of your preferred states of being and then just integrate the system to reproduce

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.240
the sentient behavior that you would have seen if this thing existed and had these was attracted

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.520
to these characteristics states so it's a really powerful way of building machines that look as

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.720
if they exist in a particular way of course that's the aspiration of machine learning and

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:03.200
artificial intelligence you know and so it's certainly in principle you could deploy the

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:09.360
free energy principle in the context of building artifacts that do the right kind of belief updating

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:16.160
by the right kind of course I mean being able to model their world where their world is basically

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.880
the world of users basically you and me which brings us to the third direction of travel which is

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.640
the kind that Chris Fifth would like which is you know the explicit acknowledgement that

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.000
what is really interesting here is this scale free application of free energy principle where

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.400
you've got lots of different free energy minimizing self-evidencing Markov blankets

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.640
all living in Markov blankets of a different scale in institutions and theologies and their

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:50.240
ideologies and your ethnic bounds and all that so how does that unfold and how do you get the

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:57.360
right kinds of ecosystems that have this joint free energy minimizing behaviors that does not

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:06.160
incur upon or require certain Markov blankets to be vitiated or destroyed you know so what

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.600
we're talking about now is a physics of an ecology that has sustainability at its heart

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:20.320
or at its core because the whole point of the free energy principle it's a description of systems

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.960
that have an attracting set and how they sustain themselves within that attracting set so I would

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.600
imagine that the free energy principle will be useful and indeed pursuing this with colleagues

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:40.960
that and versus AI so my colleagues in industry this this is one application the free energy

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:49.200
principle in the service of in you know underwriting in a principled way the aspirations of all

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.240
right-minded people engaged in designing the next version of the world the world wide web

01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.720
or artificial intelligence or information services and speak not to growth but speak

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:08.080
to sustainability that you're a biomimetic take on sustainable ecosystems but in this instance

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.840
ecosystems of intelligence so that was a bit hand wavy but it's you know it really is a fascinating

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.200
game when you start to talk to people who are actually in charge of engineering the next the

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.800
next web there really is so much potential um there's something I wanted to ask and I forgot

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.840
about it earlier but I was thinking about Markov blankets and how they they play this role um to

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:36.080
sort of this differentiate between let's say it can sort of play a role between differentiated

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:43.600
between a self and an other in a sense and does it have any role or impact when it comes to free will

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:51.040
how can you incorporate these ideas together well let's do my games

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.040
um so the self versus others

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:59.280
check the sound there as your sound is my sound good on your side

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.320
my sound is good and your sound is good otherwise yeah good

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:15.600
are you hear me yeah I can okay so I think you picked two ideas um

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.160
I haven't been able to return to that question um so let's um self and services

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.920
uh sorry just having an issue with your audio

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.560
um okay are you

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.920
okay are you okay no no sorry I was having issues with this audience

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.400
yes I couldn't hear you for about

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.920
it's back it's back sorry what did you do

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:06.560
okay so what I mean was when you think of Markov blankets they can indirectly play a

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.240
role in differentiating between a self and an other

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.240
how is this possible is this what's the trait of the free energy principle and

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.600
Markov blanket and what role does this

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.800
when it comes to

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:31.200
right yes thank you okay um so the self versus other I think is really important um

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.080
it was irrespective of

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:43.840
issue that that's that's that's what we didn't know we haven't covered any of our conversations

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840
and it is the

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.400
and so you're thinking about early development and

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.400
I myself have been thinking of a new goal in Charles as to engage in that kind of work

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:05.600
out behind the world of this system and of course the first thing that I think we need to

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:13.040
um and recognize where the further is that is that another is not part of itself you know

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:19.280
the free energy which shall enslave to being right in the sense and um you know

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.160
as to

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.080
so

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:57.280
So I think that's quite the notion of just having blood in the blood of others, in a

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.280
clear way.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:05.040
It's a really central aspect of having a model of pregnancy, building estimations and illusions

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:09.040
about women and the world, and what behind your model of pregnancy, when you're looking

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.880
well, that's what it means like you and your mother.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:22.880
So I would, I know that, you know, and I think that's how she's going to do that, which I'm going to introduce now.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.880
There are a lot of my colleagues who have done this, you know, and you've got an actual

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.880
attention on the side of it.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.880
There's, you know, there's a hundred years on your side, so I think it's certainly

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.880
the exercise of the audience of that, and I've also seen a course in human-human

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:45.880
disasters, as you can see, and I'm sure you've heard about it, because certain things tend to be

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.880
different, and that's there, and in between, the modern world model of the, I think that

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.880
is the world model, and it's not as good as the modern world model.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:59.880
It's part of itself, I mean, I think, I have access to every kind of, like, anything,

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.880
including your children.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:06.880
So I think that's how the space needs to go in, and how the modern world has to be

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.880
experienced, and I think that's the way it's constituted by how it's going to happen, you know,

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.880
and so I think that's a really important point, and I think that, you know, that was in terms of

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.880
how it really is, as long as it's science, you know, that kind of thing, you've got

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.880
additional structures, and so on and so forth.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:30.880
I think that's what we're talking about, you know, to, you know,

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:40.880
in order to have, you know, in a certain psychology sense, I have to be able to select from

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880
something.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:47.880
So what are the things that I'm going to select from, and what, well, you know,

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:53.880
the energy business, and that's from your active influence, and those are the things that

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.880
are going to have to go to the models of their future.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.880
So I can select from those kind of actual features that are under their control.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.880
So for example, which is that sound, which is going to have to go to models, and then

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.880
contain the consequences of that kind of thing, policies.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.880
And I think in a position position, what we know and what we can select is the role of

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:22.880
the available and what we have in mind as a part of the modern world models.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.880
So this is just a statistician's matter.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.880
It's just amazing modern selection.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.880
But it's quite wide, and the context is selective, it's interesting.

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:41.880
For me, that is also a nice, nice answer to the words, in the real world,

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.880
in the real world of employment, you know, in the real world.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.880
And I think that's what I'm going to say.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.880
I notice it's posing a price to age.

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.880
It's a very new price to patients.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.880
And that's the objective model of their future.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.880
So you wouldn't have to buy the virus, and you wouldn't have to buy some thermostat.

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:03.880
But it would apply to a bigger and more new kind of thing.

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.880
So that would be one thing.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.880
There are other ways of using this in the basic level, in terms of the terms of the

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.880
casting of the virus.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.880
I think what's more interesting now is the amount of energy that you can see

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.880
in the cell going on, and I think that's one of the various models

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.880
that are there for these people.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:32.880
I think that sort of brings me to something I wanted to ask you

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:36.880
from the very beginning, with the free energy principle in mind,

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.880
what do you call is the meaning or purpose of life?

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:53.880
Well, as a physicist, I don't really have too much of a question.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.880
It has no meaning.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:01.880
So from the point of view of physicists observing a universe that was comprised of things,

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:08.880
what will not the free energy principle is saying is that if this universe is settling

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.880
on to an attracting set, and if they are all like attractors,

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:20.880
then it must be the case that it is, on average, maximizing the energy of being

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.880
on things, attracting the characteristic states.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.880
It's just like it's rolling to the bottom of a hole.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.880
That's it.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.880
What way of reading that rolling to the bottom of a hole,

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:39.880
that convergence to the attractive set,

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:45.880
is in terms of a minimization of thermodynamic free energy.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.880
The special claim that's brought to the table by the free energy principle

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.880
is the assertion of a Markov blanket.

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.880
Now, you can read the minimization of thermodynamic free energy

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:02.880
in terms of a minimization of certain beliefs, inference,

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:06.880
where the beliefs are held by internal states,

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.880
but they are about external states.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.880
So this is important.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.880
I've phrased it like that because of your purpose on the meaning.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:22.880
So the free energy principle gives you what people like a Ramster custom,

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:29.880
which is exactly the same as physical mechanics,

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.880
exactly the same as physical mechanics, exactly the same as quantum mechanics.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.880
The only difference is that you've got a Markov blanket in your partition

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.880
inside the outside.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.880
So in this and only this situation,

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.880
when you talk about beliefs having a meaning about something else,

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.880
there is no something else unless you have a Markov blanket.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.880
You can't get meaningful information in statistical mechanics.

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.880
It's just the probability of being in the state,

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.880
whereas in the free energy principle, it actually requires being now.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.880
So this particular physical state has a meaning in the nation,

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.880
in every sense it is explaining its hypothesis about it is a model of

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.880
this external state about something else, this illusion of what might be out there.

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.880
So I think that the meaning of life,

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:30.880
if there is life in the sense of there being a Markov blanket,

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.880
there is emergent meaning and that meaning is found in the internal dynamics of life

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:39.880
and its meaning is established in a relational sense.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:47.880
This is the relation of the internal sense making,

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.880
the measurement of your quantum physicist,

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.880
of whatever is causing these donations and the sensations

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.880
that you are using to do your measurement.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.880
So this is a model to it.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.880
There is a levy and an election quantum information theory,

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.880
which I'm completely subscribed to.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.880
So that would be one way to do it.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:14.880
I think a slightly more popular answer to the question would be,

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.880
well, what's the meaning in my life,

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.880
where I am one of the superior systems that has this capacity for agency

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.880
in the sense that I have very precise dynamics

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.880
and that I have the ability to model the consequences of my action

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:38.880
in this very particular case where I can now infer what I am going to do in the future.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.880
There is something called expected free energy,

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:47.880
so you can compute the probability of a particular narrative action

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:58.880
trajectory into the future as basically a softmax function

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:00.880
of the expected free energy.

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:06.880
So the path into the future that has the lowest expected free energy

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.880
is the most likely action that I will follow,

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.880
and it will select very well.

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.880
I will select the path that has the lowest expected free energy.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:19.880
What does that mean, expected free energy,

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:28.880
in the same way that you can express log evidence as equal to accuracy minus complexity,

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.880
you can express the expected free energy as the expected information

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.880
minus the expected cost, where the cost is a surprise,

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:46.880
the negative self-evidence that scores the characteristic state.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.880
So if you are in a very uncharacteristic or dead dissipating,

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.880
then that would be very surprising, highly costly.

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.880
So you have now got two, like, affordances or imperatives or ams that you will select,

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:10.880
which is what I am reading, the meaning of life to be,

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:14.880
what is my life meaning, what is its purpose, what is my purpose.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.880
Well, it is the imperatives and the libel things I choose to do.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:21.880
What do I choose to do?

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.880
I choose those things that minimise my expected free energy.

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.880
What does that mean?

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:30.880
It means I will try to choose those things and maximise the expected information gain

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.880
or minimising the expected cost.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.880
The expected information gain is just curiosity.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:43.880
So the meaning of life for me, assuming that I am avoiding all those costly states of being,

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.880
just like, you know, don't put myself in danger or go out very much,

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.880
I get into trouble with my life,

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.880
but the majority of what I mean is the curiousity.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:01.880
It is basically being a scientist, the energy principle is like a person.

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.880
I think that is a beautiful way to put it, Carl.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.880
There are so many things I want to ask you about,

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.880
but something I often love to ask, I guess, is,

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.880
and I think it is because this gives us an idea of how you were crafted as a thinker

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.880
and how you really developed as a thinker over time.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.880
If you had to give us a Mount Rushmore of your favourite philosophers or scientists,

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.880
who comes to mind instantly?

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.880
Who are these people who really guided your thoughts growing up

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.880
and made you the man you are today?

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:34.880
Because I am pretty sure when people look at your work today,

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.880
from the time when time moves on, we are going to be talking about you,

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.880
have a feeling, the same way we talk about some of the greats,

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.880
and I think it would be great to know who inspires Carl Friston.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.880
Right, yeah.

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.880
Always a tricky question to ask that one.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.880
One reason it is tricky is my hero is Sherlock Holmes,

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.880
but Sherlock Holmes is not a real person.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880
I can't because he is my hero too.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.880
I think that is a great option.

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:15.880
I think the two people, when I read or reference with warm feelings

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.880
and a tinge of excitement, especially when I find their quotes,

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.880
are Helmholtz and Feynman.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.880
Herman von Helmholtz and Richard Feynman.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.880
Look, the Helmholtz reference, that makes sense.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.880
I mean, when you think of unconscious inference and all your work,

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.880
it makes a lot of sense.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.880
What about these guys really get you going?

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.880
Well, very much what probably gets you going about people like Mark Somes

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.880
and possibly me, I mean, he was a clear polymath.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880
I mean, if you just think about every move you make,

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.880
or certainly every move I make in my little world,

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.880
in trying to naturalise psychology and psychopathology

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.880
and more generally sort of what makes us tick,

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.880
you come across some foundational idea

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.880
or principle or decomposition that he has brought to the table.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.880
So you've mentioned the notion of unconscious inference.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.880
I mean, that's just basically the Bayesian brain,

01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.880
as beautifully articulated by Peter Diane

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.880
and Geoffrey Hinton's Helmholtz machine in the early 90s.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.880
So that's certainly one thing, but it doesn't stop there.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.880
You look at his work in perception generally,

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.880
he had all the one aspect of illusion,

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:43.880
illusionist thinking at least, down to fine art

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.880
and anything that was worth saying at some point, even if you said it.

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.880
But more than that, of course,

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.880
the Helmholtz notion of free energy

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.880
and the contribution to thermodynamics

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.880
is also pretty central to what we're talking about.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.880
Well, I'm the kinds of things I talk about.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.880
Interestingly, right down to something called

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.880
the Helmholtz decomposition,

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.880
which I suspect you probably won't know about

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.880
if you're more interested in computational psychology.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.880
So this is an expression of the fundamental theme

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:18.880
of, what is it, vector calculus?

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.880
No, variation, I can't remember my part.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.880
Anyway, the Helmholtz decomposition just means

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:28.880
that what you can do is describe any dynamics

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.880
in terms of two effectively orthogonal parts.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.880
One part is dissipative,

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.880
and it climbs hills or climbs down hills,

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.880
like the ball rolling down the hill.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.880
This is the thing that generates energy.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.880
It's a thing that does Bayesian belief

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.880
updating in an information theoretical

01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:51.880
of the energy principle context.

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.880
And the other part is called the conservative part,

01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.880
also in a solenoidal flow.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.880
And this part, if you like,

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.880
circulates upon isocontos or potentials

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:04.880
or probability distributions.

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.880
So this is, if you like,

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.880
can be read in many, many different ways.

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.880
If you're an engineer,

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:14.880
it's a decomposition of procedures

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.880
that you would use to assimilate data

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.880
or estimate unobservable states

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.880
to do inference as an engineer

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.880
using, say, a Kalman filter.

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.880
And you would have a prediction.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.880
So given my beliefs about states,

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:30.880
the prior prediction about what I'm going to sample next,

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.880
and that would be the conservative solenoidal part,

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.880
and then you would have your update,

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.880
which is basically a prediction error

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.880
weighted by its precision,

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.880
which changes my prediction, my prior belief.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.880
And that's the, if you like, the dissipative part.

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.880
That's my engagement in the world.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.880
That's what takes energy

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.880
and does the belief updating.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.880
But that is written down mathematically

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.880
very beautifully by the Helmholtz decomposition.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.880
And what it tells you

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:02.880
is that if you've got this,

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.880
if, by appeal to the Helmholtz decomposition,

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.880
you've got this solenoidal flow,

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.880
then you are necessarily

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.880
breaking something called detail balance

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.880
of the kind that you see

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.880
in open systems and non-equilibrium systems.

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.880
So there's a direct mathematical mapping

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.880
between the Helmholtz decomposition

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.880
and the class of systems that physicists use

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.880
and study,

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.880
which largely in the past few centuries

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.880
has been sort of

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.880
systems, closed systems that are equilibrium.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:38.880
In this century, it's now all about non-equilibrium systems.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.880
And that non-equilibrium aspect

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.880
is just due to the conservative part

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.880
of the Helmholtz decomposition.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.880
Also, it is exactly the thing

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.880
that makes us lifelike.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.880
It's what equips us with life cycles,

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.880
with biorhythms, with oscillations in the brain

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.880
at every scale of gammas oscillations

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:02.880
and our favorite hippocampal dendrite

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.880
through to our beating heart

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.880
and respiration, through to our sleep wake,

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.880
diurnal cycles, through to our life cycles,

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:14.880
through to the orbit of the heavenly bodies.

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:18.880
All of these, that's not quite a biological aspect,

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.880
but certainly for biological systems

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.880
that break detailed bounds

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.880
and have this particular kind of itinerancy,

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.880
while still maintaining their integrity

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:32.880
and a free energy principle.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.880
Then you've got a description of biotic self-organization

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.880
that foregrounds oscillations and rhythms

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.880
and arenses returning to the states I was once in,

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:45.880
which of course is part of this

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:48.880
sort of keeping our stuff within characteristic states.

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.880
So I got on a little bit there about Helmholtz.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:54.880
You can see why you're such a fan of Helmholtz.

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.880
I mean, it's clear.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.880
You can see the joy in your face when you're talking about this,

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.880
and it's very fascinating work as well.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.880
It makes sense why this really gets you going.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.880
And Feynman, what about Feynman, really?

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.880
Because Feynman, I'm a huge fan of Feynman's work.

01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.880
Sometimes even for fun, I end up watching Feynman lectures

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:13.880
just to keep me calm at night.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.880
Yeah, it's one side of the entertainment

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.880
that I can enjoy.

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:21.880
My wife watches as well.

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.880
My wife is a nurse and not into the physics.

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.880
But yeah, now he's a very alluring personality.

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:34.880
But if you didn't know this,

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.880
it's possibly worthwhile just saying out loud,

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:41.880
I mean, the variational free energy was his invention.

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:44.880
So he was trying to, well,

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.880
one reading of the history is that it was his invention.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.880
You could have good arguments with Russian mathematicians

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.880
that can get at compression and free energy minimization

01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.880
from the point of view of algorithmic complexity

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.880
via things like soft induction and the like.

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.880
And certainly there is a school of thought

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.880
that really celebrates that sort of compression view

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.880
that is described by free energy minimization.

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.880
But the Feynman view is much more closer

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:26.880
to my academic training and inheritance.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.880
So what he was trying to do

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.880
was to solve exactly the impossible marginalization problem

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.880
that people would try to solve

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.880
if they wanted to engage in exact base and inference,

01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.880
exact sense making, the exact statistics

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:47.880
to actually get a grip of the very best explanation

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:52.880
of this metaphysical world that of course doesn't exist.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.880
But that's intractable in the same sense

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.880
that he couldn't possibly integrate over all the paths

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.880
a small particle say an electron

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.880
would take in quantum electrodynamics.

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:06.880
He couldn't possibly normalize that probability distribution

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:11.880
by integrating over all the universe of paths

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.880
an electron could take.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.880
So what he did was to dissolve that problem

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:23.880
by converting this inference marginalization integration problem

01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.880
into an optimization problem.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.880
And he did it by creating this band on the quantity

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:34.880
he wanted to optimize, namely the log marginal likelihood

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.880
which is the variation of the energy.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:40.880
So that's all of the Feynman view principle.

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.880
It's greatest debt, I think,

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.880
but that's not quite fair on health health

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:51.880
so everybody else runs through from a cat through to a...

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.880
And base all the way through.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.880
Everybody, yeah.

01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.880
There's certainly people you couldn't mention.

01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:00.880
Anyway, certainly from a technical point of view

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:05.880
that that pathological formulation is so beautiful

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.880
and it is leveraged directly,

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.880
certainly in my personal work

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.880
and the way that I would formalize the free energy principles.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880
Not the only way to...

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.880
You could read the free energy principles

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:21.880
as dual to James's maximum entropy principle

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.880
but when read or written as a...

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:27.880
in its pathological form,

01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:31.880
that is really a homage to Feynman's original conceptions.

01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:34.880
But as you say, he's such a delightful person to watch as well.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.880
And like me, he was a committed smoker, so I like that.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.880
Yes, you love your cigars, I know that.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.880
I often think about that video of Feynman

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:48.880
where he's talking about a red flower, I think it was.

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.880
And he says his friend, his artist friend,

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.880
looks at this flower and then tells him,

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:57.880
you as a scientist, you're obviously going to break this down

01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880
and ruin it.

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.880
And he's like, no, no, no, it's actually because I'm a scientist,

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.880
I'm going to look at the cells beneath the flowers.

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.880
I'm going to look at every single flow of each atom.

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.880
He's going to look at every single aspect of this flower

01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.880
in so much greater detail

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:13.880
that it only increases in its complexity and beauty.

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.880
And to him, the flower is far more beautiful because of this.

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.880
And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:21.880
and I think that's something that you guys have in common.

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.880
Yeah, and with you apparently with you.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:29.880
It's beautiful because Feynman has that perfect way

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.880
of blending the science with the art.

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:33.880
And that brings me to this question.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.880
I wanted to ask you, when are you going to make or write a book?

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.880
Because your work is so complex to a point

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.880
where most people really don't know how to approach it.

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.880
When it comes to whether it's a neuroscientist, psychologist,

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.880
physicist, if they don't understand the work,

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.880
they're going to find it very difficult.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.880
Have you ever thought of writing a book

01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.880
that is a bit more for the layman out there?

01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:03.880
Yeah, no, I'm notoriously bad at writing accessible photos

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.880
of a kind I think would be required for a book.

01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.880
So I'm probably not going to.

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.880
What I've found tends to work best

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:16.880
is to have the next generation of people

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880
who are much more fluent.

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.880
Usually either because they're sort of

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:26.880
in a person facing kind of science

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:29.880
like psychology or medicine

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.880
or they've had a philosophical training.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.880
So I find these people are much better

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.880
than I am at articulating in prose and narrative form the ideas.

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:42.880
So they can write the books.

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.880
I'm just sitting back and I did try once.

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.880
There's a book called Robert Pryor,

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:52.880
Robert Pryor, MIT Press,

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.880
who has been asking me for at least three decades

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.880
when I go into writing the Free Energy Principle book.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.880
And he thinks he's got precedence

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:03.880
because his surname is Pryor.

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.880
So he thinks any book that appeals to the major pain,

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.880
especially the Free Energy Principle,

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.880
has to be commissioned by him.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.880
And he was absolutely right,

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.880
but the problem is there is stuff I can write,

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:20.880
it's so torturous.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.880
And I have to say that, you know,

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.880
as with the Free Energy Principle itself,

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.880
with its emphasis on complexity minimization,

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.880
namely providing a parsimonious explanation,

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.880
the Free Energy Principle becomes simpler and simpler,

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.880
the longer it baronates, certainly in my head.

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.880
So I've taken now every year now,

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.880
I write a paper describing how a simpler version

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.880
and a simpler version, that process will go on

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:45.880
at some point it may be sufficiently simple

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:48.880
to be attractive to Robert Pryor

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:51.880
or any other editor who invites me

01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:54.880
or asks me the question that you've just been asking.

01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.880
My suspicion is I will probably be retired or die

01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.880
before that was derived.

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.880
So, you know, but there are some wonderful renditions

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.880
of the Free Energy Pro and Con.

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.880
But certainly most recently,

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.880
the Active Inference book by Thomas Parr

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.880
and Giovanna Pazzullo, you know,

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.880
I actually say it there that, you know,

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.880
I was allowed to write the forward, but nothing else.

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880
Yeah, that's okay.

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.880
I was just about to ask you,

01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:26.880
what are some of the reading recommendations?

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880
I think that's definitely one.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:28.880
That's on top.

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.880
That's actually a book that I want to read desperately.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.880
And I cannot wait.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.880
If you had to recommend us any other books,

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:39.880
what type of books would you recommend

01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:41.880
to either increase our knowledge with regards

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.880
to the Free Energy Principle or Active Inference in general,

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.880
or just books that you find help a scientist,

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:54.880
philosopher in general to grow in this field?

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:58.880
I'm afraid I'm not going to give you a very good answer

01:56:58.880 --> 01:56:59.880
for that.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:00.880
There's a reason for that.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.880
There are two reasons.

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:04.880
One, I don't have time to read books.

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.880
When you get to my age, you tend to be,

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:11.880
you get asked to write blurb for books.

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.880
So I have to speed read certain chapters of books,

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.880
but I don't actually have time in my working life

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:20.880
to read books.

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.880
I can only review papers and scientific proposals.

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.880
That's even working seven days a week.

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.880
Any papers that come to mind?

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.880
Any papers that come to mind?

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.880
Oh, there are lots of papers.

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:35.880
Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you what they are

01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.880
because the people I don't mention will be very, very upset.

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.880
So I'm not very good at reading books nor recommending books.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:49.880
So what I'm going to do is what my father is.

01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:53.880
So he sometimes sends me books to read,

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:55.880
which he thinks are good for me.

01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:57.880
So I'm just going to mention the last one that I read,

01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.880
literally a couple of weeks ago,

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.880
which is Hell Go Land by Carlo Rovelli.

01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.880
I really like that.

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:07.880
So that would, I would certainly recommend that.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:11.880
And I think that had color written that last year,

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.880
as opposed to I think 2014,

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.880
there would have been more emphasis

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:17.880
because the Friended Bridge Bridge is just that,

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.880
you know, that viewpoint,

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.880
I think articulated slightly more in a classical setting,

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.880
in particular the pathogen formulation of Richard Feynman.

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:27.880
So I really enjoyed that.

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.880
Otherwise, if people are generally interested,

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:33.880
there are lots of wonderful papers, usually by philosophers,

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.880
usually by, again, people like Andy Clark,

01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.880
Jacob Howe, and Maxwell Ramstead,

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:44.880
you know, when he's wearing his philosophy hat.

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:46.880
But there are also lots of really wonderful other,

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:48.880
but you can just go to a repository.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:51.880
So Baron Edge has got a nice repository and GitHub

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.880
of his favorite FEP papers.

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:56.880
There's something called the Active Inference Institute,

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.880
by Daniel Friedman,

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:02.880
that is dedicated to trying to organize the material

01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.880
in a didactic or pedagogical way.

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.880
They're actually writing now, I think,

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.880
another Active Inference book,

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.880
which is an explainer for Thomas's and Giovanni's

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.880
Active Inference book.

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.880
So if you're interested, I think you go to the people

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:21.880
actually know how to teach and articulate these ideas.

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.880
It's funny because one of the last people,

01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:25.880
well, this was actually a year ago now that I think about it,

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:28.880
who talks about hierarchical Bayesian brains

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.880
and Active Inference.

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.880
It was Lisa Feldman.

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:32.880
Oh, yes.

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:33.880
Yes.

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:34.880
And one of the books.

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:35.880
Yes, exactly.

01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.880
And the book she recommended was Halkeland.

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.880
And this was just when the book came out.

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.880
So it's funny that you both basically talk around

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.880
the same topic and recommend the same book.

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.880
So it clearly is an impactful book in general.

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:47.880
Yeah.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.880
Well, she's also written some very influential stuff

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:50.880
in the emotional sphere.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.880
And there's now, you know,

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:55.880
quite a key player in the Active Inference,

01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.880
but certainly the emotional inference

01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:59.880
and intercepted inference field,

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.880
along with Anil Seth and colleagues.

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.880
Just to close off called any theories of consciousness,

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:11.880
the brain that you feel sort of go against

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:13.880
the free energy principle,

02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.880
anything that you know stands out that counter argues

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:20.880
this principle in a way that does sort of get you,

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.880
get you shield up.

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.880
No, I'm afraid not.

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.880
I think that probably affects the fact that I don't have

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:28.880
a philosophical training.

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.880
So I don't, you know, I'm not used to adversarial progression,

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:34.880
adversarial argumentative approaches.

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:38.880
No, I don't, you know, the whole point of the free energy principle

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:42.880
is it has to explain everything or it's, it explains nothing.

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.880
So if there is a viable theory of consciousness out there,

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:48.880
there has to be some way of, if you like,

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:53.880
reframing it or substantiating that right theory

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.880
by naturalizing it using the free energy principle.

02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.880
Remember, free energy principle can never be wrong,

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.880
so it doesn't need to defend itself.

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:02.880
It's just a method or a tool,

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:05.880
very much like Hamilton's principle of least reaction.

02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.880
Inherently unfalsifiable.

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:09.880
Yeah.

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:10.880
Yeah.

02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:13.880
And I think just, I'd like to say thank you so much

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.880
for all your work.

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.880
I clearly supported in the fact that I,

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:20.880
I quoted you a couple of times, referenced you numerous times.

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.880
So to me, it is replicable.

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.880
It is work that a lot of us are using out there.

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.880
So from my side, I just want to say thank you so much, Col.

02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:29.880
It's a pleasure.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.880
It's an absolute honor to actually chat to you.

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:34.880
And I really enjoyed this conversation.

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:35.880
Well, so am I.

02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:38.880
You've asked some really excellent questions.

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:41.880
You've kept me on my toes, but also kept me smiling.

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.880
Thank you very much.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.880
Thank you.
