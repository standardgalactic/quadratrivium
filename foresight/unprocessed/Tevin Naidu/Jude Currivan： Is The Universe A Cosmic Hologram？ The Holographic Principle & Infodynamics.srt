00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello. Hi, Jude. How are you? I'm fine, Terv. How are you doing? I'm great. I'm so excited

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
for this interview. I mean, I've been absorbing so much of your information over the past

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,760
couple of this past few days. And as last week, it's been, it's been amazing. Our husband

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,240
on your side? Yeah, no, it's, it's great here. I mean, during the summer, I'm sort of getting

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,400
to a point now with the end of this month, it's been so full on that I'm really looking forward

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,280
to taking an in-breath, hopefully for a couple of months, which means I, there's a lot I'm feeling

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,440
coming in. So I really want to be open and have the space to really, you know, appreciate that and

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,280
try and sort of have a sense of what it is all about. I mean, I can imagine your work is, is

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
absolutely fascinating. There's so many different topics we could discuss today. I can only imagine

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,360
the inundated emails you're probably receiving from so many people who are keen to hear about your

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,160
work. Bless you. Well, it's, well, it's very busy in a really good way, because I do feel

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,720
that we're so much flowing that, you know, now is the time. And people, you know, are really

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,080
needing to have some hope that's authentic, to have some sense of an underpinning and a framing

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,680
to a sort of a healed worldview, you know, not a fragmented perspective based on the old paradigm,

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,800
but the, but the evidence-based authenticity of something that can really, you know, empower us

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,360
to come together, you know, because that's the time, isn't it? And I know for sure. I mean, I'm

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,560
great. I'm grateful that you've started already, because I mean, I love to just get started. And

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,800
at this point, I think the question I want to ask you, you talk about this cosmic hologramdude

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,760
and governed by information. I think let's explore this idea. I mean, it's been around for many years.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,480
It's been around for decades, millennia in fact. But only now do we see a growing body of evidence

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,800
that supports this idea. And I think it would be amazing for the listeners and viewers to

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,360
listen to this evidence and for you to express yourself in a nice open platform where the listeners

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,840
and viewers can appreciate it. And just by the way, the audience are generally very technical

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,320
for this podcast. So go into as much detail as you want. Don't shy away from the physics.

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Yeah, just I'm curious, this cosmic hologram and everything about it. I'm looking forward to this.

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,760
Okay, well, there's probably a couple of convergent points to be making here. But let's

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
let's talk about the holographic principle to start with, because that really, as you say,

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,600
it's been around for a while now. And the sort of very early intimations of it really date back

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,560
to David Bohm. So we're talking about, you know, for if not five decades, as a sense of what this

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,200
might mean. But of course, the big move forward came when researchers were looking into the

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,480
thermodynamics of black holes, and people like Gerrata Hooft and Leonard Suskin and Jacob Beckenstein

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,800
and others. And the question really was what happens to the information that's actually,

33
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,640
you know, making up a massive star, when at the end of its life, its nuclear fuel runs out,

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
and it collapses. And of course, the collapse is so gravitationally powerful that it actually

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
collapses within an event horizon. And therefore not even light can escape. I know there's a

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,880
nuance with that with the with Stephen Stephen Hawkins work. But essentially, you know, you're

37
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,720
not even like an escape. And so at the event horizon, you suddenly get this blackness

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,720
that we term a black hole. And of course, was the star collapses, a spherical star

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,040
collapses as a spherical black hole. So the idea was, well, the is infant, first of all,

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,360
is the information lost? Because if it was lost, that would blow quantum physics out the water,

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,800
literally. So there's a huge debate about firewalling and what's happening all of that. But as time has

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,800
moved on, that has more and more evidence has suggested that actually no, the evidence, the

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
information is actually held at the event horizon. But then the big question was, well,

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,960
what is that information? And when calculations were done that related it to the thermodynamics

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,320
of the of the black hole, it was realized that the it was that the information was proportional,

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,880
not to the spherical volume of the black hole, but the surface area of the event horizon. And

47
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,960
then a few light bulbs went off. Because that is very, you know, you know, reflective of what

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,360
happens when on on Earth, we create technologically create a hologram, you know, take a beam of light,

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,840
we split it into part of the beam is is focused on an object, it's bounced off the object and it

50
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,640
collects information in that reflected light from the object. It then combines with the initial

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,920
beam to form a two dimensional pattern of information that actually looks like an oil

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,600
slick. If you actually look at one at that point in its process, it looks like an oil slick. But

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:36,400
it's basically a wonderful ability of our universe to be able to transform information into waveforms

54
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,080
and waveforms into information through Fourier transforms. And this is absolutely critical,

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,680
not just to our human made technological holograms, but also how the holographic principle works at

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,080
the universal level, which we can come on to. But so essentially, there was a realization,

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,760
you've got this two dimensional informational pattern. And when you throw another beam of light

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,040
through it, it projects what we call a hologram. And the point of the hologram that it projects is

59
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,160
that the whole is in every pixelation. So if we have a high definition, pixelation, then we,

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,560
you know, all the wholeness, if it's an apple, for example, you get minuscule apples throughout

61
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,640
the whole hologram. But taking this now to our universe, it was realized that from black holes,

62
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,760
we could extend this, what became known as the holographic principle to the whole universe.

63
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,640
And we could go back into the evidence for this, because there is compelling evidence now at,

64
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,280
you know, all scales of existence and many different fields of research. But the sense

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,520
is that the appearance of our universe, the energy matter and space time appearance of our

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,600
universe is not its more fundamental nature. But the appearance arises from this deeper realm

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,760
of causation as meaningful in formation. And I always hyphenize in formation to sort of really

68
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,720
emphasize its meaningful nature. But that meaningful information is actually accumulated

69
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,800
on the boundary of what we call space time, and then holographically manifested as the

70
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,840
appearance of our universe. So if we go back 13.8 billion years to the very first moment

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,200
of space time, not in a big bang, we know it wasn't big. I mean, that was Fred Hall being very

72
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,240
facetious. But you know that the implication of a bang, it wasn't, it was incredibly fine

73
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,160
tuned and ordered, it began in its lowest informational state. So as time has flowed forward

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,680
ever since because of that entropic flow began its lowest informational state.

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,480
As time has flowed forward and spaces expanded, that holographic principle

76
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,560
allied to other laws of physics that we can come on to has meant that our universe has been able to

77
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,440
undertake this evolutionary arc from simplicity to ever greater levels of complexity, experience,

78
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,640
evolutionary potential, individuation, self awareness at those levels. Yeah, that's the

79
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,480
story of our universe, because that first moment, not of a big bang, but the first moment of a big

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,520
breath, an ongoing big breath. And the reason that space has to expand is because that is where

81
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,960
the accumulation of the emergent evolutionary information is held. So space didn't expand.

82
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,280
There could not be more and more and more and more information able to be expressed in its

83
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,480
evolutionary arc. And of course, what happens is the pixelation of the holographic boundary of our

84
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,800
universe as Jacob Beckenstein understood is pixelated at Planck scale. So in that sense,

85
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:05,280
our universe is the reality of our universe comes into form at the Planck scale, which is a basic

86
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,840
measures of space and time and energy matter as a result and temperature. And so it all hangs

87
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,840
together. But that pixelation scale, that Planck scale pixelation at a spatial level

88
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,560
is as small as to a nucleus of a hydrogen atom as a hydrogen nuclei, nucleus is to the whole

89
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,320
universe is 10 to the minus 35 meters, it's trillions of trillions of times more minute than

90
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,440
our best high definition of human holograms. And the point is that so that is the way that is

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,080
what we call the boundary of what we call space, the holographic boundary

92
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,400
is able to encode more and more cosmic and universal information. But the point is also

93
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:58,640
that the flow of time itself at every Planck scale temporal pixelation, which is 10 to the minus

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,800
44 seconds, get your head around that, you know, it's like every that every Planck scale time is

95
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:15,600
like adding another, you know, another movement of the whole universe's emergence. Of course,

96
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
it is so minute that it's rather like us watching a television screen, you know,

97
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,280
the pixelation is small to us. So we see the whole image, we don't see the pixels. Well,

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,640
this is the pixelation of the universe, our universe's reality. So that's a start anyway.

99
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,560
I mean, it's a brilliant start. And I love the way you articulate this because it makes it a lot

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
easier for people to understand when you're talking about the fact that it's obviously

101
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,360
expanding in the terms of the way while in the way that we used to express it. But now you're

102
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,080
talking about it as information rather than matter in the same way we usually discuss it.

103
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,240
People that I've seen a lot of people sort of mistake that for new content arising, whereas

104
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,400
we know that, well, according to the laws of thermodynamics, matter is neither created nor

105
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,920
destroyed. So you talk about entropy rather than entropy. And I do, I do. And as a child,

106
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,640
this is really sad. When I was about seven or eight years old, I was always asking why are the,

107
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,600
at the time it was mainly two laws of thermodynamics. Yeah. But there's a third law,

108
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,720
which is relating to a closed system where the temperature of a closed system is inversely

109
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,360
proportional to its entropy. So my question for a long time was why are the two laws of

110
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,480
thermodynamics? Because, you know, I'm a great follower of one of my great heroes, Albert Einstein,

111
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,560
and to paraphrase Einstein, you know, the universe as simple as it can be, but no simpler. And I add

112
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,320
to fulfill its evolutionary purpose. And that add-on is really key. Because what I realized

113
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,600
when I was writing the Cosmic Hologram, and also more laterally, the story of Gaia,

114
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,800
is we can actually restate those three laws of thermodynamics to what I call three laws of

115
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,720
info dynamics. So the first law, if we go back to the initial, you know, the initial

116
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,680
first of thermodynamics, began, of course, essentially with Boltzmann, saying, as you say,

117
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,240
the energy of a closed system cannot be destroyed or created. It can change through time,

118
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:34,240
but it cannot be created or destroyed. So if we take the science going further than Boltzmann,

119
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
and bless him, I mean, Boltzmann was doing his work before even atoms had been validated. So

120
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,280
he was amazing, again, pioneer and great giant, for which I feel we should all be very, very

121
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,080
grateful. But taking that on, we now know that energy and matter are equivalent equals MC squared.

122
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,800
So that says that the energy matter of a closed system cannot be created or destroyed,

123
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,200
just changed through time. We also, for our laws of physics to work at all, and this is

124
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,480
something that really still some folks struggle with, but all the evidence is really showing us

125
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,200
that our entire universe is a, is a content, I call containered system, because closed system

126
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,080
has a very specific topological perspective, and it can be confusing. So as a containered system

127
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:31,440
with this sort of holographic perspective, yeah, it means that the energy matter of our universe

128
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,280
from its first moment to its last, and there is also now more and more evidence that it's a finite

129
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,400
life cycle can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change. Now that essentially is the first

130
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:52,240
law of thermodynamics applied to our universe. But when we also appreciate that in 2012 and since

131
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,880
there have been experiments that have shown that information is every bit as real as any

132
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,240
thermodynamic measurements, so work, heat, etc. So we also now know that we can start to expand that

133
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:14,400
first law of thermodynamics to a first law of infodynamics, where information expressed as

134
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,680
quantized energy matter can neither be destroyed or created, but just changed through the cycle of

135
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,680
our universe. Now that's fine. Because that in its essence, which is quantum physics, you know,

136
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,840
because of course, energy matter is the domain of quantum physics in description terms.

137
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:42,720
That's all great, but it has no notion of space or time. So it's the seed, it's the framing for

138
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,760
how our universe can exist. But this then, the second law begins to answer my seven-year-old's

139
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,320
question, why do you need more than one law of thermodynamics? Because the second law,

140
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,360
which you say quite rightly, is about originally the notion of entropy.

141
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,520
So the idea is that the entropy of a closed, I'm going to say containered now just for

142
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:13,040
consistency, a containered system in, you know, it has to increase over time. And there's been a

143
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,800
lot of misunderstanding about this, because a lot of folks think of entropy as order to disorder.

144
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,640
But what Boltzmann was really talking about was the micro, the energetic microstates of such a

145
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,760
system. And when you think about it, I sometimes use an analogy of a pack of cards, if you take a

146
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,560
pack of cards out of its sort of box, they're very ordered. Yeah, you throw them up in the air and

147
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,680
they land all over the place and you come together and they're not in that initial order. But rather

148
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,640
than order to disorder, you're just increasing the number of states through time. So every time

149
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,960
you throw them up and they land, more and more states are formed. So it's this it's this progress

150
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:05,440
through time of increasing micro energetic states. But of course, we now also know that we can see

151
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,160
information. And again, we can go into a lot more detail of the evidence for this, as also being

152
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,280
expressed, not just as energy matter in its quantized, its quantized form, but in a complementary

153
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:26,720
way of space time, that's where the holographic perspective comes in. So that second law then

154
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,760
when applied to our universe can be restated and in informational terms, that first of all,

155
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,360
the entropy, because I'm now talking about information, whereas entropy is about energetic

156
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,640
microstakes, I move from entropy to entropy. It just makes it easier. But the but the equation

157
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,080
that describes the informational content of a container system, and the entropy, the energetic

158
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,280
microstates of a container system is the same equation is originally defined by Boltzmann.

159
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,400
So we're onto something here. And so now if we look at the second law of info dynamics,

160
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,880
it says that the and of course, let me go back to the first law for a second, because I want to

161
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,440
bring in space and time here, because this is vital. So the second law of thermodynamics says

162
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,160
that the entropy of a container system can only increase through time. Okay, and we're talking

163
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,720
about container system here. So now we move into 20th century physics, and we now know the equivalence

164
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,240
of space and time. So relative space and relative time, lovely that they are, have to be conjoined

165
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,000
as invariant space time, if we're going to have a universe that hangs together. Yeah.

166
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
And we can actually talk about the universe that hangs together and the laws of physics and all

167
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,000
the rest of it. So we can then expand that first second law of thermodynamics from the entropy

168
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,200
of a container system only increasing through space time to the entropy of a container system

169
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:13,040
as its information content only increasing in our universe's case through space and time.

170
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,160
So literary space expands and time moves forward, the information content gets bigger and bigger

171
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,520
and bigger. And that's the entropy. Okay. Third law is this is cool. I love this because this

172
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,440
really came to me quite late on. Because I was thinking gosh, why is there a third law? Where

173
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,760
does temperature come into this? But the third law of thermodynamics, as I mentioned, says that the

174
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:48,400
temperature of a container system and its entropy now entropy are inversely proportionate. So we

175
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,640
now know that our universe began in its highest temperature form at the Planck temperature,

176
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,880
10 to the 32 degrees Kelvin, and its lowest entropy. So as time exploded and space has

177
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:11,600
expanded, the temperature has dropped. That drop in temperature is allied inversely to the increase

178
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,600
in informational content entropy. It is so simple to have. I mean, it all hangs together in this

179
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:27,600
glorious way. And then the final cherry on top of it is essentially that I talk about meaningful

180
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:37,280
information. Yeah. So the wholeness of our universe as meaningfully informed and holographically

181
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,320
manifested, it's framing can be can be done. It can be brought together with these three

182
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:52,320
laws of infodynamic. The first law is the most simple statement of quantum physics. The second

183
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,440
is simplest form of relativity physics. But together they combine within these three laws

184
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,680
of infodynamics, which with a hyphen, are three laws that bring together our universe that

185
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:15,760
meaningfully exists and purposefully evolves. I think it's incredible because this is what

186
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
we've been searching for for such a long time. People have been looking for a unifying theory

187
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,720
of this universe. I mean, it's been the goal when you think about Stephen Hawken and I know you guys

188
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,120
when you were the youngest participant and you won the award, I can't remember exactly where,

189
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,240
but you obviously met Stephen Hawken at that time many years ago. How old were you 19 at the time?

190
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,120
I was 19. And my my mental was Dennis Sharma, who was Stephen's doctoral supervisor when they're

191
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,920
at Cambridge. And then Dennis came over to Oxford. I was doing my physics at Oxford.

192
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,840
And Dennis, bless him, he just took me under his wing. And after Stephen and Roger Penrose,

193
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,680
who got the Nobel a couple of years ago, came together to present to the postgraduate

194
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,760
department. And Dennis invited me along, even though I was an undergraduate, I was the youngest

195
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,160
person in the room. I think I was the only woman in the room. And then afterwards, Dennis said,

196
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,680
why? Because it was all black holes. They were like, woof, this is coming forward.

197
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,120
And Dennis said, why don't you enter this essay competition? And I said, sure. And he said,

198
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,520
why don't you write about black holes? I went, sure. So I did. And I won the prize.

199
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,800
Was it 25 quid? It was 25 quid. In those days, this was the early 70s. That was beer money for a

200
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,080
term. The reason why I bring that up is, I mean, of course, we think of Stephen Orkin,

201
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,960
we think of theories of everything. I mean, there's unification of quantum mechanics and

202
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
spacetime general relativity. How do we combine these concepts? But also, when you think of

203
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Stephen Orkin, you think of black holes, event horizons. I know it's coming forward. It's coming

204
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,720
full circle. It's quite extraordinary. And I want to go into that. I mean, unless you want to address

205
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
the evidence first, how would you like to approach it? Would you like to go into black holes now?

206
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,280
First, talk about the holographic principle and how we've gathered more evidence over time

207
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
and certain experiments that have helped to solidify this.

208
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Yeah, I'd be happy to. And I think the other thing that's really key in all of this

209
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,640
is that our universe exists and evolves in this way, meaningfully exists, purposefully evolves

210
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:27,200
in manifested holographically and meaningful information. But the other key aspect of it is

211
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,040
our universe does so as a non-locally unified entity. And this, of course, if we can take a

212
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,720
couple of minutes just to nail this one down, I think, this is something that came out right in

213
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,680
the early days of quantum physics. And many of the quantum physicists were, of course,

214
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,680
scientists mystics, you know, and some of them went to India and started really appreciating

215
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,240
that the Vedic tradition of ancient India, the Rishis, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads,

216
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,600
were basically telling the same story that they were realising. And what became clear

217
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,360
is that for quantum physics, quantum mechanics to work at all, essentially our universe had to be

218
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,800
non-locally unified in its entirety. And of course, you know, Bell came out with his, you know,

219
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,600
sometimes called a theory, sometimes called an inequality. But nonetheless, it was a test bed

220
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,080
for this. And at the time, it was a theoretical perspective. And it was only many, many decades

221
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,800
afterwards, you know, we're talking 70s, 80s onwards, that researchers were able to start

222
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,320
to experimentally test this at greater than quantum scales, because it was clear it was happening at

223
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:48,000
a quantum scale, but was it able to be expanded to a universal level? So you had researchers

224
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,560
coming along and progressively increasing the scale well beyond any quantum levels to show

225
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:03,280
entanglement. And in 2017, then 2018, a group of, I think, it might have been four or five

226
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,080
universities, one of which I think the lead was MIT. And what they were able to do was

227
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,760
non-locally entangle photons of light in their laboratory, with starlight from 600 light years

228
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,840
away, but also triggered by light from a quasar, a very active galactic center,

229
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,800
two quasars actually, one I think was 7.8 billion, the other was 12.2 billion light years away.

230
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,480
And that was a triggering that actually created a level of entanglement that exceeded the inequality

231
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:44,720
test, you know, the thresholds of Bell. But beyond that, in late last year, the Nobel Prize for

232
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,040
Physics were given to three researchers who've been working on this for decades. Anton Zellinga,

233
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,240
who was also part of that MIT collaboration, Alan Aspect and John Clouser. And the Nobel Prize is

234
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,760
only given for settled physics. I often say Einstein didn't get it for relativity, because it was seen

235
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,920
as being quite contentious. He got it for the photoelectric effect. So the fact that we have now

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,520
the Nobel, we've got this experimentation at cosmological scales.

237
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,880
You know, we have all of the theoretical framing now to support this and the evidence across many

238
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,240
fields of research that also play into this. You know, it's an amazing and exciting time,

239
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,560
not just for scientists, because as we'll go on, I'm sure, to explore, this is important, this is

240
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,560
vital for everyone. A lot of implications. There's so many practical implications.

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,080
Exactly. I mean, when you think about it, as you said, Nobel Prizes are only given to settled

242
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,120
science. And I mean, he got it for the photoelectric effect. He didn't get it for what he's best known

243
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,520
for. And that's pretty incredible, because at the time, of course, I mean, he called it spooky

244
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,680
action at a distance. And we know that he wasn't comfortable with this concept. I mean,

245
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,640
he would have been now because I'm convinced he would have been now because, of course,

246
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,520
you know, he was he and the quantum physicists were working decades before the neutron

247
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,440
was discovered. I mean, let alone the hologram, let alone the cosmological understanding we have,

248
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,320
let alone, you know, the sort of leaps and bounds we've had to understand

249
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,800
the significance, the fundamental significance of information and meaningful information,

250
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,920
which means, of course, the slippery slope. Yes, please, of consciousness. You know,

251
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,560
we have to bring this front and center. Of course, what he did feel very uncomfortable about,

252
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,240
as did Planck and others, is that whereas quantum physics and what they're all come

253
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,360
really gave us the clues that mind and consciousness aren't something we have,

254
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,080
they're literally what we in the whole world are, that was literally pushed to the side.

255
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:03,360
And so it's taken almost another century and an inability with the old framing to reconcile

256
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,800
quantum physics and relativity physics, because they're at the appearance level of our universe

257
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,240
of energy matter space time, we've needed to understand this deeper level of causation,

258
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,640
which is meaningfully informationally driven, and then being able to show how information

259
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,480
expresses itself in these complementary ways, as the appearance of energy matter quantized energy

260
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,240
matter and entropic space time brought in the holographic principle, you know, I think he'd

261
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,200
be jumping up and down and going, yeah, because he was one of the folks who was saying, you know,

262
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,800
mind and consciousness are what we are, what the whole world is.

263
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,960
I mean, so Jude, I mean, for the listeners and the viewers, I mean,

264
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,720
I was introduced to work by Don Hoffman, and he told me it would be a very fascinating

265
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,880
conversation, and I clearly already is. But I remember when Don and I were talking about it,

266
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
he was telling me about your work, and I find it very intriguing, because I mean, Don has such

267
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,400
amazing work being done. They're currently doing the new test to experiment whether physics arises

268
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,440
from consciousness, and I think they just released it yesterday, I think it was, yeah, 26th of June.

269
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,000
So when you talk about consciousness, from an idealism perspective, because this is fundamentally

270
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,520
what the view entails from a philosophical perspective, it's an idealist view of consciousness.

271
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,160
Consciousness is what we are, and everything that there is technically in a sense. How do you work

272
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,720
around this concept of consciousness? How do you define it? How do you explain it to people?

273
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,960
Because obviously, this podcast is called Mind Body Problem, I mean, Mind Body Solution for a reason.

274
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Absolutely. Well, you know, the very terminology, what's consciousness, you know, you'll get

275
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,880
five answers from four people. And I have a very broad church of consciousness. And, you know,

276
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,960
a friend of mine, Professor Max Velmans, differentiates mind and consciousness and

277
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,480
talks about consciousness as a level of awareness. Whereas mind is fundamental, you know, we can

278
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,560
talk about mind as being cosmic mind as Einstein would have called it, the ground of all being,

279
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:24,160
you know, and so in that regard, our universe is mindful. And, you know, the way I'm working with

280
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,040
this, and my next book will dive deeper into the, you know, the ground of all being and the rest of

281
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,720
it. But both for the cosmic hologram and for the story of Gaia, I really wanted to show how

282
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:43,520
what I would also refer to as cosmic mind, an eternal and infinite mind, has thoughts,

283
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,160
a thought, thoughts, that, you know, we turn our universe, which is very much,

284
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,520
you know, pervading universal wisdom teachings. And in my own explorations, you know, as a

285
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,960
noetic experiencer all my life is very much the way I've experienced realities. But by

286
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,880
being able to articulate it is as cosmic consciousness, cosmic mind,

287
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:19,120
expressing itself as the appearance of our universe through the articulation and digitized

288
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,120
meaningful information. You know, I mean, we're almost predisposed to this now because our

289
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,400
communications technologies, you know, take the image of me, gather all the information,

290
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,720
the meaningful information about me, translate it into digitized ones and zeros,

291
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,760
squirt it down a cable of a satellite to your computer, you know, recombine it as an image,

292
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,080
does the same vice versa. You know, this goes back to the incredible attributes of Fourier

293
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,440
transforms, the way our universe can, you know, make this beautiful play of information,

294
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,960
waveforms, it all hangs together. But it hangs together with the evidence showing that it has

295
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,120
innate meaning. This is the key, I think is this is not random data, just as our conversation. Well,

296
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,520
I don't know, some people may say it's random data, but hopefully our conversation is meaningful.

297
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,960
But of course, the meaningful nature of our universe is not dependent in any way on human

298
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,080
sentience. It's a universe that is itself living in that sense, mindful, informational,

299
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,480
where everything in it from, you know, atoms and molecules to planets and plants and people

300
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,360
have a part of that meaning and essential purpose. So it's a broad church,

301
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,800
but it's it's it's innately the same fundamental stuff, the nature of reality.

302
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Jude, how what are your thoughts on Don's work?

303
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,200
I well, when I first got it, it was so lovely because Don and I met at the Science and Nonduality

304
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,040
Conference in in California before the pandemic, and had lunch together and really enjoyed being

305
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,160
together and have had a number of conversations since and I love his work. He's coming I'm coming

306
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:29,440
from this primarily as a cosmologist, and as an evolutionary biologist and a systems person,

307
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,720
and you could argue a philosopher, but many, many different hats. And because I'm so curious,

308
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,880
I like to join the dots and see where they lead. Don comes from it more from human consciousness

309
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:50,720
and how our human consciousness relates to this wider consciousness. And his book is very provocative

310
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,040
because of course, from the human consciousness perspective, our senses are not direct in direct

311
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,280
touch points with universal consciousness. We moderate, we mitigate.

312
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,480
Yeah, our sense of self through a number of ways of forming meaning. But when we met,

313
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,920
I realized that he wasn't in any way, decrying or not acknowledging universal

314
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,360
reality. He was only really exploring the ways in which we relate to that larger

315
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,000
understanding of reality. So, you know, as microcosmic co creators, as I call us,

316
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:43,920
of our universal living intelligence, he and I are very close. So, you know, I mean, we agree

317
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,400
very much. What I really love as well is he's working with a number of quantum physicists

318
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:57,920
in a sort of more specified way of how this works. But what I would say is the work that I've done

319
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,800
offers us the underpinning and framing through these three laws of infodynamics.

320
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,320
And I'm happy to sort of say to Don and the other guys, I'm really excited about what you're going

321
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,120
to come forward in this, because it's going to come, I just feel it's all convergent. It's all

322
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,200
the same direction of travel. I'm glad you brought up quite a quantum physicist, because I mean,

323
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,640
another theory of consciousness that circulates is that of penrose. When you think of Stuart

324
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,520
Hammerhoff and penrose, they talk about quantum consciousness and the microcubules of cells.

325
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,520
Your thoughts on that? Well, I'll write about this a little bit in,

326
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,720
well, I'll write about quantum biology in the story of Gaia, because whereas the cosmic hologram

327
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,160
was bringing the evidence and this underpinning and framing of these laws of infodynamics and the

328
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:53,120
cosmology and all the rest of it, that was back in 2017 in last year with the story of Gaia.

329
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,600
I wanted to tell the evolutionary story, not just of our planetary home, but our entire universe,

330
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:07,120
because the story of our universe, as my friend Brian Schwimm and I both talk about, is a story of

331
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,840
us. The hydrogen in our bodies is as old as the universe. We're not just stardust, even though we

332
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,600
are. We go back way back. We're all 13.8 billion years old. We're all 13.8 billion years old.

333
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:28,400
So in that sense, the evolutionary story is extraordinary. And what you see throughout

334
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,480
it and really came to me ever more strongly as I wrote the book or the book wrote me, I feel,

335
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:42,960
is a sense of evolutionary purpose. Because what you have all the way through is this almost

336
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,120
preparatory processes that things were in place that could then be assembled when the

337
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,840
conditions were right. If we go back before that our planetary home came into being about

338
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,000
five billion years ago, around five and a half billion years ago, the harbingers and the nutrients

339
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,240
that would create our sun and our planetary system, were all there gestating in interstellar

340
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:21,680
clouds of gas and dust, including complex molecules. And we start to get the sense of that quantized

341
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,960
nature of potential playing out there. Well, even within those complex molecules, we were starting

342
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:38,800
to get enzymes coming into being. And enzymes are vital to the speed in which proteins come

343
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,640
together and build biological organisms. Because the enzyme speed, those processes are

344
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,240
dramatically without in themselves changing. And the view very much is that that involves

345
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:01,520
quantum tunneling. And so when Stuart and Roger have been bringing these ideas of microtubules

346
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,200
forward, I don't think it's the most fundamental aspect of how this is playing out. But I think

347
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,960
it's an important contribution to the conversation. And other people such as Jim and Khalili has also

348
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,800
written on quantum biology. There is a view that some of them have expressed that photosynthesis

349
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,640
is quantized in nature. I personally haven't seen the evidence that's convinced me of that.

350
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,120
I think there are other processes that are at play that don't actually need that aspect.

351
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,240
But there are others where, as I say, in zomatic action and others, there are other ways in which

352
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:50,000
the DNA, double helix is formed and molecules such as posna molecules, and the way that that works,

353
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,320
that can really hold memory for a very long time, likely because of quantum resonance.

354
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,400
So I write about all of this in the story of Guy because it's very important. And it's very much

355
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:10,880
an emergent field of study. I'll definitely be putting links to your books below and to the

356
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,280
website, of course. I remember while reading, I was thinking to myself, there were two specific

357
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,560
experiments I wanted to ask you about while reading. It came to my mind immediately and I

358
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,680
thought of the observer effect and the double slit experiment. And I wanted to just know

359
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,280
your general thoughts on that. So I have one more question. But I think before I get to the second

360
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,600
one, just what are your general views on that? Because when I interviewed Don, I remember talking

361
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,200
about when we talk about consciousness being fundamental and the entirety of our reality.

362
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,200
And I labelled at the podcast a new experiment to test whether consciousness,

363
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,520
whether physics arises from consciousness, and someone commented saying,

364
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,280
have you ever heard of the observer effect as a joke? So I think with you, let's address that,

365
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:04,880
how that supports this. I really want to, though, expand this perception that the universe is the

366
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,000
universe, whether we're here or not. Yes. Yes, I think that's really important because so much

367
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,880
perspectives about consciousness is human centred. And I'm not suggesting that's problematic. I'm

368
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,880
saying it's both and. Yes. And the way that we as microcosms of our universe as macrocosmic

369
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:30,880
consciousness, sentience, livingness, mind, you know, because I think we can get caught up in

370
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,360
the languaging a little bit. And I want to sort of get a more so generic sense of this.

371
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,040
But yes, so going back to remind me, I think I'm losing the thread here. So with when we serve

372
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,880
observer effect, yeah, okay. The point is, we're embedded within a conscious universe.

373
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,360
There cannot not be an observer effect, because we're both observer and observed,

374
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,800
we are naturally embodied, we're inseparable. We are literally inseparable. But I think the

375
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,680
important point there is that the unity and unified nature of non locally unified nature

376
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,360
of our universe has two aspects. First of all, it means that although our universe exists and

377
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:26,320
evolves as a non locally unified entity, within space time, light is the cosmic speed cop signals

378
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,240
cannot go fast on the speed of light within space time, which means that we can have this journey

379
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,880
of 13.8 billion years, we can have a flow of time, we can have a causality. And this is important

380
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,720
when we start to explore super normal phenomena. Because although this both and

381
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,680
enable super, you know, naturalize a super normal phenomena naturalizes our intuitive

382
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,000
insights naturalize the synchronicities. It's a both and so there is this causality playing

383
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
through. So, you know, I was in a panel with Dean Raiden and the ions folks a couple of days ago.

384
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,160
And Don was being given a prize there, which is wonderful for his work. But essentially,

385
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,720
because it's it's it's a both and we are both observer and observed, we are inseparable,

386
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:27,440
but that unity is differentiated. It's unity and diversity, it's unit in radical diversity.

387
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,880
So yes, we're always we're informational beings within an informational universe,

388
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:44,000
whether we know it or not, we're in continuous dialogue, multi log. Yes, with all around us,

389
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,920
where we are, you know, we talk a whole world view of act local feel global think cosmic,

390
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,440
because we are all and we are uniquely our universe is breathing through us.

391
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,000
Each of us uniquely. So let's apply this this law of infodynamics, let's apply

392
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,280
infodynamics to different systems so people can get a better understanding of this. So let's

393
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,560
think of it from maybe let's take into account a biological scale or something like DNA, and apply

394
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,120
to something like human civilization, take it to economics, and maybe continue from there,

395
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,080
just maybe start off from a from an atomic scale, perhaps, and then let's work our way up.

396
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,280
Okay, let's do that, because what we're finding is that the informational patterns,

397
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:35,120
the relational dynamic informational patterns, many of whom we call fractals, not all the

398
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,240
relationships are a fractal per se, we have other relationships that we can come to,

399
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,960
for example, power laws, but we find the fractal relationships which are essentially geometric.

400
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,800
When Beckenstein was doing the the holographic work on information, and the pixelation at the

401
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,280
boundary of what we call space time, that plank scale pixelation on that two dimensional

402
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,320
boundary of space time is triangular. Okay, because then it can tile without a break.

403
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,800
It's the ideal geometry that doesn't overlap. So within each plank scale. Yes, pixelation

404
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,240
there is essentially one bit of information, and it's at such a minute level that when we scale

405
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:30,160
it up to atoms or quarks or neutrinos or and beyond, it has a lot of information already

406
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:38,640
at that accumulated scale. But what we find is that, for example, when an element is going

407
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,880
through a phase transition, for example, between an insulator and a metal, it's electrons cluster

408
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,000
fractally. Yeah, so from that scale, we start into because of course, the plank scale is much

409
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,320
tiny, that pixelation scale is much tiny. So we're out of atomic scale. We also find fractals

410
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:02,000
running through from that scale upwards. So for example, on a planetary scale, clouds are fractal,

411
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,360
in that sense, weather patterns are fractally based, river systems are fractal. But the key

412
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:15,040
thing here, and let me just go up to cosmic scale, and then I want to come back, because there's a

413
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,040
key point here, we find that at a planetary and a planetary scale, but also when we look at a solar

414
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:30,560
system scale, the solar wind is fractal. Some of the ways in which the resonances of planetary orbits

415
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,480
and planetary the planetary system as a whole have fractal relationships. We go into the galaxy,

416
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,240
we see fractal patterns here, we go to cluster galaxies, we see fractal patterns.

417
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:49,200
And in 2017, Afshadi and Skanderis and a group of folks looked at the cosmic microwave background,

418
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,640
which is, as you know, is the relic radiation left over from what's often called the recombination

419
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,240
era, around 380,000 years after the beginning of the big breath, where space had expanded enough

420
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,640
and temperature cooled down enough to become transparent, because before that,

421
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,120
space was transparent to acoustic signaling, but not to light. When that happened, again,

422
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:19,920
there was like a phase transition, where space became transparent, and therefore there was a

423
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,320
relic radiation that filled the whole of space at that time. And because the temperature that was

424
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,760
that was in play at that time, we think that it would have had an orange glow,

425
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,040
which I quite like the idea of really. Anyway, that filled the whole of space. As space has

426
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:44,080
continued to expand ever since, that those wavelengths have sort of lengthened to microwave

427
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,360
microwaves now. And so we call it the cosmic microwave background, and it fills the whole of

428
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:57,840
space. In 2017, an analysis from the W map, the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe map,

429
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,800
was able to show fractal patterns in the minute temperature differences throughout the whole

430
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,000
of the cosmic microwave background. So we have fractals all the way up and all the way back.

431
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,880
But going back to us, we find that the same fractal patterns that underpin, for example,

432
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,960
complex systems such as ecosystems, is the same fractal patterns that underpin the nodes

433
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,240
and the networking points of the internet. Yeah, we find, for example, moving beyond fractals.

434
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,880
So let's look at power laws. Let's look at the incidence, for example, of earthquakes.

435
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,600
We know that when we plot the incidence of earthquakes against the destructive power

436
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,960
on a logarithmic scale, the Richter scale, that they form a straight line. So in other

437
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,000
words, there's no such thing as an average earthquake. If you apply all the earthquakes big

438
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,120
to small on that, you know, that frequency, and then logarithmic destruction, they form a straight

439
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:06,160
line. It's called a power law, which says there's only one relationship for all of them, that an

440
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:13,600
earthquake that is twice as powerful logarithmically is four times less frequent. That's it. So there's

441
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,680
no such thing as an average, no Gaussian curve there. But at the end of the Second World War,

442
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,320
a researcher called Lewis Richardson, and then subsequently to that, a researcher at Miami

443
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,160
University, a gentleman whose surname is Johnson, but whose first name eludes me,

444
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,600
looked at human conflicts at all scales and measured them in terms of their frequency against

445
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,280
their destructive power in terms of human fatalities, and found the same relationship.

446
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,920
Slightly different pitch, but nonetheless the same relationship as for earthquakes.

447
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,240
Because what we're realizing, going back to what we're saying throughout this,

448
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,800
is the appearance of our universe emerges from deeper levels of meaningfully information, and

449
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:10,640
that applies to our human behaviors, our human consciousness, as well as universal consciousness

450
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,680
and planetary sentience, that brings forward these same relationships at all scales. But the

451
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:26,080
key here is if we have the collective awareness to make choices of conflict, then we can evolve

452
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,760
our collective awareness to make choices of peace. And this is, I think, one of the most

453
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,360
fundamental conversations of our time, because this is what this new understanding and this,

454
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:46,640
you know, this unitive narrative that can, you know, there's an underpin and framed by the evidence,

455
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,960
but also can underpin and frame our choices and their behaviors.

456
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,600
Exactly. And that's why, I mean, when I labeled this podcast, I said that this podcast

457
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,320
explores the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, but morality is a big part of it,

458
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,760
because whatever belief you have regarding the nature of reality or consciousness will determine

459
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,400
how you perceive your ethics, your morals, your values. And with your view, I see such a deep,

460
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,160
caring, healing nature towards it all. And I am definitely going to touch on these

461
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,240
practical implications. But before we do, I just want to definitely make sure that we

462
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,640
touch on as much of this, the science behind what you're talking about, because it's so amazing,

463
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:34,240
it's so intriguing. One thing I did want to touch on before that was, I mean, there was the big breath,

464
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,080
it all started, slow outbreath, you often talk about Vedic traditions and the Brahman and how

465
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,000
they started this concept. What happens as we go along all the way to the end?

466
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, the evidence we've got now is suggesting that it's a continued outbreath.

467
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,040
For a long time, there was, is it going to be, is it going to do that? Or is it going to bounce

468
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,840
back? Or what's going to happen? And we find that the acceleration, very surprisingly for a lot of

469
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:12,720
people, that the expansion of our universe began to accelerate again, about five billion years ago.

470
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,840
So it started with an acceleration, the first time, you know, the first epoch of the big breath,

471
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,960
it then slowed down because the balance of gravity and dark energy and all the rest of it,

472
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,160
one out, one in. But then a space that expanded to the point of about five billion years ago,

473
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,640
the acceleration began again. And it looks as though that there's nothing to, there's no

474
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,000
way in which that that is likely to stop. And when I bring the third law of infodynamics

475
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,240
into the piece, of course, the temperature continues to drop, as the information continues

476
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,240
to increase, you can see that there's a sort of a cycle here. Because the temperature of our

477
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,680
universe, I said, began at the Planck scale at the first moment of the big breath, 10 to the 32 k,

478
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:07,120
it's now down at just over 2.7 k. So we're looking to see that this, this life cycle,

479
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,480
rather like a bubble, yeah, comes to a completion at some point. The other thing is there was some

480
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,160
really good work done by I think Dennis Sabral, a few years ago that I referenced in the Cosmic

481
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,080
Hologram, showing that the sort of the, the, the, the, the epochs of stellar formation,

482
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,960
and a big, big acceleration about nine billion years ago, then another, but progressively less

483
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,120
and less fewer and fewer, because the hydrogen to create new stars is being used up. So the view

484
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:46,000
is that probably something like 98% of all stars that could form have already formed. Many of them

485
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,960
have come to the end of their lives. And again, you know, as I write in the story of Guy, there's

486
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,560
this incredible evolutionary arc, you know, of massive stars at the beginning that formed black

487
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:05,040
holes and supermassive black holes and galaxies. And then, you know, it's just a beautiful, beautiful

488
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,240
journey, journey forward. So my perspective, again, with the evidence, you know, I'll follow,

489
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,680
I hopefully follow the evidence wherever it leads, but this is where it seems to be leading us,

490
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,800
that our universe is finite in form. It's a, it's a great thought form, but a finite thought form,

491
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,720
in that sense, in the mind of the cosmos. And we're probably closer to the end

492
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:37,680
than we are to the beginning in that regard. And I mean, it does work. So a lot of people seem to,

493
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,920
well, from what I've gathered, seem to think that you're not, you're talking about something

494
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,360
completely different, but you're not, you're actually taking the current work we have, and

495
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,920
you're framing it in a different perspective. And I think that's important to note is that it's not

496
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,200
that you're making new claims in a sense. You're more just changing it and adjusting it in a way

497
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,840
that completely shifts mindsets altogether. How do you feel this has impacted the scientific

498
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:11,200
community? Because you know how scientists can be. I'm pretty sure you've been, because anytime

499
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,280
someone talks about anything that goes outside of the status quo in science, you complete,

500
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,160
you're labeled as so many different things that how has it been on your receiving end?

501
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:29,200
It's been extraordinary, actually. It's been rather wonderful because in a way, because as you

502
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,080
say, I'm actually working with the evidence and I'm working with the evidence of tens of thousands

503
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:41,520
of researchers. I guess what I can bring is an ability to see patterns and an ability to join

504
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,080
up the dots, because so many scientists are working in this incredibly depth of work, but

505
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,720
they're not seeing what so-and-so is doing or so-and-so is doing in a different field of study.

506
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:00,560
And what I can do because of my breadth of interests is I can see the bigger picture

507
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:07,920
of what it's all coming with and the direction of travel. And also as a cosmologist,

508
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,080
we're getting folks like Professor Brian Cox, who wrote a book with Jeff Forshaw last autumn,

509
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,600
last fall, basically on black holes, but coming at the end of that book to say more and more it's

510
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,480
looking that the appearance of our universe is not its deeper reality. I don't know what that means,

511
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:33,680
he says. But that's the point that cosmologists are coming to, because that is where the evidence

512
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:40,080
is leading us. Now, you're right, I think, you know, I'm also a student of the history of science.

513
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,640
And I can see how certainly over the last, certainly until the 20th century, there was a

514
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,200
perspective very much of this separation of science and spirituality. And I can absolutely,

515
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,960
you know, I've studied all the reasons for this and get it. But we're coming full circle or full

516
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,720
spiral now, because the leading edge discoveries, and they really are only in the last few years,

517
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,600
the holographic principle, the understanding of information, you know, my, my redefinition of

518
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,320
the laws of thermodynamics to infodynamics, it's simple. Anybody could have come up with that.

519
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,480
The reason I did it is because I saw it with new eyes, as you say, and I wasn't caught with the old

520
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,760
perspective. And so in that sense, and that's what Marcel Proust of course said,

521
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,040
the journey of discovery is not discovering new lands, it's seeing with new eyes. And so I think

522
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,960
it almost is a situation where once somebody is willing to see with new eyes, it all fits into

523
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,040
place. And it's not in any way dishonoring everything that's come before. We've needed to

524
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,840
take every step it seems to me. So I'm not into blame and shame on any way. But we do have a paradigm

525
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,480
that's actually not even 20th century science. It's 19th century science of a mechanical,

526
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,080
mechanistic, materialistic, separatist universe. And that has been turned on its head. And when

527
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:18,480
we bring consciousness in, it's not, it's, it's, how can I put it, it's for all faiths and non,

528
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:26,400
it's human. It's who are we, it's remembering who are we, and not sort of making any labels

529
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,360
or anything else. But this is where the evidence is inviting us to remember.

530
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,240
Jude, before I go on to the next portion, where I'm going to talk about the practical

531
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,920
implications as well as the Eastern philosophical aspects of how you came to your views at some

532
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,640
point. The last thing I want to ask you is, is there anything you want to clarify in terms of

533
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,080
the way you approach infodynamics, cosmic hologram, all of this, anything that you feel has always been

534
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:57,520
misunderstood, that you've been itching to kind of just get out there and let people know this is

535
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:05,200
actually what I meant? Not misunderstood. But I feel that there's still a misperception of people

536
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,760
who work with entropy. And seeing it as this order to disorder I was mentioning earlier,

537
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,880
rather than as initially an increase in energetic microstates and now an increase in

538
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,680
informational content and now an information, an increase in meaningful informational content

539
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:31,440
is this perspective that came through with people like David Bowman, Prigga Joan, and others,

540
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,760
realizing that in what's called a dissipative system, such as our planet and a person, that

541
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,720
there seems to be a sort of a switch around of entropy. So entropy, it's not order to disorder,

542
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,320
it's somehow disorders become order. And so what I've been able to share and more and more people

543
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,920
are now getting it, is it's the old concept or the misperceived concept of entropy as order to

544
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,320
disorder, rather than from increased energetic states and now information. Because then what you

545
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,960
realize in dissipative systems, let's talk about our planetary home, a dissipative system,

546
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:23,440
actually, energy comes in, energy flows through, what's not needed to support the homeostasis of

547
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:32,560
that system is then dissipated. If you think of that as information coming in expresses energy,

548
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:42,000
information therefore used as a coherence to, you know, to support the coherence of that system

549
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:49,520
and what is not utilized gets dissipated. So again, that then correlates with this perception,

550
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:57,600
both of, both of the meaningful information, not just as underpinning, but the very stuff

551
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,040
of that system, that that throughput enables its coherence through its lifetime, whether it's a

552
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:11,600
human lifetime or a planetary lifetime. But also it shows that then going back to that third law,

553
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,760
that temperature difference is a measure of the entropic potential.

554
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:26,480
Yeah. So that so that in a planetary, you know, if we have a planet where that

555
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,080
dissipative process stops, the temperature difference between that planet and ambient space will

556
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,000
will will reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce. Yeah. When we come to the end of our life cycle,

557
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,600
our temperature when we die, when our physical bodies die, our temperature then correlates with

558
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:53,200
our ambience. So the ability by maintaining a temperature difference in a dissipative system

559
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:01,440
is a measure of its continuing entropic potential. I see. Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

560
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,400
That's the that's the one thing that I think people have quite a lot of because, you know,

561
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,960
terms like neg entropy and syntropy and all sorts of stuff's come in, they're not needed.

562
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,360
When you understand it in these terms, you can appreciate rather like the epicycles

563
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,560
of medieval astronomy, pre Copernican astronomy, you don't need it. And what you get is a much

564
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:28,880
simpler understanding when you're seeing it with new eyes. So you know, the Copernican,

565
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,680
putting soul in the middle of our solar system, suddenly you don't need epicycles and all that

566
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,640
complications. And you don't need the complications of neg entropy and syntropy, which of themselves,

567
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:48,800
you know, violate this universal continuing increase in entropy.

568
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,880
I think I think it's very apparent. I mean, if you if you have a hammer, you look for nails

569
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,760
and science, I mean, it's very objective. So you're constantly looking from an objective

570
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,120
standpoint. I mean, it's very difficult to get a step out of that. And I know I'm the same in

571
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:08,080
that regard, because when I started this podcast, my views and consciousness were very fixed and

572
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:14,080
firm. And the more it's gone on, the more it's continuously changed and non stop. I mean,

573
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,640
at this point, I question reality all the time. But it's something I've always done.

574
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,400
But I mean, that fixed belief is no longer there. It's something that's open to

575
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:28,480
exploring these new ideas. I don't think that the child in me would have explored concepts

576
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:37,520
like this with so much just openness. I love it. I love it. I mean, I love it.

577
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:43,440
Yeah, me too. I mean, it's all it's all a work in progress. It's all a work in progress. I mean,

578
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,840
for me, what's exciting is having had my first direct experience of, of, you know,

579
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,520
multi dimensional realities, you know, no ethic experiences from the edge of fall.

580
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,200
I've, I've also it's both and I've also really, really, really valued, you know, science as a

581
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,400
process, as long as this Francis Bacon, who is the father of the empirical method, you know,

582
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,560
follow the evidence wherever it leads. And I do feel he's been given a quite a bad rap,

583
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:17,040
which I would disagree with. Because as a friend of mine, another friend of mine,

584
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,320
Peter Dawkins, who's a wonderful Baconian scholar, you really has guided, you know,

585
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:28,080
like you, you've been my guidance with this is that, you know, 400 years ago,

586
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:36,720
when Bacon in 1623, when they published Day Augmentum Sientarium, which was the beginning

587
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,040
of the empirical method, you know, Bacon's philosophical, deeply philosophical perspectives,

588
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:50,560
it seems to me, were that it wasn't going to peripheralize the divine as he would have called

589
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:57,760
it, but to reveal the divine through its empiricism. Because of course, he was living in a time of

590
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:05,520
Queen Elizabeth II, and then James, the first of England, Sixth of Scotland, where superstition,

591
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,120
you know, ruled the, ruled the waves in that sense, and the church's authority. So it's almost

592
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:18,240
come this full journey now, where leading edge science is, is revealing that universality and

593
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:24,080
those wisdom teachings and the wholeness and the divinity within everything. Exactly. And I think

594
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,440
just to put it all together, because now, as we reached the end, well, the end of this podcast,

595
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,200
at least for now, maybe we'll do around too. But let's talk about, I mean, unity and non-locality

596
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,640
is the basis of all of this. And at some point, it all comes together for us to understand and

597
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:47,440
realize that everything is interconnected. There is no separation. This is the sort of

598
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,400
separating things needs to slowly dissipate. And this does have practical implications.

599
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,080
I think as we get into that, let's start from your East, the Eastern philosophy that's inspired

600
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,000
this and taken because we've spoken a lot about Western science at this point. And I'm curious

601
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,960
for you to apply the Eastern philosophy into how we should approach the practical and ethical

602
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,480
implications moving forward with this theory. Yeah, absolutely. Well, first of all, as you

603
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:19,520
said, I mean, you know, our worldview is our mindset, our narrative, our underpinning narrative

604
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,680
is the way we see the world and therefore the choices we make. And we've had a Western secular

605
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:32,720
worldview of, as I say, based on 19th century science. And all the structures that came from

606
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:39,040
that, because in the 19th century, with that mechanistic, separatist, materialistic perspective,

607
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:45,520
you know, our structures became hierarchical. You know, whether it's our education, whether it's

608
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:52,800
our organizations, our governance or whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever. And now that's

609
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,160
completely been turned on its head and converging much more with universal wisdom teachings and

610
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:05,120
very much those of the Eastern traditions and the indigenous traditions. And so, you know,

611
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:11,360
for example, the Chinese, Yi Qing talks about in the beginning is the one not was is the one

612
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,200
becomes to the two becomes three and from the three 10,000 things are born, you know, the yin yang

613
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:24,320
symbol. And we haven't even touched on the feminine masculine and all of that. But that's so important.

614
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:32,320
But you know, the yin yang symbol has, you know, the yang with the yin coming out and the yin with

615
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:38,960
the yang coming out. But the wave in that symbol is often not mentioned. But the wave is that

616
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,360
creativity of what this all means. And yeah, I talk a lot about trinities, philosophically

617
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:50,800
trinities, you know, the masculine, the feminine and the child. And in that resolution, and that's

618
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:57,920
again seen through many, many traditions. We talk about the Vedic tradition, as we have before,

619
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:05,440
Indra's net. You know, the tradition talks of Indra's net as a analogy of the reality where every

620
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:13,920
reality made up of beautiful gems of many, many different colors and all different facets and

621
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:21,440
each facet reflecting others and linked by golden threads. Well, that is a millennial old description

622
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,520
in my perspective of the cosmic holograms. In South Africa, we, because I'm Indian of Hindu

623
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,240
origin and descent. And but I was born and raised in South Africa. And the South African culture,

624
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,360
there's this word, it's called Ubuntu. I love that word. I love that. I am because you are.

625
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,920
And that's exactly what she's saying. Yeah, it's exactly that. And Ubuntu is so beautifully

626
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,000
inviting in. Because the other thing is that I love about Ubuntu, many things I love about Ubuntu.

627
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,480
But I talk about, you know, often we're now describing unity and diversity. But for a number

628
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:05,520
of years now, I've said, let's take that a step further, beyond even unity in inclusion to unity

629
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:13,840
in belonging. Because this is showing us that we all belong. And that is the very heart of Ubuntu.

630
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,000
Ubuntu is so fundamental because you don't have to be invited into that relationship.

631
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,040
You are inherently fundamentally part of that relationship. And this is what we're discovering.

632
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:35,920
And so altogether, I mean, this unification, this, tell me about the overall goal for us as a society.

633
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,360
How would you like this infodynamics and everything you've spoken about today to be applied somehow

634
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:49,920
into it all? Well, again, these things, have you ever heard of somebody called Mr. Magoo?

635
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,560
He's very much in America. Yeah. And he always backs into things and then looks around and goes,

636
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:04,640
oh, that's the story of my life, I think. So a couple of years ago, with all of this and writing

637
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,200
the Cosmic Hologram at the time, and then the story of Gary, sorry, writing the story of Gary

638
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,200
at the time Cosmic Hologram would come out. I came together with a number of change makers

639
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:21,760
and folks who'd been involved with the United Nations for decades, and involved with the

640
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:27,200
Sustainable Development Goals and what's called Agenda 2030. And we're getting more and more

641
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:33,200
frustrated because this realization that they were coming not necessarily from the people who were

642
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,680
trying to negotiate them, but certainly the way they were articulated and then

643
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:46,800
led out very much from this siloed perspective, 17 goals and lots of measurements, but the goals

644
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:55,120
themselves and the realization from these 150 or so change makers that they could never be

645
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,640
implemented with that sort of mindset. I mean, Einstein said, you can't solve a problem from

646
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:08,160
the same mindset that created it. Well, we have a problem because of an illusion of separation,

647
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:15,360
a dis-ease of separation, we cannot solve it from that same mindset. So all that I'm sharing and all

648
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:23,200
the evidence is pointing to is overturning that perspective and bringing in this realization

649
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:30,800
and understanding of wholeness. So what these folks were really wanting to say is how can,

650
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,320
because they were coming from this perspective, how can we bring this perspective of wholeness

651
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,640
into the SDGs and Agenda 2030? And one of the things that came forward was the need for a narrative

652
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,560
that could share this, because we're a narrative species, we're storytelling species, you know,

653
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:57,440
we sat round from the very beginning sharing stories and sharing perspectives, who we are

654
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,320
and what are we? Who are we in the world? Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?

655
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:10,640
And in that sense, making meaning of our existence. So we now have the evidence

656
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,000
that is converging, the scientific evidence that's converging with universal wisdom teachings

657
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:24,480
to offer us a unitive narrative, to underpin and frame us to be able to come together and serve

658
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,760
potentiality for transformational change. So I got involved with this group of folks and I put my

659
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:37,120
hand up and volunteered. That's my mum. My mum always said, volunteer, volunteer. You may not

660
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:43,040
know what you're volunteering for, but volunteer. So I did and I was one of the co-authors of a

661
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:50,400
unitive narrative, that these folks took on board and adopted and the evolutionary leader

662
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,960
circle of whom I remember also adopted and others. But what that's now doing that came forward

663
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,640
just over a year ago, what that's done in the meantime, is that late last year, the United

664
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:12,480
Nations for the first time in its 70 year history, adopted a group of NGOs and organizations founded

665
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:19,600
on the unitive narrative, this unitive narrative. And so this unitive cluster now has a voice, has

666
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:25,920
voices in all of the things that United Nations are doing. But that's just one thing, because the

667
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,640
other thing it's now underpinning is bringing together folks who are really wanting to transform

668
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:40,560
economics and finance system from a unitive perspective. Folks who will look at regenerative

669
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:48,640
economics, doughnut economics, living systems economics, but all of it underpinned and framed

670
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:57,760
by unitive narrative that then deepens it still further into unitive principles that serves

671
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,640
the health, the whole being of our planetary home and our people.

672
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:10,400
Unitive education. How do we share this story with folks of all ages and in so many different ways?

673
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:19,440
And how do we share this in ways through arts and culture? Because this is what this is about.

674
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:26,640
This is the many, many stories that can arise and be shared from this underpinning of a unitive

675
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,120
narrative. So that's what I'm doing pretty much most of my time now and sharing this

676
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:41,920
understanding, but it's vital that it moves beyond understanding. It has to be experienced

677
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,840
to be embodied. Well, I hope this podcast helps to get that message out, Jude. I know you're

678
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:53,360
time-sensitive and we've sort of reached the end of this conversation, but I just want to say thank

679
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,160
you so much. And to quote, I mean, your work and obviously Ubuntu, I am a Cosmic Co-creator because

680
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:04,560
you are a Cosmic Co-creator and thank you so much for being part of this creation with me and part

681
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:12,240
of this experience. Bless you, Tev. And it's folks like you. I mean, I've done so many podcasts now

682
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:20,400
and I'm in awe of each and every one of you as hosts because your passion, your clarity, your

683
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:28,000
service is so, so important because the folks you will reach in their own way will share this

684
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:34,720
in their own way. We don't know where this ripples, but we know it does because as you say,

685
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:41,120
Ubuntu, we are inseparable. We are each unique and we are inseparable. You know,

686
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,920
this offers us authentic hope. This, I hope, empowers us and inspires us. And this for me seems

687
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,120
that this is the invitation of the universe and our planetary home guy. You know, they're saying,

688
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:59,120
come on, items to this adventure. This has to be one of the most inspirational. Well,

689
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,400
I'm feeling well-inspired. One of the most inspirational talks I've had so far.

690
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,600
I'm liking it so far because there may be others who are even more inspirational to come.

691
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,480
Yeah, I've enjoyed it tremendously. Thank you so much, Jude. I wish you all the best and yeah,

692
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,920
I'm looking forward to chatting to you again sometime. I'd love that, Tev. Anytime. I'd love

693
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,680
that so much. Take care, Jude. And yeah, we'll keep you in touch. I'm looking forward to this

694
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:35,680
hearing. Cheers. Thanks.
