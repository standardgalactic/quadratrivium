1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Helen, I've been trying to think of a way to start this podcast interview by giving you

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,520
the best opportunity to explain your view. And I think the best way to start is how I

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,000
often start with certain people. I did this with Keith, I mean with illusionism. I'm going

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,440
to do this with panpsychism. What I want you to do is give me a brief philosophical history

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,880
of the mind-body problem from your side, from how you grew to listen to this problem, to understand

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,640
it and tell me which philosophers or scientists have played the biggest roles in shaping your

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,800
current view. Because I think it gives us a great understanding of how you came to this view. I

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,800
know Berkeley is obviously going to be one of them, but I mean it's a great way to understand how

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
your thought processes have formed over the years. Yeah, okay, so that's a very interesting

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,600
question. So I think I first became introduced to consciousness. Actually, my dad introduced me

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,960
to the knowledge argument when I was still in high school. And so and I loved that. And I had very,

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,720
very strong dualist intuitions right from the get-go. So my first philosophy of mind class that I

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,640
took spent a lot of time discussing different particular physicalist theories and the minutia

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,920
of those theories. And I spent the whole time sitting there like, what, this is completely

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,160
missing the point, right? This is missing consciousness. Where are the feels coming from?

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,200
So I spent all my time sort of sitting there idly drawing little pictures and diagrams and

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,600
concluded based on this that there could be no such thing as mental causation. And what I was

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,120
drawing out was these standard diagrams that have been used to support epiphenomenalism. So the

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,200
idea that, you know, there's the physical world and every physical event is caused by a previous

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,720
physical event. And those physical events cause conscious experiences, but there's sort of not

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,360
any room in the picture for the conscious experiences to do causal work. The conscious

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,560
experiences are just sort of an extra that explains the feelings, but nothing more. So,

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,480
so I quickly became concluded that epiphenomenalism was true and my philosophy professor spent the

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,400
rest of my undergraduate career time to disabuse me of this and never succeeded. So my I while I'm

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,040
currently working on idealism and developing an idealist view of the nature of reality and the

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,960
nature of the mind body problem. I'm actually not not necessarily a committed idealist. I'm sort of a

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,480
committed antiphysicalist. So I have very strong intuitions that consciousness can't be reduced to

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,640
can't be reduced to something non conscious. And not only intuitions, I think these intuitions can be

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,160
developed into good arguments to this effect. But at this point in my life, I'm sort of neutral

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,720
between dualism of an epiphenomenalist sort and idealism of an epiphenomenalist sort. So I mean,

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,360
I guess you asked for people who had influenced me on this journey. And it's a little bit funny,

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,840
because I think I actually kind of came fully formed to these views that I have prior to reading

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,440
people. And then it was subsequently I started reading people like Dave Chalmers and going, ah,

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,360
he's said everything I want to say only way better than I could say it. And Thomas does have that

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
Yes, is very, very frustrating.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,440
But so I sort of I began my career as a dualist, and I put no stock whatsoever in the truth of

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,720
idealism. It sounded like a bonkers theory. I met Howard Robinson, who is a contemporary idealist

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,280
philosopher when I was in grad school, and I was blown away that he was actually an idealist. And I

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,560
didn't think there were any such people. But subsequently, it actually I started thinking

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,600
about idealism more carefully as a result of two things. One was thinking about just reading

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,680
Barkley when I was in grad school and thinking about abstract general ideas. So this is sort of

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,040
the question of that the early modern philosophers were interested in of how it is that we can have

43
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,560
thoughts that latch on to not just a particular thing, but latch on to many things that are very

44
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,520
diverse in different ways. So how we can have a thought, a particular thought about triangles.

45
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,720
That's not about any particular kind of triangle, but just triangularity in general. And so that

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,960
led me to reading a lot of Barkley and the early modern philosophers and sort of increased my

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,720
interest in idealism. And at the same time, I was being exposed to work contemporary work in the

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,440
philosophy of perception. And these people called naive realists. And naive realism is this view

49
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,600
about perception where the thought is that somebody should start with representationalism

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,760
because I think it's the more intuitive view. So for a representationalist, there's this world

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,000
out there and light bounces off of the object and enters my eye and stuff happens in my brain

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,840
and causes me to represent a mug that's before me. But what it is that I'm sort of directly

53
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,880
grasping is this thing that my brain generates, this experience of the mug, this representation of

54
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,280
the mug. I don't directly grasp the mug. I sort of grasp the mug that I'm looking at or anything

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,760
in the world in an indirect kind of way. And naive realists say, no, no, the intuitive view is that

56
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,720
vision is kind of like touch. We sort of reach out and we sort of grasp the object. And the object

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,360
is a part of our thoughts. And listening to this in grad school, and I found this completely

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,080
just insane sounding. How is it that my thoughts, my conscious experiences could have things like

59
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,760
cups and trees and computers as a part of them? That made no sense to me at all. And it made no

60
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,840
sense until I started thinking, well, but if the whole world is experiences, if the whole world is

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,600
made up out of consciousness, then maybe it's not quite so insane. And that sort of led me down the

62
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,320
road of interest and idealism and just sort of playing with it as a view, not because I thought

63
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,080
it was true, but because it seemed interesting. And I was curious, is it a view that could be

64
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,120
defended? And actually, the more I sort of played with it, and the more I thought about it, the

65
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,680
more I realized there actually are some genuinely good things to say in favor of this view. And I've

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,240
sort of argued myself into giving it significant credence, although I'm not a committed idealist.

67
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,360
I mean, there's so many idealists today, giving such great arguments. I mean, if you think of people

68
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,400
like Bernardo Kastrup out there, you've got someone like Donald Hoffman who does conscious

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
realism, but I mean, it's a form of idealism, in a sense, if you when you think about it,

70
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,520
you take consciousness to be this fundamental reality. I mean, you're talking about a difference

71
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,040
in the nature of consciousness. I think a great way to go with this is let's go with one of your

72
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,560
papers is called dissolving, I think type B physicalism. Yeah. Remembering the title

73
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,440
curriculum. Let's dissolve physicalism. Tell me why that's just go with it.

74
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,920
Well, I don't know that we actually can dissolve physicalism. So I kind of, I think there are

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,640
certain versions of physicalism that don't work. But I actually am inclined to think that there is

76
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,040
a plurality of metaphysical views out there that actually are each, not just internally

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,760
coherent, like from the inside, you can stamp your feet and say, no, I refuse to listen to

78
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,440
anything you say, but that are sort of deeply like internally plausible, I guess is maybe the way to

79
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,920
put it. So let me try to think how to express this. So I think it's, it's well known that

80
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,720
you can for, you can take and you can just refuse to listen to the other people's sides

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,240
arguments, you can say, I disagree with that premise, I refuse to accept that. And as a result,

82
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,280
I don't have to accept your argument, I'm going to hold on to my, to my position. So, you know,

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,800
when you have something like a physicalist faced with a knowledge argument, the physicalist could

84
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,200
say, look, I just don't think that Mary, when she sees red for the first time, learns anything.

85
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,320
I think that's, I think that's the wrong way of thinking about it. I don't think she'd be fooled

86
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,600
if you showed her a blue banana. But I think that you could also be a physicalist who actually

87
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,400
genuinely accepts the intuitive starting point, and nevertheless, can still defend from the inside

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:50,440
that viewpoint. So I think, and I argue in that paper at the end of the paper, the idea is that

89
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,160
it's a kind of mysterious. So the idea is that we,

90
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,400
we have a particular sort of cognitive structure to our minds. And that cognitive structure is

91
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,120
essentially sort of limiting to what it is, what kinds of things it is that we can understand.

92
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,880
And depending on sort of the formatting of how it is that our brain goes about making sense of

93
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,960
consciousness in sort of conscious terms versus physical stuff, sort of using physical terms,

94
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,520
it may be that our brain just is not set up to be able to match those two kinds of things together.

95
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,080
But it doesn't, that doesn't mean that it's impossible for these two things to be matched

96
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,920
up. That could just be a limitation due to kind of like our neural hardware. And so I think that

97
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,440
if a physicalist were to embrace a view like that, that they can simultaneously accept things like

98
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,440
the knowledge argument, except the actual intuitive datum, the datum that Mary as a human being, Mary

99
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,600
as somebody with an art cognitive architecture that works like ours, she would be fooled by a blue

100
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,640
banana. She would learn something new, even if she had all the physical knowledge, but it doesn't

101
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,680
mean that there's something more to consciousness. So I think, I think a physicalist can,

102
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,960
can sort of embrace what the dualist says and still maintain their physicalism.

103
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,200
At the same time, I think that a dualist can embrace a lot of things that a physicalist

104
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,520
wants to throw at them and really listen to them and still not have to be moved. And I similarly

105
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,760
think the same kind of thing for idealism. So I actually think that there's sort of a plurality

106
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,800
of views that they're not just defensible from the inside in that you can say, mean or meaner,

107
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,440
or you know, stick your tongue out at the other side and say, I refuse to accept your starting

108
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,240
points. You can accept the starting points, explain away as needed and come to an internally

109
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,920
plausible view for these very different views. And I kind of think that, sorry, I'm interrupting.

110
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,800
I completely agree with that. I think that when I started this podcast, I had such a specific

111
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,080
thought going into it. What I thought consciousness was, I wrote essays on it as well. It's part of

112
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,080
my dissertation. So I had my own view. But when I listen to people's coherent arguments, the more

113
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,320
you actually try and sympathize or empathize even more with these views, the more you understand

114
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,320
that if you set up a great bunch of assumptions prior to starting the argument, you can really

115
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:27,880
flow with your argument and you can give something succinct and not Nina Nina. So people can listen

116
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,160
to it. I mean, and you do a great job at this. I think you do a perfect example. You're a perfect

117
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,520
example of someone who can defend idealism with some really coherent arguments and even just

118
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,840
reading your papers. I mean, you've done a great job at that. I think at this point, do you want

119
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,640
to defend your actual position? I mean, what is your position regarding consciousness? What is

120
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,800
consciousness to you, Helen? Okay, so would you like me to talk about consciousness or about

121
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,880
idealism itself? Let's talk about idealism because I mean, we obviously know that that's

122
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,320
like your view on consciousness. Okay, well, in a sense, sorry, I keep I keep sort of,

123
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,240
I sort of agree with what you're saying, but I keep sort of also disagreeing and it's

124
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,800
it's made it a little hard to directly answer the questions. So I think in a sense, I think that

125
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:21,880
idealism is not itself a view of consciousness or a view of the mind body problem in the way that

126
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,160
like materialism or dualism or panpsychism, those are views that are coming and are

127
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,360
essentially trying to like answer the mind body problem. Whereas idealism, I think is

128
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,080
essentially a view about the nature of the physical world. And the view basically is just

129
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,480
sort of in a nutshell what it takes to be, I guess I should say an idealist of the sort that I'm

130
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,360
interested in. So I think of this as ontological idealism. But what it takes to be an idealist

131
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,600
basically just is to think that the physical world around us, it's real. But what it fundamentally

132
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,920
is, is conscious. It fundamentally is built up out of phenomenology. So I sort of think of this

133
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,400
a little bit by analogy to like reductive physicalism. So reductive physicalists, they want to say,

134
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,440
you know, look, I think consciousness is real. I think there is such a thing as pain. I'm not

135
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,680
trying to do away with pain, I'm trying to give an analysis of it. And this is the analysis.

136
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,360
Pain reduces to some sort of physical state, some sort of brain state, functional state.

137
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,720
Similarly, for the idealist, the idealist wants to say, the physical world is real.

138
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,240
There are rocks, there are stars, there are atoms. But what are they fundamentally? I'm trying to

139
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,480
give an analysis of it. And the analysis is such that it ultimately reduces to phenomenology.

140
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,040
Now, that sort of doesn't answer your question, right? Because you asked me about my view of

141
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,040
consciousness, which I haven't said anything about what consciousness is, what it is that this

142
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,800
is built up out of. You're talking, so we're going metaphysics here, we're talking about the

143
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,840
fundamental nature of reality. And we know that if everything is fundamentally matter,

144
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,240
that's going to be physicalism. And if everything is fundamentally mind, then you're going towards

145
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,000
more for an idealistic viewpoint. So you're basically saying that the fundamental nature

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,880
of reality is conscious, rather than consciousness is something, something, something.

147
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah. Yeah. So consciousness is sort of coming in, as you're pointing out,

148
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,120
consciousness is coming in as a primitive. So I mean, I suppose you could try to reduce

149
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,400
the physical world to consciousness and reduce consciousness to something else that doesn't

150
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,120
tend to be the way that idealists go. We do tend to take it as a primitive, as just so generous.

151
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,840
Yeah. But so, but that makes it very much very similar to panpsychism, because you're obviously

152
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,240
now taking that to be the fundamental property of reality. At what point do you guys diverge?

153
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,840
Yeah, that's a surprisingly tricky question. And I think the reason is because there aren't really

154
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,760
sufficiently precise agreed upon definitions of what it takes to be a panpsychist versus to

155
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:15,240
be an idealist. So there are people who are panpsychists who think that consciousness is one

156
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,200
fundamental, one sort of fundamental property, but that there might be other sorts of fundamental

157
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,880
properties that are not conscious. So it'd be kind of impure panpsychism, which would be quite

158
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,320
different. The idealist, according to the idealist, it's all phenomenology is sort of what is essentially

159
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,800
the nature of reality. So that's one potential difference. I think some of the differences

160
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,200
between panpsychism and idealism come in in sort of two respects. One is just in the canonical

161
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,880
form of panpsychism and the canonical form of idealism, why looking different,

162
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,640
and the others in their motivations. So sort of the canonical form of panpsychism is what some

163
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,560
people have called micro psychism. So this is the idea that the fundamental building blocks of reality

164
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,760
are tiny particles, quarks, whatever it is, maybe something smaller, and those fundamental

165
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,880
particles have as their intrinsic nature consciousness. So panpsychists give arguments for

166
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,040
this, of course, and then everything else is built up out of them. So we get consciousness in at the

167
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,200
ground level in building everything up, but sort of the fundamental locus of it is at the very tiny

168
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,280
level. By contrast, the canonical representation, I think of idealism, at least in the Western

169
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,960
tradition would be Barclay's idealism, which has basically the world all as experiences in the

170
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,440
mind of God, at least as one way of putting it. So there's sort of a difference in terms of whether

171
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,240
the one starts with these very, very tiny things and experiences coming in as parts of them, and

172
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,880
the other starts with these sort of very large experiences, experiences of the universe.

173
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,000
Now that's not essential to the two views because there are now panpsychists who call themselves

174
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,240
Cosmosychists, Philip Goff being one of them, and they are going to embrace this bigger top-down

175
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,600
picture. But I think the other difference between idealism and panpsychism really comes from the

176
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,160
standard motivations for the views. So panpsychists typically come to their view as a way of giving

177
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:29,960
a solution to the mind-body problem. So they look around and they go, look, I think that

178
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,600
consciousness can be explained in the same way that we explain all the other stuff in the world.

179
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,800
We explain liquidity by, we've got a bunch of molecules, they arrange in the right way,

180
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,280
and liquidity emerges. I think consciousness is the same. I think you can take these little

181
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,200
physical building blocks, put them together, and you can build consciousness. But in a sense,

182
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,760
that's agreeing with the physicalist. But also the panpsychist says, but I also agree with

183
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,400
the non-physicalists, with the dualists, because how could you take non-physical things and put

184
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,400
them together and sorry, non-conscious things, non-conscious things and put them together and

185
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,120
have consciousness pop into existence out of that. So they sort of infer from that that the

186
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,880
consciousness must have been in there from the start. And it's the only way we're able to build

187
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,680
big consciousnesses like ours up is that we started with little consciousnesses. This is obviously a

188
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,480
cartoonish caricature of the view. But so the mind-body problem is the central driving

189
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,960
force. They're getting people to panpsychism. With idealism, the standard route to idealism

190
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,600
actually doesn't have to do with the mind-body problem. It has to do with trying to give an

191
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,320
account of the physical world around us and just directly of its nature. So I can say more about

192
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:55,560
that. Go ahead. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I mean, I guess if we sort of started with like Barclay as sort of

193
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:03,640
the father of the Western idealist tradition, you know, very rough caricature again of the view,

194
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,720
you look around and you're like, you know, what do I know about the world? Well, I know it's

195
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,080
populated by mugs like the one I'm holding by trees like the trees I see outside by stars and so on.

196
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,800
What's that? It's a really nice mug. You know, the last time I did an interview,

197
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:27,080
I had a different mug and I was also complimented on it. I like mugs. So,

198
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,440
right, so I know, I know all these things, but what do I know about these things?

199
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:40,600
Well, the mug in my hand, I know it feels solid and warm. I know, you know, I see blue

200
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,080
in the mug and white on the inside. I see brown, sort of with light reflecting off of it,

201
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,040
because I shouldn't quite describe that way. I see brownish, bobby, upy, downness when I look

202
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:00,200
inside of the mug and see the tea sloshing around. Now, all of these things that I just described

203
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,280
were the ways that it seems to me were experiences that I have when I look at the mug, right?

204
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,240
Hardness, warmth, and so on. And when you think about it, all of the information that we gain

205
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,880
about the world around us, empirically, we gain through our senses, through the experiences

206
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,480
that we have of the world. Even when you're, you know, in a science laboratory, you're looking

207
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,280
through a microscope or, I mean, presumably when you're running tiny particles together in a particle

208
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,360
accelerator, right? What it is you get from that is the experiences that you have of looking

209
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:42,200
through the microscope. So now, we could say, all right, there's some sort of mind independent

210
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,880
matter out there that we don't know anything about what it's like. We just know that it causes us to

211
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:56,040
have certain experiences. That's one sort of view we could have. But why, first of all,

212
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,240
Barkley thinks, you know, Barkley is an empiricist, he thinks we should just pause it,

213
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,760
what we get through our experiences, and nothing more than we need to pause it.

214
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,080
Why go about pausing that? Why not just pause it? That it is the thing that we're directly aware of,

215
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,840
experiences. Why not just pause it that we've got warmth, cylindricality, hardness, and so on?

216
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,640
And that's what the mug is. After all, that's all I directly have evidence of. And if you

217
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,840
tell me there's something more to it than that, I don't know what the hell it could be.

218
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:32,280
So that sort of is the motivation for Barkley getting to idealism. And I think the standard

219
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,800
motivation for getting to idealism is thinking, you know, this is what we have evidence to think

220
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,360
that there is. And there's not evidence to think there's anything more. So if we don't need anything

221
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,360
more, if we can do without it, that looks like the more simple parsimonious view.

222
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah, which is a very coherent way of thinking. I mean, ideally, if that's the way it all looks,

223
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,640
the best assumption to make is that that's just the way it all looks and is.

224
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,520
Yeah, I mean, I find this kind of argument actually quite compelling. I think a lot of people

225
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,280
don't. I mean, I guess the question is, can we actually come to a coherent view that's able to

226
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,520
respect what we learn from science, that's able to respect our intuitions about the world having

227
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,560
a sort of stability that it does, and does the ultimate view that we get when we really try

228
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:31,080
to flesh this all out, does that look good? And that's, I think, maybe where idealism has work

229
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:39,160
to do, at least. But I hope to fill. So coming into this view, I mean, you must have had knowledge

230
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,880
of, I mean, reality, we dark matters 95% of the universe. We don't know anything about it.

231
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,680
It's dark energy, we know nothing about the fundamental nature of reality. So

232
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,160
coming into this, was that does, does what we've learned from physics and basically everything

233
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,800
we know about biology, everything else we know, did that play a huge role in forming this view for

234
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,120
you? Was that was that a driving force for you to no longer trust reductionism or physicalism?

235
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,400
Yeah, that's a very interesting question. That was not a driving force for me. I think that

236
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,480
some of the cases that you present are interesting puzzle cases, though, for the idealist and cases

237
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,520
that the idealist really needs to think about and be able to speak to. So, I mean, what I started

238
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,240
off describing was the sort of experiences that I have of the world, right? And I started saying,

239
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,880
you know, that it seems like we want to have a world that has that, at very least as a part of it.

240
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,240
It's interesting that the cases that you're describing things like dark matter, you're

241
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,560
describing things that I, as you say, you know, we don't have the ability to perceive.

242
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,000
So that might be taken to be something that would pose a challenge for the idealist,

243
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,360
insofar as the idealist wants to say that everything in the world is experiences.

244
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,440
So how do we account for the sorts of things that perhaps are, you know, certainly that we

245
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:05,480
can't experience or perhaps are essentially imperceivable? So would you like me to talk

246
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,040
about this a little bit or? Yeah, this is about, I want to listen to what you have to say.

247
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,920
Okay, all right. Yes, I mean, I just think you've sort of actually hit on quite a challenging

248
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:25,000
sort of puzzle case. So I think it might make sense to get to this after getting more of the

249
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,440
positive view out, but maybe. I think let's do that first, and then we'll get, we'll touch on this.

250
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,600
I'll try and just make, you know, but continue. So wait, let's, let's start off with, I mean, so

251
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,480
let's run through some of the various types of idealism that they are. I mean, because

252
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,120
Barclay's idealism is very much, I mean, there's a lot of credence placed on God. God's one of the

253
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,640
main driving forces behind this, and your view does not have that behind it. It's more of a

254
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,360
secular version of this. So let me let's touch on the different versions of this and how yours

255
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:07,080
differs from most of the others. Oh, I am not, I'm probably not the best person to give a rundown

256
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:15,080
of all the different versions of idealism. Well, at least the most, the most commonly brought up

257
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,880
views. Yeah. So, well, okay, so, so you've brought up Barclay's idealism. So Barclay's idealism,

258
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,800
we started off describing a little bit how he came to the motivation for it. But as you've touched

259
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,280
on, God is playing this very central role. So maybe I should just say a little bit about how

260
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:41,880
that comes in. So if the world is just a world of experiences, if the cup that I'm seeing right now

261
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,400
just is sort of the experiences that I'm having of the cup, you very quickly run into problems,

262
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,360
right? For one thing, if I sort of set the cup down out of view, and there's no one else in the

263
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:59,800
room perceiving it, does the cup pop out of existence? That seems bonkers. So Barclay's

264
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,160
answer to this is no, it doesn't. The world around us is stable and persists in the way we think that

265
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,720
it does. And the answer, the solution to this is God. So at least on the caricature that of the

266
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,080
view that is typically presented to undergraduate students, God is always perceiving the totality

267
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,680
of reality. So God is experiencing the cup even when I'm not. And this actually, I think,

268
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,960
is important in other ways. So it's not just that God is ensuring that my cup continues to exist.

269
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,800
But if you think about it, there's a lot of features of the cup that I'm not aware of,

270
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,320
like even when I am looking at it, I'm not aware of the backside of the cup. But the cup's backside

271
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,560
doesn't pop in and out of existence. Why will God is experiencing it? Similarly, the molecular

272
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,920
structure of the cup that maybe with a high powered microscope I could perceive. But I'm not

273
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,800
currently. The molecular structure doesn't pop in and out of existence because God is always

274
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,200
experiencing it. So God is playing this really big role, which, as you've pointed out, I want to

275
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:09,320
get away from for a variety of reasons. So I sort of think of my view as kind of a neo-Barclayan

276
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,080
view. So it's very much in the Barclayan tradition. It's a realist view that, you know, a view that

277
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,640
says cups exist, they're real, rocks exist, they're real. You can't refute the view by kicking a rock.

278
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,000
But God is not the thing that's accounting for the stability and persistence of objects and their

279
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,960
properties. A different sort of view that has also been kind of resurrected recently is the

280
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,000
phenomenalist view. So phenomenalism is a position according to which reality is not

281
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,960
constructed out of experiences per se. It's constructed out of potentials for experience.

282
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:01,320
So this cup, you know, right now I'm experiencing it. I put it down and I'm not looking at it.

283
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,480
But nevertheless, were I to turn my head and look at the cup, I would have certain experiences.

284
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,360
And according to the phenomenalist, those potentials to have experience,

285
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,440
those maybe conditionals, those counterfactual claims, those obtain even when I'm not actually

286
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,800
looking at the cup. And that is what the cup is constructed out of. So this is a position that was

287
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:32,200
associated with Mill and that Mike Pelisar has recently done an admirable, remarkable job of

288
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:40,200
resurrecting and defending. So there's sort of another version of idealism, or not exactly

289
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,120
idealism, but view in the ballpark. We've touched a little bit on panpsychism. There are, of course,

290
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,160
there are a lot of views that are sort of idealists, but are very of a different kind. So there's

291
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,040
sort of transcendental idealist views, which have also recently been resurrected as forms

292
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,320
of linguistic idealism. So these are views basically where we're not giving a view about

293
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,840
the nature of the world around us, we're giving a view about the nature of what we can know,

294
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,360
and of the world as we interact with it, or maybe what it is that our words are about

295
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:21,320
in the more recent forms. So I am very much not an expert on Kant, but Kant is the person

296
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,240
associated with transcendental idealism, which would be this sort of idea that there is a cup,

297
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,640
a thing in and of itself, but that is sort of outside of the bounds of my ability to grasp.

298
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,640
What I grasp is something that's more akin to what a Barclay would hold that we grasp.

299
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,440
So yeah, so we've got a whole lot of different, but sort of interconnected web of views that are

300
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:58,840
all called idealism or idealist adjacent. Yeah, so there's like a plurality, I'm sorry,

301
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,160
a bit of a tongue twister there. Yeah, so there's a lot of, there's many different views there,

302
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,400
and a lot of them sort of coincide in certain ways, but yours differs in some other ways.

303
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,880
Why have you excluded God from this? Okay, good. So I guess there's two reasons.

304
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,400
One is just that, so I'm agnostic, and for Barclay, God is playing this really metaphysically

305
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,920
like heavy weight role, right? I mean, God is ensuring that the backside of my cup at every

306
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,120
moment continues to exist, and that, you know, that this has a molecular structure even when I'm

307
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,280
not looking at it under a microscope and so on. And that's, I would kind of prefer a view that's

308
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:47,640
just more theologically neutral in part because of my own agnosticism. But beyond that, I think even

309
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,360
if you are a theist, a committed theist, that there is value in stepping away, at least temporarily,

310
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:01,800
stepping back from God, playing the central role. Because I think that God kind of is like a black

311
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:11,160
box to us. And I think part of that's that, you know, we don't feel comfortable, I mean,

312
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,240
I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable just speculating about the structure of God's mind

313
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,400
and what it's like and how everything hangs together, right? It's something where you'd

314
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,560
feel sort of compelled to go and look at theology. And even then, the answer you're going to get is

315
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,680
probably, oh, divine mystery, we don't know, humans aren't going to presuppose about what God is like,

316
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,840
right? So I think if we sort of step back from talking and thinking about God, I mean, God,

317
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,400
you can sort of smuggle a lot into God, you can say like, ah, well, God's doing it. And then

318
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,200
it's sort of like, that's the end of that, right? You've shut the case, you've said God, and now

319
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,400
there's nothing more to say. And I really think that we want to have a more substantive view than

320
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,960
that. So I think that, you know, stepping back from God and just thinking about the structure

321
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,640
of the mind or the phenomenal unity that constitutes reality can enable us to do that,

322
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,080
can enable us to say something more substantive than a theistic view could. And if at the end of

323
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,360
the day, you have theistic inclinations and want to add some of those traditional godly attributes

324
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,320
back into the picture, you can do that, but with a sense as to how it all could work behind the

325
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:30,760
scenes that I think you wouldn't get otherwise. Within your agnosticism, I mean, where are you

326
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:38,920
most inclined towards? Like, are you inclined towards a sort of theistic God, a deistic God,

327
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:45,160
polytheistic God? What are you looking at? If you had to sort of posit some sort of a

328
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:53,720
some helpful Barclay, basically. Yeah, well, myself, I mean, this, this is not sort of part

329
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,920
of the arguments that I give, but I'm, I'm sort of agnostic between sort of atheism and a deist

330
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:06,680
God, I sort of I find, I find the cosmological argument rather persuasive. And I find, I find

331
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,840
a particular variant of the fine tuning argument that has to do with fine tuning,

332
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,520
psychophysical bridging laws kind of also quite persuasive. So,

333
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,600
you know, dualists and certain sorts of idealists take it that, you know, we've got our brains

334
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,600
and we've got conscious experiences and the relation between there's some sort of law like

335
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,600
relation between them, right? So when my brain is in brain state five, I'm having a reddish

336
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,160
phenomenal experience. Whereas the bridging laws could have been different, my inverted twin

337
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,640
could have been in brain state five. And if the laws were different, it could have caused a greenish

338
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,120
experience to be generated. And so, you know, this is a standard way that dualists think about

339
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,680
consciousness. But then you can ask these questions like, well, why is it that our experiences,

340
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:03,160
particularly experiences like pain, why is it that our pain experiences feel bad? You know,

341
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,120
couldn't the bridging laws have been different such that whenever we have tissue damage

342
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,040
occurring and signals being sent to our brain and this thing happening in our brain, that we

343
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,480
feel pleasure. But, you know, our brain, you know, causes us to pull away from it, even though we're

344
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,760
actually feeling pleasure. I think that that's perfectly possible. You might think, you know,

345
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,480
well, it's just, it was just good luck. It was just luck that the bridging laws worked out right.

346
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,160
I mean, you could have someone who experiences pain as we feel it, but enjoys it. I mean,

347
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,880
to some people, the wires. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I tend to think that if for those cases

348
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,960
of actual people, there's probably other functional differences within their brain beyond, beyond

349
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:55,400
this, but, but that's absolutely right. Yeah, so, but in any event, I mean, I guess, if you don't

350
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:01,320
want to posit that that's sort of just good luck and random, one way of going about explaining

351
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,080
that would be that God ensured that we had sensible bridging laws, that God fine-tuned the

352
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,400
bridging laws. And this is sort of, I mean, there's, it's a complicated argument, but

353
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,160
I think this sort of fine-tuning argument gets away from you can't do things like the anthropocentric

354
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,440
kind of response, right? So, you know, if the bridging laws were different, we would still

355
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,360
be aware of the bridging laws being different. So, so I'm sort of, I find those kinds of arguments

356
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,960
somewhat persuasive and persuasive enough to leave me as an as an agnostic, but I find the

357
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,120
problem of evil, the problem of suffering really just seems insurmountable to me. So,

358
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm not inclined to believe in the sort of God that Barclay would posit.

359
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,000
It's always fascinating to know someone's spiritual slash religious beliefs, because

360
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,960
a lot of the times it does play a role in the way they view consciousness. I mean,

361
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,880
this is a very fascinating book called by John Hogan called Blind Body Problems,

362
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,600
where he dissects different philosophers and scientists and talks about their upbringing

363
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,560
and how they came to a certain view that would predispose them to have that philosophical view

364
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:19,000
in the end. So, yeah, you think your agnosticism played a role in this, in this idealist view of

365
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,360
the world? Ah, I would be inclined to think not, but I'm probably too close to it to be the best

366
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,560
arbiter. I mean, I think, you know, the sociology of philosophy, the sociology of academics is like,

367
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,880
I mean, it seems fascinating to me, although maybe it's just because I'm an academic and so

368
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,520
everybody thinks the sociology of them seems fascinating, but yeah, no, I mean, I think it's

369
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,800
a super cool, super cool question. I might need more distance from myself. Yeah, no, I do know

370
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,160
that your your husband is as an ethicist and you guys have written a lot of papers together as well.

371
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,560
Because this podcast is also all about reality, the nature of reality, morality. I mean, I think

372
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,840
it all plays a very big role. So Metaethics is a big part of what you discuss as well. How do you

373
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,760
think that this view sort of changes the way we should behave morally? I mean, how has it, how

374
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:17,960
can it affect us? So how, how idealism could affect us? People perceive the nature of reality in

375
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:26,200
this way, then there's no physical person. There is a mind that's possibly there are these conscious

376
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,040
agents, in a sense, but there is no physical person to actually go and kick if I had to.

377
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:42,280
Yeah, my answer might be somewhat disappointing. So I actually think that there's probably very

378
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:49,560
little by way of implications here. And I think part of the reason is that one thing that I'm

379
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:57,080
aiming to do with idealism is to sort of show, to show that, you know, we have our views about

380
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,160
what the world is like, and we get our views partly just by the way the world seems to us,

381
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,480
partly from science, right, from gaining, we gain knowledge all sorts of different ways.

382
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:12,440
But what I wanted to do is to see, can we, can we show that there could be a world whose nature

383
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,560
is an idealist world that looks just like we think our world actually is? So in a sense,

384
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm sort of using the way that we think that the world is as a guide, and then trying to say, you

385
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,960
know, yeah, the world could be just that way as an idealist world, and that I think there are

386
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,680
advantages to doing so. But as a result, since I'm using what we think about our world as the guide,

387
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,400
I think it's going to wind up looking very much the same as we ordinarily think.

388
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,400
So I actually do think, you know, you said there aren't physical, there aren't physical

389
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,480
beings. And in a sense, that's right. But in another sense, that's, that's wrong, right? So there

390
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,800
are bodies that have all of these, you know, there are, I have a body and it's solid and it's

391
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,720
warm. And, you know, I have a brain and it's you cut my head open, it's sort of gray and squishy.

392
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,320
And if you look at me under an FMRI, you know, you'd see different patterns of things lighting up,

393
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,440
corresponding to blood flow in my brain. And all of that's true. So in a sense, in a sense,

394
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I'm sort of maybe making a very Barkley in point. So Barkley, when people would say, you're doing

395
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,000
away with matter, you're doing away with, with the world that we know it. And he's like, no,

396
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm doing the common sense thing, I'm giving you matter. If what you mean by matter is something

397
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,040
we don't know anything at all about, yeah, I'm getting rid of that. But I'm not getting rid of

398
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,080
bodies. I'm not getting rid of any of the properties you know about.

399
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,280
Okay, no, that's, that's a very good answer. I think, I think that there was, there was a,

400
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,520
oh yes, a part of me wanted to ask at that point, let's say, let's, let's move beyond

401
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,800
hurting someone or kicking someone. What happens then when someone dies? Because ideally,

402
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,080
at that point, this is going to become a very different place. What goes on then? What happens

403
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:05,720
when someone dies in this reality? Yeah, I mean, I suppose there's a sense in which

404
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,520
the idealist view that I'm developing is sort of under, under determines that. So certainly,

405
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:21,160
you know, we have a body, and it's fundamentally made up out of phenomenology. And I have a brain

406
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,480
that's also made up out of phenomenology, and it's going to start functioning very differently,

407
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,120
right, just as we ordinarily think. So, you know, blood, my part's not going to be pumping

408
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,000
blood, my lungs aren't going to be breathing, decay is going to eventually set in, and the body

409
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,560
is going to rot. All of that's going to happen within the physical world. And just the way that

410
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:48,120
we think that it does. But the idealist is giving a particular account of sort of the nature of

411
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,760
the things that are rotten, basically. And the nature of the decay, I guess, itself is that it's,

412
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:01,320
it's all sort of, in some sense, phenomenal, in some sense, conscious. Not that my body remains

413
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,720
conscious. It's not that there's a little consciousness experience in my body, but that,

414
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,200
you know, when you think about the bones that make up my skeleton, you know, yes, they're there,

415
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,720
they're made up out of whatever molecules they're made up out of, structured in the way that they're

416
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,920
structured. But what are those things, ultimately, like, you know, what is, you know, a physicist

417
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,160
could give us a mathematical equation that explains all of these things, they can tell us about the

418
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,400
relations between things. But what fundamentally is the intrinsic nature, what are the things that

419
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,880
have these properties that have these sandwich relations, I guess. So that's what the idealist

420
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,720
is telling us. So, you know, the body is going to wither and rot. Then there's the question of the

421
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,520
mind, which we haven't really talked about how the mind and the body are related on the idealist

422
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,760
view. And I think there's not just one view that ideals could have about this, I think idealism

423
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,520
is compatible with a number of different views on this. But I think probably any view that a

424
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,520
physicalist or a dualist, I guess maybe more dualists could have on this would be open to the

425
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,840
physicalist, or sorry, it would be open to the idealist. So, you know, I think it would be

426
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,480
compatible with an afterlife to whatever extent other views are compatible with the afterlife.

427
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,840
But I don't think idealism itself determines that.

428
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,960
It's, it's, it's, when you, when you talk about this nature of reality, this, in this ideal world,

429
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,040
let's talk about things like that we talk that a lot of people, let's say illusionist, for example,

430
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,760
that try and count, count to these arguments, we're saying, look, the truth is, is that our

431
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,200
perception of reality is not what we think it is. Fundamentally, the more we've been learning,

432
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,120
the more we've been exposing how little we know, how little we matter, and how not important we

433
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,520
are, for example, Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain, and you've got people taking us

434
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,600
out of the center of the universe slowly, we're learning that this is not really about us. And

435
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,640
just because we have these experience doesn't mean it should be fundamental to reality. So,

436
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,160
does that bring us towards some sort of a solipsistic view on how we view ourselves and

437
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:19,240
consciousness or well, mind? Yeah, there's actually a sense in which I think that idealism

438
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,520
of the sort that I'm interested in meshes really well with the observations that you were making.

439
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,880
So, you know, you talked about Darwin taking us off of the, you know, Darwin just putting us,

440
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,480
we're just another animal, right? And our sun isn't the center of the universe, our planet isn't the

441
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,520
center of, you know, the solar system, right? Now, when I talked about idealism thus far,

442
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,520
and I was talking about Barclay and idealism, I mean, I was giving examples of the sorts of

443
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,560
experiences that I have. And I was saying all of these things seem like, you know, they're telling

444
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:02,520
me something about reality, like they're a part of reality. And on the view that I defend, that is

445
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:09,160
true. So, in a sense, I am saying the thing that you're disagreeing with, namely that our experiences

446
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,160
are a part of reality. But I don't think that that's in any way privileged or special. So,

447
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:23,880
in a sense, I completely agree with the examples that you're giving. So, I, yes,

448
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,160
I have certain experiences, I look out and I see a tree and it looks green. And the greenness,

449
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:36,280
I think, seems like it's there as part of reality. And the idealist is going to say it is. But my

450
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,160
inverted twin, or there to be an inverted twin here would look out and would see a tree and it

451
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,440
would look red. There's no reason we should privilege my experiences over my inverted twins.

452
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Redness just as well seems like it belongs as part of the world. Similarly, a bee has their

453
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,080
perceptions. A bee perceives maybe ultraviolet that I don't perceive. That all, just as well,

454
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,840
I mean, nothing privileging my experiences, the bees experiences seem like they're equally

455
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,960
well part of reality. The bat echo locating, its experiences equally well seem like they

456
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,120
count as part of reality. And you could go on and on and on and on. And all of these

457
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,080
experiences, none of them seem privileged or prior to any of the others. So, for the idealist

458
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,960
view that I'm developing, and I would be inclined to think that really on a Barclay in view as well,

459
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,440
all of this is part of reality. And there's not sort of a, there's not special glowing experiences

460
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,560
that are the real true ones. They all equally count. And if you think about it, God, Barclay's

461
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,920
God doesn't just perceive the world from a human point of view, right? He doesn't have a single

462
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,840
vantage point on the world. The idea is that you perceive the totality of the world, he perceives

463
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,600
the totality of the world, which is going to include vastly more than human beings are aware of.

464
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,200
So the idealist view, there's a lot of phenomenology and it's not, for my view,

465
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,440
not necessarily for all idealist views, human experiences are not privileged in a way that

466
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,360
they would be maybe for like John Foster, possibly. In psychiatry, there's this field

467
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:17,160
that's called phenomenological psychopathology. And there's, there are these two tools used to try

468
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,840
and understand schizophrenic patients. And one is called the ease and the other's called the EE,

469
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:29,480
but it's the examination of anomalous self experience and the examination of anomalous

470
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,040
world experience. So what happens is you look at this patient and you try and understand

471
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,200
while they psych out, almost becoming psychotic. So close to psychosis, they start to do all the

472
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,400
things you're talking about. I mean, to have these different experiences that are so diverse

473
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,720
from the average experience. I mean, someone starts seeing the world as being a part of it,

474
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,600
being part of consciousness, someone, someone might not see red the same anymore. Some of them

475
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:00,520
even don't see visual illusions that we often see. They actually see it as accurate representations.

476
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,760
They see the truth actually, they see more than we do in that sense. So it's intriguing to see

477
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,400
how different experiences do exist even among this one species that has really identical DNA.

478
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:19,640
I mean, we're all basically the same. It kind of fits with your view in a sense, if you think about

479
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,160
Yeah. Yeah. No. And I mean, and questions about how to deal with hallucinations and illusions

480
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,800
are also just like a super interesting question. And I think even within just sort of like a

481
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,920
neurotypical subject, I mean, you think about things like after images, right? Where you're

482
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,560
looking at, you know, some red light and the relevant photoreceptors become fatigued and

483
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,120
then you look away at a white wall and you see this green patch. Well, in a sense, you know,

484
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,560
what you're perceiving of the wall, on my view, like that really is a feature of the wall,

485
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,120
the greenness of the wall is a feature that some other, you know, some other creature with a different

486
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:02,760
sort of visual system that maybe only is capable of seeing green green light would see. And that

487
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,640
also is a feature that is a part of reality and that puts us in touch with reality, but in a very

488
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,360
different way from the way that we normally are. But I think there are challenges for the idealist

489
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,920
in how to make sense of these things. It's a it's a complex picture. But but yeah, I think the

490
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,080
idealist has the resources to deal with the complexity. The I think it's really fascinating

491
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:34,360
to see when someone really becomes when they're psych patients, where I mean, I don't mean to

492
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,640
use them as like tools of examples, but it's really fascinating to see when someone becomes

493
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,920
truly solipsistic, where they really think that once they close their eyes, nothing else exists.

494
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,960
And it's a it's an intriguing thing to perceive because I've witnessed it from patients. And when

495
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,160
you see how real that feels for the person, you can understand that that might be a real feeling.

496
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,200
I mean, it might be a real experience. And so it does coincide well with what you're saying. I mean,

497
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:07,160
this this could just be the way the world really is for all of us, fundamentally. But yet this

498
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,120
person is just fortunate enough to experience the reality of it.

499
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,800
Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, I guess, sorry, I've had a whole lot of thoughts as you've been talking. So

500
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:24,040
one is that I mean, there's there's an interesting question about what sorts of things for the idealist

501
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,560
are part of reality and what sorts of things are just parts of our minds. So the way that I think

502
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:38,600
about it, I the view that I develop is one on which reality is this vast unity of consciousness.

503
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,680
But it's just sort of sensory experiences that are bound together into a unity. So if you sort of think

504
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,200
to me, would it be okay if I sort of said a little bit about my view and how it works?

505
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:58,920
I think so, yeah, I think. Okay, so. So we had sort of Barclay's view that I gave where we

506
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,080
have God and God is always perceiving the totality of reality. God doesn't just see the world from a

507
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,960
single vantage point. He sees it from all vantage points. He sees, you know, he sees all of it.

508
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,680
But it seems like there's a lot about God that's not essential to

509
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,800
to ensuring the stability and persistence of the world as he needs to for Barclay's view.

510
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:28,920
So, you know, I think God doesn't have to be all good. God doesn't have to be all powerful.

511
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,320
I don't think God has to be an agent. I don't think God's beliefs are a part of what's doing the work.

512
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,760
What's doing the work is God's experiences, right? And God's experiences, God is not just

513
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,120
having, you know, a giant experience of everything that's happening that's just all disconnected

514
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,680
from itself. God's experiences are structured in the same way that our experiences are structured.

515
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,360
So when I, when I look at a tree, I don't just see greenness and leaf shape and brownness and

516
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,120
trunk shape all sort of scattered around. The leaf shape and the greenness are bound together.

517
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,840
The brownness and the trunk shape are bound together. My experience has structure

518
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,520
along various different dimensions. And the thought is that God's experience in order to be

519
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:17,240
a single experience of the world and in order to be coherent has to have structure too. And so

520
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,560
God is having the thought is for Barclay. We can sort of think of God as having this

521
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,320
gigantic multi-perspective experience. And that experience, that multi-perspective experience

522
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:34,040
is what's doing the work of ensuring that the world persists even when we're not perceiving it,

523
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:44,360
when we're not there. So for me, reality, just the physical world around us just is this structured

524
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:49,800
multi-perspective experience structured using the same resources that structure our own experiences.

525
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,440
You sort of refer to it as like a tapestry of reality.

526
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,400
Yeah. Yeah. So I like the analogy of a tapestry because a tapestry, you've got all these threads

527
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,000
that are, they're not just separate threads, like, you know, piles of little yarn everywhere, right?

528
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,080
There are threads, which in the case of reality are phenomenal threads, bits of,

529
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,440
bits of experiences. And then they're, but they're structured, they're woven together into a single

530
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:19,640
whole unit, kind of like a tapestry. But so on this view, the idea is that what makes up

531
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:27,080
reality is sensory experiences. So, you know, experiences of color and warmth and solidity

532
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:35,080
and line and smell and pitch and so on. Now, there are more to our experiences than just

533
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,800
sensory experiences. So I think, I'm inclined to think there's something called cognitive

534
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,200
phenomenology. So this is the phenomenology of thought. And I'm inclined to think that cognitive

535
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,320
phenomenology is not a part of the physical world itself. The cognitive phenomenology sort of comes

536
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:58,520
from our minds. And it's kind of like, like a cognitive overlay on reality. So when I'm aware

537
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:06,760
of the physical world around me of this sensory tapestry, I don't know, do you remember those

538
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,960
overhead transparencies? Did you have these when you were a kid in school?

539
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,440
Yes. The clear, the clear overhead and then they put it down and then they could like write on it

540
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,880
with markers and you could put another overhead transparency on top. I kind of think about

541
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:25,800
cognitive phenomenology like a, like a overhead transparency on reality. But it's coming from

542
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,200
our minds. So, sorry, this has taken us quite far from where you started, but you had this

543
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:42,920
really interesting point about. Well, you had, you'd raised this really interesting

544
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,920
case of people who wind up, you know, not just believing that they're the only person who exists,

545
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:58,440
but having this experience, this sensation as of being, you know, the only thing that's real.

546
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,640
And so I think, I think it's quite interesting because on this sort of view, cases like that,

547
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,560
there's going to be a question of, is that what kind of phenomenology is that? Is that some sort of

548
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:15,160
cognitive phenomenology? Or is that actually sensory phenomenology? And not obviously not all

549
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,480
sensory phenomenology is part of the physical world. I think there can be hallucinations that

550
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,880
are part of our mind, but not the physical world. But it is interesting because whether,

551
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:32,760
whether something is purely cognitive or whether it's sensory does wind up

552
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,520
playing a big role in how we think about it fitting into reality.

553
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,320
Along with you with, in your idealism, you also talk about naive idealism. Do you want to touch

554
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:52,360
on that as well? Sure, yeah. So this is a view about perception that I think that idealism meshes

555
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:59,320
really well with. So for the idealist, for the idealism, just as I, as I've stated it,

556
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,200
just as a view about the physical world and what the physical world is ultimately like.

557
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,680
But then there are all these other questions that that doesn't touch on. So when one question is,

558
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,280
it doesn't tell us about how our minds relate to our brains. So it doesn't directly answer the

559
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,080
mind-value problem, although it has implications for it. Another thing that it doesn't do is it

560
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,440
doesn't tell us anything about how it is that we, maybe our minds interact with the world,

561
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:37,560
how it is that we perceive the world around us. And I think I mentioned earlier that when I had

562
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,000
first come to idealism and started thinking about it, part of what led me to do that was

563
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,240
thinking about this view naive realism, which is this idea that what perception is essentially

564
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:55,720
is this relation between us and objects in the world. And that when we stand in this relation,

565
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,840
sort of the objects in the world, in some sense become a part of the experience or part of the

566
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:07,560
character of the experience. And that's something that always struck me as really, really mystifying.

567
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:15,800
And this still strikes me as completely mystifying. The basic idea behind naive idealism

568
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:23,160
is that that sort of intuitive idea of perception that naive realists want to hold on to is something

569
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:31,000
that I think we can get and we can get really intelligibly, but only if the objects in the

570
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,880
external world that we're related to are themselves mental or phenomenal kinds of things. So I mean,

571
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:46,440
I think it doesn't make any sense to take an apple, a material apple and sort of shove it into

572
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,840
a computer program. I mean, I take my T mug for anybody who sees this online and I try shoving

573
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:00,840
it at the screen. I don't therefore put my mug into the computer. It's just not the right kind

574
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:06,120
of thing to be a part of the computer or a part of a computer program. Similarly, my mug is not

575
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:11,240
the right kind of thing to become a physical material mug. I don't understand how it can

576
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,920
be a part of an experience. I understand how I can be related to it in different ways,

577
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,360
but I don't understand how it can be an elementary constituent of an experience or

578
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:26,600
the phenomenal character of my experience. By contrast, if you think about something like

579
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:33,880
maybe stepping back from thinking about perception, it's really easy to see how my

580
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:39,800
experiences just in general can be constituents of other experiences and other judgments and

581
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:48,040
things in my mind. So when I introspect and I don't know, I feel slightly hot,

582
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:55,320
I'm able to directly, my mind is able to directly apprehend the hot feeling that I have right now

583
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,760
and the hot feeling can actually become sort of a part of the thought. It doesn't stand at a

584
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,760
distance from the thought. They're both constituents of, they're both sort of mental things, right?

585
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:10,440
There's the hot feeling and then there's the thought about it and there's not a mystery as to how

586
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:21,080
the one can literally sort of subsume the other. Well, if the cup itself is a phenomenal item,

587
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,200
is a bit of phenomenology, the thought is that we can have the same sort of thing be true

588
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:34,040
of perception. So I actually think I might need to say a little bit about,

589
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:42,440
no, I'll just try saying it without backing up anymore. Explain yourself as much as possible

590
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:50,760
so that it's... All right, well, the idea is that when we perceive objects, our mind literally

591
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:59,800
comes to overlap with the perceived objects. So when I perceive the cup, the cup winds up,

592
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:05,480
the cup is a part of the phenomenal tapestry, it's a part of the physical world. But the idea is

593
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,960
that the cup also becomes unified with my mind. So, and how is it that this is possible? Well,

594
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,880
the cup is more phenomenology. The cup is kind of like pain. Pain can be unified with the rest

595
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:25,160
of my experiences. And similarly, the cup itself, my mind can sort of, in perception,

596
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,920
can sort of reach out and expand and pull the cup into it, in a sense. So, I mean, we're not

597
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:36,280
talking about physically pulling the cup into it, like in terms of a spatial relation, but the thought

598
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:42,520
is that the elements of my mind are unified with the cup in the same way that they're unified with

599
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,680
my pains or my warm feeling. So the cup, actually, in a sense, is part of the physical world, but

600
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:54,760
it's also a part of me. And as such, I can think about it directly. I can directly grasp and apprehend

601
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:02,280
it and know about it. And that, I think, is one of the things that idealism can get that materialism

602
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,960
can't get, and that I think is a really interesting advantage to the view.

603
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:15,880
Yeah. This is bringing me back to one of your papers. I think it's called dualism all the way

604
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,440
down. You're talking about, you talk about phenomenal judgment, you talk about self-knowledge,

605
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,720
and I know how critical this relationship is. What is the paradox there? I forgot

606
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,640
what it was called, the paradox of? The paradox of phenomenal judgment.

607
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,160
Yes. Explain that to me, because while reading it, a part of me was just a little bit confused.

608
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,800
I wanted to just understand that a little bit more. Yeah. So this is a paradox that doesn't

609
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,840
have to do with idealism, particularly. It's a paradox for epiphenomenalist dualism.

610
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:57,320
So the dualist takes it that there's the physical world, and then there's also

611
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,040
consciousness. And consciousness can't be reduced to things in the physical world,

612
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:11,000
so we need a duality. And we quickly run into this problem, if you're a dualist,

613
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,840
namely the problem of how consciousness and the physical stuff interact with each other.

614
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And there are some reasons that I think I mentioned very early on for thinking that

615
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,280
they actually can't. That maybe the physical stuff can generate consciousness,

616
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,360
but we should think that consciousness can't actually affect the physical world.

617
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,600
Why not? Well, it seems like every physical event can be entirely explained in terms of

618
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:45,080
earlier physical events, or at least every physical event that has a cause or something like that.

619
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:53,880
So that's one reason. I mean, conservation of energy also is going to potentially play into this.

620
01:01:55,160 --> 01:02:00,120
So that might push you towards a version of dualism called epiphenomenalism,

621
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:06,600
which is the view basically that every physical event, everything happening in my brain,

622
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,720
everything happening in my body, can be explained entirely in terms of earlier

623
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,400
things happening in my brain, my body, the physical world around me.

624
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:19,800
So I can completely explain all of this without needing to posit consciousness.

625
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,400
But there also is consciousness, and consciousness is not just physical.

626
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:33,560
So when I take a pencil and I stab myself and the signal is sent to my brain and my brain does,

627
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:39,960
it's whatever it does, then there's also, I say, ah, and I pull away from the pencil,

628
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,040
but I also have an experience of pain. And the experience of pain itself doesn't cause me to

629
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,800
do anything. The experience of pain doesn't affect anything in the world. We could get rid of it,

630
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,120
and I would still, though, I would still pull away from it. So that's the epiphenomenalist

631
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,880
position. And it's a position that seems deeply counterintuitive to many people,

632
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:12,040
because you think, isn't it obvious that when I go and I order, I order a cup of tea,

633
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,360
that I ordered tea because I was thirsty and wanted caffeine, right? I mean,

634
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:21,240
isn't that what could be more obvious than that? And for the epiphenomenalist, that's just not the

635
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,640
case, right? You ordered the cup of tea. Why? Well, because your brain was sending certain

636
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,680
signals down to your body, which caused blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

637
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,760
But you also do feel thirst. Now, why does the epiphenomenalist hold this? Well, because the

638
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,520
epiphenomenalist is convinced by the, you know, first that we have conscious experiences that

639
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:47,560
nothing could be more obvious than that, because we feel them. And second, that physicalism can't

640
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:53,800
account for these conscious experiences. Yeah. So we pause at the experiences because we know

641
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,640
that there are experiences, not because we think we need them to do causal work.

642
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,040
But then you run into this problem, the problem of the paradox of phenomenal judgments.

643
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,680
Sorry, I realized how it took us, of course, there, but it's fine.

644
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:20,120
Sorry. Well, we're here now, I guess. So the paradox of phenomenal judgments is basically

645
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:25,720
this idea that, you know, there are these experiences, the experiences don't come down

646
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:34,040
and sort of affect my brain. So how is it that I could possibly know about these experiences

647
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:43,720
if they're not actually doing any causal work? And so this paper is attempting to respond to this,

648
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:50,840
to this, and to give an account of how it is that a dualist, an epiphenomenalist dualist could accept

649
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,400
that you actually can know about your experiences, even if they're epiphenomenal.

650
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:02,440
And actually, it sort of made sense that you thought of this in the earlier response that I

651
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:09,720
was giving, I think, because the response that I give there appeals to the idea that the experiences

652
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:18,440
themselves, while they're not a part of my brain, they are a part of my mind, and they are embedded

653
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:24,280
in a sense in the judgments, which are also mental things. So there's this conscious judgment that has,

654
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:32,040
as a constituent, the pain itself or the phenomenal redness itself. And what I'm aware of

655
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:37,640
is the conscious judgment and the thing that I'm judging. And both of those things are generated

656
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:44,520
by my mind. But the awareness sort of isn't happening in my physical brain, the awareness

657
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,000
is all stuff that's being generated by my brain and is all happening sort of at the conscious

658
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:57,560
mental level, in a sense. Helen, who do you, which philosophers or philosophical views do you think

659
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,160
challenge your nature of reality the most?

660
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,440
It's interesting to see how we perceive our, the people who say no to our theories.

661
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, well, I mean, who gives the best examples of why this, this wouldn't be true.

662
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:29,560
Yeah, it's a little hard. It's a little, I'm sort of paused for a little bit, in part, because

663
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,960
I'm not, I think maybe the task that I've set myself in a sense is easier than the task that

664
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,720
I think a lot of idealists have set themselves, in that I'm not trying to argue that you have to

665
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,840
be an idealist. I'm just trying to argue that idealism is possible, as opposed to that it's

666
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,480
necessarily true. I'm trying to argue first that it's possible and second that it's

667
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:55,480
more likely than you might have thought. So it's harder to give a knockdown argument of that

668
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,000
than it would be to give a knockdown argument of this is necessarily the way that reality is.

669
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,680
So, I mean, if you wanted to argue that it's not even possible,

670
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,120
sounds like a very strange, it seems like a very hard task to set yourself to argue that's not

671
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,840
possible. I think the biggest pretty much possible, I think that's why this is, I mean, it's because

672
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,600
no one can do that. Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest challenges to idealism come from the

673
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:30,120
incredible complexity of idealism. That's not necessarily a view as just a straight up problem

674
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:35,320
that the idealist has to reckon with. So, I mean, like I was telling you, when you were pointing

675
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:39,720
out that, you know, well, look, we're not at the top of the, you know, maybe we're at the top of

676
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,400
the food chain, but we're not at the top of like, in the sense, we're not has some privileged,

677
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,760
glowing place in reality, right? And I was like, yeah, but I don't think our experiences have

678
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,480
a privileged, glowing place in reality. There's, you know, the tapestry of reality is this, you

679
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:59,560
know, incredibly complex, rich thing that includes far more than us and our experiences aren't in

680
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:07,480
any way special. But once you accept and embrace that, you see that reality for an idealist is

681
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,760
incredibly complicated. I mean, you know, you think, well, my experiences are part of reality.

682
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,480
The experiences that an inverted twin would have, they're part of reality, the experiences a bat

683
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,440
would have, the experiences the bee would have, the experiences the snake would have,

684
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,520
the experiences the Martian would have. I mean, once you get to that, you're like,

685
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,400
is there any limit to all the experiences that are bound up as part of reality? Or is

686
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:35,320
reality sort of infinitely complex? And I think there are ways for the idealists to

687
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,400
stave off the idea that it's infinitely complex. But it does wind up being incredibly complex,

688
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:46,360
whereas, you know, a materialist can come at the idealist and say, look, we just think there's

689
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:53,640
this little simple particle, and it just has one simple little nature to it. And it, you know,

690
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:00,440
combines with other particles that are similarly simple and minimalistic. And the diversity of

691
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:05,320
experiences is just something that happens when you have different perceivers who actually are

692
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,840
perceiving things. But those aren't extra parts of reality, and they don't exist unless they're

693
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:16,920
actually is a bee or a bat or a person in the room. So I think that that's really the biggest

694
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:23,000
challenge for idealism just is the the profligacy of it, I guess, the idea that that it has all

695
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,320
this richness built into reality. Are there any specific idealists or people who believe

696
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:35,640
that ideally that the fundamental fundamental nature of reality is mined? Any specific philosophers

697
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:41,880
or scientists today that you think are providing this view with a lot of backing and like support

698
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:50,440
in a very effective manner? Yeah. You're just going to see my own ignorance and how at the

699
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:57,240
extent to which I'm in my own mind here. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of there are a lot of

700
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:03,960
different people playing with a lot of very different but related views. I'm most

701
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,520
views are very different from each other. They're from what I've gathered so far.

702
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,160
Right, right. So I mean, I'm more familiar with the philosophical side of things, although I'd

703
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,880
love to learn from you about people in other disciplines who are doing relevant related work.

704
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:25,320
So I mean, I think there's a lot of work in panpsychism to sort of had a bit of a rise

705
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,640
before idealism has so it's sort of more well known and has had more development of it.

706
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,800
But I know Noam Chomsky had been referencing Galen Strausson who is, as he says, quite brilliant

707
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:44,520
and excellent and Philip Goff had a march. So there have been a lot of panpsychists recently

708
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,200
who've been sort of developing and trying to refine and hone those views. They're quite

709
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:55,320
different views, I think, from the view that I'm interested in. I really admire the work of Mike

710
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:02,280
Pelisar, who's a phenomenalist, again, a very different sort of view. But he's done just a

711
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:09,480
remarkable job of trying to show that phenomenalism, which is a view that I think a lot of people had

712
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:15,960
decided was dead and buried, actually has a lot more going for it than you might think. And he's

713
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,160
somebody who also you're asking about views that pose challenges to idealism. He's somebody that

714
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:27,000
does do that, that actually directly takes and says, look, phenomenalism trumps idealism and

715
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:39,800
gives a really kind of clever argument to that effect. So Pelisar argues that we, he sort of

716
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:46,600
imagines a world that has one sort of intrinsic nature, maybe it's a materialist world. And then

717
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,280
overnight, while we're sleeping, the nature of the world changes. And now it's a Barclayan world.

718
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,200
And then overnight, it changes again. Now it's a panpsychist world. Then overnight,

719
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:04,680
it changes again. And we're all living in the matrix. But of course, throughout all of this,

720
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:10,120
there is no change whatsoever to anything that we observe. The world seems, from our

721
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,680
perspective, exactly the same. And then you imagine that at the end of all of this,

722
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:21,560
the newspapers reveal nature of reality constantly shifting. Now, what would the newspapers say?

723
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:27,480
Would they say that the world ceased to exist? In every night, the world is ceased to exist?

724
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:34,680
No, they wouldn't say that. They'd completely ignore it. Or they'd be like, weird fact.

725
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:41,240
So the lesson that Pelisar draws from this is that what's essential to being our world,

726
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,080
the world that we care about, is the thing that all of these things have in common,

727
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,320
namely the potentials for experiences that we're having throughout all of these.

728
01:12:50,760 --> 01:13:00,680
And so it's not, even if our world ultimately has a Barclayan god that is at the base of it,

729
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,840
that's not really what's essential to being our world. What's really essential is the potentials

730
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:10,840
for experience. So this is something that Pelisar has argued against all the other views,

731
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,080
which I think is a fun and clever argument.

732
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:21,720
Red argument. Yeah. I think the idealist can resist it. Whereas I think the other people

733
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:27,800
can't resist it, which is I think kind of cool. But it would be very difficult to tell the difference

734
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:34,280
if it did change constantly. Yeah. Yeah. This is very several philosophical questions indeed.

735
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,480
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, I think, you know, the way that an idealist potentially

736
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:46,600
could resist it is, you know, if you imagine that the world has been, imagine an idealist world.

737
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,040
And as I said, as I said a little bit ago when we were talking about naive idealism,

738
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:59,720
about the theory of perception that I propose, for the idealist, we're directly in contact

739
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:06,760
with reality, right? We directly grasp the world around us. So a way that I like to put it is that

740
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:13,560
so Dave Chalmers has this paper where he talks about like perception and the fall from Eden,

741
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:19,160
where he imagined this perceptual Eden. And in perceptual Eden, you know, the world, the world

742
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,560
was just as it seemed, right? The world seems like it includes, here we go. I've got a green dinosaur

743
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:30,760
I'm holding up. The world seems like it includes, you know, phenomenal greenness there as a part

744
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:37,560
of it. Greenness is a primitive element of reality. And it seems like I directly apprehend

745
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:44,440
this greenness when I look at the green dinosaur that I'm holding up. And then, you know, Chalmers

746
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,400
says, look, we think these things. And then we do some science and we realize, no, greenness

747
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,960
isn't out there in the world. There's just a surface reflectance property that the dinosaur has

748
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,040
certain wavelengths of light bounce off of it. My brain does certain things and I have an experience

749
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:05,160
as a result. But there's no like green property out there in the world. And, you know, similarly,

750
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,880
we maybe think that we directly apprehend, you know, properties in the world that we directly

751
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:15,160
grasp them. And then we learn that no, actually, we only grasp them in this very indirect way,

752
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:23,080
through this long complicated causal chain of, you know, physics. Now, if idealism is right,

753
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:31,960
we actually do live in Eden, right? If idealism is right, the world around us is precisely the

754
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:39,480
world that it seems. Greenness, warmth, you know, all of these things are actually part of reality.

755
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,400
And furthermore, they're part of reality that we directly apprehend. We don't stand at a distance

756
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:50,520
from them and just sort of, you know, get them indirectly and then have some experience that

757
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:56,360
our brain generates, right? We really are in touch with reality. So I think if that's right,

758
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,360
and if we imagine that we live in an idealist world, you know, that's the world that we've

759
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,200
always grown up in. And then, you know, at midnight last night, it turns out that

760
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,320
the nature of reality changed. And now we all live in a materialist world.

761
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:16,200
I actually do think, whoa, wait a minute, we went from having a world that is just the way

762
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:22,440
that it seems, that has greenness as part of it, that I directly apprehend to a world that I'm only

763
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,840
indirectly in touch with, and I, you know, just sort of stand at a distance from, and there's no

764
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:33,400
greenness or warmth in the world. That's a big cost. And yeah, I do think, you know, maybe that,

765
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,400
maybe we would say the world that we knew is gone. So I think, I think the idealist has

766
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:43,080
some resources to respond, but I still think it's a very, a very clever argument.

767
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:50,200
But ideally, ideally, if everything is fundamentally matter or mind,

768
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,880
there shouldn't necessarily be a change in our perception when the thing does change

769
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:02,680
from material to mind. I mean, it shouldn't actually still feel the same way, except we

770
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:08,680
haven't learned the science, perhaps in this new materialistic world that provides us with

771
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,960
knowledge now, that that's not true. You probably would still experience it as

772
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:21,720
Yeah, it would still seem the same way to us. But in a sense, something very different would

773
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:27,240
be going on. So it would be kind of, you know, like, like, you know, I could have, I know this is

774
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,720
just a philosopher's imagination of hallucinations, that we don't actually have hallucinations that

775
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:37,640
are qualitatively indistinguishable from from this, this world. But, you know, you could,

776
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:42,200
we can imagine that I could have a hallucination of talking to you right now on a computer that

777
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:50,360
would be exactly from the inside feel exactly the same way. But without there being any reality

778
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:57,640
outside of my mind. So I think we can't necessarily read off from the way that things would seem

779
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:06,600
from the inside to, to, to the sorts of questions about like, whether we're truly perceiving things

780
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:15,080
and how we're related to things. Is there anything surrounding your, your view on idealism that you

781
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,320
that you've always wanted to argue or say or talk about that you've been holding in and you just

782
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:26,360
really wanted to get out there? I think I think that would be the best time. Oh, gosh. I mean,

783
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,960
something you've always felt misunderstood by I mean, have people ever come to you and said like,

784
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,120
do you think, why do you think that the world is all mine? Like, have people come to you with

785
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:39,480
some basic arguments that you've always felt? Let me clarify and clear this up right now.

786
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:47,960
Yeah. I mean, definitely idealism is extremely misunderstood. I mean, I guess there's a,

787
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:53,400
I guess the two things that jump out are, which are things that I've said before, but, but that

788
01:18:53,400 --> 01:19:01,080
still, I think maybe bear, bear forcefully repeating. So the first is just that idealism is

789
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,320
not at least a sort of idealist view that I am defending and that people like Barkley are

790
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:12,600
defending. It's not an anti-realist view. It's a, it's not a theory according to which there is no

791
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,840
world, there is no physical reality. It's a view about the nature of the world and the nature of

792
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,880
that physical reality. So, you know, you've got the, you remember who it was? Do you remember who

793
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,600
it was who was trying to refute Barkley by kicking the stone and saying, I refute you thus? I think

794
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:40,760
it was. Not Locke. Anyway, is a famous, famous, famous, ridiculous, ridiculous. No, it was

795
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,400
not humor. No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't, it wasn't a super famous philosopher. It was,

796
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:52,920
yeah, some, some, oh, I kind of know what you're talking about now. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, and it,

797
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,000
I mean, it's just such a ridiculous misunderstanding of the view, right? Because

798
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,480
the view precisely is one where there are rocks and it's trying to give an account of what the

799
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,120
rocks are. So, I mean, Barkley. What rocks are, that's the problem is that we don't really know

800
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:13,480
what rocks are. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so, I mean, kicking a rock doesn't help anyone. No, it doesn't.

801
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,440
But so I think that's why I like to, to sort of think about Idealism and to present it to people

802
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:28,520
who are physicalists with that sort of analogy to how reductive physicalists think about the mind.

803
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:34,040
You know, look, you're not denying, you at least don't think that you're denying that there is such

804
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,120
a thing as consciousness. You're trying to give an account of what it is and analysis of it. And

805
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,440
similarly, I'm not trying to deny that there are rocks. I'm trying to give an analysis of

806
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:47,560
what their nature is. So that's, that's one thing. I mean, I think the other thing is that I think

807
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,680
when people hear you talking about idealism and hear you defending idealism, it's always

808
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:57,800
naturally assumed that you are an idealist and that you think that the world is an idealist world.

809
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:04,280
And I'm actually engaged in a project that's, as I said, a little bit maybe sneakier than that

810
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:11,000
and harder to argue against, which is just the project of arguing that, you know, there could be

811
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,200
a world that is just as our world seems to us, that has a particular sort of nature and idealist

812
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:24,920
nature. And then second, looking at, you know, suppose that we take a world that seems just as

813
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:29,480
our world does, it's an idealist world, and suppose we take a world that seems just as our world does,

814
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:33,640
that's a materialist world, I think that there are both sorts of, I think both sorts of things are

815
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:40,680
possible. And, you know, take each of these possibilities and look at the complete total

816
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:45,640
worldview that's on offer from both sides. So not just what it says about the metaphysics,

817
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,600
but what it says about the mind-body problem, what it says about the nature of perception.

818
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:58,520
And then, you know, take those total packages and see which one of these looks more plausible and

819
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,480
has more theoretical virtues. And that's the project that I'm engaged in. It's the project of

820
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:09,000
not arguing that you can't accept a certain view, but of arguing you can accept this view.

821
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,440
And furthermore, when we compare the total packages, it actually looks much better than you would have

822
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,840
thought and perhaps better than the materialist view. Yeah, you're trying to ensure that people

823
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:24,600
apply as an important level of credence to this view as opposed to perhaps a materialistic view,

824
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:30,120
because ideally when people think about it, they automatically shun it down as if it's completely

825
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:35,000
absurd. But when you hear certain people's arguments, it means clear that this is a

826
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,320
possibility. This is because for people, when I started this, if I was, let's say, 10 years ago,

827
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:47,960
20 years ago, I would be completely materialist. I'd be physicalist all the way down. And even

828
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:54,040
though my intuitions are very much physicalist, I still don't, I know how much we don't know,

829
01:22:54,040 --> 01:23:00,760
the unknown unknowns. So it's almost impossible to have that Gnosticism regarding reality. I think

830
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:06,600
Raymond Talis, I often bring it up, he says he's ontologically agnostic, but epistemologically,

831
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:13,320
he knows most of us are wrong. I mean, I love that, because that's so true. That's exactly why

832
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,720
I have this podcast. I mean, it's an opportunity for someone to bring up a view just like this.

833
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:22,760
I mean, to have that opportunity to discuss it. Helen, I mean, if we had to close off,

834
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:27,160
they've here to think of five philosophers, your favorite five philosophers, I know it's

835
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,120
difficult. It's like picking a mad rush mode of like, big people, who would those be? Because I

836
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:36,840
feel like when people read your work, get to know who you are, they're going to want to know who are

837
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:43,640
the people they should read that inspire you and make you the philosophy today. Okay, well, I would

838
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,280
definitely say, Dave Chalmers, who I know you've had previous guests, at least one,

839
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:54,200
sip me some not so favorable things about. So I'll just give a plug for Dave.

840
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,520
Hopefully, I have Dave on soon at some point. So it's fine.

841
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:06,040
Oh, fantastic. Well, everybody will enjoy his podcast. So actually, another person who you've

842
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:12,760
already had on whose work I just absolutely love is Eric Schwitzkabel, who I think, I mean,

843
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:19,400
just both in terms of defending views that might seem bonkers, but then giving really

844
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,960
interesting creative arguments for them that are incredibly fun. I mean, anybody who has

845
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:29,400
the opportunity to read any of his his work, I mean, everything he writes is just really fun to

846
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:35,080
read. Eric is very underrated. I enjoy his work very much. Yeah. And actually, my husband had asked

847
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:41,480
me who I thought the whatever the best philosopher of mind in the world besides Chalmers was. And

848
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:47,560
I was like, ah, you know, and he's like, well, who would you who would you whose work would you

849
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,040
be most excited about reading if you heard some new paper come out? And the tricky thing with that

850
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:56,040
is that, you know, in general, it's the kind of people who work in the on the stuff that I work

851
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:00,680
on. But I did realize that of all the people who don't do directly the stuff that I work on,

852
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,040
hands down, it's Eric Schwitzkabel, because anything he writes is going to be brilliant.

853
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,720
I mean, he's got some fascinating topics like the philosophy of science fiction. I mean,

854
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:16,280
he goes into some very intriguing domain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, yeah, he's got a book on

855
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,640
the perplexities of consciousness that's very fun and accessible, arguing you have no clue what's

856
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:27,880
going on in your own mind. And I think a paper if United States, sorry, if materialism is true,

857
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:32,120
the United States is probably conscious that involves these incredible fantastical science

858
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:43,320
fiction examples to try to make this case. Yeah. But so I guess I've also mentioned Mike Pellisar,

859
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,840
if anybody's interested in sort of similar like idealist adjacent things, I think he's also a

860
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,640
very good and underrated philosopher. Oh, I don't know how's your name? Catty Balog is somebody

861
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:05,000
who's a physicalist, a, an opistory or a physicalist, who I think is a really also very underrated,

862
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,840
very subtle, interesting, interesting philosopher. Not sure if I've given it five.

863
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,920
Historical philosophers, some of the. Yeah, shout outs to Barkley and Locke.

864
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,240
I had a feeling those two names would come up. No, Helen, I mean, it's been an absolute pleasure

865
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:27,480
chatting to you. This has been such a fascinating conversation. I mean, even listening to you,

866
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,320
it reminds me of the conversation I've had with Eric. I can tell you that type of person who

867
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,640
is very intrigued by a lot of these ontological questions, the metaphysical side of things.

868
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:40,920
And it's really great to have people like you out there challenging and pioneering these,

869
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:47,000
these arguments and these views, because ideally there's, then we just get stuck in our own world.

870
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:55,320
Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, I think in a sense, it is, it is, it's very much a creative,

871
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:02,600
a sort of a creative world building, almost endeavor that, but I hope is thought provoking

872
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,160
in the way that you described. So it's very nice to hear you say that.

873
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,400
I think without you, this tapestry would not exist. I mean, we all have to sort of give up.

874
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,960
Oh, no, which indicates that my view is wrong if you're right, but

875
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:20,200
we all have to sort of give our views and sort of get into that argument and just have a great

876
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,720
time doing it. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me on. This has been a pleasure.

877
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,840
Thanks so much, Helen. I really appreciate your time and I look forward to reading more of your work.

878
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:35,640
Super.
