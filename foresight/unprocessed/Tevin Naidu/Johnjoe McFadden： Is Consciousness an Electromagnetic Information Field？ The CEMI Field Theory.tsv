0	16800	Jaja, you have a great approach of addressing the problems of consciousness. You go through
16800	22000	the why, the how, the why not, the what, the where. So these are talking about the heart
22000	27600	problem, the binding problem. What is the difference between conscious and unconscious
27600	33520	brain processes? Where is the seat of consciousness? So I'd like you to start this conversation by
33520	39040	running us through these processes. And in doing so, I'd also appreciate if you could talk me
39040	44000	through your views on all of this prior to your quantum biology revolution, because it's always
44000	49040	interesting to see how someone's view changes over time as well, regarding your concepts.
50000	57280	Okay. So first, why are we interested in consciousness? Because if you look, if you
57280	63680	get to the butcher shop and you look at a brain from a cow, it just looks like meat. That's what
63680	70320	our brain would look like, a lump of meat. And the strangest thing in the universe, in my view,
70320	77680	is the fact that a lump of meat can know it's there. And that to me is profoundly puzzling. And
77920	84480	strange, because nothing else outside of that lump of meat inside our heads and presumably other
84480	90080	people's or other animal's head has this property of knowing itself, knowing that it is around,
90080	99440	that it is a thing. And that property is kind of mysterious, because it's outside of science.
99440	106880	Science does not talk about this. It's not an area that can ever look inside our heads. And this
107200	113040	describes our experience. It's only a first person account that we can have a go of our
113040	118640	experience. And yet, it's the most important part of us. It's what would life be like if we were
118640	125760	totally zombies, as the conscious community tends to call it. If we were zombies that have no
126320	132320	consciousness, what would be the purpose of life then? So it's profoundly important. It's something
132320	141360	that, in one way or another, I've always had an interest in. I've always been interested in the
141360	149120	history of ideas and history of ideas going back to the myths and stories and the religious basis
149120	155360	of where the religion comes from. It seems to come from the same question, really, that what is it
155360	162000	that's inside us that is the us that is important to us and makes us feel that we're worth
162080	171040	maintaining our life. So that, to me, is the most profound and interesting question of not only
171040	179520	science and the whole of the world. Of course, not only science deals with the puzzle of
179520	188000	consciousness, lots of literature and art also is around this strange understanding we have of
188000	198320	ourselves and our perceptions. So that's always been the puzzle. And I didn't really get interested
198320	207600	in trying to figure it out scientifically until over 20, 25 years ago, something like that, I guess,
208320	220160	when I was, I wrote a book called Quantum Evolution, it was published in 2000. I became
220160	226560	interested in the idea that quantum mechanics may be involved in life, in life more generally,
226560	233760	not consciousness at this stage, but I thought it might be involved in evolution and I grew in
233760	240320	touch with the, because I didn't know very much if anything at all about quantum mechanics, I got
240320	248400	in touch with Jim Alcalely, who is a famous broadcaster and physicist, who was at the same
248400	255520	university as me at the University of Surrey. And we, and it was then about evolution and mutation
255520	260400	and whether quantum mechanics may be involved in this. And, you know, we're still pursuing that
261360	267920	at the University of Surrey and unraveling that question of whether quantum mechanics is involved
267920	276400	in mutation. But it did get me profoundly interested in the role of quantum mechanics in life more
276400	286400	generally. And then I thought it's a book and I persuaded a publisher to give me an advance to
286400	292160	write it, which was called Quantum Evolution. Now, in the book proposal, I had chapter 13,
293200	299600	which was reserved for probably the most famous consciousness idea, the idea put forward by
300800	304720	Roger Penrose and Stuart Hammerhoff, that consciousness can be explained by quantum
304720	310320	mechanics and it's going to do gravity and gravitational collapse of wave functions.
311280	316480	That sounded kind of interesting. And I thought, well, that's a good thing for chapter 13. That was
316480	322080	the final chapter of the book, which otherwise looked at things like enzymes and DNA and that
322080	327040	kind of thing. So, but chapter 13, I thought, okay, it's consciousness. And then when I started
327040	332480	reading it, I knew enough about quantum mechanics at the time to kind of gave me pause and thought,
333200	339200	well, actually, what they're proposing, Hammerhoff and Penrose doesn't work.
341520	348960	They propose an interesting idea that structures called microtubules in the brain, which transport
348960	354320	neurotransmitters up and down neurons, that they could be in a quantum mechanical state.
354320	358480	And by this time, by the time I got to chapter 13, when writing the book, I'll get
358480	364800	new a lot about quantum mechanics, a lot more than I did before I put it down as a topic for
364800	371120	chapter 13. And I realized, no, that's not going to work. Microtubules are the busiest structures
371120	376240	in the brain and always doing stuff. There's no way they could be in a quantum mechanical state.
377200	383280	So I was convinced by their story, but reading Roger Penrose is, I then read Roger Penrose's
384240	389680	book, Emperor of the Mind. Emperor of the Mind, the Emperor of the New Clothes,
389680	395040	as I think of Roger Penrose, his book, On Consciousness, who come to me the title in a moment,
395040	401200	but he convinced me that consciousness is a kind of field. And that's the fundamental idea that
401200	407440	goes behind all of young field theories of consciousness and my own idea that when I look
407520	415760	at my window here in the UK, and I see trees, I see wall, I see people moving around,
416720	421440	I don't see them as independent things. They're all part of a single structure,
421440	433680	which is my conscious mind. And how do you account for that in science? When, if we encode
433760	439520	information, say, in a computer, it's all split down into binary digits. And one binary digit will
439520	444480	be there, another will be over there, and they're all distributed all over the place. And this
444480	451360	brings us to the binding problem, which is a famous problem in consciousness, that how is all
451360	457040	the information bound up in your brain, or the matter is divided up into lots of discrete units,
457040	463520	like atoms and neurons, et cetera, biomolecules or microtubules, they're all separate stuff.
464320	470560	And information is distributed amongst all of them. So for example, if I'm looking at the trees
470560	476480	across the road, facets of the trees such as the color of the leaves, the color of the bark,
476480	482560	the shape of the leaves, the texture, the movement of the branches as they're swaying in the wind,
482560	487680	all of those facets are encoded in different parts of our brains, in different neurons,
487680	492800	in different areas of the brain. But that's not what it feels like. It feels like our conscious
492800	500320	mind is stuck together. It's a single physical entity of which we are at the center of. And
500880	507360	how do you make that? And what Roger Penrose proposed in his Emperor of the Mind, or whatever the
507440	513760	book is called, something like that, is that it was a field. And what we mean by field is like
513760	520320	the gravitational field that holds us, holds me on my seat at the moment. If you're standing up,
521360	528160	it holds you to the ground. And the field is everywhere around, it's invisible, it's everywhere.
528880	533360	But the field that the soul of your feet, if you're standing on the ground is an integration
533360	539040	of the mass of your body and the mass of the entire planet. That's what's holding you at
539920	546160	the soles of your feet to the ground. And that's kind of remarkable. And that's feature of fields,
546160	551920	physical fields, that all of the information is distributed everywhere within the field. It is
551920	560240	indivisible. There's no place where the soles of your feet or the continent of Australia,
560240	566880	which is contributing to you being standing at that point, it's everywhere within the field. It's
566880	572000	not just in Australia, it's at the soles of your feet as well, that information which provides a
572000	578160	little bit of the gravitational force that holds you there. And that's really I thought what we
578160	582560	needed for consciousness. Penrose thought that many people before him have thought that. And
582560	587760	when I did more research, it goes back to guest out philosophers back in the early part of the
587840	594800	20th century, they also proposed that consciousness was some kind of field. But that kind of fell
594800	601360	out of favor when neuroscientists started studying the brain and seeing that when you see neurons,
601360	608960	you don't see fields, you see neurons and they communicate by these synapses and neuron firing
608960	614880	and all that kind of stuff. And that doesn't involve fields. So the idea that consciousness
614880	625760	was some kind of field fell into disuse, if you like. Penrose re-energized it with his proposal
625760	631360	that it was a quantum field. But the quantum mechanics, what quantum mechanics does is it
631360	639360	turns matter into a field. So if you have an atom of matter that's behaving quantum mechanically,
639360	642960	then it doesn't have a fixed position in space, just like the information of the
643520	649520	of the mass of Australia isn't a fixed position in the gravitational field of the earth, it's
649520	657360	everywhere. Well, an atom can be everywhere in quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics is really
657920	664480	a science about fields. So if there was in the brain a quantum mechanical field, then it could
664480	671280	account for consciousness. But the problem is in making quantum mechanical fields out of matter
671280	678240	is hard. Normally, you have to have a very simple system, an atom or two in a box cooled down to
678240	685920	absolute zero as close as you can get to it in a vacuum on an optical table, which will remove any
685920	691280	vibrations or anything. And when you've got all this, you might retain a quantum mechanical state,
691280	695920	those two or three atoms can behave as a single entity for, you know,
696720	702720	in picoseconds or some very short length of time. But that's not going to happen in the brain.
703520	709520	So although I was convinced that quantum that consciousness is a field, I wasn't convinced
709520	716720	that it could be done by a matter field quantum mechanical matter field. So I looked around for
716720	721280	what is there any other field in the brain. And of course, there is the field that people have
721280	726240	been looking at for over a century, even then when I was first thinking about it,
726240	732640	people knew that was the brain generates its own electromagnetic field. And that electromagnetic
732640	738720	field is what physicians measure when they put the electrodes on your skull to do an EEG,
738720	746000	they've been measuring it for 100 years or more. And mostly they've thought it's just
746960	752000	there's just a consequence of the brain's activity, but doesn't impact on the brain's
752000	758800	activity in any way. It's often described as the steam whistle of a steam train generates
759360	765440	a whistle, we know about it, you can detect it with the EEG electrodes, but it doesn't function in
765440	772000	any way. But it occurred to me, well, if consciousness isn't in the matter of the brain,
772240	776320	in the electromagnetic field generated by brain, the brain's activity,
776320	781920	then it already has some very interesting properties. For example, it contains all of the
781920	789520	information in firing neurons. And that's kind of useful, because we've got an awful lot of
789520	796560	information on conscious mind, it's distributed all over the brain. But in the brain's ear and field
796560	802720	is everywhere within the brain's EM field. So that was kind of good. But it also has a very
802720	813760	interesting property. And that's to do with how fields interact. And this, to me, was the key
813760	820880	to thinking, wow, this could really be it. At that time, Francis Crick started to work on
820880	827600	consciousness and the Nobel Prize winners for discovering the structure of DNA. Before Francis
827600	834080	Crick worked on consciousness, working on consciousness as a scientist was like working
834080	842320	on fairies. I'm going to study fairies from now on. It was a career destroying move, if you said
842320	846640	you're going to work on consciousness. Nobody worked on consciousness. It was considered only
846640	853280	crackbots worked on consciousness. But then this mega brain, Francis Crick started to work on
853280	858240	consciousness and suddenly became respectable to think about consciousness. So he put a lot of
858880	865920	gave conscious the consciousness field a really big boost. What he said was the best way to get
865920	870080	into studying the brain is first of all, start with looking at the correlates of consciousness.
870720	876240	What that means is, when we, for example, I'm always losing my glasses on them.
878000	883600	When I take them off and I can't find them, and they're somewhere on a very messy desktop,
883600	887760	I'm looking at that desktop and I can't see my glasses, then suddenly I can see them.
889280	896160	Now, what happens between the millisecond before I saw them, when I was looking at them,
896880	903600	the image of them was on my retina, but I still wasn't seeing them. And then suddenly I can see
903600	911680	them. What happens in that few milliseconds between the image entering my retina, being in
911680	917840	my brain, being processed, but I'm not seeing them. And when you see, when you become consciously
917840	923760	aware of my glasses, in this case, and what a number of studies have demonstrated in the 1990s
923760	931120	mostly, and the early 2000s, is that the best correlates of consciousness is not the neuron
931120	940720	firing per se, but when neurons fire in sync. Though I'll be nearly there to the end of the
940720	948000	where we get to the next moment. But when they fire in sync, you become conscious. Now, that's a
948000	954960	bit of a puzzle, because neurons process information in independent, you know, the shape of my
954960	960400	glasses, the colors of my glasses, all of those features will be processed in independent neurons.
960400	965280	They're all firing, but not in sync. And then they get in sync, and suddenly I'm aware of them. Why?
966080	968880	Informate, they're going through the same neural pathways, as we know.
969840	976560	But there's a feature of electromagnetic waves, which explains it. When electromagnetic waves,
976640	983840	like any wave, if they're waving in sync, then they have what's called constructive interference.
983840	989600	The signal is amplified, because all of the waves peak some troughs, match up, and you get a bigger
989600	994720	signal. It's like two waves in the sea. If they're waving in sync, then you're going to get a bigger
994720	1001040	wave. Whereas if they're waving out of sync, then the wave will be destroyed. So if consciousness
1001520	1006000	is the brain's electromagnetic field, then we would expect it to correlate with
1006000	1012320	synchronously firing neurons. And in the 1990s, that was demonstrated in monkeys and mice,
1012320	1018800	and later in humans. That is the best correlate of consciousness. So it just made sense to me that,
1018800	1023520	okay, all we need to do is switch from the matter of the brain to the electromagnetic field of the
1023520	1028480	brain, you solve the binding problem, all your information is stuck together, and it matches
1028480	1033680	up with the strongest correlates of consciousness, synchronous firing. And he explains why synchronous
1033680	1042000	firing is associated with consciousness. So that was a revelation to me. And then it all made sense,
1042000	1047760	and I thought, well, surely someone must have published about this idea before. I searched
1047760	1053680	around, and no one did. Well, I might as well put a paper or two in, and I did. I met and had published
1053680	1061040	a couple of papers on this idea. And that was more than 20 years ago now. And mostly it's been
1061040	1067520	not taken seriously for most of those two decades or so. But now it's beginning to gain some momentum
1067520	1073520	partly because of all the other theories of consciousness have kind of failed to really
1073520	1078880	make progress in understanding a phenomenon where people say, well, we need something else.
1078880	1085040	And I think that's what we need. The understanding the brains in field is where our conscious mind
1085040	1089440	sits. So a very long explanation that gets us to the beginning of the story.
1090320	1094720	I mean, this is just the very beginning for for all those who are not familiar. Let's let's let's
1094720	1100240	define it. I mean, you call it the consciousness electromagnetic information theory, field theory,
1100240	1106000	sorry, so the semi field theory. Do you want to define that for people? Yeah, so it's conscious
1106640	1112320	information because it's encodes information and information. I mean information about the outside
1112320	1118160	world. So this excludes EM fields that generated by toasters and stuff like this, which are not
1118160	1125200	really communicating anything useful about the outside world. So it's information that is from
1125200	1132080	our senses. And that gets from our memory and neurons, they get transmitted into the brains in
1132080	1137760	field. And what is interesting about the brains in field that was discovered more
1139680	1145920	after my first papers on consciousness is that it does influence neuron firing. Because if that's
1145920	1150720	all that happened, if it was transmitted, the information is transmitted into the brains in
1150720	1156160	field, then who cares? It's there. It's a reflection of the information in the brain, but it's not
1156160	1163920	doing anything. But if if the brains in field influences neuron firing, then it can have a
1163920	1169600	feedback that your conscious mind can start pulling on the levers of the neurons. And that's
1169600	1175200	exactly what it's done. It's it does lots of studies, including some more recently, my own lab
1175200	1180160	have looked at the effect of EM fields on neurons and neurons are both transmitters
1180960	1187280	of information into the brain's electromagnetic field. But they are also receivers of that
1187280	1193920	information. So it provides a loop of information from the neurons going into the brain's electromagnetic
1193920	1198160	field where it all gets joined up. And there you can start thinking because that's where your
1198160	1203360	thinking is happening in your conscious mind. And then your thoughts can influence your brain,
1203360	1208320	can pull on the levers of neurons to do the kind of actions that we call our free will.
1209040	1216480	That's the fascinating component of this is that you you've taken this complex subject of
1216480	1222560	consciousness and which is a very deep philosophical question in its own right. And then you've also
1222560	1228240	managed to now approach another topic that people often discuss in various different debates,
1228240	1234560	which is free will. You've managed to tie these two concepts together. And it's interesting because
1234560	1238160	when you first spoke about this, when I first read about it many years ago,
1238880	1244720	I thought about the fact that people think about electromagnetic fields and they talk about it,
1244720	1249760	particularly scientists, in a very mystical manner, you know, so like this is, and this is
1249760	1254880	especially true in medicine as a doctor, I see it when you talk to another biologist or a doctor
1254880	1258960	that when you start talking about anything regarding electromagnetic fields, they start to
1258960	1266400	think that you're going down some sort of spiritual mystical, non-physical realm. Has that been what's
1266400	1270880	been occurring to you as well? Do you feel like your theory is automatically placed in this group
1270880	1275760	of mysticism? And that's not the case. Is this not ultimately a physicalist theory, if I'm not
1275760	1280960	mistaken? Yeah, I think that that is a problem. That's one of the reasons why it's taken a while
1280960	1287040	for it to become at least partly accepted, because it is grouped along with the wacky stuff, if you
1287040	1293280	like. Yes, we have crystal therapists who are putting crystals on your body and claiming there's
1293280	1300000	some electromagnetic field coming in and helping to heal you, and people talk about trees having
1300000	1306720	these electromagnetic field auras around them, so it kind of plays into all of that, but it shouldn't.
1307600	1315200	Electromagnetism is fundamentally scientific, since the work of Max Waller who showed that light,
1315200	1324880	the light that we see is electromagnetism. It's a form of energy that comes from the sun. It's all
1324880	1332400	electromagnetism. In fact, all of the things that happen on our world pretty much apart from gravity
1332400	1337680	are all down to electromagnetism in one way or another. Chemistry is really all electromagnetism.
1337680	1342560	It's pretty much everything that happens that we see is about electromagnetic interactions.
1343520	1351040	It's not spooky at all, but it is not physical. Sorry, it's not material. It's not material,
1351040	1357280	and that's the key difference that makes people kind of hesitant about it, because it's invisible.
1357280	1361040	You can't see it. When you look at the brain, you see a big lump of matter and say, well,
1361040	1367120	that's it. That's the brain. That's all that's happening. The dead brain, it's not happening
1367120	1374000	well, but a live brain has an invisible electromagnetic field, which is just as rich in information
1374560	1380560	as the brain's neurons. But as I said, it has that extra property of all the information being
1380560	1386960	joined up as joined up as the information in a single photon or a single electron. It is completely
1386960	1394640	physically united within the brain's electromagnetic field, and thereby binds the information in our
1394640	1401280	conscious mind. So, yes, it's not materialist theory, but it is a figureless, physicalist
1401280	1406400	theory. And that, I think, is when people say they're materialist, after me, it shouldn't really be
1406400	1412000	saying that I have physicalists, because you can't explain our world with just material. You have to
1412720	1417680	pretty much everything that happens is an interaction between fields, our current understanding of what
1417680	1423120	matter is, what an atom is, and electron is. They are perturbations of fields, of electromagnetic
1423120	1430800	field, gravitational fields, nuclear forces. They are all perturbations of fields. So ultimately,
1430800	1437840	everything is fields. So this isn't a wacky idea at all. It's no more wacky than a materialist.
1439360	1446720	Just because we can see matter doesn't make it not a field. It really is fundamentally
1446720	1451520	another kind of field. It reminds me of one of the things you want. I mean, you mentioned this
1451520	1457920	earlier as well, but the way you describe meat, and just this lump of meat, I mean, when you talk
1457920	1466960	about that way, it sort of highlights this degree of absurdity. And it almost down and brings your
1466960	1473120	theory back into sort of a normal realm of debate and chat, which is an important way to approach
1473120	1480320	this. But I have noticed that other people also seem to have semi-field theories as well. And some
1480320	1486320	of those do tend to go into the spiritual realms. And I think that's also hindering your own process
1486320	1493280	and your own research. Yeah, I agree. I agree. There is a lovely story, actually, by a short story.
1493280	1500800	You can find it online. It's easily found by Terry Bison called They're Made of Meat. It's a story
1500800	1509760	of aliens who discover in some far distant galaxy an intelligence and sentience. And they're all
1509760	1515280	excited about this. And then one of the aliens says, but the strange thing about this sentience
1515280	1521440	is they're made of meat. And they're a gas. What? You mean that's stopped me by a butcher that we
1521440	1527280	eat and chop and make steaks out of? That can't be sentient. That's just nonsense. And then you
1527280	1533200	go on and on and on. And essentially, they decide to suppress the idea. It's so bizarre that
1533200	1540240	consciousness could be made of meat. But that is what everyone else thinks. And it is far more
1540240	1546640	bizarre to think that meat can be conscious than it is to think that electromagnetic field can be
1546640	1555040	conscious. The latter is much more sensible and realistic and less wacky than the idea of a lump
1555040	1561840	of meat is conscious. So, yeah. But yes, you're right. The spiritual stuff, I try to be very
1561840	1567840	rigorous and not get into those deeply philosophical questions about meaning of life and things like
1567840	1574080	this and panpsychism and all those kind of things and try to keep to the nuts and bolts of the,
1575200	1579680	because I think there is a danger in many fields that they can get corrupted by
1581040	1589680	sloppy thinking, sloppy kind of mystical thinking. And I'd like to keep it very scientific,
1590320	1591520	scientific and grounded.
1592320	1599440	John Jo, do you worry about the fact that even when people talk about materialist theories of
1599440	1605200	consciousness, so whether it's matter, some sort of neuronal firing, whether it's a global workspace,
1605200	1610640	whether it's integrated information, people are still going to be concerned that these
1610640	1618480	electromagnetic fields are still merely correlates. And do you think that that still satisfies,
1618800	1625440	satisfies the thirst that some people have for a theory that does not have this correlation
1625440	1629760	issue? Because as we all know, correlation does not equal causation. The information.
1629760	1635920	Yeah, absolutely. Essentially, we have to take a jump somewhere, but I think we have to make
1635920	1643520	the jump as small as possible. And ultimately, we have to come around to the idea that something
1643520	1649680	in our bodies is conscious. Okay, we know that we're conscious or something is conscious. And
1649680	1655600	that's usually bizarre. I mean, as we said, we just made them out of meat and blood and bones
1655600	1659840	and all the rest of it. And some part of it is gone. If I told you that your bones were conscious,
1659840	1665920	you'd say, no, crazy, but it's no more crazy than believing the meat of your brain is conscious.
1666560	1670720	So somewhere, because we have our own introspective experience of being aware,
1671280	1676480	that's got to be a property of something in our brain. So we've got to pin it down somewhere.
1676480	1681200	If we pin it on the matter of the brain, we're stuck with the binding problem. How does it get
1681200	1685920	stuck together to give us our experience? If we put it in the brain's electromagnetic field,
1685920	1691520	then that solves that fundamental problem of consciousness. And a lot more, it makes sense
1691520	1700000	in lots of different ways that we haven't gone into yet. But it's got to go somewhere. And somewhere
1700080	1705920	we've got to take the wacky leap and say that, okay, this thing that we thought was not aware,
1705920	1712320	not conscious, is conscious. Because otherwise, how are we talking at the moment? Why are we
1712320	1718400	arguing about it? Consciousness is a thing. Awareness is a thing. It's got to be pinned on
1718400	1721440	something. The unfilled is the best one.
1722480	1727760	Judge, some people have new theories of understanding the brain-body connection and sort of
1728480	1733280	there are these new concepts like embodied cognition. The fact that we have a brain-gut
1733280	1737760	axis, we've got relationships between our body and brain that are separate entities,
1737760	1744560	almost like having two brains in a sense. The fields you're talking about are consistent with
1744560	1749200	the brain. But what does that have to do with sort of serotonin receptors in the gut,
1749200	1753200	other areas of the body? Does this entwine into these?
1754160	1762000	I don't think it makes any difference from, if you believe consciousness is a matter of the brain
1762640	1768880	or consciousness is the field of the brain, then we still have, it doesn't differentiate
1768880	1774800	between the two theories in terms of whether there's a wider consciousness in, say, the gut
1775680	1784240	or anywhere else. I don't think you need to, I mean, I'm a donor, a kidney donor,
1784240	1794000	I gave my kidney. I don't think I passed any of my consciousness to her when I gave her a kidney.
1794000	1798800	She is not good. She still doesn't like the things I like to eat. She doesn't like the music.
1799760	1806880	So I don't think, yes, there is nothing about the body consciousness and things like that,
1806880	1813120	which convinces me that anything outside the brain needs to be conscious. Because all of those
1813120	1819600	areas that we think we are embodied in the rest of our body and in our gut axis and all the rest
1819600	1823680	of it, they're all connected by neurons to the brain. So the information is in the brain, you
1823680	1832000	don't need to have a consciousness elsewhere. And I think there's absolutely zero evidence for it.
1832000	1836080	There's not any kidneys, there's hearts and other organs that have been transferred from
1836080	1841280	one person to another. And there's no evidence at all that any consciousness is transferred in
1841280	1848480	that operation. Tell me, John, do you know if any sort of, are there any newspapers, aren't there,
1848560	1852160	that sort of describe EM fields anywhere else in the body?
1853840	1863920	Well, there's lots of them. Yeah, heart, for example, we use ECG to detect heart arrhythmias.
1864720	1868000	Sorry, I think I didn't ask the question correctly. What I wanted to know is,
1868000	1872240	do you know if there's any sort of relationship between the EM fields that we do have in the body
1872960	1875760	that link up to sort of the EM fields generated by the brain?
1875840	1881520	Yeah, I don't know if you've, I think you have, I think I looked on your podcast,
1881520	1886640	you've interviewed Mike Levine. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, okay. We've actually chatted a few times, yes.
1887200	1891280	Yeah, fascinating work, him and Wendy Bean. Such amazing work.
1893200	1899920	I think it's the prehistory of consciousness, the kind of thing that he's looking at. It's that
1900880	1907200	he is already finding that the EM fields generated by the body have causal efficacy.
1907200	1913680	They are doing things to help in wound healing and development and some, and those kind of things.
1913680	1921280	That to me is a prehistory of what's happening in our brain, that the EM fields that were
1921280	1927040	generated by the brain started in evolutionary history to make a difference to how the brain
1927040	1932480	works. And instead of being, instead of having an influence on wound healing or development,
1932480	1939520	they had an influence on our actions. And that's just seems to me a natural consequence of the
1939520	1946560	kind of thing that Mike and Wendy and other people have found in the role of EM fields in other
1946560	1952080	parts of our body. Once you have EM fields in the brain, then they are in the powerhouse,
1952080	1957200	they are in the control room now. And they can start doing all sorts of things like making you
1958560	1965600	making you happy, sad, making you do actions, preventing you from do actions. Suddenly, the EM
1965600	1970000	fields are not just involved in development or wound healing, they're involved in everything,
1970640	1976480	every action that you do. Mike actually might watch this episode because he just sent me an
1976480	1982160	email the other day to say he watched a previous episode. I want to almost speak for him in the
1982160	1986640	sense by saying, I mean, what he's trying to show at some point is that this bio electricity,
1986640	1991120	I mean, this electricity, electrical signals can communicate messages, which is something
1991120	1996560	we never really thought was a thing. And this is amazing work. I mean, he's showing how information
1996560	2001920	can be transferred in ways that we could never imagine. And the impact this has, do you think
2001920	2008480	at some point all of those bio electrical signals could perhaps create an EM field for the entire
2008480	2016480	body that sort of communicates all together? Well, although the brain's EM field is everywhere,
2016480	2022080	obviously, we know that if you have a transmitter very far away from you, it is less likely to be
2022080	2030160	detected by your radio, you know, I can, I can detect the times when it was all radio signals,
2030160	2034640	you can detect, you know, London, say, but I couldn't detect Edinburgh. And very occasionally,
2034640	2039280	you might detect somewhere like Moscow or something like that on your radio, but very rarely. And
2039280	2045440	that's because the strength of the signal decreases with the cube or the distance, is it? I kind of
2045440	2049760	remember my physics, either the square of cube or the difference of distance. So the strength of
2049760	2056560	the signal drops. So yes, the information, there will be some bit of information that say comes
2056560	2066240	from your toe, that when it's injured, that will also impact the brain. But most of what the brain
2066240	2073680	is doing is going to be influenced by the nearby EM fields, which are generated by neurons, particularly
2073680	2080560	as neurons are the most electrically excitable, and are the biggest transmitters of, of signals,
2080560	2089120	and the, and the most effective antennae for signals as well. So I would say, yes, it's possible,
2089680	2096960	but I think the, the influences likely to go down the further and further away, the
2098160	2099760	organ is from the brain.
2099760	2105280	Yeah, and perhaps, and perhaps even the Mali nation might also control, because that's
2105280	2106960	yeah, much more common within the brain.
2107680	2110400	Yeah, but I'd be interested in Mike's view on this.
2113360	2115120	We're going to chat about it soon.
2115120	2119200	So when we have that other chat, I'm going to make a note to actually ask him about this.
2120800	2124480	You touched on something just now, and I have a note here, just let me just find it.
2125920	2131360	You said, at some point, I mean, when, when someone's alive, they can have this field.
2131360	2135840	And then you said, well, unless they did, I mean, but sometimes when someone dies,
2135840	2139280	you sort of still sort of see an electromagnetic field around them,
2139280	2141440	there's still some sort of information being carried.
2141440	2143440	So what happens when someone really dies?
2143440	2146960	Does the information store somewhere within the field?
2149600	2153200	Well, remember that the information is constantly changing in the brain.
2153200	2158000	It's not that it's not like a hard disk of a computer that would be laid down forever.
2158000	2162480	We do have memories that are in the Senate, or we believe memory is still one of my
2162480	2166320	mysterious things about how our brain works, and we don't fully understand it.
2166320	2172720	But most guesses are that it's, it's maintaining the synaptic connections of our brain.
2173280	2177680	Those will be there, still there when we die, but they will start to disintegrate.
2178480	2179600	So they won't last long.
2181520	2184720	There is another interesting way of thinking about it.
2185760	2188960	And I've not really, I've not really thought this,
2189680	2194320	this is now when, when I go into dangerous, wacky area, but it's fine.
2194320	2195200	This is an open space.
2195200	2197200	This podcast is exactly what it is.
2197840	2202320	But there is something that I think, I wonder what that means.
2202320	2207440	But okay, information, information, according to quantum mechanics,
2207440	2209520	information can't be created or destroyed.
2209520	2210960	It's just moved around.
2212800	2214800	So there's a conservation of information.
2214800	2216240	It's a theorem.
2216240	2217360	Or is that what they call it?
2218080	2221760	No one's proved it as far as I know, but it's fundamentally quantum mechanics
2221760	2223520	that information can't be destroyed.
2224480	2230160	Now the brain's information, what the CM semi-field theory says is the brain's
2230160	2233040	information has the quality of awareness.
2233920	2234480	Okay.
2234480	2235520	That's what is aware.
2235520	2239040	The information encoded in the brain's field is aware.
2239840	2240480	Okay.
2240480	2244960	So then I have to say, I have to go on, look at that more deeply.
2244960	2249680	You have to say, okay, well, is all electromagnetic field information aware?
2249680	2254480	I say, well, you know, what's the electric, what can the electromagnetic field of a
2254480	2255760	single electron know?
2255760	2256880	What it knows is itself.
2256880	2259840	It doesn't carry information about the outside world.
2260560	2264880	What is normal and interesting about the brain is that the brain's young field
2264880	2270400	carries this vast amount of information about the outside world and the inner world of the
2271200	2272960	person, their memories and everything else.
2272960	2278400	It's all encoded in the brain, so it's a much richer sourcing information.
2279920	2284400	But it is information and it's never going to be destroyed according to quantum mechanics.
2285040	2286000	So what happens?
2286000	2286640	I don't know.
2286640	2294320	I mean, every thought that we make is transmitted into the brain's field and some of that leaks
2294320	2295120	into the universe.
2296240	2298000	So what is that information?
2298720	2304480	It's not connected in the same way, but it's still there, as I said.
2304480	2305520	EM field is unified.
2305520	2307840	There's only a single EM field for the entire universe.
2308560	2313520	Universe has a single EM field of which our brains, our electromagnetic field is part of.
2314800	2321360	So when we stop thinking and our brain stops working, do we become part of the universe's
2321360	2322480	electromagnetic field?
2322480	2324960	Do we get any awareness of that state?
2324960	2325760	I don't know.
2325920	2326880	I will find out.
2328560	2329520	Not for a while, I hope.
2330560	2332160	I was just going to say, hopefully not too soon.
2332160	2335360	It is a kind of spooky, kind of interesting idea.
2336160	2342720	Conservation information is if information, electromagnetic field information has the
2342720	2346480	property of awareness and that's fundamental to semi-field theory.
2346480	2348320	That's the only way we can account for consciousness.
2349600	2351840	Then that information has gone off into the universe.
2351840	2355200	Every thought that we've had still has that property.
2356240	2356960	What does that mean?
2356960	2357440	I don't know.
2358160	2364400	It's crazy because I remember when I first, this was years ago, when I came across your work
2364400	2369760	and Jim Alcalilla, I watched one of his, I think it was his, was it a Ted talk, if I recall,
2369760	2373120	talking about quantum biology and then I went down this rabbit hole,
2373920	2376800	learning about it, reading about it, then came across your work.
2377360	2383200	I remember still back then being so fundamentally materialist that to me it sounded completely
2383200	2388560	absurd and since starting this podcast, the more I've learned about other theories and
2388560	2393600	understanding other people's perceptions, the way they work, it becomes a lot easier to empathize
2393600	2401040	and sort of see the other person's viewpoint a lot clearer and but then you also don't know
2401040	2405040	where to draw the line anymore because at this point, as we're discussing this, it's easy to
2405040	2409120	see how we can tread down territories that are non-scientific.
2409120	2413600	We can almost go into some sort of bizarre phenomenon that, I mean, it's not a bad thing
2413600	2418160	necessarily. This is still intriguing things and it's not clear that the work is wacky.
2418160	2421200	It still is quite cool that you can go down these routes, I think.
2421920	2430000	Yeah, I think to me, the line is when it's no longer science and when it becomes no longer,
2430720	2436640	when you can't actually prove what you're speculating about, it is no longer science.
2436640	2445120	So people ask me, well, how do we know that the radio isn't conscious and I would say,
2445120	2452320	how would you ever prove it was or wasn't conscious? And in turn, someone comes up with a way of
2452320	2458400	answering that question, then I don't think there's any, that is part of science. We just have to say,
2459120	2463840	well, as far as we know, the radio or my car or whatever isn't conscious,
2464160	2471200	you know, maybe someday it will start talking to me and I'll disprove that theory. But until then,
2471200	2477760	I'm going to take the default simplest way of accounting for the fact that my car doesn't talk
2477760	2483120	to me, that it is not conscious. And I think we have to take the ideas that I was just saying
2483120	2487760	about what happens to our consciousness after I don't think I'll ever be able to test that.
2488320	2493840	So I count that as non-scientific speculation, which is perfectly okay,
2493840	2498480	as long as we don't think it's science. We can speculate. Philosophers have been doing it for
2499280	2503280	centuries and they go away with it. Why shouldn't scientists occasionally get away with a bit of
2503280	2508240	speculation? I can just see the way someone could take this information and sort of a patient,
2508240	2512400	maybe in a psych ward, listening to this conversation, now realizing that actually no,
2512400	2521280	the radio really did say that to me. So I always have to put it in the podcast. I mean,
2521280	2525840	this is just weird informational purposes only. This is not, I guess a doctor or one patients
2525840	2530480	to really go around to think, yeah, okay, this is fine. This is purely educational. This is just
2530480	2537040	a disclaimer for everyone. But tell me, the skull access is almost a Faraday cage,
2537040	2544080	holds in all these signals, as much as possible, the fields at least. So it can't go too far. I
2544080	2547920	mean, you briefly touched on that fact. I mean, it's not like you and I could step together side
2547920	2554720	by side and sort of do almost a telepathic communication with each other. That's what
2554720	2561600	you're saying either. No, I have a lot of people who ask me, and whenever you've been talking this,
2561600	2569840	someone always pops up and says, does it explain telepathy? And I say, no. Because firstly,
2570960	2578320	is telepathy a thing that can be explained by science? No, because no scientific experiment
2578320	2584400	that's actually demonstrated telepathy. So it's like saying, does your theory explain aliens on
2584400	2590160	the moon? No, because there's no need to explain them. There's no evidence for telepathy and all
2590160	2595760	the scientific tests have shown nothing's there. But we want to expect it from my theory.
2597200	2600400	You can see the headlines now, Semifield and the Fermi paradox.
2604640	2612080	Yes. And no, I don't think telepathy can't be explained by Semifield theory. Because of that
2612080	2616960	problem of the information is diluted as it goes further and further away from you. And also,
2617920	2622800	your brain has developed, it's like going back to my Levine's work, your brain has developed
2622800	2630880	to both make its own fields, own EM fields and decode those fields. I doubt if any other brain
2630880	2634560	is capable of decoding it. It's probably only...
2634800	2643200	Oh, John, I think I've lost you there.
2644080	2648960	Ask in the brain, there's no fundamental code that all brains use. They're going to be using
2648960	2654800	all different codes. So I think only your brain can decode the EM field information inside your
2654800	2660800	head. Sorry, John, for a moment, I lost you, but you're back. Okay. As long as you're back, it's great.
2661760	2670960	Okay, it's in the EM field. I could switch to another, I can see, I should
2671920	2675520	to prevent it happening again, I could switch to another router.
2677200	2680720	We'll give it a go. If it fails again, we'll switch over.
2680720	2685200	Okay, we'll leave it as it is. While we're on that topic, though, I mean, what are the chances of
2685200	2690320	other sort of electromagnetic fields interacting with ours anyway, not causing sort of telepathic
2690320	2698480	communication, but actually affecting my own EM field? Yeah, people have concerns about this in
2698480	2704880	terms of whether electrical installations, telegraph wires and stuff like this could influence
2705680	2715520	how we think. It's feasible, I would say, if a very strong electromagnetic field can make a radio
2715520	2721840	talk as it can when we have a radio receiver, it could interfere with the brain. But it's working
2721840	2730880	on different frequencies, it's not going to be decodable. So by the brain, the brain is designed
2730880	2736160	by evolution and development to decode its own information, not to decode the stuff that comes
2736160	2742800	in the radio waves. And as far as I know, no one has ever managed to listen to a radio station
2742800	2748480	just with their head. So we can't decode that information, whether it can do any harm to us.
2749360	2757200	I think the evidence is very slight, if any, that there is any influence of power stations and
2757200	2766000	stuff like that near us doing any harm. So my guess is not, but because there's been a lot of
2766000	2771600	research and a lot of contradictory in this area of whether external EM fields can cause
2772960	2780480	ill effects in people, I prefer to stay agnostic about it as I don't really study the literature
2780480	2788400	enough to be very clear in my own mind about it. I think it's fascinating because you're
2789600	2798000	discussing a theory that is so quote unquote, wacky, but it's not. And yet you simultaneously
2798000	2802080	write a book that's like slightly simple and talk about Occam's Razor, I mean, William of Occam,
2802080	2808400	and you discuss how you approach science in a very scientific manner because of the fact that
2808400	2813520	you understand the difference between taking a leap of faith and then being agnostic when
2813520	2818240	agnosticism is needed. So I just want to put that out there for you to sort of.
2818560	2828480	Yeah, yeah, I think they, as you said, in my recent book Life is Simple, I make the case that
2828480	2834160	what differentiates science from other forms of ways of making sense of the world is the science
2834160	2839360	is committed to take the simplest solution to problems. To me, the simplest solution
2839360	2843600	to consciousness is the brain's electromagnetic field. It solves so many problems,
2844400	2850320	such as why synchronous firing should be correlated with consciousness. It gives us a way of
2850320	2855280	understanding one of the other big puzzles of the brain, why most of what the brain does is
2855280	2862400	actually non-conscious. And that's something we have to also explain. Because if the brain is
2862400	2869200	just neural activity, then why isn't most of what the brain does conscious? We do a lot of very
2869280	2873520	complicated stuff. A lot of people have argued, well, it's only the really difficult stuff that
2873520	2878960	we do that we're that we need our conscious mind. No, we could be trying solving a really difficult
2878960	2885120	equation and still on stand on our toe and become highly aware of a very simple stimulus of someone
2885120	2893440	standing on our toe. So very simple stimuli can overwhelm our conscious mind. So complexity
2893520	2901600	and consciousness aren't necessarily related. And yet we have to explain how some parts of
2902400	2907440	some of the things that we our brain does is we're not aware of, like me waving my hands around
2907440	2912800	when I talk, I'm not aware of that. And lots of things that we do blinking and all this kind of
2912800	2919200	stuff, that's all done non-consciously. So we have to explain how the brain can work in two
2919200	2924640	different ways. One a conscious way and one a non-conscious way. As far as I'm aware, the only
2924640	2930640	theory consciousness theory really sorts this out is the semi field theory, another a and field
2930640	2936240	theories of consciousness that says only the activity from synchronously firing neurons,
2936240	2943600	because the waves of the synchronously firing neurons fire together, only that gets transmitted
2943600	2950160	into the brain's electromagnetic field. If neurons fire asynchronously, and mostly they do,
2950160	2954480	that information doesn't get transmitted into the brain's electromagnetic field,
2954480	2960320	because the wave, the top of a wave of one neuron is cancelled out by the bottom of the wave of
2960320	2966080	the other neuron. So it explains why only some information is consciousness, it's only the
2966080	2971680	synchronously firing neurons, and that's exactly what we find. The rest of what the brain does
2971680	2975520	is going to be non-conscious, so you get a conscious and a non-conscious mind.
2975520	2982720	So all of those problems are just disappear once you just move consciousness from the
2982720	2988480	matter of the brain into the brain's EM field. And I think it's a much simpler theory than others
2988480	2996880	like IIT, which is integrated information theory, which has to propose this massively difficult
2997360	3001440	mathematical equation is what explains consciousness and, you know,
3002000	3006800	a level of consciousness can solve this equation for more than two or three neurons
3006800	3014480	at most, and I just can't see that it's needed. So it's a simplest theory,
3015520	3021440	and I admire that in science, and science has been driven by simplicity right from those early
3021440	3027040	days, as you mentioned, William Rockham was the first modern person to make that claim that
3027040	3033280	science is all about simplicity, and it has stood the test of time. The Higgs boson was predicted
3033280	3038320	on simplicity grounds that were more complex theories, but the simplest was the Higgs theory
3038320	3044000	that predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, and only one of them was the simplest of many
3044000	3049840	theories to predict. One of them, the only advantage of the one that predicted only a
3049840	3055280	single Higgs boson was simpler than the others, and that's the way it turned out. So science
3055280	3061520	looks for simple solutions. Semi-field theory is, in my view, far simpler than any other theory
3061520	3071040	that attempts to account for consciousness. As of mid 2024, are there any sort of labs, other
3071040	3075920	people's work that you're looking to that are sort of showing support for this theory? How's
3075920	3084960	the evidence looking for this theory, and any updates? Well, yeah, there was work in, I have to
3085520	3094640	my brain is, my brain is useless, digging out names and particular studies, but at least tell us about
3094640	3101920	the studies. I can send you the reference later if you want. There was a very fascinating study
3101920	3110960	done by a group at MIT, and what they did was look at the brain neurons in the brain of monkeys,
3110960	3118640	I think it was, that was recorded by multilateral recordings of the brain when they were keeping
3119520	3127040	something in memory. And there's a lot of studies have done this, and they found that
3127040	3133680	if the monkey is thinking banana safe, okay, when it recalls banana, different sets of neurons
3134320	3139280	were fire. And there's a name for this, and again, this has escaped me at the moment, it will come
3139280	3148240	to me sometime, it's that memories seem to not rely on particular neurons. A set of neurons will fire,
3149120	3155440	but it won't be the same set of neurons when a monkey thinks of the banana two or three times,
3155440	3158960	there'll be different neurons, there'll be five or six neurons say that will fire,
3158960	3163680	but there'll be a different set of neurons, and that's very hard to explain in terms of memory
3163680	3168960	when we think of memory in the synaptic idea of memory that I mentioned earlier, that it's to do
3168960	3175760	with just the connections between neurons via synapses. A temporal drift, I think it is called,
3175760	3182800	that the encoding of a memory drift between different neurons, but what this study at MIT
3182800	3189440	showed is that what was preserved wasn't the neurons, but the electromagnetic field generated
3189440	3195680	by those neurons. So although different patterns of electromagnetic fields just similar,
3196160	3200640	yet the electromagnetic field of the neurons was always similar. So whatever was the memory
3200640	3206080	of the banana was not encoded in neurons, it's encoded in the electromagnetic field
3206080	3211520	generated by neurons. And that was a very fascinating study that I think could
3213200	3220400	be very interesting. The other big area that I think, if anyone is listening who wants to try
3220400	3223920	to make, I think it would be fascinating to make, and I think someone's going to do it, and
3225520	3230800	I think it should be done despite people having fears about it. A conscious AI,
3232400	3238560	that's got to be the way that things are going. At the moment we know that chat GBT is fantastic,
3238640	3244560	does wonderful things, it's not conscious. We still haven't got, with conventional computing power,
3244560	3248800	we haven't got any closer to consciousness. There's no inkling, there's not even this,
3248800	3252480	there's kind of consciousness that a little baby will have as soon as it's bought,
3252480	3257520	that's not no little baby is starting to go, go, go, go, go, go, and be, oh, I'm pleased to see,
3257520	3263200	do spontaneous stuff like that. So despite the fact that modern computers are now competitive
3263200	3271120	with the power of the human brain, but there's no spark of consciousness there at all.
3272000	3277360	The reason for that, of course, according to the semi-fuel theory, is that all the
3278080	3284000	conventional computers do is simulate what the non-conscious brain is doing,
3284640	3290960	calculating and computing with the wires. That's what we've said that the neuron,
3290960	3296720	the non-conscious part of our brain does, but then the conscious stuff, the information that goes
3296720	3302640	through the brain's electromagnetic field, is where consciousness is, and that's where we do
3302640	3306800	our conscious thinking, and that's where our creative thinking, that's when we come out with
3306800	3313040	great ideas. We don't come up with them, oh, you rarely, sometimes we do, a non-conscious mind seems
3313040	3317600	to be able to generate good ideas, but mostly we use our conscious mind to think and to come
3317600	3323440	up with good ideas. That is lacking in computers because engineers, they call it electrical
3323440	3329760	interference, EMF interference. When they build computers, they engineer them to not
3329760	3336240	be influenced by their own electromagnetic fields. So they've engineered out consciousness in
3336240	3341040	computers. That's happened because that's the way all electrical devices work. They don't want
3341040	3347840	them to be interfered with by their own electrical activity. There's a fascinating
3347840	3354480	experiment that was done over two decades ago. When I was first writing, yes, over two decades ago,
3355200	3360320	by a chap called Andrew Thompson, a cobb's group, a cognitive science group at the University of
3360320	3367280	Sussex in Brighton. I think one of the most fascinating experiments I've ever done,
3367280	3373680	and no one's really picked it up and gone forward with it. I started to get funding to do work on
3373680	3379840	it, but not take me forward. So Andrew Thompson did an experiment of making an AI, this was a
3379840	3386640	long time ago, more than 20 years ago, but not designing it, evolving it. So it took something
3386640	3396080	called an FPGA chip, field programmable gate array. And what these are, are a chip that can be
3396080	3401920	reconfigured. The electrical connections can be reconfigured endlessly. So you can make lots of
3401920	3407200	different configurations. So we took a number of them, let's say a hundred of them, and randomly
3407200	3414000	set them to different configurations, and then tested each one for their ability to solve a task.
3414000	3419360	And he gave it a simple task, I think it was recognizing musical note. And they're all rubbish
3419360	3425280	at it, but maybe one or two were a little bit good at it, could do just slightly better than
3425280	3430800	what would be expected from a random guess. So he took those, the best one, and then cloned it
3430800	3437760	across the entire 100, and then mutated them all a bit. Okay. And then repeated the exercise,
3437760	3441760	and then did it again and again and again for I think about a hundred generations until he got
3441760	3449920	a chip that worked. It could now recognize musical note. So he had evolved in intelligence that could
3449920	3457280	do this task rather than designing it. But it was weird. There was one feature of it that was
3457280	3461520	particularly puzzling. It didn't work all the time. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't.
3462240	3467360	And they worked out eventually, what was the factor? It only worked when the radio was on in the lab.
3469040	3473840	Now, why would that be? Because this was an off-piste experiment that they weren't paid to
3473840	3478560	work on. It was something they thought would be fun to do. So they did it at the end of the day
3478560	3483440	when they finished the normal work as it goes into the evening and turned the radio on to keep
3483440	3489440	themselves company. And they evolved the chip with the radio being on. So it was picking up
3489440	3495440	radio waves and using them as part of its computation. And they needed those radio waves,
3495440	3501840	EM fields, to actually do the computation. And that was one weird thing. The other weird thing
3501840	3507760	about these chips were that there were some parts of the chip. It's a complex microchip,
3507840	3513040	it's got lots of little circuits and resistors and capacitors here and there. There were some
3513040	3519920	parts of it that were necessary for the computation. If they removed those completely,
3519920	3524160	it didn't work. But they weren't connected to either the inputs or the outputs.
3525520	3530640	But how do you explain that? The only way to explain it is that they're communicating through
3530640	3536560	EM fields. So EM fields are within the chip are communicating with each other with different
3536560	3542080	parts of the circuit. And also in that experience, they actually were picking up signals from the
3542080	3547600	radio as well for the computation. So the fascinating conclusion of that is if you evolve
3547600	3554720	an electrical circuit to do a task rather than design it, you involve an EM field, sensitive
3554720	3560880	computer, one that computes through fields as well as through standard electrical,
3561760	3568480	neural, and standard electrical connections. I think that has to be built on. And we have to
3568480	3575200	build an AI that does this. And that also makes an excellent question. At what point
3575200	3583280	were our EM fields generating this sort of potential in terms of our evolutionary journey?
3583280	3589040	A very interesting question. Certainly somewhere in my guess is that the brain went through the
3589040	3596320	same process that Andrew Thompson's experiment did. At some point, it started to, you know,
3596320	3601360	communicating, first of all, the neural communication was all non-conscious. All of the
3601360	3606960	information was set down the wires. But then as more and more neurons got packed into the brain,
3606960	3611760	then it started generating and many of them were often seamlessly firing. It started to generate
3611760	3618880	its own electromagnetic field. And then those electromagnetic fields, and this has been demonstrated
3618960	3625520	experimentally, EM fields of the strength and structure of the brain's EM field. If you, we've
3625520	3631360	done experiments in our lab, if you apply them to brain tissue, that brain tissue will twitch if
3631360	3639200	you'd like. There is a feedback onto neurons. Neurons are sensitive to the brain's electromagnetic
3639200	3647040	field. Now, once that happens, then the actions driven by that brain are going to be visible
3647040	3651520	to natural selection. So natural selection acting on our brain that's now got electrical
3651520	3658000	interference will do two things. If the electrical interference is bad, is bad for us, then it will
3658000	3662800	insulate it. It will insulate those things. It will dampen down those electromagnetic fields,
3662800	3668800	will make them fire asynchronously, whatever, get rid of that interference. So part of the brain
3668800	3674320	will evolve in the direction of being non-conscious because things you don't want to interfere with
3674320	3679680	with your conscious mind, like the heart beating or walking or breathing, all of that stuff needs
3679680	3687920	to be non-interferable. But if there was some capacity that was captured by electromagnetic
3687920	3693840	field interactions between neurons, then natural selection will kick in to develop that. And my
3693840	3699040	guess that has happened certainly by the time of primates, probably somewhere in Malamanian
3699040	3707440	evolution, maybe way back in vertebrate evolution, that that gradual takeover of electromagnetic
3707440	3714720	fields in terms of driving actions was selected by natural selection as being an efficient way
3714720	3720160	of dealing with complex situations by thinking rather than just automatically responding.
3720800	3727280	And certainly primates have it, my guess is higher mammals like dogs and cats also have it,
3727280	3733440	but those are all guesses. Until we really understand and can prove what consciousness is,
3733440	3740560	it will be speculative. But somewhere, somewhere less than humans, I'm sure, has awareness and
3740560	3746480	consciousness like us, but it's a very, like us, but probably not very much like us. Can you think
3746480	3751760	of how you would think without language? That's a tricky thing, isn't it? How you would think without
3751760	3757600	language? Certainly we do, we kind of feelings and stuff, and that's what I guess animals are
3757600	3762960	thinking, they don't have language. So they think in terms of feelings, those can't be very complex
3763680	3768800	calculations and ideas that they can have, I guess they've seen food and say, oh, I'd like to be over
3768800	3775440	there and eat our food. And that's a feeling rather than in our mind where we can encapsulate
3775440	3781120	the feelings in words as well and start to compute with them by starting to think through
3781120	3788240	problems that I don't think animals have that capability. I just today, I think earlier I was
3788240	3792640	reading a paper, I can't remember by who, but it was on Orcas and apparently there's this,
3792640	3800720	they're starting to figure out a communication system that seems to be very much structured.
3802320	3807680	I'm not too sure on the details, I just briefly came across this while I was at work reading,
3807680	3814880	and that seems fascinating to me because you're right, linguistics, language, this triumph in
3814880	3819760	evolution that sort of allows us to shape our views, shape our thoughts and sort of give
3819760	3825840	this synchronicity that's required to give attention to certain things, changed the game
3825840	3831520	for humans. This seems to be one of those game changes, I think. So it would be fascinating to
3831600	3838240	do these Orcas speak their specific type of language, because then this gives them a sort
3838240	3845360	of different EM field in that sense. Yeah, I think the experiments could be done once you
3845360	3850160	commit yourself to the idea that consciousness is the brain's EM field. The key question is,
3850720	3857520	does the EM field generated by a brain influence its own actions? And that's something that can
3857520	3864160	be answered. You can start to, you can imagine experiments that will then determine, you know,
3864160	3872000	what percentage of brain activity in a particular animal is influenced by the animal's brain's EM
3872000	3877040	field. That will be a measure of consciousness if we could do that kind of measurement. I don't
3877040	3880800	know how we'll do it at the moment, but I'm sure it will be possible to do that at some stage and
3880800	3888560	find out how much animals are thinking consciously. Would you say this would be taken further with
3888560	3894080	regards to free will? At what point are they making active decisions to either go left or right in
3894080	3902560	terms of... Yeah, well that does... The other thing that semi-field theory provides is a theory of
3902560	3909200	free will, which provides it for free, because it divides the brain's activity into those which
3909200	3914720	are non-conscious and those which are conscious. We call our conscious decision making those which
3914720	3920400	aren't made by the automatic part of our brain. We call it free will when we make conscious decisions
3920400	3927440	to raise my hand or not raise my hand. All of those are driven by our conscious mind. So I think
3927440	3933520	everyone gets into a muddle with free will because of the word free. I think we have to stick to what
3934320	3941840	the second word which is will. Will is when our conscious mind is willing our actions. It's not
3941840	3949520	necessarily free because it's all determinism ultimately in science. Jumping out of determinism
3949520	3955760	is very difficult. So it's still deterministic, but our conscious actions are those that are
3955760	3960160	driven by our conscious mind rather than our normal conscious mind. And that gives you a nice
3960240	3965680	simple explanation of free will. It doesn't require anything deep or philosophical. It's just
3965680	3970560	the stuff driven by our conscious mind, the free field rather than the neurons.
3970560	3976160	Yeah, so it's sort of just a byproduct of being conscious in itself. So it just jumps along for
3976160	3983040	the ride. Yeah, yeah. Once the brain becomes conscious by having an EM field, then those EM
3983040	3989600	fields influence actions. We call that free will. I mean, if people say, you know, as I said, the word
3989600	3998000	free causes a lot of confusion here. If you think about what we believe our minds are doing when we
3998800	4006400	make purposeful actions, we don't necessarily think that without a preceding thought,
4007120	4013920	when I think, okay, I'm going to phone my brother. It may be because I've seen him put
4013920	4018640	something on the TV that's reminded of him. I wouldn't think that that idea will just pop into
4018640	4024960	my head without any precedent. And I think most of what we do, if we think hard about
4024960	4030640	every action that we do, it's perceived by some other thought. So I don't think determinism is
4030640	4038240	the problem of consciousness. It's never been. And in the past, people didn't think of it as being
4038240	4044560	non-deterministic. They talked about fate, that your actions will be driven by fate, not by,
4044560	4050000	and fate was something you had no control over. So the idea of determinant of being free will
4050000	4056800	being something or will being free, something that isn't determined by anything that's happened before
4057520	4062560	comes out of later thought in philosophy and Christianity, really had to be punished for
4062560	4067840	your sins. So that's really the source of where the idea of free will comes from.
4068800	4072720	But if we just accept that there are some thoughts that we, there's some of our actions sort of
4072720	4077840	driven by our own automatic brain, and some are driven by conscious mind, and that makes a lot
4077840	4081840	of sense. And it's predicted by the semi-feel theory. And then you don't need to worry about the
4081840	4089760	philosophy. We touched on a species going from, from let's say, amoeba to humans, and obviously
4089760	4094800	maybe vertebras have this, perhaps mammals have this. What about humans? What about when we start
4095360	4104000	as embryos working our way upward into adulthood from childhood? When does this become active?
4106000	4111840	Your guess will be as good as mine. Don't really have any insight. The key thing is that when the
4111840	4122240	brains in field influences the activities that a person is performing. And I think that's when
4122320	4129200	they become less than, more than reactions. So, you know, blinking is a reaction. If a fly flies
4129200	4135440	into your eye, you blink and you've got no control over it. Then you can see a baby, you know, might
4135440	4143200	look this way and that way, and it will do the kind of pause and look at things. And, and,
4144560	4148640	you know, it can be pretty sure there's some thinking going on in that baby's brain.
4148640	4154080	Once they start toddling around, moving around, and they laugh and stuff like that. I mean, I've
4154080	4161600	hardly any animals laugh. People say that some monkeys laugh, but so they can laugh at themselves
4161600	4166240	and they can find things amusing. All of those things are conscious things. We couldn't, we
4166240	4172400	wouldn't find anything amusing, non-consciously, for example. So, I think you have to ask the
4172400	4177280	question, what do we need our conscious mind for? And what can we do without our conscious mind?
4177360	4182400	I can do all this moving around in my hands, non-consciously. I can drive a car pretty well,
4182400	4186960	non-consciously. I mean, we know that if we have an accident and everyone does that again, and you
4186960	4191040	think, what was I doing a moment before? You probably not be able to remember, because you have
4191040	4196080	all emotions that you're doing, I'm going on non-consciously. So, there's lots of things that
4196080	4202720	we do non-consciously. They're this stuff, like, you know, like a long division, we couldn't do
4202720	4207840	non-consciously. And there's another interesting feature of consciousness, that is, you can only
4207840	4213520	do one thing at once, really. And that's strange, because you can do lots of things
4213520	4219040	non-consciously, like me waving my hands around. I could be scratching my head and moving my arms
4219040	4226560	and I could be tapping a tune. All of those things are going on. But you can't say, do a crossword
4227120	4232960	and talk to someone at the same time, could you? So, your conscious mind is, this has been
4232960	4238160	established outside of the semi-field theory. But your conscious mind is what's called a serial
4238160	4242720	computer. It can only do one thing at a time. Whereas your non-conscious mind is a parallel
4242720	4247920	computer. It can solve lots of problems and be working on lots of problems simultaneously.
4247920	4251840	So, again, you've got to account for that in the brain. Semi-field theory does it,
4252640	4257600	like that. It's no problem. There's only a single brain-em-field. Unlike the neurons,
4257600	4261520	which are distributed and there's lots of different circuits, lots of different areas,
4261520	4267680	the brain-em-field from its perspective is singular. So, it's always going to be
4267680	4273760	only one thing at a time. Anything else will start to cause interference. So, it's identifying the
4273760	4279280	things that we do consciously. And certainly, we couldn't imagine talking non-consciously. You
4279280	4284400	couldn't have a conversation with someone non-consciously. You couldn't do anything creative
4284400	4289840	non-consciously. So, all of those things that we require our conscious mind for, when we see
4289840	4297920	those happening in, say, babies or in animals, then we've got to admit that they are very likely
4297920	4304080	also conscious. John, Joe, would you see the future of semi-field theory going? What would
4304080	4308640	you like to be done in terms of other people who watch this podcast, the thousands of people
4308640	4315040	listening? Where do you want some of these future scientists to take this and perhaps?
4315040	4322480	Yes. I think we have to take the brain's-em-field seriously and find out how it functions to,
4323200	4328320	as a conduit for information transfer in the brain. No one's really done that. I mean,
4328320	4334000	there's no one's even worked out how you can calculate how the-em-field generated by the
4334000	4339440	brain will influence neural firing patterns. All of those things need to be calculated.
4339440	4344880	We need to do a lot more experiments on how neurons can communicate through electromagnetic
4344880	4351280	fields. And we're doing some of those experiments in our lab by applying external electromagnetic
4351280	4356240	fields. But it's tiny, the amount of work that's going on in this kind of area compared to what's
4356240	4362240	going on in other areas of neurobiology. And I think we need to try to use these principles
4362240	4367600	to make a conscious AI. Ultimately, I think the only way that you'll prove a theory of consciousness
4368240	4376720	is by applying it to make a conscious AI. And the kind of work that I was describing earlier
4376720	4380960	gives you a route towards doing that. There are lots of other theories which will also give
4380960	4387200	you a route towards doing that, like IIT. According to IIT, commuters are already conscious.
4387280	4394640	So to me, that's already disproved IIT. Global workspace has also been disproved because
4395600	4400000	computers can have global workspaces in the global workspace sense. And none of them have
4400000	4404880	shown any signs of consciousness. So we've got to wake up and kind of say, okay, well, let's
4405440	4411840	try to design a conscious mind based on different principles on, say, IIT or global workspace
4411840	4418560	or semi-field theory and let's see which one talks back to us. So would the goal then be to
4419120	4425440	create this artificial intelligence to match our electromagnetic field?
4425440	4430880	I think it's more than artificial intelligence. There's a conscious artificial intelligence.
4431920	4435920	There are, of course, ethical issues there. And those have to be looked at as well.
4436560	4441200	But the ethical issues will make any conscious being a person. Either way, everyone's trying
4441200	4444000	to do this. I think it's an inevitability at this point.
4444000	4448480	Yeah, there is an inevitability there. And every time we have a baby, we make another
4448480	4455680	conscious being. So why not make one? And that would be a murderer and still go around and kill
4455680	4463920	people. So we can't predict what biological conscious beings will do. But I think the
4463920	4468400	advantage of it would be that we would be able to understand consciousness better
4469120	4474320	and, you know, going way into the future, we can think about the possibility of transferring
4474320	4480400	our minds to AI that's much more durable than these bodies are sadly going to decay in
4480960	4488960	not so many decades. So, you know, there are those kind of sci-fi ways of preserving humanity.
4488960	4495520	And I think we will need them in the future. That makes it quite exciting to know that,
4495520	4500720	I mean, because it's obviously throughout the universe. I mean, we could in some way be
4501440	4507680	completely at the side of the universe if the tech becomes absolutely, if we can transfer our minds
4507680	4517120	into AI, then we could travel a lot easier to travel at sub light speeds to really explore
4517120	4521360	the universe. And then the question, of course, you mentioned the Fermi Paradox, why hasn't it,
4521360	4525920	why haven't we already met the aliens who have gone through this stage and developed the very
4525920	4532960	durable forms of themselves? I mean, if a consciousness is an electromagnetic field,
4532960	4538240	could you transmit it? You wouldn't need a spaceship. You could send the big beam
4538240	4542560	of electromagnetic information across the universe. You know, there are all sorts of
4543280	4548720	sci-fi ideas that are so exciting and interesting, bizarre and speculative that we've got to go
4548720	4553840	and find out what there is there. And if you take the idea that consciousness is an electromagnetic
4553840	4561520	field, then all sorts of interesting stuff starts to emerge from that idea. It's completely
4561520	4565600	fascinating. And it's super exciting to see so many different theories of consciousness,
4565600	4571840	people taking leaps, people doing such great work. Thanks to you. Any final words, anything you want
4571840	4576400	to say or add? Do you think there's anything about semi-feel theory that people might have
4576400	4579680	misunderstood from this conversation or things you've always wanted to point out?
4580800	4588480	I just think that thinking that our mind is an electromagnetic field, an invisible form of
4588480	4593040	energy in our brain is, I think, interesting, fascinating, and it feels better to me than
4593040	4599920	to think my mind is a lump of meat. I think if everyone starts to think of themselves as this
4600800	4609840	entity of energy that is driving their brain, of electromagnetic energy, pulling the levers
4609840	4616400	of the brain, I think it just gives a different feel of what we think we are. And it makes so
4616400	4622880	much sense and it gives us lots of speculative ideas that we can take forward in terms of thinking
4622880	4627760	about what happens after death and all that kind of stuff. We're never going to know until we get
4627840	4635200	there, but we can speculate, nevertheless. And speculation is exactly what this podcast is about,
4635200	4640960	because although I call it mind-body solution, I don't claim to have the solution. Nor do I think
4640960	4648720	we'll find it, but hopefully one day it's possible. Absolutely. You've got to have an open mind,
4648720	4654240	but not so much your brain drops out. I'd say be passionately curious but reasonably
4654320	4658640	skipping at the same time. Absolutely. You've got to be rigorous. If you want to do science,
4658640	4663360	you've got to be rigorous. You can still speculate as long as you label it as speculation and this
4663360	4670640	is we can't prove this or that, but speculation is fine because it can inspire people to study
4670640	4676960	science and inspire people to do things that lots of speculations have turned out to be true. So
4677520	4682480	it's okay to speculate as long as we know that's what they are. Just look at how much science
4682480	4686880	fiction has become reality at this point. Exactly. It's phenomenal. Exactly. Indeed.
4688240	4692640	Any final words, John Joe? Thank you so much. This has been such a... Well, thank you for talking
4692640	4703040	to me, Tevin. And yeah, anyone who wants to get in touch with me and if you've got any great ideas
4703680	4710080	to test me, feel thoroughly. And certainly, if anyone wants to make an artificial AI and
4710080	4720080	as the resources to do it, get in touch.
