0	14920	Look, the last time we spoke done, we, we touched on the fact that physics and evolution
14920	21720	agree, space time is doomed. At this point, it is not fundamental reality, nor its objects.
21720	25800	And today, I think our focus is going to be on your paper, conscious agents and the subatomic
25800	30640	world, which I've read a couple of times and still I don't think I understand it as much as
30640	36360	I would have to. It's very complicated. I don't have a physics background, but I'm hoping this
36360	40000	conversation is going to help enlighten me a bit more. Wonderful paper, by the way. How was it
40000	48800	working with Chetan and Swapham again? How's it going? Very, very fun. Chetan has been a
48800	55680	collaborator for more than 30 years. So we go back a long time from our youth. And so we're
55720	59600	continuing to have fun collaborating with each other. You know, we bounce ideas back and
59600	64680	forth. He's the mathematical genius. I'm the mathematical flunky. But he's trained me enough
64680	69240	so I can actually talk with him about it. And then he can do the actual hard math stuff. And
69240	77160	then Swapham is a world-class experimental particle physicist. He's at CERN and the Fermilab. And
77160	83760	he contacted us out of the blue earlier this year. He'd seen our work on consciousness and his
83760	92880	possible relationship to particle physics. And he thought that there's some possible good stuff
92880	99120	there. And so he looked at what we were doing in the paper. We were already halfway through that
99120	106800	paper writing it when he contacted us. And he decided to join forces and work with us on it. So
106800	114600	we're really glad to have a real professor of particle physics. He's a professor at UC Berkeley,
114640	120920	now emeritus, but also at CERN and Fermilab. So Swapham has been very, very helpful. He's a
120920	128920	no-nonsense guy. He knows what's real and what's not. And so he helps really guide us in terms of
128920	135240	the... We have to be daring. But sometimes you're daring and obviously wrong. So he helps us.
136800	140320	That's amazing. And the fact that you guys have someone like that, I mean, in this paper, you
140320	146400	propose a mathematical model in which conscious agents are fundamental and interact by Markovian
146400	154160	dynamics. And some agents create space time as an interface where by the interact and physics is the
154160	159720	projection of the ancient dynamics onto the interface. So this is quite a fascinating idea
159720	164920	altogether. I mean, in a nutshell, you're basically saying that conscious agents create the subatomic
164920	168200	world. Let's start by exploring that basic concept.
169560	176360	That's right. So it is out of the box. But here's what I think is the current state of play in physics
177040	185880	that calls for out-of-the-box thinking like this. And that is that space time, first space and time were
185880	194040	the foundation for Newtonian mechanics. And that was fantastic for several centuries. And so successful
194040	201640	that many physicists like in the 1890s figured that it was done. Physics had little mop up jobs to do
201640	206400	here and there, but it was done. And bright students should go elsewhere to, you know, because there
206400	212720	was just nothing for really bright people to do. Well, that all blew apart in 1900 and then 1905,
213240	221320	with Planck's work and then Einstein's work. And basically by 1905, it was over for space and time.
221360	226760	And it was over for Newtonian as being fundamental. Of course, we still use Newton to this day, but as a
226760	233400	fundamental theory, it was over. But it took a few decades for some to find that out, right? You know,
233400	238880	the 1922 Nobel Committee giving Einstein his prize made it clear it was not for relativity theory, not
238880	246160	for his theory of space time. So I mean, even though it had been over for 17 years, it takes a long
246160	255560	time for the community to understand and move on. Well, so now, Einstein's space time has been a
255560	263440	found fantastic foundation for more than a century, special in general relativity theories. But in
263840	271200	2005, David Gross, the Nobel Prize winner for his work on the strong force, you know, wrote an article
271200	277840	that was, of course, you know, in honor of Einstein and the 100th anniversary of his 1905 miracle year
277840	282440	and his special theory of relativity. But then he, you know, in the right spirit of science, he said
282440	286680	space time is doomed. Thank you, Einstein for space time. But now space time is doomed. It's time for
286680	293600	us to move on. And that's the way good science is. And since then, a lot of others have echoed the
293600	301640	same thing in Neymar, Connie Hamed and Nathan Cyberg and Ed Whitten and so forth, you know, are
301640	307240	basically saying in their own words, space time is doomed. And what that means is not that we're
307240	314480	going to throw space time away, but that it's, it's not a deep enough structure to be thought of as
314480	321920	foundational. It has specific limits. It has no operational meaning beyond the Planck scale, which
321920	330760	is like 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. It just, it has no operational
330760	335600	meaning, which, which, which means that it's not usable beyond that. And it's really pointing to its
335600	343920	own limitation. So, so the question is, what, how do we go next? Because most people think, well, you
343920	350760	know, space time is the fundamental reality. How can I think out? So how could any objects or any
350800	356320	entities be outside of space time? Space time is everything there is. That's the way we think. And,
356320	365160	and so this requires a new level of creativity, because the idea is, you have to open your mind.
365480	372360	Space time is not fundamental. You have to think, could there be new structures entirely outside
372360	378120	space time, not curled up inside space time, the little hidden dimensions are entirely outside. And,
378200	387960	and in the last nine years. So this is relatively recent. Physicists have published structures.
388800	394560	They've discovered beyond space time, not not not curled up again in inside space time entirely
394680	399560	outside space time. And most people have no idea what that could even mean. What could you possibly
399560	404240	mean about structures that are outside of space time? But that's, that's where we're headed. And so
404240	410400	that's what we're doing in in our work on conscious agents. And I'll just say the reason for what
410400	418160	we're doing is this. The physicists have discovered structures that are that are static, like
418160	425800	geometric objects and structures like permutations and so forth. But, but they haven't yet
425920	431200	posited a dynamics that would account for these structures. And so the structures that like the
431200	438240	amplitude hydrant and things called decorated permutations and cosmological polytopes and so
438240	445920	forth. So, so they have these these structures, but you know, ultimately, physics goes after
445920	453440	dynamics. But this is going to be different because these are going to be dynamical entities, not in
453440	460400	side space time, but dynamical entities, utterly and completely outside of space time. And so
460400	465840	that's not going to be comfortable. What what in the world could we are? What are these things that
465840	469920	are not inside space time? I mean, you and I are, you know, here we are inside space. What are these
469920	475360	things that are not inside space time that are dynamical? And what are they doing? And why? So
475360	480880	you can see that this is this is not a trivial endeavor. And you have to, you know, you work,
480880	485520	of course, we're going to make mistakes here. And that's what we're so we're we're proposing.
486400	495040	I'll put it in the the least tendentious way. We're just proposing that there are these dynamical
495040	501200	entities beyond space time that have a Markovian dynamics. And the argument for this Markovian
501200	506960	dynamics in part is that we show how a Markovian dynamics projects to decorated permutations
507520	512240	and through and therefore through decorated permutations into space time. So, so what we're
512240	517600	doing is we're saying the physicists discovered decorated permutations beyond space time.
519280	524400	And it's a big surprise, you know, permutations of what and for why what who ordered this,
524400	527840	basically, you know, why why should that be what we're discovering beyond space time. And what
527840	534960	we're saying is, well, we discovered that if you have any Markovian dynamical system, the so-called
535600	541680	the the ergodic communicating classes of it, the recurrent communicating classes
541680	546480	of the Markovian dynamics are classified by decorated permutations. So that's a new result
546480	551360	in a paper we published in January. So we we, as far as we can tell, no one had ever published
551360	558320	that before. And so we discovered that and that gave us a way to take our Markovian dynamics
558320	564720	and say this could be a the kind of dynamics that's beyond space time because it does map
564720	569040	into these decorated permutations. And so there's some kind of dynamical entities.
569680	573520	That's the least tendentious way to put it. What we're proposing is more tendentious. We're
573520	577840	saying, well, we're also after consciousness, we're interested in consciousness and the hard
577840	583040	problem of consciousness, what's relationship and consciousness and brain activity. And so
584320	588080	we're trying to, in some sense, kill two birds with one stone, what's beyond space time,
588080	591600	and can we solve the hard problem of consciousness at the same time with that. So
591600	595600	we're proposing these are dynamical entities that we'd call conscious ages. But, you know,
595840	600880	you know, the mathematics stands by itself. If you don't like the conscious interpretation,
600880	605120	just say they're dynamical entities beyond space time. But I'm interested in pursuing the conscious
605120	610800	agent interpretation myself, and how this can help us with the hard problem of consciousness.
611680	615680	I think, look, at the moment, you're doing very fascinating work. I've got a lot of notes in front
615680	620320	of me. I made tons of notes because your paper is quite extensive. As of today, I'm not sure
620320	624960	it's not yet published, if I'm correct, Don, the current paper. That's right. It's going to be
625680	632720	we submitted it as a contestant in a competition for the Institute of Neolithic Sciences.
633280	640640	And we're one of three winners of that competition. And so it's going to be released on June 24. So
642400	647120	there's going to be an online, I think Zoom, anybody that wants to can join in and I'll be
647120	652160	talking for 20 minutes describing our work there. And then the other two groups that are
652160	656640	winning will also be describing their work. So it's June 24 at the Institute of Neolithic Sciences.
656640	661280	You can just go online and it's free to log in. Okay, great. At some point, I will put a link to
661280	664960	that. And just by the way, for everyone listening or watching, I'll put the link to our previous
664960	669440	conversation as well, because there we discussed conscious realism, user interface theory, we
669440	674640	discussed quite a few things. But keeping in track with this paper, the theory of conscious agents,
674640	679600	that these two assumptions pretty much they exist conscious experiences, such as the taste of
679600	685200	chocolate or the mood of elation, that's something you've written. And they exist, probabilistic
685200	691840	relations among experiences as well. But then you go further to describe what are called CA nets.
691840	696480	So talk to me about what a CA net is, and then we'll move from there and just go through the paper
696480	702880	and a bit of a systematic approach. That's right. So the way I think to think about it,
702880	708160	that's the most easy for most people would be think about the Twitterverse, right? That's a big
708400	713680	interacting social network. There's millions of Twitter users, probably billions of tweets
714720	719760	that are going along. And if you think about it, you're following certain people.
720320	724080	If you're Twitter, you follow certain people, there may be a few dozen or a few hundred or a
724080	729120	few thousand people that you're following. And there might be a few dozen or if you're lucky,
729120	736640	a few thousand or a few hundred thousand that are following you. And so it's a really complicated
736640	741040	social network. And there are lots of subgroups that they have their own interests and the things
741040	747760	that they're following and so forth. And so that's what you should think about when you think about
747760	752080	this conscious agent network. There are a bunch of these agents, they're interacting. What they're
752080	759120	passing instead of tweets is they're passing experiences. And effectively, tweets are affecting
759120	766080	your experiences. They're thinking how you think, what videos you see, what cat video you're looking
766080	770320	at and laughing at. And so they're affecting your experiences. So that's quite parallel.
771120	778320	And so this is just doing a Markovian dynamics of this network of conscious agents and proposing
778320	784480	that that's the fundamental reality. And again, by the way, I'm absolutely not Dr. Nair about this.
784480	791760	This is like my attitude is we're taking our first baby steps out of space time. Of course,
791760	798400	we're going to be wrong. But you've got to do something precise. And it's going to be, I think
798400	804560	future work will look at that as our work is simple. But hey, it was bold and it was precise.
805520	810480	So we're trying to make a bold and precise step outside of space time. And we're proposing this
810480	818160	Markovian dynamics. So that's sort of the top level. Now, I should say why you mentioned that
818160	824240	we're talking about experiences and probabilistic relationships among experiences. You might wonder,
824240	829200	well, why in the world did they just do that? I mean, they're thinking about consciousness.
829200	834080	There's a lot of stuff in consciousness. There's the self. There's learning and memory and problem
834080	841440	solving and intelligence. And there's just a ton of stuff that free will. Why aren't they talking
841440	848400	about all of that and putting that right into their model? And the reason we're not putting that
848400	855120	right up front is the whole point of a scientific theory is to have as few assumptions up front as
855120	860800	possible. If you throw in the kitchen sink, what are you going to explain? You want to make the work
860800	866960	as hard as possible for you as few and as trivial the assumptions as you possibly can. And then you
867040	871120	have to do all the hard work to explain all this other stuff. So our attitude was,
873920	879520	if we just say that there are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate, smell of garlic,
879520	885280	whatever it might be, and probabilistic relationships among them. And we can then say, okay,
885280	893600	the probabilistic relationships will be Markovian. Basically, it just means probability with a finite
893600	897440	memory. That's all it really means, probability with a finite memory of what happened in the past.
898800	905120	If we start with that, then we can build networks of these interacting,
906000	914080	trivial conscious entities. But these networks, we can show are computationally universal.
915360	919680	So anything you can do with neural nets, you can do with these conscious agent nets,
919680	923520	even though they start off with just experiences and probabilities of relationships among
923520	927680	experiences, you can build anything that you want out of it because they're computationally
927680	932800	universal. So we can build theories of learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence, and so forth.
933600	941360	We can do all of that. And it's even more interesting because Markovian dynamical systems
941360	951520	are not limited to computation. They're defined on probability spaces. And the measurable sets
951520	957760	in the probability spaces which they're defined on need not be computable. So we're not doing that
957760	962800	right now in our work. We're only looking at the computational aspects. But if we upgrade our
962800	968560	brains, we might be able to go after the beyond computational aspects. But I'm happy just to
968560	976400	look at the computation for now. But so that's sort of the top level of you and why we picked
976400	983920	what we picked. If we put a self in there to begin with, it seems like we're just throwing too much
983920	993920	of the kitchen sink in upfront. And same thing with intelligence and even specific kinds of memories.
994000	996560	I mean, we have this one, just a finite memory of
996560	1001680	concentrations. But then you think about humans, we have episodic memories and memories about
1001680	1007600	things learned in language, the structure of language, the grammars of language that we know.
1007600	1010880	And so there's lots of different kinds of memories, short term memory, long term memory.
1011920	1018080	So that will have to all build out of networks. So that's sort of the top level.
1018080	1023600	I think that that approach is both it's a humble approach and very strategic in a sense. Obviously,
1023600	1027760	you don't want to put too much out there and focus on too much. You want to maintain a core focus.
1027760	1034160	And I think that's great. But I think it's also nice to see someone who's claiming something so
1034160	1040400	extravagant. I mean, to some people, this is very outside the box. It's extremely out there.
1040400	1046160	And when they approach you with any questions, I always see, I love how humble your approach is,
1046160	1050000	because you'd expect someone who's claiming something so outrageous to actually say,
1050000	1054240	defend themselves a lot. But you don't, you often say, your goal is to be proved wrong. You
1054240	1059760	want people to actively prove you wrong. That is, that is something science. That's what I actually
1059760	1064880	love about your approach to this whole thing. So far, when you've started since starting,
1064880	1068640	how much like let's say pushback have you gotten from the scientific community?
1069440	1076240	This is I'm just stepping off the paper for now. So my lot of my closer colleagues are, you know,
1077200	1082400	studying consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness. And so my training is in cognitive
1082400	1088960	neuroscience and artificial intelligence. And, and so a lot of my colleagues and good friends
1088960	1094160	who are physicalists and looking after looking for how the brain or computer systems could
1094160	1099600	create consciousness. So we're all we're all good buddies and friends and so forth. I think
1100080	1108480	most of them aren't persuaded by a long shot. And I'm sure a few secretly think that, you know,
1108480	1114720	I, you know, you had a lot of promise, but look what he's squandering it, you know. So, so yeah,
1114720	1120320	yeah, I'm sure it, but you know, they'll be polite and have a beer and we'll have a good discussion
1120320	1125520	and so forth. So, you know, and that's to be expected to mean it's it's, there's nothing
1126480	1133040	new under the sun. This is the way it's always been in science. Most of the quote unquote
1133040	1138000	innovations turn out to be wrong. And the ones that turn out to be right aren't usually recognized
1138000	1143360	for a long time. And that's just that's, and that's the way it should be. Science is a conservative
1146320	1150640	enterprise in the sense that as a social institution, it's conservative. Of course, we
1150640	1155920	need entrepreneur, individual entrepreneurs within science to push different ideas and
1155920	1161280	and take them to their limits. And of course, in most cases, be wrong. But but then science as a
1161280	1167200	social institution checks and rechecks and shows you where you're wrong or where you need to polish
1167200	1173440	your assumptions and so forth. So, so yeah. But but then, you know, the pushback goes both ways
1173440	1178560	when my whenever I get together with my colleagues on stage who are physicalists,
1179520	1185680	but the one question I always ask is, okay, so you have a theory in which, you know,
1185680	1193520	integrated information patterns or orchestrated collapse of quantum states of neuronal micro
1193520	1202320	tubules or some global workspace architecture. You claim gives rise to conscious experiences.
1202880	1208400	Okay, great. So what specific conscious experience like the taste of chocolate or
1209200	1214720	whatever, whatever anyone you want. Can you give me one example where you say,
1216720	1222160	this pattern of integrated information must be the taste of chocolate. And these are the
1222160	1227920	reasons why that pattern of integration is necessarily the same thing or give rise to
1227920	1232000	the taste of chocolate and could not possibly be the taste of vanilla. I mean, this is supposed
1232000	1239280	to be a third consciousness. So what one conscious experience can you explain? And there's, and this
1239280	1247680	is a stunning result. There is in all of the physicalist theories. And I include it in that group.
1249120	1251440	They may say it's not necessarily physicalist, but
1253200	1258720	yes, anyway, yeah, I just spoke to Christoph Koch the other day. And I know it's almost it's kind
1258800	1263360	of like an idealist and sorry, a hand psychist approach, but you're not really
1263360	1268480	psychist. Yeah, exactly. They would say yeah, that's right. So so but I would say that they're
1268480	1275680	trying to have some kind of, you know, computational core, like an integrated information
1277360	1282400	shape or something like that that gives rise or is identical to the so if you think it gives rise
1282400	1288160	to it or is identical to give me one, just give me one example where your theory works on ones.
1288160	1294800	I want one specific conscious experience that we can go test. But if you don't have one with
1294800	1299280	a specific conscious experience that we can go test, how can this be a theory of consciousness?
1300000	1306320	And so there's, there's literally not one experience that has been able to be explained
1306320	1314000	by any of these theories where they say this pattern of, you know, neuronal collapse of micro
1314720	1320720	quantum states of neuronal microchipals must be the taste of chocolate or this global
1320720	1325520	workspace architecture and this pattern of activity must be the smell of, you know,
1326400	1332320	cherry. There's nothing on the table. And, and I think, you know, Stephen Pinker understands
1332320	1337840	this. He's, he's a, you know, a friend of mine for many years and brilliant. And he likes the
1337840	1342720	global workspace model, but he says in his recent book, The Enlightenment Now book,
1343600	1350800	I think 2018 or something like that, that he likes the global workspace, but, but the connection
1350800	1357040	between the state of the global workspace and specific conscious experiences, he says,
1357040	1361280	is something is the, is the last dollop of a theory that will have to be stipulated.
1362240	1369760	And he's right. The connections are stipulated. So there's not, they're not explained. And that's
1369840	1374320	the key thing. They're, they're, they're saying we have a theory of consciousness, but no specific
1374320	1380480	conscious experience is ever explained. It's always stipulated. And so, so what I always say
1380480	1386640	to my friends is, look, you guys, you're, you're stipulating these, you know, like the neuronal
1386640	1394080	workspace, the global, the global workspace architecture or IIT or, you know, orchestrated
1394080	1399120	collapses, you're stipulating that, and you're stipulating these conscious experiences. And
1399120	1403360	then you also have to stipulate the relationship between them. Well, I'm only stipulating the
1403360	1410560	conscious experiences. And I propose to show you where space time and physical objects come from.
1410560	1415040	So based on what we call Occam's razor, you know, the theory with the simplest
1415040	1419920	set of assumptions wins, this theory should prevail because we don't have, I don't have to
1419920	1425520	stipulate as much as you stipulate. So that's my attitude about it. And one reason I took this
1425520	1432960	direction, if I could have given a physicalist theory, I would have. But I realized decades ago,
1435360	1444960	it's not possible. It's just not possible. And why, why waste my time? So as strange and as
1444960	1450400	counterintuitive as it might be, let's just let go of space time. Let's, you mean, if I have to
1450400	1456160	let go of, if I, if I'm wrong, do I have conscious experiences? I'm not sure I'm right about anything.
1457840	1462640	So, so I'm, you know, again, I might be wrong, but, but boy, you know,
1463840	1467680	so let's assume that there are conscious experiences, taste of chocolate, smell of,
1467680	1472640	let's just make that mathematically precise. And then let's see if it's possible to boot up
1472640	1477280	space time. And that's what this last paper is about. So, okay, well, finally, I can say,
1477840	1483600	we can have a Markovian dynamics of these conscious experiences interacting. And the,
1483600	1487360	the physicist told us that we need to get it mapped onto decorated permutations if we're
1487360	1492400	going to map it into space time. Well, we can do that, we can map, that's a new mathematics, but we,
1492400	1497840	we, we discovered this new mathematics, we map Markovian dynamics to canonically into
1497840	1502160	decorated permutations. And then the physicist tells us how to take it into scattering amplitudes,
1502160	1507120	like particle scattering in space time. So that's, that's sort of the big picture about
1507120	1514960	why we're making these bold, crazy moves beyond space time. The bottom line is, when you try to
1514960	1520400	do it inside space time, you learn first, space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
1520400	1525520	And second, the best and brightest minds, my colleagues are brilliant. These best and brightest
1525520	1530480	minds on the planet cannot figure out how to boot up conscious experiences, not even one
1530480	1535040	from inside space time. And, and it's not because they're done, they're brilliant,
1535040	1540160	it's just that you can't do it from within space time. And, and that will be the lesson,
1540160	1547600	but we had to really, we had to spend a lot of hard work and a lot of careers to learn that it
1547600	1554400	can't be done. Don, are there any specific people you can think of who do not follow your theory or
1555360	1560240	perhaps even go against it, whose you find relatively convincing or at least respect and
1560240	1565440	admire their work? For example, someone with a neuroscientific theory or philosophical differences.
1566000	1572240	Any people that stand out to you? Any theories? Oh, well, I mean, I know most of all, all the
1572240	1575760	big players and their friends, and I think they're brilliant. And I think that the theories are,
1575760	1580160	are, are brilliant. It's just that I think they're brilliantly wrong. I think that,
1581120	1584560	but the thing is that they have insights and some of those insights might be
1586880	1590000	salvageable and reused in a completely different framework. In other words,
1590880	1593920	maybe there is something about integrated information theory that will turn out to be
1595520	1599520	very interesting. But it won't be that it's how
1602160	1606800	unintelligent and unconscious systems with the right kinds of information,
1606800	1612800	theoretic properties either give rise to consciousness or, or just are conscious
1615040	1619920	is going to be different. If we think of space time, not as the fundamental reality,
1620560	1626880	but just as a user interface, maybe integrated information theory might be telling us something
1626880	1632480	about what patterns in our user interface are giving us better pointers to the consciousness
1632480	1636480	behind the interface. So they're not, they're not telling us how consciousness is created.
1636480	1640560	They're telling us how our, how our interface sometimes, sometimes the interface will give
1640560	1645040	us better insights into consciousness and sometimes less. So maybe it will, you know,
1645040	1651120	there will be a complete rethinking of, of what they've done. So it's not that their work will be
1651120	1656240	lost, but it will be just reinterpreted just like a lot of Newtonian stuff gets reinterpreted,
1657120	1663760	you know, in Einstein and Primark and so forth. So, so, you know, I, you know,
1663760	1669680	Stuart Hemeroff, I love to hang out with him and, you know, these were all good people
1670560	1676160	and friends. What about Bernardo Castro? I mean, your thoughts on his work and what he,
1676160	1682560	and everything he talks about regarding idealism? Well, Bernardo and our good friends and I've,
1682560	1689840	I've begged him to come work with us. He's got, he's a philosopher, but he also has another PhD
1689840	1697200	with a lot of mathematical chops. So I would love to, and anytime Bernardo wants to come work with
1697200	1702160	us because, you know, philosophically, we're on the same page, right? Our theory is an idealist
1702160	1710720	theory. And, and I respect Bernardo's decision to, to spend his valuable time taking up the
1710720	1717680	philosophical aspects of this. And we've decided to, there is a little philosophy in what we do,
1717680	1722560	and we have a collaborator, Robert Printner, who was a professor, I mean, not a professor,
1722560	1729040	but, you know, his PhDs and one of his PhDs is in philosophy. And so he brings a lot of philosophical
1729680	1737280	sophistication that I don't have to, to our work in idealism. But, you know, my, my background,
1737280	1741920	I have a little bit of background in philosophy enough to talk and get myself in trouble, but not
1741920	1748080	enough to be a professional. And, and I don't know enough math to be a mathematician, but,
1748080	1753120	but I know in how to collaborate with the, the appropriate people who can listen to me and say,
1753120	1755680	well, Dan, it's not quite right. But here, this, this will, this will fix it.
1757280	1760800	What are you, some of your favorite aspects of Bernardo's work? What, what, what intrigues you
1760800	1772640	most about it? Well, I think that Bernardo is giving good philosophical arguments for why physicalism
1775120	1779280	is, in some sense, almost self-contradictory and, and, but couldn't possibly be
1781120	1787120	the way forward and why idealism shouldn't be dismissed. I mean, I think a lot of, for most
1788000	1795440	philosophers, well, most people just in general, the, the a priori assumption is that, of course,
1795440	1799920	space-time is fundamental. And the burden of proof was in whoever wants to say that, you know,
1799920	1805920	this consciousness stuff is, is, I mean, surely you, you have the burden of proof if you talk about
1805920	1810720	consciousness being fundamental, because we all can see that space-time and particles and
1810720	1816880	physical stuff is fundamental. Of course, brains are there and created consciousness.
1817920	1823760	You have to be a fool, I mean, you know, to not, to not think that. So, so Bernardo does a good
1823760	1828320	job of turning the tables and saying, no, really, the burden of proof is on the physicalist.
1830720	1836000	And science itself is already saying that we need to move into a post-space-time
1836640	1843520	framework for, for, for science. So, so I like Bernardo's work. And he's, he's very forceful.
1844720	1848480	We have different personalities in terms of how we present our ideas, very, very different
1848480	1852960	personalities. But, but he and I, when we get together, we get along quite well.
1852960	1856560	Yeah. No, Bernardo, when I spoke, when I had, when I interviewed him, he actually asked me
1856560	1861680	during our round two, he wants me to interrogate him a lot more intensely, apparently. So he likes
1861680	1867280	to be challenged. He loves that active interrogation. He said, don't be like, I was like, I can't help
1867280	1871840	it, but he wants that. Anyway, let's go back to the paper, right? So we think of conscious agents,
1872880	1877360	trace change, decorated permutations, and then you go to the amplitude hindering and then
1877360	1881600	particles and space-time. Let's run through that process. How do we get from conscious agents to
1881600	1888960	particles in space-time? Right. So, I mean, that's a very, it's a layered question because there's
1888960	1896160	so much to actually go into that. There's so much. I know. Maybe we'll go into it a bit more in detail
1896160	1901680	afterwards. Oh, just a summary. Okay. So just top-level summary. Okay. Yeah. So the top level,
1901680	1908080	the idea is that there are, there is a Markovian dynamics, which basically a Markovian dynamics is
1909520	1915600	the simplest probabilistic dynamics you could imagine. Which doesn't mean to say that it's
1915680	1921920	simple, but it's just the simplest that you could write down. And
1924480	1931840	within that dynamics of these, what we call conscious agents, but these entities beyond
1931840	1939280	space-time, there are certain patterns of the dynamics where you get coherence, where a group
1939280	1948640	of them have a stable dynamical system. We call these recurrent communicating classes or ergodic.
1949280	1955760	So you have a big dynamical system, but subsets of states are ergodic, and they give you a little
1955760	1962720	ergodic Markov chains, where they have long-term behavior that can be described by a probability
1962720	1970240	measure, an invariant probability measure. And it's these different ergodic subsets,
1970240	1977840	essentially, of the dynamics that we've discovered map on to the decorator permutations. So the
1977840	1983840	decorator permutations are basically telling you which states go together. This group are together
1983840	1989680	forming ergodic set, this group forming ergodic set. So that's what the decorator permutations
1989760	1995120	are doing. So that's the new interpretation that we're proposing. So that's actually a new,
1995120	2003360	as far as we can tell, a new contribution to mathematics. And then from that, the physicist then
2004080	2011600	can take the decorator permutations and show how they're related to something called an amplitude
2011600	2015760	hydrant. And now this is not for all particles, the amplitude hydrant is only for massless
2016720	2023680	particles. And it's also that it's a special case where it's a supersymmetry, n equals 4
2024240	2031680	supersymmetric kind of thing. So it's in some sense a toy model, but it's close enough to
2031680	2037360	reality that physicists take it quite seriously. And more recent work, they've been able to let go
2037360	2044240	of the toy and do it for all masses and spins. But for now, we're trying to understand that new
2044320	2050960	work and connect with that as well. But for now, we can say this map gives us, for the massless
2050960	2059040	particles, and we think also the massive, a map through decorator permutations, through the
2059040	2063840	amplitude hydrant for the massless particles, and they're into scattering in spacetime. And by
2063840	2070240	scattering, I mean, you know, you have like the Large Hadron Collider and other Fermilab colliders
2070240	2075040	and so forth, where you take particles at high velocities, like two protons or electron
2075040	2080960	smashing into a proton. And you see it's, you see the particles smash into each other and then
2080960	2085040	the stuff going out. And you try to figure out what's going on, just like trying to figure out
2085040	2088720	how cars are made by smashing them into each other and seeing all the wheel flies off and hubcap
2088720	2094960	and the engine. It's hard work, you can imagine. So how do you figure out, you know, it's not easy,
2094960	2098240	but it takes a lot of, but that's what they're doing. There's, there's smashing
2098240	2101600	particles together and seeing what flies out. And that's called particle scattering.
2101600	2104960	And that's what you can predict using these decorator permutations
2105760	2108880	and the amplitude hydrant. You can actually predict the probabilities, what they call the
2108880	2115840	amplitudes for these. And so what we're doing now is, is saying, what properties of the
2115840	2122400	conscious agent dynamics, these recurrent classes correspond to mass, momentum, spin,
2123360	2131440	energy. And how do the evolving Markovian dynamics project to what we look and see as
2131440	2134800	scattering of particles in space time? That's sort of the top level picture.
2134800	2140080	Okay. So look, it's interesting when you think, okay, so when you think of a collection of agents,
2141520	2146320	I know at some point you mentioned in your paper, I think it was Erwin Schrodinger's essay,
2146320	2150880	Mind and Matter. You mentioned how it links to this concept. How are these two links,
2151040	2154000	that concept of, or his book on Mind and Matter?
2155840	2165920	Well, Schrodinger and a number of, of the early quantum theorists. We're thinking about
2167840	2174240	like the collapse of the wave function. You have, in quantum theory, you have
2175200	2182880	Schrodinger's equation for non-relativistic quantum systems. And you have this differential
2182880	2191040	equation, which shows how the state evolves as a function of time. And it's deterministic
2192640	2199760	and unitary. But when you make a measurement, that equation no longer holds.
2200720	2209280	If you, if you want to actually say what value of the spin you got, or what value of the position
2209280	2218400	you got or momentum, you have a different, it's the collapse operator. And, and that's non-linear.
2219680	2225440	The Schrodinger equation is linear. So, so you have this weird situation in quantum theory where
2226400	2231760	when essentially you're not looking, there's one evolution. And when you look, when you measure,
2232960	2239760	it's a different dynamics. Well, that's not a very happy situation for most scientists. I mean,
2239760	2244880	that's not happy at all. And the, you know, of course, that's led to all sorts of, you know,
2244880	2251760	multiverse kinds of explanations and many worlds interpretations and so forth.
2255840	2259840	Basically, it's more than many worlds, not the multiverse, many worlds that came out of that.
2261040	2266640	So, I think at some point you spoke about any collection of agents is itself an agent.
2268160	2272800	And then you said there is ultimately one agent. That sort of links to this.
2273760	2278880	Right. That's right. So, yeah, that gets to what Schrodinger was after was there is some kind of
2278880	2285520	unity behind all this diversity. And Schrodinger was looking at that. He, I think, was interested
2285520	2291520	in some of the Eastern mystical ideas and, and, and, and cites them. And so there is this notion of,
2292880	2298640	some whole wholeness, some unity beyond space time. And, and maybe we're gonna have to go there.
2298640	2305440	David Bohm also in his book Wholeness and the Implicant Order has the same, same idea. This
2305440	2311760	is different than his pilot wave work, you know, but, but his book Wholeness and the Implicant
2311760	2315040	Order is going after the same kind of thing. I think that Schrodinger was talking about that.
2315040	2320000	Maybe we have to go to a deeper point of view in which there is a reality beyond space time
2321120	2325840	that is somehow unified. And we go, we do go there. So, yeah, thanks for, you know,
2325840	2328480	sort of putting me on track here. We do go there with our work because we,
2330560	2338560	it turns out to be the case that we can think about ever larger conscious agents.
2340480	2347680	And then any huge conscious agent can be articulated into a bunch of interacting
2347680	2352560	smaller conscious agents, which, which constitute it. And so we're sort of led to,
2353520	2359120	you know, we can have accountable infinity of agents, which are all part of one agent,
2359120	2364240	then an ALIF one, ALIF two, there's the whole canterarchy and cantors hierarchy of,
2364240	2372400	of infinities, we could imagine agents with, you know, ALIF two trillion states
2374000	2377680	in it and having a dynamics and then all the sub agents that could come out of it.
2378480	2382320	And ultimately, this, this line of thought leads you to say there's, well,
2382320	2387520	there's ultimately just one agent, but we could never actually write down the mathematics for it.
2388080	2393600	We can only write down, you know, projections of it, you know, the, the, the part, the partial
2393600	2397600	agents that, that cut that are part of it. But even there, we might be able to make
2398880	2402720	some progress, but it is interesting that the mathematics is, you know, if consciousness
2402720	2408640	is fundamental and we're using this mathematics, there is one agent and you can do a lot of mathematics,
2409600	2413920	but you'll never get to that one agent. Your mathematics will never be able to,
2413920	2418880	you can address projections of that one agent, you can do that, but you'll never be able to give
2421040	2423360	the mathematical theory of the dynamics of the one agent.
2423360	2426720	Yeah. What are your thoughts on mathematical realism in general,
2427840	2429520	your views on that concept?
2429520	2434160	I think that's a deep, deep question. And I, I go back and forth on it. My,
2436080	2442640	you know, I, the way it's typically put, our mathematical theorems invented or discovered,
2442640	2446720	right? That's, that's the big, the big divide. And
2446720	2454400	my,
2457200	2463920	I go, I go back and forth on that myself. I really go, go back and forth. Somehow my,
2463920	2467280	my feeling is that perhaps the equation, the question itself
2468000	2472320	is making a false division and it's both. I mean, that, that in some sense, if we really
2472320	2476640	understood this, if I even understood my own ideas about consciousness being fundamental
2476640	2483520	deeply enough, I would realize that the difference between invention and discovery here was, was
2485760	2490000	artificial on my part, that, that, that I wasn't thinking deeply enough. But again,
2490000	2492160	I, I'm not able to think deeply enough to, to actually
2494720	2501200	say anything deeper about that. So if I had to bet on one, I would say discovered.
2502400	2508720	Not invented. But, but my, our own work on consciousness makes me head myself and say,
2509440	2515680	ultimately, we may find that invention is discovery. Yeah. So,
2517760	2522560	so that's, that's very, very deep. Yeah, no, it is kind of both. Back to the paper. So at some
2522560	2527280	point you said, a physicist discovered the surprise to their surprise, sorry, that decorated
2527280	2532320	permutations invariantly categorize the physical content of scattering amplitudes for particles
2532320	2537760	in space time. And then there you go on to say that you guys prove that Markov chains project
2539200	2545360	kind of kind of, sorry, where am I reading? Sorry, project to decorated permutations and
2545360	2547920	thus onto particle scattering. How do you guys prove that?
2547920	2557520	Well, so we, what we show is that we prove it by actually writing down the projection.
2558320	2564960	So, so, so what we do in the paper is we say here for any Markov chain, here is the algorithm
2564960	2570640	by which you get a decorated permutation. And then when you, when you look at it, the algorithm
2570640	2577120	is basically telling you how to divide the entire state space of the Markov chain into this
2577920	2584240	collections of states that have their own recurrent communicating class. So, so the way we prove it
2584240	2590880	is to actually do it. We give you the prescription for the algorithm for doing it.
2590880	2598000	I think on page 11 of your paper, you discuss the precise hypotheses and you label them one to six.
2598000	2601440	I don't know if you want to go through that because that's actually quite a very fascinating
2601440	2607840	component of this paper together. Right. And obviously at some point when the paper is out,
2607840	2610720	I will put a link for everyone listening or watching just to follow through.
2611520	2616960	It should be, a link should be put up any day now by the Institute of Neolithic Sciences,
2616960	2621920	certainly by the 24th of June, which is just a week from Saturday. It'll be up because that's
2621920	2627040	when we're going to be doing, I should probably pull up the paper, but or I could just talk at
2627120	2632720	top level about the paper and just so you can go through those points.
2632720	2636080	I think so. That'll be quite, I think good for the listeners and the viewers as well.
2636720	2640400	I mean, number one, you talk about each elementary particle of the standard model of physics.
2640400	2645200	Each boson, lepton and quark is a projection of a recurrent communicating class and it's
2645200	2650480	Markovian kernel that arise in samplings of trace chains of conscious agents. That's the first one.
2651040	2654640	And then you go on from very fascinating work.
2656000	2660480	Right. So I'll pull that page 11, page 11. Okay.
2662480	2667600	I mean, let's run through those hypotheses and discuss how you call, you act.
2667600	2672880	I think that's a really good idea. Okay. So there it is. Okay. Each elementary particle,
2672880	2677040	the standard model of physics, each boson, lepton and quark is a projection of recurrent
2677040	2683200	communicating class and it's Markovian kernel that arise in samplings of trace chains of
2683200	2689040	conscious agents. So it's one thing. So what we're doing there is
2692320	2698480	get back where I can see you. Okay. So the first thing we're doing is we're saying there's going
2698480	2704960	to be a mapping between the dynamics of conscious agents and elementary particles in the standard
2704960	2712000	model of physics. So the bosons, leptons and quarks, the bosons are the mass, well the force
2712000	2718720	carriers. Some of them are massless photons and gluons are massless. The others, the Higgs and the
2718720	2726240	Z and W plus and minus are massive. And then there's leptons, which are like electrons,
2726240	2732080	muons and Tau's and electron neutrinos, tau neutrinos and muon neutrinos. And then there are
2732080	2740800	the quarks. There are up and down, charm and strange and top and bottom quarks. So then and
2740800	2746800	that's the whole basic particle suit. Then you combine those to get other things like pions
2746800	2753440	and mesons and other other things that you that you protons and neutrons. And so
2754800	2760800	our first thing that we're proposing is that there is a mapping between the
2760800	2767040	conscious agent dynamics and these elementary particles. And that is the recurrent communicating
2767040	2772160	classes of the Markovian dynamics of conscious agents that will correspond to these elementary
2772160	2780160	particles. Now, I should say not every recurrent communicating class of the conscious agent dynamics
2780160	2786320	will project to a particle. Yes. A probably a trivial subset. There's the Markovian dynamics
2786320	2790960	is going to have a lot of stuff going on there. What we're doing here is saying, okay, ultimately
2790960	2794800	we have to get a mapping from the conscious agent dynamics, not just the particles, but to
2796240	2802080	organisms, to brains, to neurons, to neural networks. And so there's going to be a mapping.
2803280	2808880	So what we're doing in this paper is saying the first connection we're going to try to make
2809520	2815120	is to elementary particles. And so the obvious question is why? I mean, clearly everybody
2815120	2821680	thinks that brain activity is related to and you know, it's it's so why go after, you know,
2821680	2827360	bosons, leptons and quarks when surely the the low hanging fruit is the brain. And that's that's
2827360	2830960	where we have the neural correlates of consciousness and so forth. So you guys already,
2830960	2836640	you know, shooting at the wrong target. And the reason we're going after the elementary particles
2837120	2846160	is because we figure that those are the most simple connections that we can make.
2848240	2854080	And I said that even though I'm not a particle physicist, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. For me,
2855040	2858480	talking about the brain is much, much easier than talking about elementary particles. I'm
2858480	2866000	having to do lots and lots of remedial reading and homework to even talk the lingo. But I realized
2866720	2871920	it's hopeless to go after the brain is too complicated. The simplest thing inside space
2871920	2875600	time are these elementary particles. So if we're going to do this,
2877600	2882400	the best shot we have is to connect to the elementary particles and then gradually work our
2882400	2887360	way up. Okay, elementary particles. Now can we get to protons and neutrons? Oh, we okay. And
2887360	2893440	then can we get to atoms? Now can we get to molecules? Now can we get to larger molecules?
2893440	2898880	No. Okay, now we can try to maybe climb our way up to the brain, but that's not going to happen
2898880	2903840	in my lifetime. I mean, if we can get the particles in my lifetime, I'll be delighted.
2905600	2910000	So that's our strategy. We're not going after particles because they're the most important
2910000	2914960	thing or the most interesting thing. They're the simplest possible thing, which is not to say simple,
2914960	2917680	but they're the simplest possible connection that we could make. So that's,
2918400	2924720	that's why we're going after them. And most recurrent classes of the conscious
2924720	2930320	age dynamics will have nothing to do directly with particles, most of it. But we're going to
2930320	2936320	try to find the, you know, mappings that do relate to particles so we can build our way up.
2936320	2941360	So that's sort of the meaning of that first one. And the second one. So then number two,
2941360	2949200	huh? Properties of a free particle, the spin, the mass, the energy momentum are projections
2949200	2954880	of the properties of the kernel of the recurrent communicating class. For example, the periodicity,
2954880	2958560	the entropy rates, heating times and stationary distributions of that communicating class.
2959280	2966400	So the idea here is, there's one thing to say, recurrent communicating classes correspond to
2967120	2972720	at least some of the corresponded particles, but you need to do more. You need to say which
2972720	2978880	particles as it goes on the left on a quirk. And you all need to say, okay, what property
2978880	2984320	of the recurrent communicating class of Mark Markov dynamics corresponds to the energy?
2984320	2991760	What corresponds to the mass, the momentum and the spin, right? No hand wave now, right? You said
2992720	2999200	a recurrent communicating class projects to a particle. Well, particles have energy, momentum,
2999200	3008080	spin, mass, so where's the beef? What's, but in other words, you know, the very same thing I was
3008080	3012800	pointing at my good friends and colleagues or said, where's the beef? What's, you know, what
3012800	3018800	specific conscious experience can you get out of your theory? The same finger points back at me.
3018800	3022960	You're saying recurrent communicating classes give us position, momentum, spin. Well, give me
3022960	3028160	on exactly what property of the recurrent communicating class is the mass, for example.
3029360	3037520	So we have a proposal for each one of those in this document. For mass, it's, we propose,
3037520	3043360	it's what's called the entropy rate of the dynamical system of the recurrent communicating
3043360	3049440	class. And entropy is, you know, a measure, everybody knows entropy is a measure of disorder.
3050880	3057120	An entropy rate basically takes a Markovian kernel that has a bunch of rows and columns,
3057120	3064080	right? It's, it's, you think of it as a square matrix. And if each row, each row is a probability
3064080	3069280	measure, essentially, each row of a Markovian kernel is a probability measure. So if it's an
3069280	3074880	n by n matrix, you have each row is, has n entries in it, and in all the entries sum to one.
3076000	3080640	They're all, they're all non-negative. They're greater than zero. They're all between zero and one,
3080640	3086080	and they all sum to one. That's effectively what a Markovian kernel is. If you write down
3086800	3092320	an n by n matrix, each row has numbers between, only between zero and one, and each row sums to
3092320	3099760	one, you've got a Markovian kernel. That's what it is. And if the, if that Markovian kernel is,
3099760	3112480	is recurrent, that is that any state within, you have n states, if you can get from any state to
3112480	3120400	any other state, you can find that amount of time and back again, basically, then it's recurrent.
3121120	3127200	And if it's, if the entropies in the rows are not all zero,
3129440	3133840	in other words, if you have some, if, if a row has just zeros, and then there's a single one in that
3133840	3143040	row, that, that's a legitimate row in general, but, but a recurrent class in which every row is
3143040	3149120	like that is a periodic Markov chain. You, and you're, and you're going basically from step,
3149120	3155040	you know, state one to state three with probability one, and then to state four with, you know, and
3155040	3159200	then back to state two, whatever it might be, you're going from each one with probability one. So
3159200	3168480	that's a periodic chain. Those, each row has zero entropy in that case. But what we, well,
3169680	3173920	it's a little complicated, but I'll just say this, the entropy rate basically says this,
3174160	3181600	saying that that's the mass means if the Markovian kernel is periodic.
3183120	3187040	So if you're in this state, then you will necessarily with probability one go to that
3187040	3191760	state. And, and there's, so there's a, it's almost like a deterministic set of states that you go
3191760	3197040	through and cycle. So you're cycling through states in a specific order, that will have zero mass.
3197600	3206400	So we propose that periodic kernels map to massless particles,
3208160	3212720	massless bosons. Makes a lot more sense when you say it. I mean, from reading the paper, it's a
3212720	3217200	lot, it's a lot better to hear you say it. Yeah, it is more, there's more intuition that this was
3217200	3221920	the intuition that that sort of guided it. Well, no, I'll tell you what the intuition was that
3221920	3226720	guided it with, but, but in the case of, I'll just say a little bit more of what it means
3226720	3232160	than I'll give you the intuition that that does as much detail as you want on go go ahead. Yeah.
3232160	3241360	Okay. So if, if there are entries other than zeros and ones in your recurrent communicating
3241360	3248400	class, then it's going to have mass, according to this entry rate, it'll be massive. And the reason
3248400	3254720	why we were thinking about it this way was the following intuition. What does, what does mass
3254720	3258480	mean intuitively, right? This is what the kind of thinking you have to do when you can try to make
3258480	3262640	these connections. You have to say, okay, we're trying to say what aspect of conscious agent
3262640	3268160	dynamics corresponds to physical mass. We're going to have to think abstractly, what do we really,
3268160	3275120	what is mass in the physical, and at least inertial mass in some sense. Well, I'll just say mass in
3275120	3279840	general has something to do with how much you can be influenced and how much you influence,
3281200	3285200	right? If you, if, if you're massless, you have less influence than if you're massive.
3287040	3295120	And so what would correspond to influence in a social network? Who are the influencers in a
3295120	3299200	social network? So this is the way you have to think to, because these, these conscious agent
3299200	3304720	networks are social networks. So think, you know, the internet, Twitterverse and so forth.
3304720	3311920	Well, the influencers are those who have the most followers. And, and so if,
3313040	3318560	in other words, they have the most connections, the more, so Hoffman has a lot fewer connections
3318560	3323760	on his website than Google, Google has, you know, a few, a couple dozen more connections than Hoffman
3323760	3330000	has a lot more power, and they're a lot richer. So, so that, that's the notion of influence.
3330000	3336240	How connected are you? Well, now, if we look at this Markov chain, if this state has,
3336960	3341280	in this role of the Markovian kernel has all zeros and only a single one, that means
3341920	3346400	it's not talking to anybody except one guy. Yeah, he's only talking to one guy. Well,
3346400	3350000	that's as little influence as you can have. And if you're talking only to yourself,
3352000	3356240	then you're, then, then you're, you're, you're out, you, so, so that was, you can see the
3356240	3361120	intuition that went into this. And so, but if you're, if you're connected to everybody,
3363600	3368080	you're going to be more influential. Well, if you look at how you're going to be connected
3368080	3372560	to everybody, that means that the entropy in your row is going to increase. The more connections
3372560	3377440	you have in general, you're going to be having more nonzero entries in your row. And if every
3377440	3384560	entry is nonzero, that's going to, in general, you know, it's a bit of a handway, but, but
3385200	3389040	it's going to, in general, mean that you're going to have greater and greater entry. So we just said,
3389040	3397280	okay, let's make it, in some sense, the, the influence of a state is the entropy of its row,
3397280	3402720	right? But now we're talking, we have to give a, an influence for the, in some sense,
3402720	3408640	a mass to the whole recurrent class. So we need to weight all the, all the influences of those
3408640	3412560	other guys. We have to weight them. What's the right weighting that we have to give to them? Well,
3412560	3418960	the old, there's only one canonical measure for the weighting is so-called invariant measure.
3418960	3425920	It's the, there is a probability measure that the, when you multiply, so if we have a kernel P,
3425920	3434320	we'll call this matrix P, and we have a measure M. So M is the measure. If M times P equals M,
3435600	3442080	that's called an invariant measure. So M P equals M. There's, for recurrent communicating
3442080	3446880	class, there's a unique measure that has that property. And so that's the invariant measure,
3446880	3452400	is the measure that's left alone by the whole kernel. And so we use that to weight
3453200	3458160	the entropies of the rows. And that, and, and Claude Shannon, you know, the inventor of information
3458160	3462320	theory, he was the one who first defined entropy rate. I mean, I'm sort of giving sort of the
3462320	3468000	kinds of ideas that might go into that. But Claude Shannon is the genius who invented information
3468000	3473280	theory. And he came up with the definition of entropy rate. So we just borrowed Claude Shannon's
3473280	3481120	definition of entropy rate and said, that is, for the intuitions I just gave, give some notion of the
3482080	3492480	influence or inertia of this group of interacting conscious agents. Each row corresponds to an
3492480	3500720	agent and its interactions. And that then leads to, as soon as you make that move,
3502480	3507760	that means that periodic Markov change, we go from one state to the next state, you know,
3507840	3511360	one agent talks only to this agent, he only talks to the next agent and so forth.
3512560	3519200	They're massless. So somehow now, see, this is now that one definition gives us a real
3520320	3525760	rip on things, because we know that the massless particles always move at the speed of light.
3526960	3532960	Right. So now we all we get a handle. Okay, so, and the massive ones are always moving less than
3532960	3539920	the speed of light in their projection in the space time. Now, now, so that so that gives us
3539920	3544960	another thing, then we can say, okay, well, we have the mass, we made one other postulate, and that is
3544960	3549520	that the we go to the paper.
3549520	3560320	So by periodicity, it entropy rates hitting times and stationary distributions.
3561680	3565600	That's right. So let me let me just go down to
3568320	3573600	make sure I say what we did correctly, even though it's my own work.
3574400	3578880	I mean, okay, we all often do we write papers and then we do forget certain details.
3578880	3584480	It's normal. Yeah, here, here saying the wrong, it has to be said exactly right or you're wrong.
3584480	3585120	Yeah. So,
3589440	3596240	so the one one thing we're saying is that a communicating class, so this recurrent communicating
3596240	3600000	class, if it has n states, it has momentum and
3600720	3601280	is
3604240	3610880	and it has a mass equal to its entry rate, we just talked about. Okay, so that's so that's
3610880	3617280	so I bring that up because that's another postulate. The momentum is the number
3618880	3624960	of states, the number of agents in the class. That's the momentum. And once you have those two
3624960	3631120	things, then the energy falls out. Right. So so once once you have those, then you then we used.
3631680	3631920	Well,
3634400	3638800	there, one could say we're cheating a little bit and Schwapp-Hohn has suggested to me that we'll
3638800	3646960	need to think more about this. We're using the physics equation now that relates energy, momentum,
3646960	3656080	and mass, mass squared. But so we we we do that for now and we may need to give deeper
3656080	3661680	motivation for it later. But but right now, I'll just say with that proviso, once we have the
3661680	3665920	momentum being the number of states and we have the mass being the entry rate, then the energy
3665920	3672640	falls out as as from from Einstein, from Einstein's special theory of relativity.
3676080	3691120	And so so now we've got energy mass in momentum. The spin is now spin is an interesting tricky
3691120	3702480	thing. Spin of a particle is is something that's, I think, counterintuitive to a lot of people. It's
3703520	3709600	if you if you're spinning, you have a basketball player that's spinning a basketball on the fingertip,
3709600	3714400	you can go at any speed that you want, you know, they can go fast, slow, but spin for
3714400	3722240	per particles, you can only go spin at certain speeds. And there's no speed in between that you
3722240	3730720	jump at your spin values, which so the spin is is is counterintuitive. What we what we do is we use
3732480	3737520	a branch of mathematics called geometric algebra, sort of a generalization of something called
3737520	3748960	Clifford algebra. And we this this this gets a little bit technical, but what we what we do is we use
3754720	3761280	trying to see if there's a way to say this. Here's an intuition when a Markovian kernel
3762080	3770160	right, it's a it's an n by n matrix. If you can ask yourself, what does it do if I have
3771680	3778720	an n dimensional space, and I have unit vectors, a unit vector pointing on each of the n dimensions.
3779760	3784320	Let's just think about three dimensions that let them keep it real easy. So I have a three by three
3784320	3789920	Markovian kernels got three rows and three columns. And it's and I have I'm looking at three vectors,
3790240	3797920	my finger, my thumb, that are orthogonal and that are each is length one. And I ask, okay, when
3797920	3803920	when this Markovian kernel acts, it's going to move these vectors around. That's what it does. It
3803920	3810880	moves. It moves them around, it may shrink them, it might expand them. So so suppose I start off
3810880	3819520	with a unit volume. So this is I have three vectors, and each is like one inch long. And so I've got a
3819600	3827440	one inch cube is a cube of one inch, one inch cubed. When I act on it with the Markovian kernel,
3827440	3831760	those vectors are going to move, they're going to like scrunch in or spread apart somehow.
3832400	3836160	And some of them are going to get longer. I can't do that with my fingers. Some are going to get
3836160	3842800	shorter. That would be too painful. But but but what's going to happen is, and they may switch,
3842800	3847600	maybe maybe this one, it was this order, but maybe this one switches over and they they
3847680	3856640	can cross in certain ways. So the volume of that they define, right, they're going to follow here,
3856640	3861280	they're a cube, but they're going to in general, have a parallelogram of some kind, or a parallel
3861280	3866320	pipette parallel pipette that they're going to define. And the volume is going to be somewhere
3866320	3872480	between zero and one, it won't increase the volume, but it can decrease the volume. And it can change
3872480	3878240	the sign. If I think of this as a, you know, using the right hand rule that this is a positive
3878240	3884240	sign volume, then maybe that is a negative sign volume. Okay, so it can go be so it can change
3884240	3893200	the volume, which was one to any volume between minus one and plus one. So that's what the kernel
3893200	3898800	is doing. And that operation on these basis vectors is what we call the spin. What it does to
3898800	3903600	the volume is the spin. So that so there is a way to do it intuitively. Oh, that's that's okay,
3903600	3908960	there is a way to do it into it. If you if you want to go into the final detail, you more than
3908960	3915600	welcome that done. Okay, yeah, well, that was a good one, because that is actually an accurate
3917440	3921600	an accurate description of what we're what we're saying is happening, what what the spin is.
3921600	3933200	And by the way, one thing that this then tells us is if only periodic
3933280	3949680	chains are massless, then you can from what I just said, one can show that if
3950400	3953040	if the
3957360	3962800	number of states is even
3967120	3972400	you have to again, now you look at our paper, you have to say it exactly right. You rather make sure.
3972960	3980720	Yeah, this is tricky enough. It's very complicated. So I'm glad you actually have the paper on hand.
3982320	3989200	Yeah, I just want to make make sure I say it exactly right. I don't want to say it wrong and
3989200	3996400	then have to. Yeah, then the comment section goes wild. That's right. Okay,
3997360	4007920	so if see if this class is massless and has n states, if n is even, then this matrix has to have
4010160	4016560	spin minus one. Well, it's spin one, but with minus sign. Okay, spin one, but minus sign.
4017600	4025680	And if it's if the number of states is odd, then it has spin one that's with positive sign.
4027360	4028720	And what that means is
4035600	4037040	you can't have
4044480	4048400	Which page are you on at the moment? This is page 27.
4049360	4055600	Yeah, what that means, it was stunning to me. What it means is
4057600	4059200	if you have a massless
4061840	4064160	particle, according to our theory,
4066480	4072480	and you change the sign of the spin, plus one to minus one,
4073440	4079760	it has to have a change in energy. Yes, change, change in, yeah, change in energy, it has to have.
4079760	4080880	So you cannot have
4083520	4084720	two massless particles
4087200	4094960	of the same energy and opposite spins. It's not possible. So when I, so when I ran,
4094960	4100800	when I realized that from our mathematics, and I thought, oh, well, that's, that's where that's,
4100880	4105760	that seems to be, that's a very, very strange prediction. Oh, well, maybe that's where we're
4105760	4110240	going to be shown to be wrong. I mean, that's, that's, that's really wild. Or, or if it's true,
4110240	4116000	maybe, you know, it's, it's, you can have n and n plus one. So maybe, you know, the, the, the, there
4116000	4122320	could be an energy of, you know, one million, and then it has to be one million plus one. So maybe
4122320	4129920	it'd be too small to see the, the difference that I was thinking. So that's true. What I don't
4129920	4137200	know about physics. It was, it was a couple of weeks later that I realized, no, this is what,
4137200	4142960	what they found is, is that there's this fine structure to, like the orbital, the electron
4142960	4152080	orbitals. Now, now, what, what's going on there is you, in the Bohr model of the atom, you have
4152080	4156880	these different orbitals. But when you look at them very, really fine, you find that there are,
4156880	4161200	there's actually two, two little bands there. And so the, the photons that you're going to get
4161200	4168000	aren't the same energy photons. They're actually, there's this fine. So, so always, and so there's
4168000	4174080	a lot of fine structure there. And so, so that doesn't mean that we're right, but it means that
4174640	4178160	one thing that I thought, well, that's to blow us out of the water. I mean, this is a pretty strong
4178160	4181920	prediction that there's going to be this fine structure. Well, yeah, there is a, they call,
4182720	4187040	there is this hyperfine structure. And, and there's the fine structure constant. So now
4187040	4191920	I'm very interested in looking at the, the fine structure constant and seeing how that plays a
4191920	4199280	role in our COVID dynamics. So, so, so you, but that by itself made me think, well, you know,
4200240	4203920	of course, we're probably wrong, but this is pretty, this is a pretty interesting game now.
4205040	4209120	You know, the math came and hit me in the face and said, you're predicting that you can't have
4209120	4216080	two massless particles of opposite spin and have the same energy. That is a strong, strong
4216080	4220560	prediction. I mean, there you, there you can be, I mean, surely you can be falsified right on the
4220560	4226480	get go from with that one. And it doesn't look like we're falsified right out of the get go on
4226480	4232480	that one. So, so that gives me hope not that we're ultimately right, but that this horse may have
4232480	4237680	a lot of writing to do before we find out its limitations. I see. What's up on the, what's
4238240	4242400	am I pronouncing it correctly? Shwapong? Was he part of? Shwapong, yeah.
4242400	4246000	Is he the one who figured this out or was it, was it you, you got, you and Prakash?
4248480	4254640	What did you guys come to? I did. Or you did? Yeah, I was the one who, but then as soon as I
4254640	4260240	said it, Shwapong of course knew about the, I mean, of course, fine structure. So it was,
4260240	4265600	it was me, you know, because of my ignorance, not knowing about it and going through a couple
4265600	4271600	weeks of sweating and thinking about it. I was the one who had first noticed that, oh, wow,
4271600	4277120	we make this weird prediction. And I worried about it for a couple of weeks until I happened
4277120	4282240	to run across a video. I was doing some remedial physics training on myself. And I
4283600	4286880	happened to run across this video on the hyperfine strat. I said, you've got to be
4286880	4292080	kidding me. I couldn't have asked for something better than that. So it was, it was my ignorance.
4292080	4295760	First, Shwapong, it was just falling off a log. He understood this and Chaiton.
4295760	4301600	Yeah. Okay, let's move on to number three then of the, of the hypothesis. Each projection is
4301600	4307680	perceivable by some CA via a window of some finite number of steps in which the agent observes
4307680	4311680	the corresponding trace chain. And yeah, I think at this point we can discuss trace chains and
4311680	4317680	everything around that. Yes, let me pull up page 11.
4320400	4325440	All right, right, right. Page 11. Okay. Yeah, I find this page actually, I love the way you set
4325440	4334160	this up. Oh, good. Good. Makes it a lot easier for me, particularly for this interview and this
4334160	4341360	conversation. Right. Yeah. And that was partly because the Institute of Theetic Sciences asked
4341360	4346160	for a certain format in the, in, in these proposals. So it was very helpful to, to make it,
4346160	4350000	and their goal was to try to make it accessible. So they did a good job of that.
4350000	4355760	That's correct. So, so you're doing number three. Okay. Each projection is perceivable by some CA via
4355760	4360960	a window. Unless there was something about number two that you still want to touch on,
4360960	4362320	are you fine? Are we done with that one?
4363280	4373040	Yeah, I'll just say one, one other thing about two that might be of interest in that is we,
4373040	4377920	I haven't yet worked out the, like, the notion of the velocity of particles in space time.
4379920	4385040	But we know that that the massless particles go at the speed of light. So we know that answer.
4385040	4390000	So whatever our ultimate story is going to be about the massive particles and their speed.
4390960	4393920	And I can just say at top level, the kind of thing I'm thinking about right now
4395760	4399840	that our team is thinking about, but I won't, this is what I'm thinking about. I'm not going
4399840	4404560	to blame my team for any bad ideas. So if it's a bad idea, it's, it's, it's all Hoffman. If it's
4404560	4416320	a good idea, it's the team. And that is, we want some notion of the, of velocity within this Markov
4416400	4423600	kernel that will translate to what we call through projection to velocities in space time.
4423600	4427840	And the massless particles, which are the periodic ones, you, you, that means that, you know,
4427840	4431760	from this state, you always go with probably one to that state and then probably one to next.
4431760	4435840	There's no messing around. You go bang, bang, bang, bang. You, you, if there are end states,
4435840	4441680	you go through a cycle in n steps. No, it takes you only n steps to go through a complete cycle
4441680	4447040	and every cycle. But for the other, if it's massive, then it might take you if it, even if
4447040	4453440	there's n states, it might take you five n steps before you actually start with one particle and
4453440	4458880	visit all the other particles and get back to where you were. Right. So that's, there's a notion of,
4458880	4464000	of, you can see there's a notion of speed that, that's very natural there. And it's,
4464160	4470560	um, technical term is the commuting time. So you can talk about the commuting time
4471200	4478400	of an ergodic chain. And so what we're thinking about, what I'm thinking about again,
4479360	4488960	I won't blame them yet, is that the commuting times of within a communicating class
4489920	4495280	are going to somehow be related to the velocities that we say the particle has in spacetime.
4496480	4501360	But that hasn't, but that's not in our proposal. And, and we're still working on that. But, but
4502240	4507600	given that I've already, you know, given my provisos, they'll just put it out there. That's
4508560	4514000	part of the reason I'm doing that is, is people can see how fun this is, right? You're, you're,
4514000	4519840	you're playing where this is, you're exploring, you're playing and you go, what about this? What is,
4519840	4524160	what if this property of the dynamics of conscious agents correspond to what we call velocity in
4524160	4528960	spacetime? Of course, I'm probably wrong, but hey, it's a fun idea. And, you know, it's not
4528960	4534480	obviously stupid. Um, and, and we'll see. And I, it's the exploration that really matters. I mean,
4534480	4539200	it's such an enjoyable journey. And watching you talk about it as well, you can tell how much you
4539280	4542480	are having fun discussing it. I mean, it's, it's very apparent.
4543200	4547680	I'm like a kid in a candy store with this stuff. You know, you know, all along that, that of course
4547680	4552880	you're probably wrong, but you also have a feeling that there may be something of this that, that
4552880	4559760	actually sticks. It may, some of this may stick. We'll see. Um, and some will be corrected and,
4559760	4564080	and so forth. Sometimes you have to be brave and put the idea out there. That's just, that's what
4564080	4572560	science is. That's right. The nice thing about this is, um, I do get emails a lot from people who
4572560	4576880	have that are probably very, very brilliant and they have lots of ideas about how cockiness
4576880	4584560	related to spacetime. But, but out of a hundred emails, I won't get one where someone has said,
4584560	4590240	here's the mathematical connection that I'm proposing. And, and, and until you can do that,
4591120	4598000	there's nothing that scientists can look at. Yeah. It's, it's, it's when you say something,
4598000	4603520	here's the mathematical connection and this connection says you cannot have a massless boson
4606240	4613440	with one energy having the same, you know, a plus and minus spin one. It can't be,
4613440	4617760	when your mathematics gets that, that specific, then you've got something that scientists
4618320	4622080	will look at because in most times they'll say you're wrong and here, you know,
4622080	4626720	this prediction is wrong. But, but until you are mathematically precise, you're not even wrong.
4627440	4632400	And, and see, that's the point. You're not on the playing field until you can be wrong. Exactly.
4632400	4638160	There's no, scientists will pay attention to you. Yeah. At least I'm wrong, maybe. Yeah. Now, hopefully,
4638160	4641520	I mean, hopefully you're not wrong. Hopefully you're right. Hopefully I'm not wrong. Anyway,
4641600	4646400	let's go to number three. Yeah. Okay. So each projection is
4648080	4652560	perceivable, perceived by some conscious agent via a window of finite steps,
4653680	4656400	in which an agent observes the corresponding trace chain.
4658880	4668720	So, so the idea is how are we going to get from the conscious agents to the observations that we
4668720	4675840	make? You have mass and energy and so forth. Well, we're going to have to use other conscious
4675840	4680160	agents. We're going to have to use systems of conscious agents. So what we're going to have
4680720	4687280	are systems of conscious agents, basically, that do this mapping. What we're, what we're doing right
4687280	4692000	now in this proposal is we're not trying to go through and show how you construct a dynamic of
4692000	4697840	conscious agents to do this. We're going to, for now, we're just going to make the correspondence
4697920	4702880	between these recurrent communicating classes and their properties and, and spacetime will
4702880	4711680	ultimately, we want to actually build a, if spacetime is an interface, right?
4713920	4719840	And it's constructed by a network of conscious agents, like it's like a neural network, but it's
4719840	4723920	a network of conscious agents that's doing this construction. We need to write down what that
4724000	4728320	construction is and then show how it works to create that, that interface.
4731840	4738320	But we can do, and we do plan to do that, but that's, that's, you know, one step at a time. That's,
4738320	4743200	we have probably several years of work on this particle stuff before we actually start to do,
4743200	4750320	to do that. But one thing I will say on that is that my, my feeling is if we take, once we have
4750320	4759280	built that network of conscious agents that is taking the map from conscious agents into our
4759280	4765600	spacetime network, and we take that and we turn it on itself, we actually use the interface that
4765600	4770720	they construct to look at the set of conscious agents that are creating the interface. Okay.
4770720	4775600	That's a really self-referential kind of thing, but this is pretty cool. What are you going to see?
4776480	4781920	Well, I think in some cases you'll see it like in, for us, it'll look like neurons and brains.
4782720	4788160	Okay. Neurons and brains are what you see in your interface when you take the network of
4788160	4792480	conscious agents that they're constructing your interface and have it look at the construction
4792480	4799440	process itself. And that's why I think neuroscience is going to be, we need more funding for neuroscience,
4800080	4804880	not less. I think neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.
4806960	4813520	So neurons cause none of our behaviors, but neurons are the symbols that we see in our interface
4814560	4819840	that are the best, the symbols closest to the construction process of our interface.
4820560	4825520	And, and so neuroscience is going to be a lot more complicated than we thought. We thought,
4825520	4831040	I look into brains, I see neurons and synapses and, and, you know, calcium and sodium and potassium
4831040	4835680	and other ions. And that's because that's what's really there. That's what's, no, no, no. That's
4835680	4845440	your interface description. It is hiding an unbelievably complicated dynamics behind it.
4845440	4852240	You thought neural networks are complicated than they are, but each neuron is hiding behind it.
4853040	4858560	An incredible, so we need far more funding. This is job security for neuroscience for a long,
4858560	4863680	long time. To reverse engineer neurons into this network of conscious agents is going to be a lot
4863680	4872880	of work. So, and so, but we're not, we're going to try to work on that interface, but I suspect
4872880	4876400	I'm going to have to pass the torch to a younger generation. That's, that's a hard, hard problem.
4877040	4884560	It's a lot of work. What I will say on, on that, that point three is what we can do is, is say,
4886720	4893600	what that process is going to have to do. If I have some big master Markov chain,
4896320	4902640	well, typically when you're thinking about a Markov chain, it goes as an infinite number of
4902640	4909120	steps. The chain is an infinite number of steps. What happens when you, so suppose I have just a,
4909120	4918320	like a three by three matrix, right? And I'm not, or four by four, you know, small matrix.
4920400	4925440	Well, you and I haven't lived forever. We're not seeing an infinite chain of steps.
4926080	4932240	So we must be, we must be sampling. We must have this, this dynamics outside of space time
4932800	4938720	of conscious agents. And we have to make the sample, maybe have a window, maybe it's like,
4938720	4943600	I look at a trillion steps, which is a lot of steps, or a million steps or a thousand steps.
4944160	4949440	But it's not infinite. I mean, I'm not looking at an infinite number of steps. So we're sampling.
4949440	4953920	So now we get into the statistics of sampling. I've got this Markovian dynamics.
4955600	4961680	And if I, if I sample, and I then look at what, and estimate the kernel that I've sampled,
4961680	4965360	I'm not going to get exactly the right value. I'm going to get a kernel that's maybe close.
4965360	4970320	The more samples I have, my estimate of what the kernel is can be closer to the real thing,
4970320	4976720	but it's not going to be the real thing. So we're going to have sampling errors.
4978640	4983040	And then we're also going to have just due to temporal sampling, but you could also have space,
4983040	4987600	what we might call spatial sampling. Suppose I have, you know, a trillion states, and I have
4987600	4993040	this huge recurrent communicating classes got a trillion states. Well, you know, I don't think
4993040	4998960	there's any computer on earth right now that could actually simulate that Markov kernel,
4999520	5007600	because you, you, it has one trillion times one trillion entries. It's got, I don't know how many,
5008560	5013360	this is a lot of entries in it. And, and so to just do one step of that thing is going to be
5013360	5016960	tremendous amount of compute power, just to compute one step. If you want to compute a
5016960	5020560	million steps, I mean, I don't think, I think supercomputers are going to be, you know, grinding
5020560	5025680	to a halt. So, so simulating this thing is going to be, is going to be difficult, right? We're
5025680	5036800	going to have to, but, but what we can do is talk about, I talked about there was this one huge master
5036880	5041760	Markovian kernel that we can never look at. We're going to have to look at just some of its states.
5041760	5048560	We can't look at all of them. And so you can take a big Markovian kernel and look at, at only
5048560	5054560	what happens on a few of its states and get a new Markovian kernel. So the whole Markovian kernel
5054560	5059600	is influencing what you see on the smaller states, right? It's influencing them. But what you're
5059600	5064320	doing is you, you're getting a kernel just on the small side of it. And that's called a trace
5064320	5070960	process. So you, when you take a big kernel, and you say what, what kernel does it induce on a subset
5070960	5076960	of states? That's called a tracing process. And so, so that's going to be like spatial sampling.
5076960	5082720	So we'll have temporal windows and spatial windows. And what we're going to be doing,
5082720	5088160	what we're proposing in the, in this proposal is those windows are what we're going to use to try
5088160	5096640	to model the, the momentum distributions of quarks and gluons inside the proton. So particle
5096640	5104320	scattering of experiments have looked at quarks and gluons inside the proton. A proton at one scale
5104320	5112080	has like three valence quarks, two up and one down. But when you go at smaller spatial resolution
5112080	5119920	and smaller temporal resolution, that dissolves. You see at the very finest resolution that they've
5119920	5128480	gotten so far, you see what they call a gluon sea or an ocean of gluons. So it's all these
5128480	5133200	massless particles just in there. And they're just roiling all over the place. And then when you back
5133200	5137840	off a little bit, you reduce the spatial and temporal, what they call the Bjork and X and Q
5137840	5143120	squirt and this are the technical terms they use Bjork and X is like the temporal window and the
5143120	5148800	Q squirt is like the spatial window. When you back off, then you get to the point where the gluons,
5149600	5154480	they say are splitting into quark, anti quark pairs. And then, and so you get this,
5155760	5160880	what they call a quark sea. And you get, so all this energy and momentum in, in these quarks.
5160880	5165840	And then when you back off, you, you still have all the gluons messed around and all these little
5166400	5171920	sea quarks, but then you get these three big valence quarks. So the proton is really a complicated
5172560	5180320	mess. And what we're going to try to do is show that as we go from really, really small windows
5181280	5192880	of time and larger windows of trace, we're getting closer to that gluon sea. And as we back,
5192880	5198720	as we trace on fewer and fewer states, so we're making the trace smaller, but we're making the,
5198720	5203600	and we're making the temporal window bigger, then we're getting closer to the valence quarks.
5204160	5211920	So what we're hoping to do is show for a particular class of master kernels that we can do
5212880	5218080	various trace chains and sampling windows and model all of the,
5218960	5224400	what, what they call the momentum distributions, one dimensional and then ultimately three
5224400	5229680	dimensional momentum distributions at the various Bjork and X and Q squared.
5229680	5233440	I was just going to ask you about that. What are one dimensional momentum fractions or
5233440	5241840	longitudinal momentum fractions? Yeah, apparently the current techniques that particle physicists
5242400	5249120	have allowed them to assess the momentum only in one dimension, not all three, but apparently
5249120	5256080	there are some new techniques that are coming online that will allow them to estimate in three
5256080	5262160	dimensions. And so what we'd like to do is even before they get all the three dimensional data,
5262160	5267760	if we could match the one dimensional data and predict the three dimensional data before they
5267760	5274880	get it, that would be really cool. We'll see. For sure. Okay. Number four, done. Do you want to
5274880	5280880	check it up on your own or should I pull that one up again? All right. This is a very interesting
5280880	5284240	conversation. I'm so glad we're talking about it because the paper makes so much sense listening
5284240	5290560	to you express yourself. Oh, good. Probably easier than just reading the paper. Yeah. I mean, for
5290560	5294880	the listeners and the viewers, whoever are too lazy to read the paper, I recommend they do, but
5294960	5300880	it is a lot better to have you chat about it. Yeah, it gives the intuitions that we didn't have
5300880	5307600	the space. This proposal, we had a specific word limit for each section. So we had to get the ideas
5307600	5312000	and we couldn't really say, here's where our intuitions, this is what we were thinking. I'm
5312000	5314720	able to do that here, but I couldn't do that in the proposal. I think that's a big function of
5314720	5319760	this podcast is to allow you the opportunity to do this. Absolutely. I appreciate that. Yeah.
5320480	5324960	So four says the projection perceived by a conscious agent is the discrete sampling of the
5324960	5330560	trace chain of a trace chain of a larger dynamics onto the states of that country. So we've really
5330560	5336720	gone into that. So I just said that there's going to be a trace chain. So number five is
5337920	5342000	the particles perceived by a conscious agent depend on a subset of states and the number
5342000	5347840	of steps in the window is trace. And that's the interesting thing. So most of us think,
5348160	5354000	you know, an electron is an electron. That's because it really is an electron and a proton
5354000	5359760	is a proton because it really is a proton and so forth. A quark is a quark. And this,
5360640	5365520	our whole approach here forces us to say, no,
5368080	5372640	there are no, in ultimate reality, there are no particles. There are no quarks,
5372640	5381040	leptons and so forth. Those are entirely artifacts of our user interface.
5383280	5388560	They're not insights into the nature of objective reality. They're statistical artifacts.
5389280	5396480	They're sampling artifacts. So for example, if I have a small temporal window,
5397120	5405760	suppose I'm only looking at two states and I only look at, say, three steps.
5407200	5411280	And what I find in those three steps, particularly that I see only three steps
5411280	5417760	in my little two state subset, and I noticed that in one step, state one went to state two.
5420080	5425200	And then in the next step, state two went to state one. And that's all I've got.
5426000	5432240	Well, then I can put a, my matrix would be like this, be 0, 1, 1, 0. That would be my matrix.
5433440	5437280	Now that might have been a projection of a matrix that have numbers that were not
5437280	5441680	ones and zeros in it. It might have had all sorts of weird numbers in it, right? There could have been,
5443760	5450080	but because it's an artifact, I only looked at a small number of steps. The matrix that I see
5450160	5458320	is 0, 1, 1, 0. I see a periodic matrix. In other words, I see in our language a massless particle.
5459360	5463280	But the mass is not because there's a deep massless particle. It's because that's an
5463280	5469920	artifact of my small sampling size. And what we're, what the intuition here is, why are the
5469920	5475920	physicists seeing all these massless particles when they make their temporal window so small
5476560	5484400	for the reason I just gave? When you're looking at lots of states and small window,
5484400	5487360	you're only going to have zeros and ones everywhere in your matrix. That's all you're
5487360	5495040	going to have. Those are massless. So that's why you get this gluon C. And why is it when you
5495040	5499440	start to increase the temporal window and reduce the number of states that you start to see mass?
5499440	5502400	Well, yeah, now you're starting to get things besides zeros and ones in your matrix. You're
5502400	5508560	starting to get massive particles. And that's the big idea about how, like a top level, we think
5508560	5515440	we're going to be able to get the momentum distributions for the massless, then going
5515440	5523200	to massive, and then finally the valence, the valence quarks. Now, an obvious for, you know,
5523200	5528000	the intelligent listener will go, I mean, it's one thing to say, what you just said is another
5528000	5534400	thing to get the exact momentum distributions. And I agree. To get the exact momentum distributions,
5534400	5537920	we're going to have to do more than just the hand wave that I just said. But the hand wave lets you
5537920	5543520	know that there is some reason to hope that we could get it. But to get it exactly, we're going
5543520	5550960	to have to have exactly the right class of master matrix. So what is the bigger Markovian matrix
5550960	5556000	that we're going to start with, that we're going to do all the sampling of traces and windows of
5556000	5563200	time. And so that's going to be for a computational experiment that we've proposed. And we're putting
5563200	5566960	together ideas about how to construct. It won't just be one master matrix, it'll be a whole
5566960	5572400	class of them that will have this property. But we have a lot of freedom, frankly, we'll be able
5572400	5579440	to play with this until we get a group of master matrices that do the job. So I don't see any
5579440	5588720	principal obstruction right now to us doing that. In fact, the argument might eventually go the other
5588720	5596560	way. Hoffman, you had so many ways to do it. What is this really telling us? And the answer, I think
5596560	5600400	will probably be, but we had so many ways that wouldn't do it as well. So this is very interesting
5600400	5607280	to ask. If there's this huge dynamics of conscious agents, what trivial aspect of it is being captured
5607280	5612640	by our space time? In other words, we think of space time as the be all and end all. And what we're
5612640	5621280	going to be saying is, no, no way. This is space time is one of an infinity of different user
5621280	5628400	interfaces, an infinity. And we have to let go of the constraint on our thinking and our creativity
5628400	5635920	and open up to the possibility that there's all these other interfaces. And so by showing that,
5636880	5640800	maybe we'll find that there's a whole class of matrices, an infinite class of matrices,
5640800	5644480	that will give us our space time. But we'll show that that infinite class of matrices has
5644480	5649520	measured zero in the set of bigger matrices. And that will sort of make the point that
5650480	5656240	space time is just a headset. And in my view, as I've said in a number of podcasts, I think
5657280	5662960	we got a cheap model. It's only three dimensions of space. I would like to be able to visualize
5662960	5669840	in 20 dimensions or 1000 dimensions. I can't. I feel really real stupid. I can imagine a
5669840	5674640	three dimensional geometric puzzle and I can see it. A four dimensional geometric puzzle
5674640	5679840	completely beyond me. 10 dimensional. Now it's like theorem and proof, theorem and proof to even
5679840	5684480	crawl your way up to figure out what's going on with the geometry of an object in 10 dimensions.
5684480	5690480	And we're doing that. I mean, Chaitan and I, our team, we're trying to study the space of all
5690480	5698240	possible Markov kernels, like the space of all 10 by 10 Markov kernels is a polytope. And it's the
5698240	5707360	Markov polytope of, you know, on 10 states. And it's, I've forgotten how many dimensions. I think
5707360	5714880	it, oh, it, yeah, well, it's an end to the, so it's a 10 to the 10th dimensional space. And it's
5715840	5719120	a, so it's, it's a 10.
5725840	5731120	Now I think it's, so it's n times n minus one is the, is the number of dimensions of the
5731120	5736400	polytope itself, but it's embedded in an end to the, oh, sorry, it's got,
5738240	5743200	this I'm making the point. I'm now trying to talk about the higher dimensional thing. And you can
5743280	5747440	see I'm, I'm, I'm struggling and so forth where as the three dimensions, I could just see it. You
5747440	5752080	could just see it. And here now it's there improved, there improved even talk about this stuff. And so,
5752080	5756640	so that's why I feel like we're cheated. And I, you know, I would love, you know,
5756640	5760720	once we take off this headset, I'd love to put on one that's, you know, that has a trillion dimensions.
5760720	5766240	And boy, that'll be, that'll be something. And, and why only three dimensions of color?
5766240	5771840	Why not a trillion dimensions of color? I mean, the Mantis shrimp seems to have more than 10
5771840	5777760	colors. The pigeons have four humans get stuck, most of us with only three.
5778320	5782080	Yeah. I can, you know, pigeons apparently seeing colors that I can't even imagine.
5782640	5788880	I just feel cheated. So I can't wait to, you know, well, I'll wait. I'm not here to die right away,
5788880	5790720	but you know,
5790720	5793920	Think about it. They can see ultraviolet to me birds in the ultraviolet. I mean,
5794640	5799440	snakes in the red with this, we saw the red logically just read some birds. I think you can
5799440	5805600	see polarization. We can't see polarization bats perceive an echolocation. What, what does that
5805600	5810880	like to perceive echolocation? I mean, they see a three quote unquote, see a 3d world with echolocation.
5810880	5814880	What's that like? There's a famous paper about what's it like to be a bat?
5815520	5819680	Thomas Nagel. Yeah, that's right. Exactly right.
5821040	5824000	No, no, let's move on to the basics then done six. Yeah.
5824960	5827920	So larger subsets of states and smaller windows of sampling
5829280	5833360	seem under stimulations to favor periodic perceptions, which we conjecture project a
5833360	5838240	massless particle. Yeah, that was exactly the point I was just making that with, you know, the
5838880	5842080	smaller temporal window with more states than your trace,
5842720	5846640	it's more likely that you'll get just zeros and ones in the in the kernel that you create.
5846640	5849840	And therefore it'll be a massless particle. So, so that was
5850240	5857840	Yeah, so we went through all six. Yeah. So if that's, I think first of all, that's
5857840	5861360	brilliant page in its own, but talk to me about the towards the end of the paper.
5861360	5864800	I think you talk about future experiments, the computational experiment that you proposed.
5866720	5871280	Right. Let's talk about that. What's what's what is the next step here all together?
5871280	5878400	Well, so the next step, I think is
5884720	5891040	we're going to need some bigger computers because these Markov chains, you know,
5891600	5900240	as you as the number of states grows as n grows, the number of entries in the Markov kernel
5900240	5908160	grows as n squared. It's going to continue to go. It's going to say it's huge.
5910640	5913120	So the next step is going is going to be
5916720	5923280	I think there's a few steps. And so I can use this as a recruiting time. We need
5924240	5930480	we need some geniuses to help us out. The pedestrian thing will be to
5932080	5936560	find and it's not pedestrian, but you know, relatively pedestrian to as I mentioned,
5936560	5946800	to find this class of master Markov chains and the set of subsets of states and windows,
5946800	5951280	temporal windows that will give us the momentum distributions that they're seen inside the core.
5952240	5959520	But now there's but and so but that's that's just the first that's what this proposal is about.
5959520	5963680	And that's the whole thing for this proposal. But that's obviously just the first baby step.
5963680	5968160	If we can't do that, then we're wrong. And but if we do that, that doesn't mean we've
5968160	5974000	we're done. It means we've taken our very first baby step. There's this huge world to explore now.
5974800	5976960	So I mean, a part of the exploration,
5979440	5987600	we really then want to understand in greater detail, this mapping from the Markovian dynamics,
5987600	5994560	like the Markov kernels, through decorative permutations into space time, that that really
5995200	5999520	right now that and the physicists are working really hard on that. I mean, among them are
5999520	6004400	Neymar Konihamed and his collaborators. And they have they were the ones who discovered the
6004400	6008560	decorative permutations, the amplitude hedron. But but they haven't stopped there, they're
6008560	6014080	looking, they're looking, they've got stuff on effective field theories and and what they call
6014080	6021280	the EFT hedron. And so there's, I think a lot of algebraic geometry, we need an algebraic
6021280	6027440	geometry, someone with a brilliant mind and a PhD in algebraic geometry to work with us.
6028160	6033200	And so if someone, if there's someone who's listening to this, and you have a PhD in algebraic
6033200	6041280	geometry, and you find this interesting, contact me, because we, we had one, we had a wonderful
6041840	6048160	friend, Bruce Bennett, and brilliant algebraic geometry. And he died, we've lost him, and we
6048160	6055120	need an algebraic geometry to, to help us here, because a lot of the stuff is the connections
6055120	6059360	we need to make require algebraic geometry. And that is an incredibly difficult branch of
6059360	6065440	mathematics. It's way above my pay grade, I mean, way above my pay grade. So we need,
6066000	6071920	we need people way above my pay grade here to work on this, but that will really nail down, right?
6072560	6077120	Our mapping between Markov kernels and decorative permutations and the algorithm, we, we mean,
6077120	6086400	that's an important link. But it's like the, the initial bridge, we need to build a multi-lane
6086400	6093920	highway, you know, to, to bridge the conscious agent domain into space time. So we really,
6093920	6098960	really need, now that we know that we think we have a connection, we need to have really smart
6098960	6103760	people working with us to help us, you know, where I, you know, I won't even be able to understand
6103760	6108880	what they say. It's algebraic geometry. It's really, really, but I will try. I will, I will
6108880	6114960	give it my, my level best. So there's, there's a ton of work in algebraic geometry to really nail down
6116880	6121360	exactly how the properties of the Markov dynamics map to properties like unitarity,
6122160	6128800	locality, and so forth inside space time. And really all the, all the complexities of, that the
6128800	6133920	physicists have found in quantum field theory, I mean, quantum field theory is incredibly complicated
6133920	6138000	kind of thing. There are all sorts of interesting, Casimir fact and all this, this interesting
6138000	6145440	stuff. Getting these momentum distributions inside the proton, we chose that now because it's the
6145440	6150480	most important, but because we think it's the, perhaps the easiest thing we could do immediately
6150480	6157040	to make people say, Oh, well, it's not obviously wrong. Okay. You know, they can do something.
6157280	6162320	It's small, but they can do something. Maybe then we can get, I mean, real smart people
6163120	6167520	way above my pay grade, who can then start to move in, who know their quantum field theory
6167520	6171280	and no algebraic geometry. And there are a bunch of other branches of mathematics that are going
6171280	6178880	to be. So, so in other words, if we, if we succeed beyond my wildest hopes in this, we will have only
6178880	6183920	taken a tiny baby step and we really need reinforcements from really smart people to, to move it forward.
6184400	6189840	Yeah. And a lot of, and mathematics is going to be the king here. Well, of course, we need
6189840	6193840	the theoretical physicists who know the current theoretical physics, because we, that's what
6193840	6199280	we have to project to you as the limiting case. But for my money, it's going to be the mathematical
6199280	6205680	physicists who are going to really be able to bring this thing home. I think, well, to just
6205680	6209440	summarize this last part of the paper, when you said the computational experiment proposed here
6209440	6214640	explores how the strong force, which dominates inside protons, may arise from a dynamics of
6214640	6219760	conscious agents. Future computational experiments will explore gravity, the weak force, the
6219760	6224640	electromagnetic force, dark matter, and cosmology from the Big Bang to the entropic death of the
6224640	6229600	universe. I mean, there's so many areas here you're going to explore. Which ones are you most excited
6229600	6235360	about? Well, I feel like a kid in a candy store. I want to know them all. I want to explore them
6235360	6246320	all. But each one will require a team of geniuses to do it. But I'll just give you one.
6248800	6250480	Here's one that's really interesting to me.
6254080	6257120	Our dynamics of conscious agents, this Markovian dynamics,
6257360	6266880	need not have an arrow of time. So it's a dynamical system, but it need not have an
6266880	6272480	arrow of time. By that, I mean, you could write down a Markovian dynamics in which the entropy
6273360	6281840	doesn't increase. There's no second law of thermodynamics in it. But it's a theorem that
6281840	6287840	if you take such a dynamics and you project it by conditional probability, so I've got this big
6287840	6292800	dynamics, it has no arrow of time, but I'm going to project it in a way that loses a little bit
6292800	6297680	of information. But I've got a projected dynamics. So I've got a new Markovian dynamics.
6298880	6305040	But it's slightly simpler than the bigger one because it's a projection. The new dynamics will
6305040	6311200	have an arrow of time because it lost information. So the projection will have increasing entropy.
6312800	6322160	Now, that's very suggestive to me that, once again, here we are in a world that we think
6322160	6326720	is ruled by the second law of thermodynamics. It started with the Big Bang, it's going to end
6326720	6335120	maybe in an entropic death or some big crunch, who knows. But it's got a finite shelf life
6336080	6344320	on this universe and things are running down. And that's a fundamental principle in physics.
6344320	6350960	It's also the fundamental thing in evolution of a natural selection, where the fundamental limited
6350960	6361520	resource that we're competing against is time. If I don't get food in time, I die. If I don't mate
6361520	6368000	in time, the species doesn't survive. So time is the fundamental limited resource.
6368640	6377520	And so this fact suggests to me that, of course, we expect it to get space and time as artifacts of
6377520	6383840	the projection. So space and time are not fundamental. They're not fundamental to the
6383840	6390640	deeper reality. They're only properties of this projection. Well, here's how time is an artifact.
6390960	6396000	It's a theorem. You can have no entropic arrow of time, but when you take a projection, you will
6396000	6403120	necessarily have. So it's an artifact. Our arrow of time is not an insight into reality. Time is
6403120	6409600	not fundamental. That notion of time is not fundamental. It's entirely artifactual. And that
6409600	6415600	means I've done a lot of work in evolution of a natural selection and I'm very interested in
6415600	6421280	evolutionary game theory. And I think evolution is absolutely the best and cleanest scientific
6421280	6426720	model we have to explain biological evolution and so forth. So I love that theory. But this is
6426720	6432720	saying that that is a theory inside our space-time interface. It's wonderful theory inside our
6432720	6442240	space-time interface. It does not generalize beyond. We could imagine that... So I'll say
6442320	6447360	inside space and time, we have organisms competing for limited resources
6449280	6455040	and going extinct and so forth. We have an arrow of time. But that could be a projection
6455040	6460160	of a Markovian dynamics where there is no competition, there are no limited resources,
6460160	6465680	and there is no arrow of time. And so what ultimately... Another thing I'd love to do
6465680	6472320	is to show exactly how evolution of a natural selection arises
6474160	6480320	as the projection of a dynamics where there is no competition and no limited resources.
6480320	6486400	And see, that's what we really want. When we transcend a previous scientific theory,
6487120	6494320	we don't disrespect it. Quite the opposite. We respect Newton. What a genius. I mean,
6494320	6503520	hats off to Newton. He was brilliant, but it's limited. Einstein is better. But space-time itself
6503520	6509040	is doomed and so we're going to transcend space-time. But we're going to, again, hats off to Einstein,
6509040	6514800	to quantum field theory, and to evolution of a natural selection. Whatever new theory we propose
6514800	6520320	beyond space-time has to project into space-time and give us back those theories. That's going to
6520320	6526960	be the discipline that our new theory has to satisfy before we are willing to saddle up on
6526960	6532880	that pony and take it where it's going to go. If that doesn't give us back Einstein and Darwin
6533600	6538320	and quantum field theory and so forth in space-time, then that's not the horse we need to ride.
6538320	6544720	That's the wrong horse. So these theories are still doing incredible work for us. So you can see
6544720	6550080	the attitude is not, oh, we're right and they're wrong and those stupid, no, no, no, no, no. That
6550080	6557840	was brilliant work. And every scientific theory is just the next baby step, mine included.
6560560	6566800	Century from now, hopefully much, much sooner, if this holds up, it'll be viewed as just a next
6566800	6574320	baby step. And we know the next generation will know far deeper and will understand what I've
6574320	6579680	done, what we've done, is just a special case of something far more general. And that's just
6579680	6586640	the nature of science. There is no theory of everything in principle. There can be no theory
6586640	6593760	of everything because every scientific theory starts with assumptions. We need to tell Kurt that.
6595600	6600320	Is there John Mungle? There's no theory of everything. Oh, right, right, right. He has
6600400	6607200	theory of everything. Well, and I think most scientists who talk about a theory of everything
6607200	6614240	is with a wink and a nod because I think they understand that, and I think Kurt as well.
6615840	6618480	I think he understands that. I think it goes with this podcast as well, when you think about it,
6618480	6621680	because I called it mind body solution, paying homage to the mind body problem,
6621680	6626560	but I don't really think we're going to find the solution. It's more of a, it's just in the
6626560	6635840	name. Yeah, that's right. The hunt. Yes, it's more of a hunt. But in principle, we can never get
6635840	6639600	a final theory of everything because every theory has to have assumptions, and those are the things
6639600	6643280	that you don't assume. I'm sorry that you don't explain. You assume them, but you don't explain
6643280	6649680	them. So that means we'll never get the final explanation. Although we may be ourselves the
6649680	6655280	final explanation. There are theories in which you are what you're looking for, but you'll never
6655280	6660080	be able to write it down. So you are it, but you can't write it down because you transcend anything
6660080	6666480	that you can write down. But this is infinite job security for science, and I love that.
6666480	6671760	Not that as well. I mean, your goal is to give the scientific community a reason to take seriously
6671760	6676400	the idea that consciousness is fundamental, that consciousness can be modeled with precise
6676400	6681840	mathematics and make precise experimental predictions, and that the dynamics of consciousness
6681840	6689440	gives rise to space time physics by projection. And when you think about this whole journey
6689440	6693040	and everything you've done regarding this paper specifically, what has been the most
6693600	6696800	fascinating aspect of it all, and just the coolest part of it all for you?
6699120	6707520	For me, it blew me away. A couple of things blew me away just in the last year. A year ago, we
6707520	6713360	didn't have this mapping from Markov chains to the decorated permutations. And when we could do that,
6714320	6721600	a light went on in me, I go, oh, wow, this is real. This is a real potential here. And then
6722240	6727840	when we said, okay, well, that's cool, but you need to get mass, spin and energy momentum,
6727840	6733520	and you've got to get those from kernels. Good luck. And when they started cracking,
6733520	6742400	when we started getting what we just described today, and then we got that hyperfine structure
6743280	6751280	prediction, that really, that was when I began to start to believe that this might be the next
6751280	6761200	baby step. This might actually be, I couldn't believe it seemed too good to be true. So what
6761200	6770160	we'll see, maybe it is too good to be true. But what I would say is this, the thing you
6770160	6776000	read at the end about trying to make precise predictions and so forth, that's what makes
6776000	6786000	what we're doing here different from panpsychist approaches. And again, these are my good friends
6786000	6792800	and so forth. So there's nothing personal here at all. But panpsychism means a lot of things. So
6792800	6797360	I'll say the version of panpsychism that I'm thinking about here is a version in which we take
6798000	6805600	space time as fundamental, we take quantum field theory as given, and the particles of the standard
6805600	6813440	model is given, the leptons, bows on the corks. And what we do is we say consciousness is the fire
6813440	6819920	behind those equations. Each particle has, you know, an electron has some conscious experience,
6819920	6823920	a gluon has some conscious, and the different colors of gluons have different conscious
6823920	6835760	experiences and so forth. And my attitude about that is there's no progress. We're not explaining
6835760	6842080	consciousness. We're, it's panpsychism, but that version that I just talked about,
6842160	6846720	panpsychism is really a dualism. Physics stuff is real. In addition, there's consciousness
6846720	6853760	behind it. And there's no principle. Why should the, what experience, what specific experience
6854560	6860160	should the electron have? And how does that differ from the electron neutrino and the tau neutrino
6860160	6865760	and the tau and the mua? What are the specific experiences that are attached to each one and why?
6866320	6875600	No one's trying that. Good luck. So to just say that there are experiences, from my point of view
6875600	6884560	as a scientist, nothing's been accomplished. Nothing has been accomplished. It's a dualism,
6884560	6892320	the version I just said. What we're trying to do in contrast is say, okay, we're not assuming the
6892320	6898160	standard model in space-time is fundamental. They're not part of our assumptions. We have to
6898160	6905440	derive them. All of it. We're assuming consciousness, conscious experiences is fundamental. And we're
6905440	6910080	going to have to project into space-time and give and explain all that. And that seems, I mean,
6910640	6914800	we haven't done it yet. So, you know, I'm not congratulating myself, but I'm saying that that,
6915520	6920960	at least that attempt, that direction of attempt is very different from saying, well, electrons
6920960	6928960	have experiences and tau and mua have experiences and quarks and glues. As a scientist, I find that
6928960	6934080	exceedingly unsatisfying. I don't see where it's going to go in terms of giving me new mathematics
6934080	6940640	that can actually do something, make predictions and eventually make new technology. If this approach
6940640	6947760	we're talking about works, if we can actually talk about the dynamics of conscious agents outside
6947760	6958800	space-time, and we understand what particles are and what mass is, we understand how space-time is
6958800	6966640	constructed as an interface, then think about what you can do. If you're playing Grand Theft Auto,
6966640	6972720	you're a user, you might be a super user, and you're able to drive your car and out and outrun
6972720	6979200	everybody. That's fantastic. That's a great skill. But if you know the code, if you understand
6979200	6984400	Grand Theft Auto is just a piece of software, and you wrote the code or you know how it's written,
6985520	6994240	then you can do stuff that's completely miraculous to the guy who's the expert inside Grand Theft.
6994240	6999200	You can take all the gas out of his tank. You can change, you can give him flat tires.
6999840	7005200	You can take away a steering wheel, or you could change the geometry of the road he's driving.
7006400	7014160	Or you can get him from A to B without going through the space. You could appear anywhere
7014160	7025120	you want to in space. If it's really possible for us to show how space-time is just a headset,
7026080	7030400	and we know the software of conscious agents that creates that headset,
7032160	7035760	and it turns out we can tinker with that software. There's a question of whether we
7035760	7045600	can tinker with it, but if we can tinker with it, then the Andromeda Galaxy is something like 2.4
7045600	7049920	million light years away. Going through space-time, we're not going to get there anytime soon.
7050640	7054880	But what if we don't have to go through space-time? What if we can just go around space-time?
7054960	7061600	And just be there. The technologies that this might open up are completely mind-blowing.
7063440	7067680	Again, I'm saying that it's guaranteed, but I can guarantee you that the pan-psychist version
7067680	7071920	thing that I said will never get there. There's nothing that even has a hope. This at least
7071920	7077120	has a hope. We'll see if the hope is dashed, but at least it's a direction where it might happen.
7077760	7081520	We'll see. I mean, if it does, it's absolutely crazy. I'm pretty sure someone who's listening to
7081520	7085280	this last portion of the podcast, if they just decided to listen to it, they think we're talking
7085280	7090880	about some crazy things. I mean, it's highly plausible. When you take everything into account,
7090880	7096560	it makes sense. That could possibly be the future. That's right. But to someone who believes in
7096560	7102880	flat earth, around earth, is a crazy thing. Yeah. Done. I mean, this is the last time we
7102880	7107520	did this thing where I told you last minute objections, anything you think you're going to
7107520	7114640	get any sort of feedback on perhaps counter-arguments. This is a chance for you to just express
7114640	7118640	certain views and anything about this paper that you find you didn't speak about yet that you want
7118640	7129360	to just clarify or mention. Just one thing that I'll point out. These are objections that I get
7129360	7136960	all the time in emails from people. They'll say also, it's two things. Hoffman, of course,
7138080	7144080	you say that what we see is not the truth. It's our construction. Well, what if a car hits you
7144080	7149200	from behind? You didn't see it coming, but it still killed you. There you go. It's all over.
7149920	7159360	You know, the car really does exist. That's simply just not a counter example. I mean,
7161520	7167920	if you're again in Grand Theft Auto and you're driving and there's a, well,
7168560	7172160	if you look behind you and you see that the red Porsche is about to come up and crash you from
7172160	7176960	behind, right? Well, if you don't look, you're not going to see that red Porsche and you're not
7176960	7181840	going to render it. So there's no red Porsche, right? In the supercomputer, there is no red Porsche.
7181840	7186160	Does that mean that you're not going to get hit from behind anyway and have damaged?
7186160	7189920	No, you're still going to get hit, but there was no red Porsche. There's some reality,
7190880	7197600	namely the supercomputer and the software that's going to enforce. But the reality is not what
7197600	7205280	you see in your headset. So for that whole class of arguments, well, Hoffman, why don't you step
7205280	7212400	off a cliff? It will kill you even if you don't think it's real. All those, just my response for
7212400	7216800	people with those objections. If you just think about putting on a headset and being in a virtual
7216800	7222160	reality game, just run your question, the same thing that you think is an objection to what I'm
7222160	7225680	saying, just run it in virtual reality and see if it still flies there. When you think about
7225680	7231520	in virtual reality, you'll realize, oh, wow, it would happen even if I didn't render it. But the
7232240	7236880	rendered thing doesn't exist. The Porsche doesn't exist. The cliff doesn't exist until I render it.
7237920	7245520	But the software is not the Porsche or the cliff. The software is something utterly outside the
7245520	7250400	headset. And that is a reality. So I'm not denying reality. I'm just denying that spacetime is the
7250400	7257680	reality. That's one objection. The other objection, and hopefully that will save a lot of thousands
7257680	7262560	of people having to write me emails saying, here's an obvious objection to what you're saying.
7262560	7266400	The funny thing about that is, is that you obviously claim that consciousness is fundamental,
7266400	7270320	but then you've got people like that, Dennett and Frank, who also get told the same can't argue.
7270320	7275280	I mean, if consciousness doesn't exist, I get knocked by a bus. Did it really happen?
7275280	7284160	That's exactly right. Because I'm unconscious. And by the way, they're both wonderful men.
7284160	7290640	I mean, even though we disagree, I mean, they're great, then they're bright. And I'm glad to have
7290640	7299120	people that bright that disagree. The other objection that I just raised real quick is
7301280	7307840	the objection that, when I say that evolution by natural, and I didn't go into that too much
7307840	7314720	today, but when I say that evolution by natural selection, we use evolutionary game theory to
7314720	7319920	show that we evolved not to see the truth, that natural selection would not shape us to see the
7319920	7329200	truth. There are a lot of people, including some professional philosophers who have come back
7329200	7336160	and said, that is self contradictory. And the contradiction is this. So evolution by natural
7336160	7342960	selection Darwin's idea is that there are physical objects called organisms competing
7342960	7351440	in space and time for physical resources like food and eggs. And now evolutionary game theory
7351440	7358720	is a mathematical statement that's supposed to capture Darwin's idea. Now either evolutionary
7358800	7364400	game theory succeeded, and it faithfully represents Darwin's ideas, or it didn't.
7366720	7372800	If it didn't, then you can't use evolutionary game theory to show that organisms and spacetime
7372800	7380400	are doomed. And if it did, if evolutionary game theory does successfully capture Darwin's ideas,
7380400	7387280	then you couldn't possibly use it to show that he was wrong. So there's no way that you can do what
7387280	7392720	you're doing without shooting yourself on the foot, logically, either way. So as one philosopher
7392720	7399920	put it, Hoffman is in an unfortunate dialectical situation. So I'm in an unfortunate dialectical
7399920	7408720	situation. And my response is, no, I'm in the normal situation of how science progresses from one
7408720	7416000	theory to the next. The way science progresses is you take your ideas, like Einstein's idea,
7417280	7420640	that spacetime is fundamental and the speed of light is universal.
7422640	7428720	And that if you're an elevator and you're following, you'll be messless. You would weigh
7428720	7436000	nothing. Those are his intuitions. He labors and labors and labors for general activity for many,
7436000	7445840	many years. And sleepless nights, deep, deep struggle. In 1915, he puts down his field equations.
7448000	7456000	Now, when you use Einstein's field equations, and also his 1905 paper where he uses
7456000	7460400	Planck's constant to essentially introduce quantum theory, although I didn't like it,
7460400	7466880	he introduces quantum theory. When you bring in quantum field theory, which is based on spacetime,
7466880	7472480	and you bring in Einstein's therapy, which I'll assume spacetime is fundamental.
7473440	7480080	When you look at the mathematics, the mathematics tells you that spacetime has no operational
7480080	7486000	meaning beyond the Planck's scale, 10 to the minus 30 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43 seconds. In
7486000	7493200	other words, Einstein's theory that was capturing his intuitions about spacetime comes back and tells
7493200	7503520	us that spacetime itself cannot be fundamental. So, Einstein is now in this very unfortunate
7503520	7509840	dialectical situation. Either these mathematically precise theories captured Einstein's intuitions,
7509840	7513840	or they did not. If they did not, then they couldn't possibly show that spacetime was not
7513840	7518880	fundamental. And if they did capture his intuitions, then they wouldn't contradict him.
7519600	7526800	That's the mistake. They wouldn't contradict him. Every scientific theory has premises.
7531680	7536560	It has a limited scope. Every scientific theory has limited scope. When you write down the mathematics,
7537120	7542160	what you hope is your mathematics is precise enough to find what is the limited scope of
7542160	7549120	your assumptions. How far do your assumptions go and where do they stop? Because a scientific
7549120	7559360	theory is not a theory of everything. It has a limited range. So, what the power of science is,
7559360	7566160	is we make our mathematics, our assumptions precise, not so that our assumptions can never be disproved,
7566720	7572560	but so that we can find their limits and say, spacetime is great until you get to 10 to the
7572560	7580320	minus 33 centimeters and then goodbye. And so, that's the way science progresses,
7580960	7586720	is by one set of equations capturing one set of intuitions and showing you their limits,
7587440	7596720	and then being the past bed for your next set of ideas, because now you have to take a leap.
7598160	7602480	And this is the fun of science. Well, part of the fun. I mean, the mathematics is fun, too,
7602480	7607680	if you're a mathematician. It's hard for me. I can see how it could be fun, but it's just hard for
7607680	7615120	me. But the fun is now you have to take a creative leap to get a new framework and then
7615360	7620720	project it back into the old framework and make sure you get that old framework or generalization
7620720	7625920	of that old framework. The old framework can't tell you what leap to take,
7627280	7632800	but it can tell you if the leap was wrong, because if it doesn't project back to, so,
7632800	7639200	so that's how science progresses. It's not that if our mathematical theories capture our intuitions,
7639200	7645760	they could never prove us wrong. It's that mathematical theories that capture our intuitions
7645760	7653040	better show us the limits of those assumptions, or they're not terribly useful,
7654320	7659280	because we know we don't, we know we don't have the final theory. We know that.
7660640	7666640	The only question is, are our equations smart enough to help us to see the limits of our current
7666960	7671760	theory, or not? If not, then our mathematics hasn't gone far enough. We need to get a deeper
7671760	7680880	mathematics to find the limits of our current. So that's, at some point, I have to write a paper
7680880	7687760	to respond to, because this has been published in philosophy journals and so forth, and so I'll
7687760	7694720	need, but there's a finite amount of time, and I think addressing it here is easy. It takes me
7694720	7699120	10 minutes to address it. Writing the paper would take me months, and I'm not sure at this point
7699120	7704400	in my life I want to spend months doing that when I have some other more fun stuff to do. So I may,
7705040	7709840	who knows, I may never respond in writing. This may be the only thing I do. We'll see.
7710400	7714240	I think, look, ideally, you're doing a great job at the moment. I mean, I've watched many of your
7714240	7720560	podcasts. You do such a fantastic job at, there's certain repetitive answers that you've got
7721120	7725600	that work perfectly. So when I watch some of your interviews, I'll enjoy that some of your
7725600	7730800	answers are well rehearsed in the sense that you know exactly what's been working and what isn't.
7732240	7737120	That's right. This can be very complicated, so it's helpful to cut through it all and try to get
7737120	7740160	to the clean intuition, because otherwise it can be very murky.
7741360	7746400	Don, before we end, this paper specifically, I mean, let's just summarize it. The fact is that
7747360	7752560	subatomic particles created from consciousness. That's pretty much what we're talking about.
7752560	7756800	That's the proposal. I wouldn't say the fact, but I would say that that's the proposal.
7756800	7760720	Anything about this paper that you want to talk about in detail specifically that you feel we
7760720	7768480	haven't touched on that you want to address? Not today, except to say that it should be posted
7768480	7775280	pretty soon. Within a week and a half, it should be posted online. I'll send, I can send you a link
7775280	7779120	to when the Institute of Atlantic Sciences posts the link, but it's going to be
7780800	7789360	Saturday, June 24th at 11 o'clock, a Pacific time, that there's going to be a live Zoom where
7790000	7796160	all the three groups that got awarded this prize will be discussing their proposals.
7796160	7799600	So I recommend it. It's free. People can log on.
7801120	7804880	I'm excited for that. Thank you, Don. It's once again a pleasure.
7804880	7808480	It's always been a pleasure to have been following you. Thank you so much, Devin. I
7808480	7813040	really appreciate it. You asked great questions. Thank you so much. I mean, I can't wait to
7813040	7816800	continue to watch this journey and hopefully continue to interact about it. Every paper that
7816800	7823040	comes out, you can expect an email from me. I'll be happy to alert you to the papers too.
7824080	7828240	It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much, Don. Good luck. I cannot wait for this paper to be
7828240	7831840	published. I'm looking forward to it. I think the viewers are in for a treat for this one.
7831840	7842800	It's pretty epic work. Thank you so much.
