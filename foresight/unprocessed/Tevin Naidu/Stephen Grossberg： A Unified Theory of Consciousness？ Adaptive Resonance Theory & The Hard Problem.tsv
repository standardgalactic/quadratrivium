0	15920	The main focus, I'll put links to the 2017 paper on the hard problem of consciousness,
15920	19400	but for the most part, that would be nice. Yeah. Yeah. I put a direct link to that in
19400	23800	the paper because I mean, in the video, because I think people should read this. It's very
23800	28940	long, very, very in depth. And I like that. I mean, that's when someone has a lot to say
28940	33540	about something so complicated. I think you can't really summarize it. It's something
33540	38260	that does require that level of detail. So to all those who are going to read this paper,
38260	43180	just bear that in mind. It probably takes repeat readings for most people to really
43180	47960	understand and grasp most of the concepts, but you do a great job at putting the imagery.
47960	55760	And I mean, it's a wonderful paper overall. Well, thank you. Two things come to mind.
55760	65240	One is that it's a long paper, but it compresses a huge amount of knowledge. So if you can
65240	72120	get through that, you've saved an enormous amount of time. And that's one thing that
72120	84000	my students always came to realize. It was a way that they could get an entree into so
84080	93800	much psychological, neurobiological knowledge and start organizing it for themselves. Whereas,
93800	102600	if all you did was you gave them 200 articles, which may be explained or an explanation often
102600	109600	in this one article of mine, they wouldn't know where to begin. And they wouldn't, they
109600	116640	would have to build up a model in their mind. And that's what I'm giving them. Not to say
116640	124840	it's the final model, but it's been validated, each of the models in multiple ways. And it
124840	131920	gives them a way to start organizing all this information. Because ultimately, the model,
131920	138440	as a thing in itself, isn't what we're interested in. We're interested in understanding what the
138440	148080	hell is going on. And if models help us to create stories about what's going on in those
148080	155080	stories, make sense and help us to clarify what we're learning, well, that's what they're for.
155080	161880	So I was going to say something else, but split my mind. I should write notes.
162840	170280	Now anyway, the huge chunk of this conversation will be about the heart problem of consciousness
170280	174920	in your paper on that topic. And I think the best place for us to start, I've got a list of
174920	181080	questions from from the general fans, audience listeners and viewers. And I'll just go through
181080	184680	those later on in the conversation. But at the beginning, I think let's start with,
185320	190600	what is the heart problem to you? And if you could tell me your philosophical history of the heart
190600	198760	problem and your perception of it, what would that story be? Well, I don't have my 2017 paper in
198760	205880	front of me, but it was David Chalmers who described what he considered the heart problem.
206840	211160	And my comment about it was the following.
219720	229400	Let's go back to the orbits of the planets. If we can predict the orbits of the planets
229480	237240	with great precision, we don't have to necessarily visit them. We don't have to touch
237240	248760	easily them. It's a description that's predictively effective. And so my comment at the beginning
248760	254680	of my magnum opus, and I think I made a very similar comment in my 2017 paper is,
255640	265080	let's say you have a neural network model, which describes identified brain cells and
266680	276040	identified regions of the brain interacting in a way that's validated by neurobiological data,
276040	284920	anatomical and physiological, in some cases, biochemical. And let's say the emergent properties
284920	293560	map quantitatively onto lots of behaviors that interest you, including parametric properties
293560	304200	of conscious experiences like seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing things. That's all equations
304200	319880	can do for you. And if you expect an equation to see color or to hear musical tone, that will
319880	327800	never happen. And it doesn't happen in mind brain science, but it doesn't happen in physics or
327800	336680	chemistry. And people have come to understand that if you get predictive insight based on
336680	349160	harmonious laws that make things seem clear, that's enough. To think you would get more,
349160	357240	which is implicit in the definition of the hard problem, is asking for something that equations
357880	364520	can never give you in any science and only look to sciences that are better developed to realize
365080	370120	you don't really need it to feel quite satisfied that you've understood something.
371480	382360	So that's my response. It's sufficient. Of course, it is a mystery. And as I point out, let's say
383080	390520	right down to the photons. And for example, Gail Carpenter and I, among other colleagues,
391320	403800	did very detailed models of the transduction of color signals in vertebrate cones.
404680	413880	And we were able to quantitatively simulate very hard data using designs that you could see had
413880	425080	been using many other parts of our brains. But the model doesn't see color. It just describes how we
425080	436200	see color. And there is that explanatory gap. And I, for one, don't see how equations can ever
437320	443560	bridge the gap, but we don't need equations to do it because we have our conscious minds.
444520	455000	So one of your quotes in the paper was, as in quantum theory,
455000	460520	there are measurement limitations in understanding our brains. We can no more personally ride an
460520	465240	electron than we can enter a neuron that is participating in a conscious experience.
465800	468280	That's pretty much along the lines of what you're trying to say.
469240	474760	Yeah, it is what I'm trying to say. And of course, there are superb
474760	485160	nurses now who do enter neurons. In fact, a colleague or a miller at MIT might put an array of
485160	491480	a hundred or more electrodes in three different parts of the brain and do experiments with the
491480	499240	way behaving monkeys to try to correlate what the monkeys are seeing and doing with the recordings.
499960	510840	And it's very insightful. And if you have a strong enough theory to explain what these patterns
510840	519800	mean for emergent properties to link brain to mind, to link brain to the perception of the action,
520200	525880	but that is extremely useful. But in itself, without a theory,
529080	537320	it's not satisfying enough. You need more. You know, where's the spice?
541000	547560	Yeah, so what are your thoughts on Thomas Nagels? What is it like that that specific component
547560	551800	of consciousness, what is it like? And the fact that we'll never really be able to say what it's
551800	561400	like to be a bad slow... Well, to the extent to which what it's like is that having an equation
562680	570120	that is the qualia, you can't do that. That's what I just said. But there are cases already,
570120	577800	many cases, where we've developed models, principled models that you can understand are using
577800	589000	principles that are parsimoniously used in many processes that can tell you a lot about
590440	596920	different percepts. And where the end, like what's the difference between vision and auditions, say?
597720	607400	Well, even though the circuits, even though the equations, I mean the local neuronal processes
607400	614760	and the modules, as I talked about last time, a certain number of conserved microcircuits that
614760	623080	are used for many things, may be shared in vision and auditions, if you look at how they're specialized
623880	633240	in order to be sensitive to environmental invariance of those signals in the world,
633800	641400	photons and phonons, and how they're organized by sound sources. Then you can begin to understand,
641400	650120	wow, this is really fascinating, because here is a universal computational substrate that can be
650200	656760	specialized to resonate with the invariance of different environmental experiences.
657800	668360	And that is the power of how evolution has crafted our brains in order to be able to do that.
669080	677160	And we know that there are a variety of species that are resonating on things that
678120	689800	we can't do, like consider honey bees or consider the vision of birds. Certain birds
690680	695480	from hundreds of feet in the air can detect the movement of a fish under the water and
695480	704600	dive straight down to it, but we can't do that. But that doesn't mean that their neurons, their
704600	713160	fundamental components are something totally unfamiliar. That's not true. And that's why,
713160	725640	for quite a while, people studied invertebrate circuitries like crayfish, swimmerettes, etc., etc.
726600	735720	And one of my colleagues many years ago, Al Silverstein out in California, I hope he's still
735720	749480	alive, a wonderful scientist. He had, I guess, studied the stomatogastric ganglion of, I think
749560	757800	it was the lobster, and he had characterized, on multiple levels of physiology, anatomy,
757800	763160	all the parts. And when it was all in said and done, he still didn't know how it worked.
764040	768360	And he said that. And that was because it's an emergent property of all those parts,
768360	776520	interacting in a highly nonlinear feedback manner. And I'll acknowledge that he did what you could do
777480	786600	with brilliant experiments. And then you need a level of description, notably a sufficiently
786600	793400	powerful model, that can show how those components interact to generate the emergent properties
793400	800600	that are the adaptive behavior of the stomatogastric ganglion, or whatever else
801160	810200	we're considering. So it's that speculative leap we talked about a little last time,
811240	818200	you know, how you discover that it's not, we don't have an algorithm for it. In fact,
819240	825560	my colleague Rudy Kalman, I don't know if you studied the Kalman filter, which is used in
826360	833320	many problems in prediction and engineering. And he was trying to characterize,
836680	845800	in a very rigorous way, linear controllers. But at least at the time, he said, when he got the
845800	852440	multi-linear controllers, he couldn't even do that. You know, the methods he had just weren't
852440	860120	powerful enough. So the miracle is that somehow the methods that I've been lucky enough to discover
860680	871080	have not hit that brick wall yet. And lots of other people use them in one form or another,
871080	876360	including in technology. And as I may have mentioned last time, one of the reasons why
877080	883640	Gail Carpenter and I, and a number of our PhD students and post-docs, were eager to
885480	894840	specialize our model discoveries into applications in engineering technology and AI
896200	905400	was to show they work in the real world. And, you know, one way you can show they work in a way
906840	914200	that people who don't really care at all about mind and brain is by doing a technological
914200	919080	application that they do care about and frankly can make a lot of money for them.
922440	931480	Yeah. Steve, the approach that the science of the brain and the approach of philosophy of mind
931480	937320	are very different. As a scientist fundamentally involved in this interface of mind and body,
938440	943640	what are your thoughts on philosophy as a whole regarding their approach to this topic or
943640	950040	philosophy's engagement in this field? Because definitions play a big role and there's often
950040	957640	arguments. I mean, within philosophy, even merely starting with the brain as the source of consciousness
957640	962200	seems to be problematic for many philosophers. You have philosophers who claim that consciousness
962200	967880	is fundamental to reality. You have others that claim that consciousness is a fundamental feature
967880	973320	of reality, so panpsychism, which integrated information theory is pretty much a form of
973320	980200	that. Are you able as a scientist to even have a conversation with those people with such
981160	984360	different views from your own? Well,
989080	995640	I always ask, what can you explain with your concepts? And by explain, I mean facts, data.
997560	1002440	If you can't explain anything, then you're not even in the ballpark yet.
1002440	1017560	Now, one of the things that's fascinated me personally is, I don't know if you looked at
1018440	1026440	a later chapter in my book, it's about really simple evolutionary precursors of
1026840	1034200	brains. I talk about a universal developmental code and show how
1037480	1046200	mathematical laws and primitive circuits that are controlling the development of
1046200	1055720	non-neural single cell or multicellular organisms have many of the
1058200	1065960	features that the laws have that I might use to explain mammalian and human data.
1066920	1074840	You know, I talked about hydra's heads and slime old aggregation and stuff like that.
1075960	1084120	And to me, it wasn't an accident that I published an article in 1978
1085720	1092840	called Communication Memory and Development, where I described these things theoretically.
1093640	1103320	And in the same year, I published, you know, an early magnum opus called the theory of human memory,
1103320	1110680	colon and then more stuff about what was in it. In fact, together they were book length and I
1110680	1117480	originally planned to publish it as a book, but I was young and foolish. I didn't know what I was
1117480	1126840	doing. And so, Robert Rosen, Bob Rosen, who was a very sweet and, you know, significant
1128360	1135640	mathematical biologist, also was an editor of a book series called Progress in Theoretical
1135640	1144360	Biology and he was eager to publish the two articles as articles, but by putting it in
1144360	1150600	something called Progress in Theoretical Biology, it buried it from the viewpoint of marketing. So
1150600	1157480	that was one of many naive things I've done in my life that I could kick myself for, but
1158200	1165400	I'm just a naive guy, basically. And I welcome it because having a naive approach to stuff
1166280	1172520	really helps you to be creative. You don't come in with, you know, too many preconceived ideas.
1173000	1180360	There's a cost for it and so far the cost has been worth it. But I should have published a major
1180360	1193640	book in 78 on mind and brain. As it is, I wised up a little and by 82, I published a book that
1193640	1201560	brought together my articles, but, you know, and that I think a lot of people were influenced by.
1202680	1207800	It was called Studies of Mind and Brain. I think it's still in print in some form.
1210360	1217800	Anyway, so you have people like Edelman and Tanoni. I order information theories and
1218520	1223080	integrated information theory. At some point, this is quite a lengthy quote, so bear with me.
1223080	1228600	This is your words. I mean, they used the word information as a critical component of their
1228600	1233800	hypothesis. But what is information? The scientific concept of information in the
1233800	1239560	mathematical sense of information theory by Shannon requires that a set of states exist
1239560	1245240	whose information can be computed and that fixed probabilities exist for transitions between these
1245240	1251640	states. In contrast, the brain is a self-organizing system that continually creates new states
1251640	1255960	through development and learning and whose probability structure is continually changing
1256040	1262040	along with them. Without a theory that explains how these states arise and how their transition
1262040	1266920	probabilities may change through time in response to changing environmental statistics and internal
1266920	1273400	representations thereof, the classical concept of information is useless. You want to unpack that a
1273400	1280200	bit for us. Well, I think you just did. I mean, I'm not sure what else. I mean,
1284920	1294360	yeah, well, Jerry Edelman was a very brilliant man and a Nobel laureate. There are a lot of Jerry
1294360	1303320	Edelman stories I won't go into, but he was a faculty member at the Rockefeller University
1303320	1309080	when I was a graduate student there. And one of the more favorable descriptions of Jerry was
1309720	1321800	the Black Knight. And I won't go beyond that in this public forum, but he made very
1323640	1329240	many useful contributions. And then as many Nobel laureates decided, hey,
1330040	1337080	you know, the next great frontier is brain, I'm going to get my next Nobel laureate in brain. But
1337720	1343880	the problem was Jerry didn't know any data. You know, and I was lucky to grow up
1343880	1354680	daved in data, which is where I comfortably live. And you can't go very far if you don't know the
1354680	1363160	data. And to know me initially, although I haven't kept track of his work, he's a clever person,
1365480	1373880	try to give a scalar to discuss, you know, whether I don't remember the details in such a long time,
1374840	1380120	whether the system was complex enough to, you know,
1382600	1390840	I think, do consciousness or something. My remark was, hey, you can't do anything with a scalar,
1391640	1399800	you know, I mean, we have a brain after all for a reason. But to the extent to which
1399880	1403560	everyone's contribution is useful.
1407480	1416280	Hey, do it. I only view problems if work is useful, and it's not just hype,
1416280	1420680	of which we know today there's a huge amount of hype. And
1423400	1427320	if it's done in a solipsistic environment,
1429880	1437240	I always taught my students and it was a policy about apartment. Whenever we were studying models
1437240	1443400	to do it in a comparative setting, what are all the models out there? What are their strengths
1443400	1450120	and weaknesses? If we have models we favor, do they have weaknesses that are the models have
1450120	1457400	overcome? And if they have, how can our models be refined and further developed to also do that?
1457400	1465000	So that's a certain attitude. And if everyone's making their proposal in the context of a
1465000	1474840	comparative analysis, then hey, go for it, it's good. But if it's solipsistic and if it's aimed
1474840	1482680	at selling any idea in a, I'll push it to the limit here, a cult-like setting,
1482920	1493640	we know that's bad news. And to me, the worst part of it is students go into
1496440	1502840	courses with famous professors or any professor who they like as a teacher.
1504200	1508360	And they're going to try to absorb everything the teacher says
1508840	1515720	at the time of life when you can learn better than at any other time in your life,
1516280	1525880	if only to get a good grade. And it's really not proper, I would almost go so far to say it's not
1525880	1535080	ethical to give kids a misleading view of the world that they're about to have to live in.
1535880	1541080	If you know better, if you don't know something's out there, hey, you do the best you can, that's
1541080	1547720	all any of us can do. But if you know something's out there and you try to shield your kids from it
1547720	1553720	because, hey, your work isn't as good and you want your kids to do what you do so you can
1553720	1562600	publish more papers or whatever, that's unethical in my mind. That's the strongest I put it. Usually
1562600	1573400	I'd say it's just in a weak character, opportunism, marketing, those words are dead enough.
1575320	1581000	The last, so the last time we went very in-depth on an adaptive residence theory in most of your
1581000	1587560	work, obviously it's just scratching the surface of what is very complex. And as a scientist,
1587560	1592360	I mean, huge respect for your work and everybody seems to have a consensus regarding that. So
1592360	1596600	I've tried to frame this conversation slightly more philosophically so that people can get a deeper
1596600	1601800	understanding of the science behind the work and what its implications on the heart problem as a whole
1601800	1607480	are. And with that in mind, the understanding of other theories of consciousness are important
1607480	1612920	because with yours you can highlight flaws within theirs, just the same way you did with the information
1612920	1618600	aspect of this one. Along those lines of Nobel laureates doing that, you've got others like
1618600	1625000	Francis Crick, Penrose, very different types of theories of consciousness. You've got someone who
1625000	1629720	is approaching it from a pan-psychist perspective who's claiming that consciousness is that fundamental
1629720	1637000	feature. And then you've got someone like Penrose who claims that consciousness is almost quantum
1637320	1644360	in a sense and beyond what classical physics can interpret. And therefore the data in this case
1644360	1651640	would not be as easily applicable. What do you think about that? Sorry, that was a very long question.
1653400	1662040	Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but it's always, you know, what theories have the
1663000	1675400	broadest and most principled explanatory range and how many of their predictions have been
1675400	1685720	supported by subsequent data. And in terms of quantum brain, you know, there's an obvious sense in
1685800	1693080	which our brain's a quantum, hey, well, matter comes out of quantum mechanics or some kind of
1693080	1700120	quantum reality, even if quantum mechanics is not yet a complete theory as some people think and,
1700120	1709720	you know, string theory and all that. So obviously, you know, the structure of matter would embody
1709720	1719480	ourselves in a world that has a quantum substrate. But I take the kind of work I've done as an
1719480	1731480	existence proof. And there have been many times in my life when I've been dying to use some kind of
1731560	1742200	concepts to explain the kinds of phenomena that I'm really yearning to understand.
1743000	1750280	And the existence proof here is that if you look at all the things that I,
1750280	1755560	my colleagues have explained, which I think has the broadest and deepest,
1755560	1761480	interdisciplinary explanatory range, linking brain to mind of any existing theory,
1762680	1776840	I've never needed quantum theory, except, except for example, at the sensory level.
1777560	1786760	So, for example, I mentioned briefly Gil Carpenter and I did some work on
1790600	1798920	photoreceptor transduction and vertebrate cones. And what that means is photons come in,
1799880	1807560	photons to the quantum constituents of light, you know, the whole thing with Einstein and
1807560	1817400	Wake particle dualism and all those profound things. But photons come in. And the question is,
1818600	1827480	how does a photo detector, which is at the front end of registering that there's something
1827480	1835000	going on in the visual world, how does it generate a signal through the retina to the optic nerve?
1835000	1845400	And one of the things we realized is that the brain, our brains in many species,
1845880	1853720	I think we were doing turtle, I think with turtle photoreceptors because, oh gosh,
1857080	1862760	you know, it's been so long ago. Some really wonderful experimentalists that worked up
1863480	1870520	turtle phototransduction. And it was a parametric database, really challenging. And
1871320	1882200	there were some really bizarre, at the first lush properties of the data curves. And what we
1882200	1894280	showed is that if you had a temporal averaging of the photons, just so you're computing a photon
1894280	1903000	density, and you know, it would rise and then it would fall when a little event occurred,
1903000	1909560	we showed with simple ideas like that, you'd be quantitatively explaining all those data. So we
1910680	1914440	faced the problem that you have to
1915400	1923320	transduce from individual photons, which is on the quantum level, into a classical description
1924840	1932600	of neuronal dynamics. We needed some stuff you don't use everywhere. And that
1933640	1940360	is a simple version that goes way back in phylogeny. And I've talked about
1941320	1951720	with some of my graduate students, we looked at multiple species that have these precursors,
1951720	1961000	what ultimately, a discovery I may call spectral timing, which is
1961160	1973800	both in space and in time. Our brains face the problem of going from,
1975560	1979960	you know, you could respond to a single photon, but that's too short to register any
1980600	1991720	microscopic event. Or in space, you could have a cell that's selective to just a very little region,
1992280	1998920	but that's not going to influence your navigational behavior. So one of the things I
1998920	2005160	talked about in my book, I like to sort of say it in a cute way, how do little nerve cells
2006120	2016680	generate spatial and temporal representations that can influence adaptive behaviors. And
2018520	2028920	a key ingredient in that turns out are called grid cells and time cells. And one of the things I
2029000	2034360	loved about this modeling, much of which I did with Praveen Pilli, a brilliant
2035320	2044440	PhD student of mine who then worked with me in much more senior positions before he got,
2044440	2049880	I think, I think he's got quite an important job at Intel now.
2050200	2060040	They obeyed basically the same laws, and they're in two parallel streams
2061160	2066200	in the entorhinal to hippocampal cortex. And because of this
2066520	2079960	homology between the spatial and temporal laws, I love to say, you know, give me a break here,
2080600	2090280	space and time are one. And I called it neural relativity, because space and time are one.
2090280	2099000	But the parsimony of it was breathtaking. Now, you know, the evolutionary precursors of that,
2099640	2108520	someone else is going to have to look at, but I'm condensed. They'll love the answer,
2109320	2116760	you know, and it'll be well worth their time. But to be able to say space and time are one and to
2116760	2122840	show, you know, and we're talking about entorhinal cortex, I didn't know from entorhinal cortex when
2122840	2133880	I was young, it's an acquired taste, you get forced into it by conceptual questions that you then get
2134520	2140840	stuck on, you get hung up on until you've got to get an answer, not the final answer, there's no
2140840	2151400	final answer, but a computationally effective and experimentally remarkably successful pair of
2151400	2161320	models. They, Praveen and I didn't mainly the space part of it, but we were able to simulate
2162280	2170360	quantitatively very challenging parametric data about grid cell dynamics. And then the time stuff
2170360	2179080	I did with a series of other PhD students, Nestosh Mayak and John Merrill, among others.
2182360	2188520	So I had called it spectral timing because there's a spectrum of cells.
2191320	2196920	If you want to go from little nerve cells to temporal delays, you could bridge. So let's say,
2197880	2210520	to give a simple example, let's say I'm a human or a pigeon or a rat, or let's say that I have to wait
2211640	2218360	two or three seconds after a stimulus to make a response in order to get my reward,
2219000	2222840	and if I prematurely make the response I might get punished.
2222840	2229800	Not so different like a student in a classroom, you have to know when it's okay to raise your hand.
2230920	2236200	And so spectral timing, you have lots of nerve cells, each with its own local
2241000	2249160	firing delay because they all have different rates of firing. So one cell might fire a bump,
2249160	2258120	another cell might fire a bump, another cell might fire a bump, bump, bump. And if the stimulus
2258120	2265000	activates the whole spectrum, it turns out that each of those cells has an adaptive weight assigned
2265000	2274040	to it. And the correlation between the stimulus and when the action is trained to occur is going
2274040	2284440	to strengthen some cells in the spectrum better than others. So for example, you could train,
2284440	2291640	I'm not sure if I can show you this. Steve, do you mind bringing more to your left?
2292840	2299080	I'm going to jiggle. I didn't do it. Bringing more to your left, Steve, the other way. Yes.
2299880	2308360	Can you see? Oh, there they are. They're the curves. So you know, it's in an
2309560	2317320	time is plotted against activity. And for example, you can get spectral cells to fire
2317320	2325240	selectively at two distinct times. And if you notice the bump at the earlier time is narrower
2326040	2334440	than the bump at the later time, that is a signature of spectral timing. And you find it
2335400	2338920	in the cerebellum, you find it in the basal ganglia.
2343160	2346840	I'm blocking the several other parts of the brain, you find it and I can't
2347480	2356040	pull it all up fast enough. It is a conserved mechanism. And you also find evolutionary
2356040	2366040	precursors of it in very primitive organisms where it isn't even neural. It is a way of
2366040	2372920	doing a kind of blocks law, a trade off between time and energy. That's what's behind it.
2373400	2381640	But that kind of spectral time that I just showed you, you can record from in cerebellum
2385480	2388360	parallel fiber, pecensio cell synapses.
2391640	2399800	So Steve, I'm sorry, you finished that first? No, I was forgetting why I was telling you
2399800	2405160	this. What triggered this reply? It's fine. Maybe if I ask the next question, it'll come back to you.
2406440	2411640	On that note, you're talking about the fact that it's also not just in neural cells.
2413160	2417320	There's work being done by people like Michael Levin. He's at Tufts University,
2417960	2422680	where they started to show this blurry nature of what intelligence seems to be. Now,
2423480	2428920	fair enough, some people might argue that defining the word intelligence here plays a big role. But
2429800	2434520	in a nutshell, what he's trying to say is there's bio-electrical communication occurring
2434520	2441880	between cells that goes beyond what our hardwired DNA is producing to communicate between cells.
2443800	2449240	Because of that, they're able to actually do some incredible work at this lab. It's called Levin
2449240	2452440	Lab. I don't know if you want to check this out afterwards, but they're able to create...
2453400	2460840	I've interacted with Michael Levin at Tufts in the past, but you're not giving me a
2460840	2468680	good focus and a prime need to remember what we were interacting about. Because there was
2468680	2474520	something he was doing that I thought some of my work clarified, but I'm just talking about
2474520	2484040	intelligence. I can't remember. In essence, he's work starting to almost confirm panpsychism as a
2484040	2491960	theory of consciousness in the sense that panpsychism basically means that consciousness
2491960	2498600	is a fundamental feature of reality, not in the sense that consciousness is just everywhere.
2499400	2503080	A lot of people, technically, that is what they mean. But for the most part...
2503320	2508840	Let me interrupt you there just because that reminded me of why I was telling you a lot of this
2508840	2524200	stuff. The reason why I was telling you about some of these primitive and not even neural
2524520	2536760	mechanisms is because, for example, there are very primitive processes which have
2537480	2544040	properties of resonance, in fact, adaptive resonance. One of the ones that I talked about
2544040	2550600	in my communication memory and development paper way back in 78, and then I review it in
2551080	2561240	chapter 15 or 16, I forget, in my 17. And my magnum opus has to do with the process whereby a
2561240	2571080	blastula during when you have a single cell, very early embryo, becomes a gastrula.
2571960	2584200	You know, you start with a spherically symmetric set of cells after the first few stages of
2584200	2591400	mitosis, and then some of the cells get selectively active and they start
2592200	2598520	sending pseudopodia to the other side of the
2600680	2606920	blastula. And on the other side, certain cells develop adhesiveness,
2608600	2618520	and when some of those pseudopodia hit the adhesive cells, they stick. And then this
2618520	2625240	accumulates until enough of these. It's an autocatalytic interaction until enough of these
2625240	2635560	pseudopodes connect. Now, why is that going to do something? It's because the pseudopodes have
2635560	2641000	contractal properties. You know, if they go up and they don't hit, they might come down and go up.
2641960	2646520	If enough of them stick, it becomes like a primitive muscle,
2647960	2653800	and they contract, and then they pull the cells on the two sides together,
2654680	2658920	and that starts to create a gastrula. It's gastrulation. It's the next step
2659720	2665400	in cellular development. And in my communication memory and development paper, way, way back,
2665400	2679160	I began to realize that these morphogenetic processes already embodied primitive versions
2679880	2686920	of things like adaptive resonance, because when the connections occur,
2687480	2697480	the prediction is they get more and more tuned, which strengthens the sensation. And as I recall,
2697480	2703080	there were some later data that were at least partially consistent, but very hard experiment
2703080	2708680	to do directly. But my prediction would be it's a simple form of adaptive resonance
2709640	2720360	in an early stage of morphogenesis, multiple species. And there are a number of examples of these.
2722280	2731000	Remember, I talked about complementary computing, a kind of yin-yang fitting together. And that goes
2731960	2738520	in multiple parts of biology, too. And although I'm going to make a statement now that,
2741960	2749720	it's the rankest form of speculation that doesn't give you any predictive ability beyond what
2749720	2758600	wonderful scientists have already done, I think an example of that complementary computing is
2758600	2772200	the double helix, the DNA and RNA double helixes. It's a way of bringing complementary stuff together
2772200	2779880	and into a more complete representation of the information you need to do stuff.
2780840	2792040	I would love to see Barbara McClintock did wonderful work on dancing
2792840	2798360	genes. I don't think that was quite it. But trying to get at the dynamics of how
2799320	2805640	the double helix, which usually you see in a static form and some wonderful
2806040	2815000	chemical architecture, but it's very dynamic. It's always doing stuff.
2817080	2824600	So I think there's resonance and complementarity everywhere. And remember, last time I talked
2824600	2830680	about the fact that in many parts of my work there are principles of complementarity,
2831640	2840120	uncertainty and resonance. And we know, coming back to quantum theory, those are principles at
2840120	2846600	the core of quantum theory. That doesn't mean that we are operating on the quantum level.
2847160	2855880	It just means these are kind of universal principles of nature. And we, through evolutionary
2855880	2863480	adaptation over the eons, have been built embodying them in a form that could support
2863480	2874360	animal intelligence. So if you ask about anti-psychism and stuff, well, you're never going to get
2874360	2881480	into that system just like you're not going to write an electron. But hey, they're built on very
2882440	2894440	similar principles as we are. And I feel I've understood more by commenting about these three
2895240	2906280	general principles that are conserved over phylogeny and evolutionary time than just saying the word
2906360	2913720	pence, psychism, which I want to know exactly what are you talking about? Because it's a lovely
2913720	2919320	phrase and it's important to have a lovely phrase, but I need to know where's the beef here?
2919320	2927800	Where is the beef? Where is it? What's the beef? So just to define it a little bit,
2929960	2935160	Mike once wrote a paper with Daniel Dennett. I think this would be a nice way to reel it in.
2935160	2939640	It's called cognition all the way down. And the reason why I bring that paper up is because
2939640	2945560	at some point I was going to mention it, you do mention it in your paper. And Dennett doesn't
2945560	2951720	have a panpsychist view. So panpsychism is pretty much the, it pretty much means consciousness is
2951720	2956680	everywhere, not always in the very mystical sense that a lot of people seem to think of it. They're
2956680	2964760	pretty much trying to come across by saying that cognition or proto-cognition or even proto-consciousness
2964760	2971240	can be found within smaller layers of reality in terms of a human. So you can go down into like,
2971240	2977400	let's say tissues and cells and within those biological processes, you can find forms of
2977400	2989240	proto-consciousness. Well, I don't necessarily agree with it. Wait, let me, you really have
2989240	2997000	to be clear about what you mean by consciousness. Yes, I agree with that completely. I've already
2997000	3007880	given you examples with guest relation and with talking about complementarity and resonance
3007880	3017160	and uncertainty going all through the natural world that these things go all the way down.
3017800	3028120	Now, the question is, what's the definition of cognition that you're using here and what's the
3028120	3038040	definition of consciousness? There are these shared processes. As I remarked in our last discussion,
3038280	3049480	I'm happy to believe that every species that solves the stability plus disability dilemma
3050680	3057640	has some form of consciousness because, you know, my own work, I showed that to do that,
3058680	3066680	at least in everything I've seen in experiments and models, you need a combination
3067400	3073720	of learning expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. And when you have all those things,
3074760	3084440	if you're exposed to an external world that has stable enough events
3086040	3092360	for you to actually learn something with spatial and temporal stability, then
3093000	3102440	the process will also give you form of consciousness, either of recognition or of perception.
3103720	3109800	But that was a big if, too. You know, what is the stable world that
3111400	3118760	resonant events are interacting with? And is it what we would call consciousness or cognition?
3119480	3125080	So I think that until I hear their definitions and how they've used to explain something
3125080	3132520	interesting, I would be more comfortable just saying stuff like I said, giving examples of
3134360	3137480	shared mechanisms like adaptive resonance and
3137640	3151640	gastrulation and this complementarity all over the place. But cognizant all the way down, it's cute.
3152760	3162280	In your paper, you mentioned. But as I pointed out in my book, Dan, who is a very bright
3163240	3173240	leading philosopher of mind, also wrote things about neon color spreading that are just wrong.
3174120	3180200	And then he became sarcastic about all the fools who actually believe it's a phenomenon.
3181400	3191080	And it really sarcasm in science is that hominem and gratuitous. And he was especially embarrassing
3191080	3197960	when he was wrong. And at a meeting where I invited him to speak because I don't only invite people
3197960	3206440	who agree with. He said to the audience that he was wrong. But I'm not sure if after he left
3206440	3214280	the meeting, he still said he would just surround it by good psychosis and neuroscientists and
3214280	3224360	modelers and what exactly did he say? What exactly he well, I think part of my talk was,
3225240	3232760	I think, you know, it's so long ago explaining a lot of data about how we consciously see,
3233640	3240600	you know, brightness, perception, form, the end color spreading. You know,
3240680	3245880	general surface filling in the complementarity of perceptual boundaries and surfaces.
3247720	3255880	And he was one of two philosophers of mind I invited. Anyway, he just got up and started
3255880	3264920	his talk with that retraction. Because what, you know, if he had claimed it again, people would
3264920	3275880	say, but Steve just explained data about it. It exists. You can see it, you know, with your own
3277000	3283880	mind. So I don't know where he stands on it now. He's very bright and very creative.
3284680	3290760	But he went too far there and he was wrong. And what made what annoyed me was it's my
3291400	3299000	current understanding that he first heard about neon color spreading. When he came kindly,
3299000	3304120	I don't take it to granted, people come to my lecture, he came to a talk I gave on vision in
3304120	3311720	which one of the kinds of data I was explaining was neon color spreading data. And, you know,
3311800	3322440	as part of a more integrated view of a lot of visual processes, like neon color spreading is,
3323240	3330440	you know, the reason it got popular. Well, one reason it got popular is because we
3331160	3342520	pulled it out of anonymity, because I could see that it gave really good visible evidence
3343400	3349800	of our predicted laws of how boundaries and surfaces interact, because there were colors
3349800	3354840	where there shouldn't have been colors. And I actually
3354920	3362920	emphasized it. And then Ken Akiyama and Mike Paradiso and other people picked up on it
3363480	3372760	and started doing more experimental work on it. But it was lying, unnoticed, until the theory
3372760	3381480	clarified how remarkable the interactions were and gave compelling evidence of surface filling in,
3381480	3385800	which is precisely what Dan was saying doesn't exist.
3387640	3391000	Yes, that is something you hear. And it's not the only one, you know, Mike,
3391640	3398120	my very gifted colleague, Ben Jo Pina, has what he calls a watercolor effect, which is all about
3398120	3405320	surface filling in. And, you know, you could say this is due to the first competitive state doing
3406120	3412440	interacting with it. I mean, we can explain it, and you can see it.
3414120	3420360	Are there any philosophers of mine who's working familiar with who you feel does
3420360	3426600	represent your form of emergentism in a great way, or your view on consciousness in a similar way?
3426840	3437080	Well, people don't have to do what I do in any way. I'm blocking on his name. The other philosopher
3437080	3449480	of mine, who I invited to that meeting long ago, is a Canadian guy. And I forget his name.
3449960	3455960	It's, I shouldn't to get it, but I, you know, I'd have to prime my stuff, my mind's else for now.
3456520	3461960	And he gave a lovely talk. I really thought it was a useful, interesting talk.
3461960	3462920	Is it Paul Churchland?
3464760	3469160	No, it's not Paul. No, Paul also did serious work.
3472760	3473400	I'm not sure.
3474360	3482120	Anyway, but my advice to anyone who wants to talk scientifically about mind and brain is,
3482120	3487720	read the data, and then read the state of the modeling community,
3489880	3491880	because you don't want to make a fool of yourself.
3493800	3500360	No, okay, so with that in mind, so we've discussed the people who have...
3501080	3503480	Let me, let me make a remark about that. You know,
3506760	3514760	I forget who said it, but I'm a very distinguished guy who I very much admired.
3514760	3521960	And, and he gave a keynote lecture. And, and he said, you know,
3523000	3527240	everybody thinks they can have a theory about how our minds work, we have a mind.
3528200	3535720	But by extension, we also have electrons and photons and atomic nuclei.
3535720	3538600	Do we feel we're immediately physicists, you know?
3539880	3545240	I mean, it's people think introspective evidence will explain their mind, but
3546200	3552760	remember the main point of cognitive and penetrability is that you and I can see each
3552760	3556360	other, hear each other, have feelings about each other, learn from each other.
3557240	3562680	Because we have no cognitive penetrability, we don't know what's up here.
3563400	3567960	We don't know that even the brain is the seat of intelligence from our daily experience.
3567960	3575080	And as, you know, anyone who studied the history of neuroscience knows, people originally thought
3577080	3584360	that other organs were the seat of intelligence, the heart or the pancreas even.
3585240	3588040	You know, so, yeah.
3588040	3593000	So, so to you, I mean, fundamentally, the, that phenomenological first person
3593720	3600440	subject of quality, a qualitative feel is explainable via scientific theory.
3600440	3604040	I'm just, obviously, I'm just playing devil's advocate. I know what your view pretty much is,
3604040	3608280	but I want people to understand this as much as possible, that intentionality that people
3609160	3615000	that intentionality, the aboutness of, of reality for you, that's nothing
3615880	3617160	and special about this.
3617160	3623080	Well, again, you have to be very clear about how you use the word intentionality.
3624360	3631640	I mean, for example, an adaptive resonance theory, there are top-down expectations,
3631640	3633560	which were a form of intentionality.
3634280	3639720	There are predictions of what's going to happen next, which are a form of intentionality.
3640280	3646920	I'd have to know an example that would be different from that to realize that someone's
3646920	3648280	talking about something else.
3648280	3650840	So you're using the nice word.
3651560	3656680	Some words are better as chapter headings.
3657480	3662840	And then you write what you mean by the word in and of themselves.
3662840	3667320	They don't tell you, do you know what, what meaning of intentionality
3668360	3669640	is being expressed here?
3669640	3671960	Can you articulate it better?
3671960	3674280	I think I say something irrelevant.
3674280	3678040	What would be, I think maybe the best way for me to do that,
3678040	3683800	let me define it from the Stanford X-cycle video philosophy is to make it easier.
3685480	3691640	In philosophy, intentionality is the power of minds and mental states to be about,
3692360	3697240	to represent or to stand for things, properties and states of affairs.
3697240	3700040	Now, I know in your theory, obviously you address these,
3700760	3706840	but to a philosopher of mind, this is considered almost a very special property, a qualitative,
3708680	3710600	it's difficult for me to actually explain it, to be honest.
3711640	3713480	That's what all my work is about.
3713640	3714920	Yeah, I know that's the tip.
3714920	3718440	But that's what the work does.
3719400	3731080	But when you're talking about what it's about, there are multi-dimensional aspects of that
3732120	3737880	knowing, including the perceptual, the cognitive, the recollective,
3738840	3748920	the emotional, the action, the appetitive, so it's too vague.
3751560	3754600	The issue is explanatory power.
3757720	3767400	As people have written about time and again in physics, people were doing natural philosophy,
3768280	3771640	until they could explain stuff and then it was called physics.
3772520	3775400	I think that's true of philosophy of mind too.
3776280	3787640	I mean, I took philosophy courses in college and what they were good at was opposing questions,
3788840	3794360	articulating questions, but if you wanted the answers, you have to turn to science.
3795320	3806440	But also what I found is by getting to a deep principled understanding of something,
3807800	3815080	it helps me to articulate new questions that I couldn't have done just based on intuition alone.
3816040	3819960	Intuition is limited.
3821080	3829000	It is so important that because we can't consciously see, because we can't consciously feel and so on,
3829960	3832840	that helps us to know at least, well, what are we trying to explain?
3832840	3838440	I want to explain how I see, how I see color and brightness and texture and
3839400	3845000	shading and objects and motion and all this stuff.
3846120	3853480	So it gives us a whole series of chapter headings, but to actually explain it,
3855080	3857240	you have to think in a totally different way.
3857960	3867000	And finding that way I have found requires an immersion into large databases that probe the
3867000	3871000	different aspects of the properties that you're trying to explain.
3871800	3875080	You can't just, hey, hey, I bet it's like this and you were right.
3875640	3879560	The chances are as close to zero as you can imagine.
3882600	3883800	Hunches are good.
3883800	3884760	Don't get me wrong.
3885880	3891720	I mean, hunches help theorists think about, oh, I should have been thinking about that,
3892680	3898280	but the hunch you'll have after you know a lot will be very different from the hunch you have
3898280	3899800	when you know very little.
3899800	3903000	Steve, you mentioned you know Paul Churchland.
3903880	3904920	He was a very prominent...
3904920	3907480	No, I don't know Paul.
3907480	3908440	Okay, but you know off Paul.
3908440	3914920	I just knew, yeah, I knew that he did some good work, but I haven't looked at it for many years.
3914920	3920520	Okay, so there was Paul and Patricia Churchland and they were the theory known as
3920600	3927160	Eliminative Materialism and what that was was it was it's a very radical claim basically
3927800	3929640	ordinary common sense terms.
3930680	3933080	So common sense understandings of the mind.
3933080	3935240	They claim to be deeply incorrect.
3935240	3938200	They felt that folk psychological terms that we use.
3938200	3942680	So even saying things like learning or thought, etc.
3943320	3946760	Don't technically work in the physical world because when you take
3947320	3953320	materialism to be true, you have to realize that reality is just neurons firing.
3953320	3958840	It's actually got there is no secondary reality in psychology where we could say things like,
3958840	3964600	okay, that's thought, that's memory, that's conscious experiences because in reality,
3964600	3966360	that's just neurons firing.
3966360	3969560	That's just blood circulating, etc. etc.
3970440	3972280	So, yeah, well, what are you?
3973080	3980280	Well, well, well, first words like learning and thought are more chapter headings.
3981480	3987160	You know, they're not theories, they're not principles, they're chapter headings.
3987160	3991400	Then you've got to if you're going to continue using those words at all,
3992120	3993720	you've got to say what you mean.
3993720	4000680	So for example, I invented the phrase adaptive resonance in order to describe
4002680	4009320	a brain process for which there was a great deal of evidence that I could explain.
4009960	4012520	The word wasn't there before and I've done that.
4013320	4015320	We've talked about spectral timing.
4015320	4018200	I invented the word spectral timing.
4019800	4022680	We talked about neural relativity.
4022680	4025400	I invented the word neural relativity.
4025960	4032120	You know, I mean, all these words come out of an analysis of lots of data.
4032760	4037480	But, you know, again, we're just getting back to the problem of emergent properties.
4038360	4045320	It's not just neurons, it's neuronal interactions that generate emergent properties
4046120	4056120	that often cause actions that lead to feedback that create a cycle of perception, cognition,
4056120	4060680	emotion, action over and over and over as you evolve in the world.
4061480	4070200	And through that cycle, if there are statistically repeatable enough or stable enough
4071080	4078680	properties of that interaction, you will learn about them as appropriate to the circuits
4079560	4085400	that are resonating with those particular invariants.
4086360	4090440	And as I mentioned last time, you know, we talked briefly about cognitive emotional
4090440	4099000	interactions. To me, it was very satisfying that cognitive and emotional circuits share
4099080	4108040	many properties. But one thing they don't share is their inputs and their outputs.
4108920	4115560	Like with emotion, you have a lot of inter-receptive inputs of hunger, satiety,
4117640	4121800	pain, you know, whatever, belief, happiness.
4122760	4130200	And with cognition, usually, there's a perceptual front end,
4131240	4139560	envision, audition, you know, tactile that drives those. And then there's an interface
4139560	4148360	that resonates. So a lot of the circuitry can be shared but specialized in order to
4149320	4157400	be able to resonate with particular invariants of the environments that they are trying to
4159880	4165720	understand. That's a bad word, it's a loaded word. To the environments for which they have adapted.
4168840	4173080	Yeah, so emergent properties, emergent properties, emergent properties, which you
4173080	4179960	cannot understand without a sufficiently powerful and principled, computational,
4180520	4191640	mathematically rigorous theory. And there is that explanatory gap without theory.
4192840	4198200	And in your work, I mean, you refer to this as establishing a linking hypothesis.
4198200	4207800	Between brain and mind, yeah. Well, it's a familiar phrase, linking hypothesis.
4210920	4220440	Yeah, and I don't want us to go in circles, but if you don't have a way to generate the
4220440	4227080	emergent properties linking to behavior, then you really can't mechanistically explain behavior.
4227800	4233160	Okay, so I've got a lot of questions from fans and audience members in general, but
4233880	4240120	tell that some of them are going to take us in circles. Well, that's okay. You know,
4240120	4247720	I don't think it's bad to say the same thing more than once. I think I might have mentioned I
4248760	4255480	would sometimes give the same keynote at two different conferences, assuming that because
4255480	4261160	they were in different continents or whatever, a lot of the people hadn't heard it. And then I
4261160	4266680	see in the audience, some of the same people and they said, you know, it's good to hear more than
4266680	4274120	once. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, you know, there are, when it comes to my
4275240	4282680	2017 paper on the hard problem, I do have keynote lectures about that on my webpage,
4283640	4294280	my webpage, your relegation is sites, s-i-t-e-s dot b-u for Boston University,
4294840	4303960	dot e-d-u for education, slash Steve G, that's s-t-e-v-e-g,
4304200	4313560	sites dot b-u dot d-d-u slash Steve G. So for people who want to hear that lecture given,
4314680	4321320	I might have given that one in more than one form, I forget, and sometimes I will
4322280	4325160	have both of them put on my webpage. But there are a number of
4325880	4335560	keynotes that I try to make self-contained for interdisciplinary audiences. But, you know,
4335560	4341320	as we were joking before, self-contained depends on where you're coming from.
4342040	4348840	No, exactly. But they keep inviting me back. So I assume I couldn't have been that bad. I keep
4348920	4356520	getting invited back. So. Well, here as well, we'll help to solidify some of these concepts for
4356520	4361640	people, because I think it does require repeat reading, repeat watching, and repeat listening,
4361640	4367880	just to get all of these, well, in your way, see, feel, and experience this a lot more, resonate
4367880	4374840	with it a bit. Well, I would recommend, you know, a discussion such as ours, I think,
4375800	4384280	for me is successful if it motivates someone to want to learn more. And then I would recommend
4384280	4391240	someone go to one of the videos on my webpage or YouTube or wherever,
4395000	4402440	and listen to the lecture. Yes. And maybe listen more than once and stop it and repeat if
4403000	4408600	what is he talking about. And after you've done that, until you feel I know a little better,
4408600	4417000	then go to some of the articles. And some of the articles are heuristic, like my 2017 paper is in
4417000	4423240	a way, even though it breaks new ground in a way, it's a review paper, because a lot of the
4423240	4429800	foundational mathematical work is earlier, or I wouldn't have had the nerve to write that paper,
4430440	4437320	because I knew everything I was writing is supported by mathematical models and computer
4437320	4447000	simulations of challenging data. So, you know, there were levels from an S, you know, our chat to
4447960	4455320	videos of self-contained lectures to reading, hopefully non-technical review papers to
4456040	4461640	technical ones. But really, the best resource I can recommend is my magnum opus,
4462680	4471960	conscious mind, resonant brain, colon, how each brain makes a mind. Because there I work really
4471960	4481480	hard to write a self-contained and non-technical synthesis and overview of my work in many different
4481480	4487800	areas, as well as to bring together and try to clarify the meaning of the work of
4487800	4494200	really hundreds of other scientists. So, but as we might have mentioned last time, you know,
4494200	4501160	we are talking about this, and this is one of the hard things to understand in the world. So,
4502200	4505320	nothing that I would write about it, I hope, would be
4506280	4513720	trivial, but I hope it's, you could see, oh, he's writing clearly. I just have to stop and
4513720	4522600	think about what he just wrote. And one reason I have over 600 color figures is to help people to
4522600	4533080	visualize the concepts that the words are trying to express. Because until you can get a picture in
4533080	4539960	your mind, it's often hard to know what the hell someone's talking about. It's not only me, it's
4539960	4553160	anything. So, yeah. Steve, talk to me about one of the one of the other very leading theories of
4553160	4560360	consciousness, which is global neuronal workspace. What are your views on that theory of consciousness?
4563080	4573640	Well, I'm not going to give a professional review like you would for a journal article.
4574680	4581080	I'm blocking on who's, I know the very nice fellow who promotes it. What is his name?
4581080	4589720	Bernard Bos. Yeah, I know Bernie Bos. He's a very nice guy, and he's very dedicated and sincere.
4590680	4597640	Just check what his predictive and explanatory range is. That's all I could say.
4599720	4606520	I mean, it's not for me to try to give a review of Bernie's work. You should ask Bernie to review
4606520	4612920	his work. I think it's always intriguing to see where, I mean, you guys either align or disagree.
4612920	4618680	It's fascinating, particularly for the audience, to kind of get a grasp of where you guys diverge
4618840	4625080	or intersect. Well, I could discuss it. Bernie had an explanation of a certain fact,
4626360	4631400	and I thought it was correct. I'd say, yeah, I agree. But if I thought it was incorrect,
4631400	4637800	I'd say, well, I would explain it as well as that I can do, but to give some holistic way
4637800	4644680	and waving evaluation of Bernie's hard work. No, I won't play that game.
4644680	4653400	I don't think it's constructive. If people find value in reading Bernie's work, they should
4653400	4658680	read it. If there are still questions they'd like answered, and they can find some of those
4658680	4663080	questions given more complete answers in my work, they should read my book.
4665640	4671080	There is a section within the book where you do discuss it, and the fact that that theory sort of
4671080	4676280	does provide a little bit more information when you compare it to the other ones that we briefly
4676280	4685640	discussed. Oh, yeah, Bernie is more serious, I think. Okay. Okay, let's let you know.
4687240	4695000	I'd like to leave it at that. Was that one of the questions someone wanted to comment on?
4695000	4700040	I haven't gotten to those. Well, you better get to that, because it's an hour and a half in,
4700920	4707560	I can go up the two hours or so, but let's go. So one of my friends actually asked this question.
4708920	4714200	This question, this first question, one of my friends asked us, he wants to remain unnamed,
4714200	4717320	but he wants to know at what, so let me just read this.
4717480	4734120	At what point would Professor Grossberg delineate between zero conscious experience
4734120	4740840	and conscious experience? Are all conscious experiences considered to be resonant states
4740840	4752920	in that regard? Well, you know, later in my book, I talk about quite a few mental disorders.
4753960	4762920	And for example, without talking about parametric properties of behavioral symptoms
4764040	4770040	and the mechanisms that cause them and what has gone wrong there in altering consciousness, you
4770040	4776520	know, if you don't have a sufficiently sustained and energetic adaptive resonance
4777400	4788360	that is resonating with either external stimuli or internal memory representations,
4788360	4795960	it won't get to consciousness. You know, what I'm blocking on his name now. Oh, he did very nice work.
4796920	4803800	You know, I talk about it a little in my book where, you know, usually
4806120	4815160	the stimulation our senses get by the time we're consciously aware of it can be 150 to
4815800	4825320	300 milliseconds later. And that's partly because in addition to the
4827400	4835000	all the pre processing stages, you then have to activate resonating circuits that have to
4835000	4843720	resonate for a sufficiently sustained energetic interval before it becomes conscious.
4844360	4851400	So anything that prevents that will not become conscious. And there are many ways that can be
4851400	4863160	prevented. Yeah, your work, I mean, clearly, in your work, you also you address the fact that not
4863160	4867800	not all resonance states are conscious states, but conscious states are always resonance states.
4867880	4876360	Yes, not all resonance states are conscious. And I give example to that.
4877400	4884520	For example, I mentioned grid cells and play cells will enter Rhino hippocampal resonances,
4884520	4893640	which support the stable learning stable and coordinated learning of grid and play cell
4893640	4904120	receptive fields are not conscious. They are not linked to internal or external sources of
4905240	4917640	sensory experience. Not directly, you know, for example, grid cells are sensitive to
4918600	4928360	linear motions and rotational motions. But those sensors aren't designed to support qualia.
4929560	4937240	And so, you know, there's just no nothing like a conscious awareness there. There are inputs,
4937240	4946680	but the inputs are very low level. Now it's another matter entirely if you try to link the
4946680	4954280	spatial representations that are learned in grid and play cells with information like optic flow,
4955240	4965560	visual cues that are being synthesized when you navigate. So you use combinations of visual
4965560	4971800	and motor information to know where you are. And then if you suddenly in the dark,
4972600	4979880	you use path integration information, that's what the information about the linear and angular
4980760	4986520	movement is all about path integration or integrating how far these senses think you've
4986520	4999080	gone. That's your ground truth. And my PhD student, Bill Gnat and I developed a rather
4999080	5012440	comprehensive animat model of how, for example, how an animat would under visual guidance learn
5012440	5031000	to efficiently acquire a food reward, say that's in a maze, you know, how you would, first, you
5031000	5039160	would just be randomly exploring the maze, you know, that would be endogenous exploratory behavior.
5040120	5049400	And then how that, as you explore it, how that is transformed into an efficient goal oriented
5050200	5056440	series of actions to efficiently acquire the goal in some distal part of the maze.
5058040	5064600	And there we do combine the visual and the path integration information to help
5065560	5073160	learn how to solve that problem. I forget what we call the model, it was, oh, the sovereign model,
5073160	5085320	sovereign for self organizing visual expectation, you know, let me wait sovereign, maybe I can
5086120	5093240	sovereign. And I think that Bill thought of this when I thought, hey, that's not that
5094360	5101080	self organizing vision expectation resonance. And on and on, I can't even remember what the other
5101080	5109320	letters stand for, but it is an acronym that captures the essence of what the architecture's
5109320	5118360	doing. And I say architecture, because not just a model, it's a very, you know,
5121720	5130280	you know, sparse version of a full animat, it doesn't have higher cognition, but it has working
5130280	5141800	memory, you know, it can learn sequential actions, etc, etc. And there, you know, the
5141800	5147320	designer working memory, I don't think you talked much about that, but, you know, you can derive
5147320	5155640	all working memories from a couple of simple postulates, both having to do with stable learning.
5155640	5162920	It's not surprisingly, but this is stable learning of sequences. So even though in a working memory,
5162920	5169800	it would be like, you know, to have remember the following series of letters five to eight, eight,
5169800	5177000	nine, five, three. And, you know, you can repeat it back to me five to eight, eight, nine, five, three.
5177000	5182840	But if I distract you and say, hey, repeat it back to me, you can't, because it's in a short-term
5182840	5191000	temporary working memory buffer, you know, in computer science algorithms, you sometimes call it
5191000	5199480	a blackboard, but this is more than a blackboard, this is a suborganizing blackboard. And one of the
5199480	5207800	key issues here is how do you know which subsequence of all the sequences you've just experienced is
5207800	5215320	predicted in a given context? And, you know, the theory gives a solution to that problem.
5216520	5223400	You want me to... And what? Oh, sorry, you were, you, sorry, continue. Well, well, and, you know,
5223400	5231320	you can see immediately there are, there are issues. Let's say I have already learned the word
5232120	5239720	my, and I've learned the word self. And in particular, I've learned recognition categories
5239720	5248120	of my and self. But now for the first time in working memory, I represent myself a new word
5248120	5259320	with a new meaning. First problem, why doesn't adding self after my, undermine the previously
5259320	5269240	learned inputs to the my and self category? But the second problem is how do you learn a new category
5269240	5276280	for myself, given you have two perfectly good categories, my and self, that are already learned?
5276280	5285560	How do you overcome the salience of the known to self-organize a larger grouping that's unknown?
5286440	5290760	And of course, if you couldn't do this, you couldn't learn language or dance or
5291400	5298840	navigational sequential skills. Because we're talking here about short words, my and self.
5298840	5305640	The same problem arises with individual phonemes grouped into words. And so,
5305640	5316680	you know, my theory of working memories off is a computational solution to that, you know,
5316680	5323960	based on very simple principle. Remarkably, that also was first published in my human
5323960	5331320	memory paper in 78 when communication memory and development came out. It was a good year. And,
5332120	5338440	and one of the reasons I got into it was because it often fails.
5340440	5345720	You know, you might not know, but there was a, let me give you a simple example of it. I was
5345720	5354840	interested more in verbal learning from when I was a boy. But, but did you over here, George Mill is
5354840	5363160	the magical number seven plus or minus two? Well, George Miller was the person who introduced
5363160	5372040	the notion of a chunk. And he basically showed that most people, if you tell them a series of
5372840	5381160	numbers or letters or whatever, they can't repeat it right back to you without learning,
5382040	5389880	well, without actively trying to learn if the sequence is more than five to maybe nine, depending
5389880	5400120	on the person, units. But then what he showed about chunks is that, you know, you could do that
5400120	5408920	for much higher level chunks. You know, like, let's say you're controlling the movements of a
5408920	5417160	dance. And you know, each movement, you're, you know, professional ballet dancer. And you can do
5418280	5424280	all of the individual movements. And now, you know, George Ball and Shane is teaching the new dance.
5425160	5432760	Well, you have to be able to put that sequence of movements into working memory where each of the
5432760	5442920	items in working memory is a chunk of a familiar dance gesture. And so that he realized you could
5442920	5453320	have, you know, sequences of chunks, creating another chunk. And you could get higher and higher.
5453320	5459800	And that's how we learned so many of the higher order things, because we chunked all the lower
5459800	5467400	order stuff and automated it. So we don't have to pay focal attention to things that are already
5467400	5476200	chunked. They more or less can be done under very much less oversight. Anyway, so that's what this
5476200	5488600	theory is about. How you get this chunking, really, by solving the myself problem by,
5490440	5497160	in a stable way, it's sort of like the stability plasticity, the limit solve to sequence learning.
5497160	5506440	But that was too far afield, maybe. But it did get a new, it got a new information.
5506440	5510600	Yes, at least. And it was in, oh, I was talking about sovereign, you need that
5511480	5521000	to learn sequences of turns in sovereign. Yeah. Okay, so the next question is from YouTube.
5521000	5535480	It's by ecstasy. Different functional modalities have been proposed to explain the emergence
5535480	5541560	of quality from physical properties. Under the given art framework, how would residents,
5541560	5546040	even in principle, explain the perception of a qualitative state?
5546840	5554600	I'm not sure what a qualitative state is. I don't mean to be perverse. I mean, the first thing that
5554600	5562840	comes to my mind, of course, is that we have to ask ourselves what flavor of what we're talking about.
5563800	5569800	The category learning stuff, as I had briefly reviewed last time, is about feature category
5569800	5577400	resonances. But if you're talking about experiences from the external world, let's say a visual experience,
5579960	5586920	what you're often conscious of is a surface shroud resonance, which is a conscious seeing.
5588040	5594120	And if you synchronize surface shroud and feature category resonances, you know and see about the
5594120	5601720	object or event, and then the surface shroud resonance via posterior parietal cortex can
5602440	5608520	control actions, which we've learned in response to that combination of events.
5609560	5613400	But now I didn't understand the last two words there. I don't know what they mean.
5614440	5620920	Yeah, I think this is basically referring to qualia, that qualia like state.
5621560	5630040	Well, I just commented on that. You have surface shroud resonance. You have stream
5630040	5640440	shroud resonances. They're not the same as basic category learning. And when I hear and see
5641320	5649400	and know things about you, they're coordinated synchronizations of surface shroud, stream
5649480	5658600	shroud, feature category, and to the extent of which you're processing sequences, you know,
5658600	5665160	they're item list resonances responding to all this, because that's where you get understanding
5665160	5670680	of speech and language. So there are all these resonances that are being coordinated quite
5671640	5682040	wonderfully. And, you know, you have resonance and reset, resonance and reset. So as our visual
5682840	5690600	representations of a momentary visual experience is reset by your movement, to what have you,
5691240	5697880	and I have another frame, and so I have a sequence of these, you know, likewise we're
5697960	5704520	updating all our working memories, because the sequential information that's forming the context
5705480	5714200	of them is changing. One of my articles, you know, I try to bring together a lot of
5715160	5729640	a lot of these ways of thinking in an article that I think that I published it in 2019, 2020.
5732840	5739960	It's an article that starts, well, I think it's one of the latest, maybe it's
5740840	5753560	it's one of the latest chapters in my book. Let me do you have the chapter names in front of you
5753560	5765640	by chance? Let me let me try to search for it. It's important that I make this comment.
5766600	5773560	Okay, I'll go to my, okay. Let me see.
5776520	5783480	Oh, I have to turn off airplane mode. That was to stop me from getting bothered.
5784600	5791080	Airplane mode. Okay. I'll be there in a minute. I have no fear.
5791320	5793640	It's fine. I'm just going to ask other questions.
5806280	5813640	Okay, I think this is it. As a list of the chapter titles on the Oxford listing.
5814520	5819080	Oops, I hit the wrong thing. Damn. Okay.
5824520	5827560	Okay. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5827880	5841640	Yeah, it was chapter 14. How prefrontal cortex works.
5842600	5853720	Um, colon cognitive working memory planning in emotion can jointly achieve valued goals.
5855480	5856360	And um,
5861320	5863800	Yeah. Sorry, Steve, my, my copy of the book isn't in this office.
5864760	5874920	No, it's fine. I'm looking at it, but, but um, yeah, and I'm, it's not, I have the abstract and the
5874920	5883960	keywords here. But it's, let me get the book one second. I'll get it. I have a copy in the next
5883960	5890680	room. Anyway, for people who haven't seen the cover, this is the cover and the background around
5891400	5897880	the brain is neon color spreading. If you look carefully at it, you'll see the red or the blue
5897880	5906520	spreading out of their crosses. Because I thought of that, you know, as such an important example of
5909720	5913800	the complementarity of boundaries and surfaces.
5914760	5916920	And let me go here. Okay.
5921960	5923000	Except for that aspect.
5925000	5925800	What is that?
5925800	5929960	The artwork. Well, what, how did you come up with that? That is the idea for the artwork.
5930920	5943960	Oh, well, um, I wanted to cover that.
5946760	5954520	So I said what the book is about. So, you know, the title is on a brain and, um,
5955480	5964360	uh, the brain is into Hemifield and I fiddled with trying to indicate the complementarity of
5964360	5969240	the Hemifields cause the water and wet streams and stuff like that. Other parts of the brain
5969240	5976120	are complemented, made it too complicated. But so that said, it's just brain, but neon color
5976120	5983400	spreading, the spreading is an emergent property that happens in our mind. It's a property of our
5983400	5990040	conscious visual awareness. And I thought it would be nice to emphasize on the cover.
5990600	6005000	It's about emergent properties. And I'm trying, I thought I, oh yes. Yeah, yeah.
6005320	6022280	Um, I, Betsy Murray stimulated me to write, to make some of these discoveries cause Betsy told
6022280	6027880	me that they had all this wonderful data in prefrontal cortex that no one could explain.
6028520	6036680	And so she sent me the paper and I realized that not only could I explain it, but I predicted
6036680	6044520	some of it and, you know, and they have, you know, words like desirability and availability
6045560	6051160	stuff like that, which are good words for the phenomena they were talking about. But, you know,
6051720	6059640	a macro circuit in complete one of, of the predicted adaptive resonance theory I needed for
6059640	6068760	this. I don't know if you could see that, but I couldn't put in the basal gaggle or a number of
6068760	6077480	other things. And those different colors, the red, green, what have you, are systems. And so it
6077480	6088040	just showed that like for prefrontal cortex, I needed and, and explained data from seven
6088040	6097080	interacting parts of the prefrontal cortex. It's not a unitary thing. It's a complex organ. And,
6097800	6104920	and then I also, in red, I had some of the main reinforcement learning kind of things that,
6105880	6111960	and then I'm just black and white. I had some of the main vision and spatial
6113800	6115160	kind of things. Anyway,
6122200	6128040	Roy, you want me to move? I think the point, I would, the point was I was trying to clarify
6128920	6139480	that, you know, the prefrontal cortical work really is a synthesis of a lot of work.
6139720	6147880	And I think, I think that
6151800	6154920	things really came together in a nice way.
6159720	6164600	You know, with a number of points in my book, I point out, you shouldn't take for granted
6164680	6172120	that the next step could be taken. And this happened to me over and over again, how the previous work
6172120	6178600	sort of thrust me into a new area where I knew they were interacting with. And the same things with
6178600	6186440	the prefrontal cortical work, so many parts of the brain are interacting there to explain really
6187160	6196680	challenging quantitative data, physiological data mostly. But, you know, it's all an accumulation
6196680	6208440	of evidence. And if you're a really good theorist, you can weigh the amount of evidence for this
6208440	6217160	part or that part or the other part. You know where the weaknesses are, where you might have
6217160	6223640	variations on a theme that don't undermine any of the principles as you would expect
6224360	6232360	for species specific variations of the design. And you also know what you can't explain.
6233320	6243000	And, and that keeps you up night until you can. So this is not, this is not finished. But I think
6243000	6251240	if someone wanted to get into an overview of some of my work after this discussion, and maybe looking
6251240	6258040	at a lecture of mine on my web, you might look at my magnum opens, and I want to emphasize one thing.
6258920	6267640	It's a long book. After you read the preface and introductory chapter one, I wrote it so that you
6267640	6275400	could jump directly to any chapter that's topic interested. You don't have to read at all. I don't
6275400	6282280	expect even interested people have the time or interest to read at all. The chapters are written
6282280	6290200	independently of each other. And so, you know, if you wanted to read more about art in the
6290920	6298040	sense of future category resonance, jump to chapter five. But if you wanted to read about
6298040	6305160	prefrontal cortex, you'd go to chapter 13. If you wanted to know about spatial navigation,
6305160	6311080	I think it was chapter 16. Yes. If you wanted to know about visual perception,
6313320	6320040	go to the first few chapters, and so on. Yeah, I really enjoyed that aspect. I said this the last
6320040	6325160	time. It's that easily accessible nature of the book, the way you can just jump from chapter to
6325160	6330840	chapter without having a preconceived idea of the previous chapter makes it very accessible.
6331720	6334280	Steve, one last question, and this one's from Facebook.
6335320	6344600	This is a funny one. Francina, who resonates most in the Grossberg-Karperter household?
6348040	6355160	Whoa, now this is getting very personal. Who resonates most with why?
6355160	6357880	I have no idea. That's just the question. That's where the question ends.
6358760	6375800	Well, all I could say is that Gail Carpenter is the love of my life. We've been together for a
6375800	6385960	half century. She has strict instructions that she can't pre-desease me, because she's younger
6385960	6394520	than I am. We already spoke on the phone earlier today. I'm in Truro on Cape Cod, and she's back
6394520	6403160	in Newton, where we have our main residence. I'll be talking to at least two, three more times today.
6403880	6417960	She's a brilliant neural network modeler. She's done foundational work, as well as really doing
6417960	6427560	some of the best work on large-scale applications, like she did really important work on remote sensing
6428120	6436520	on medical database prediction. One of the things she did that I think
6437960	6440360	should be studied more, and I think she'd agree,
6445240	6452600	is in a remote sensing context, where you can have multiple observers. They're each looking at
6452600	6463000	different pieces of a remotely sensed terrain, maybe with different combinations of sensors.
6464280	6471320	They will create their own personal labels for what they're trying to describe.
6473560	6480760	One person might say water. One person might say pond. Another person might say lake for the very
6480760	6494920	same object, and they only do this for a subset, usually a pretty small subset, of the remotely
6494920	6501800	sensed terrain, because it's expensive to get ground through. Someone has to be running around
6501800	6509400	down there. How do you input this kind of information, which may be
6512520	6519800	incomplete, probabilistic, sometimes self-contradictory, and out of it,
6520840	6527400	automatically learn a cognitive hierarchy of rules, including the confidence you have
6527400	6537320	of the links in the hierarchy, whereas you get higher and higher and higher in the rules,
6537960	6546680	they get more and more abstract. I think that is a foundational contribution, a really quite
6546760	6558920	wonderful one. That needs a lot more work. Gail and I are both no longer teaching, we're both
6558920	6567320	emeritus, and it doesn't mean we're brain dead. I just published my last paper, I think a few
6567320	6575160	weeks ago, and I'm writing another book, but Gail is not going to work on that project again,
6575160	6585000	and that project could really be very interesting, especially if you're in some kind of a technology
6585000	6594120	AI lab. That's the kind of project that Google could really sink its teeth into,
6596200	6602360	because you could do it for the whole world. Part of it, we got into it because
6602840	6611640	many years ago, I gave a lecture at the Optical Society meeting about some of the vision modeling
6611640	6617560	work, and there were several program managers from MIT, Lincoln lab there, which is one of the
6618600	6626600	great sensor houses in the world. They have laid on multispectral IOS and tetic aperture radar and
6626600	6636200	so on, and very much pixelated data with very intense pixels and dropout pixels and
6637320	6645800	a lot of noise, and they realized that the kind of work even then that we were doing in vision
6645800	6654840	modeling could help them process their sensor data. In fact, there was a very active project at
6654840	6663320	Lincoln lab for a while doing that. They also designed a robot based on some of our ideas
6663320	6668760	and sensor remote control course, some of the models I developed with my students and platform
6668760	6680520	independent, they work with wheels or legs or what have you. Yeah, so what more should I say
6680520	6689800	about my wife? My best friend, the love in my life, the mother of a wonderful daughter, and we
6689800	6697560	have wonderful grandchildren. We feel super lucky, super lucky. I love the way your face lights up
6697560	6701560	when you talk about us, Steve. Sorry for the personal question, but I thought it's quite cool
6701560	6706760	that you bought such great pioneers in this field, and I thought it would be a nice question to ask
6706760	6714440	from Mo while it wasn't mine, but I chose it. Well, to sum it up, we've been a real mom and
6714440	6722120	pop show where I have many projects without Gail, she many without me, and we've done, I think at
6722120	6728440	least 20 projects together, and you know, they're sort of like our scientific children.
6730120	6734840	Well, I think it's absolutely beautiful, and keep up the great work. Steve, thank you again for
6734840	6743880	joining me. So I really appreciate your round two. And you've also written a paper on illusions
6743880	6748200	enough that I find very fascinating. And I hope at some point we can also dissect one of those.
6748200	6752200	And with that one, it will be far less philosophical and a lot more scientific. So
6752200	6759800	I think you'll enjoy it a lot more as well. Yeah, well, I love studying, especially visual illusions,
6759800	6766120	of course. You know, it's sort of like how very young people can get
6769960	6775800	excited by mathematics, some of the hardest problems in number theory, you can say to any child,
6776600	6784600	and then it takes firm math to solve it. But visual illusions, it's right there,
6785400	6794280	it's in your face. And immediacy raises questions of how do you see anything?
6797240	6804120	Well, thanks, Ted, for having me on. So this would be part, this would be part two of this series.
6804120	6807400	Yes, definitely. Thanks so much. I enjoyed this.
6807400	6809400	Thank you so much, Steve. I appreciate it.
