WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
The main focus, I'll put links to the 2017 paper on the hard problem of consciousness,

00:15.920 --> 00:19.400
but for the most part, that would be nice. Yeah. Yeah. I put a direct link to that in

00:19.400 --> 00:23.800
the paper because I mean, in the video, because I think people should read this. It's very

00:23.800 --> 00:28.940
long, very, very in depth. And I like that. I mean, that's when someone has a lot to say

00:28.940 --> 00:33.540
about something so complicated. I think you can't really summarize it. It's something

00:33.540 --> 00:38.260
that does require that level of detail. So to all those who are going to read this paper,

00:38.260 --> 00:43.180
just bear that in mind. It probably takes repeat readings for most people to really

00:43.180 --> 00:47.960
understand and grasp most of the concepts, but you do a great job at putting the imagery.

00:47.960 --> 00:55.760
And I mean, it's a wonderful paper overall. Well, thank you. Two things come to mind.

00:55.760 --> 01:05.240
One is that it's a long paper, but it compresses a huge amount of knowledge. So if you can

01:05.240 --> 01:12.120
get through that, you've saved an enormous amount of time. And that's one thing that

01:12.120 --> 01:24.000
my students always came to realize. It was a way that they could get an entree into so

01:24.080 --> 01:33.800
much psychological, neurobiological knowledge and start organizing it for themselves. Whereas,

01:33.800 --> 01:42.600
if all you did was you gave them 200 articles, which may be explained or an explanation often

01:42.600 --> 01:49.600
in this one article of mine, they wouldn't know where to begin. And they wouldn't, they

01:49.600 --> 01:56.640
would have to build up a model in their mind. And that's what I'm giving them. Not to say

01:56.640 --> 02:04.840
it's the final model, but it's been validated, each of the models in multiple ways. And it

02:04.840 --> 02:11.920
gives them a way to start organizing all this information. Because ultimately, the model,

02:11.920 --> 02:18.440
as a thing in itself, isn't what we're interested in. We're interested in understanding what the

02:18.440 --> 02:28.080
hell is going on. And if models help us to create stories about what's going on in those

02:28.080 --> 02:35.080
stories, make sense and help us to clarify what we're learning, well, that's what they're for.

02:35.080 --> 02:41.880
So I was going to say something else, but split my mind. I should write notes.

02:42.840 --> 02:50.280
Now anyway, the huge chunk of this conversation will be about the heart problem of consciousness

02:50.280 --> 02:54.920
in your paper on that topic. And I think the best place for us to start, I've got a list of

02:54.920 --> 03:01.080
questions from from the general fans, audience listeners and viewers. And I'll just go through

03:01.080 --> 03:04.680
those later on in the conversation. But at the beginning, I think let's start with,

03:05.320 --> 03:10.600
what is the heart problem to you? And if you could tell me your philosophical history of the heart

03:10.600 --> 03:18.760
problem and your perception of it, what would that story be? Well, I don't have my 2017 paper in

03:18.760 --> 03:25.880
front of me, but it was David Chalmers who described what he considered the heart problem.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.160
And my comment about it was the following.

03:39.720 --> 03:49.400
Let's go back to the orbits of the planets. If we can predict the orbits of the planets

03:49.480 --> 03:57.240
with great precision, we don't have to necessarily visit them. We don't have to touch

03:57.240 --> 04:08.760
easily them. It's a description that's predictively effective. And so my comment at the beginning

04:08.760 --> 04:14.680
of my magnum opus, and I think I made a very similar comment in my 2017 paper is,

04:15.640 --> 04:25.080
let's say you have a neural network model, which describes identified brain cells and

04:26.680 --> 04:36.040
identified regions of the brain interacting in a way that's validated by neurobiological data,

04:36.040 --> 04:44.920
anatomical and physiological, in some cases, biochemical. And let's say the emergent properties

04:44.920 --> 04:53.560
map quantitatively onto lots of behaviors that interest you, including parametric properties

04:53.560 --> 05:04.200
of conscious experiences like seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing things. That's all equations

05:04.200 --> 05:19.880
can do for you. And if you expect an equation to see color or to hear musical tone, that will

05:19.880 --> 05:27.800
never happen. And it doesn't happen in mind brain science, but it doesn't happen in physics or

05:27.800 --> 05:36.680
chemistry. And people have come to understand that if you get predictive insight based on

05:36.680 --> 05:49.160
harmonious laws that make things seem clear, that's enough. To think you would get more,

05:49.160 --> 05:57.240
which is implicit in the definition of the hard problem, is asking for something that equations

05:57.880 --> 06:04.520
can never give you in any science and only look to sciences that are better developed to realize

06:05.080 --> 06:10.120
you don't really need it to feel quite satisfied that you've understood something.

06:11.480 --> 06:22.360
So that's my response. It's sufficient. Of course, it is a mystery. And as I point out, let's say

06:23.080 --> 06:30.520
right down to the photons. And for example, Gail Carpenter and I, among other colleagues,

06:31.320 --> 06:43.800
did very detailed models of the transduction of color signals in vertebrate cones.

06:44.680 --> 06:53.880
And we were able to quantitatively simulate very hard data using designs that you could see had

06:53.880 --> 07:05.080
been using many other parts of our brains. But the model doesn't see color. It just describes how we

07:05.080 --> 07:16.200
see color. And there is that explanatory gap. And I, for one, don't see how equations can ever

07:17.320 --> 07:23.560
bridge the gap, but we don't need equations to do it because we have our conscious minds.

07:24.520 --> 07:35.000
So one of your quotes in the paper was, as in quantum theory,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.520
there are measurement limitations in understanding our brains. We can no more personally ride an

07:40.520 --> 07:45.240
electron than we can enter a neuron that is participating in a conscious experience.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.280
That's pretty much along the lines of what you're trying to say.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.760
Yeah, it is what I'm trying to say. And of course, there are superb

07:54.760 --> 08:05.160
nurses now who do enter neurons. In fact, a colleague or a miller at MIT might put an array of

08:05.160 --> 08:11.480
a hundred or more electrodes in three different parts of the brain and do experiments with the

08:11.480 --> 08:19.240
way behaving monkeys to try to correlate what the monkeys are seeing and doing with the recordings.

08:19.960 --> 08:30.840
And it's very insightful. And if you have a strong enough theory to explain what these patterns

08:30.840 --> 08:39.800
mean for emergent properties to link brain to mind, to link brain to the perception of the action,

08:40.200 --> 08:45.880
but that is extremely useful. But in itself, without a theory,

08:49.080 --> 08:57.320
it's not satisfying enough. You need more. You know, where's the spice?

09:01.000 --> 09:07.560
Yeah, so what are your thoughts on Thomas Nagels? What is it like that that specific component

09:07.560 --> 09:11.800
of consciousness, what is it like? And the fact that we'll never really be able to say what it's

09:11.800 --> 09:21.400
like to be a bad slow... Well, to the extent to which what it's like is that having an equation

09:22.680 --> 09:30.120
that is the qualia, you can't do that. That's what I just said. But there are cases already,

09:30.120 --> 09:37.800
many cases, where we've developed models, principled models that you can understand are using

09:37.800 --> 09:49.000
principles that are parsimoniously used in many processes that can tell you a lot about

09:50.440 --> 09:56.920
different percepts. And where the end, like what's the difference between vision and auditions, say?

09:57.720 --> 10:07.400
Well, even though the circuits, even though the equations, I mean the local neuronal processes

10:07.400 --> 10:14.760
and the modules, as I talked about last time, a certain number of conserved microcircuits that

10:14.760 --> 10:23.080
are used for many things, may be shared in vision and auditions, if you look at how they're specialized

10:23.880 --> 10:33.240
in order to be sensitive to environmental invariance of those signals in the world,

10:33.800 --> 10:41.400
photons and phonons, and how they're organized by sound sources. Then you can begin to understand,

10:41.400 --> 10:50.120
wow, this is really fascinating, because here is a universal computational substrate that can be

10:50.200 --> 10:56.760
specialized to resonate with the invariance of different environmental experiences.

10:57.800 --> 11:08.360
And that is the power of how evolution has crafted our brains in order to be able to do that.

11:09.080 --> 11:17.160
And we know that there are a variety of species that are resonating on things that

11:18.120 --> 11:29.800
we can't do, like consider honey bees or consider the vision of birds. Certain birds

11:30.680 --> 11:35.480
from hundreds of feet in the air can detect the movement of a fish under the water and

11:35.480 --> 11:44.600
dive straight down to it, but we can't do that. But that doesn't mean that their neurons, their

11:44.600 --> 11:53.160
fundamental components are something totally unfamiliar. That's not true. And that's why,

11:53.160 --> 12:05.640
for quite a while, people studied invertebrate circuitries like crayfish, swimmerettes, etc., etc.

12:06.600 --> 12:15.720
And one of my colleagues many years ago, Al Silverstein out in California, I hope he's still

12:15.720 --> 12:29.480
alive, a wonderful scientist. He had, I guess, studied the stomatogastric ganglion of, I think

12:29.560 --> 12:37.800
it was the lobster, and he had characterized, on multiple levels of physiology, anatomy,

12:37.800 --> 12:43.160
all the parts. And when it was all in said and done, he still didn't know how it worked.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.360
And he said that. And that was because it's an emergent property of all those parts,

12:48.360 --> 12:56.520
interacting in a highly nonlinear feedback manner. And I'll acknowledge that he did what you could do

12:57.480 --> 13:06.600
with brilliant experiments. And then you need a level of description, notably a sufficiently

13:06.600 --> 13:13.400
powerful model, that can show how those components interact to generate the emergent properties

13:13.400 --> 13:20.600
that are the adaptive behavior of the stomatogastric ganglion, or whatever else

13:21.160 --> 13:30.200
we're considering. So it's that speculative leap we talked about a little last time,

13:31.240 --> 13:38.200
you know, how you discover that it's not, we don't have an algorithm for it. In fact,

13:39.240 --> 13:45.560
my colleague Rudy Kalman, I don't know if you studied the Kalman filter, which is used in

13:46.360 --> 13:53.320
many problems in prediction and engineering. And he was trying to characterize,

13:56.680 --> 14:05.800
in a very rigorous way, linear controllers. But at least at the time, he said, when he got the

14:05.800 --> 14:12.440
multi-linear controllers, he couldn't even do that. You know, the methods he had just weren't

14:12.440 --> 14:20.120
powerful enough. So the miracle is that somehow the methods that I've been lucky enough to discover

14:20.680 --> 14:31.080
have not hit that brick wall yet. And lots of other people use them in one form or another,

14:31.080 --> 14:36.360
including in technology. And as I may have mentioned last time, one of the reasons why

14:37.080 --> 14:43.640
Gail Carpenter and I, and a number of our PhD students and post-docs, were eager to

14:45.480 --> 14:54.840
specialize our model discoveries into applications in engineering technology and AI

14:56.200 --> 15:05.400
was to show they work in the real world. And, you know, one way you can show they work in a way

15:06.840 --> 15:14.200
that people who don't really care at all about mind and brain is by doing a technological

15:14.200 --> 15:19.080
application that they do care about and frankly can make a lot of money for them.

15:22.440 --> 15:31.480
Yeah. Steve, the approach that the science of the brain and the approach of philosophy of mind

15:31.480 --> 15:37.320
are very different. As a scientist fundamentally involved in this interface of mind and body,

15:38.440 --> 15:43.640
what are your thoughts on philosophy as a whole regarding their approach to this topic or

15:43.640 --> 15:50.040
philosophy's engagement in this field? Because definitions play a big role and there's often

15:50.040 --> 15:57.640
arguments. I mean, within philosophy, even merely starting with the brain as the source of consciousness

15:57.640 --> 16:02.200
seems to be problematic for many philosophers. You have philosophers who claim that consciousness

16:02.200 --> 16:07.880
is fundamental to reality. You have others that claim that consciousness is a fundamental feature

16:07.880 --> 16:13.320
of reality, so panpsychism, which integrated information theory is pretty much a form of

16:13.320 --> 16:20.200
that. Are you able as a scientist to even have a conversation with those people with such

16:21.160 --> 16:24.360
different views from your own? Well,

16:29.080 --> 16:35.640
I always ask, what can you explain with your concepts? And by explain, I mean facts, data.

16:37.560 --> 16:42.440
If you can't explain anything, then you're not even in the ballpark yet.

16:42.440 --> 16:57.560
Now, one of the things that's fascinated me personally is, I don't know if you looked at

16:58.440 --> 17:06.440
a later chapter in my book, it's about really simple evolutionary precursors of

17:06.840 --> 17:14.200
brains. I talk about a universal developmental code and show how

17:17.480 --> 17:26.200
mathematical laws and primitive circuits that are controlling the development of

17:26.200 --> 17:35.720
non-neural single cell or multicellular organisms have many of the

17:38.200 --> 17:45.960
features that the laws have that I might use to explain mammalian and human data.

17:46.920 --> 17:54.840
You know, I talked about hydra's heads and slime old aggregation and stuff like that.

17:55.960 --> 18:04.120
And to me, it wasn't an accident that I published an article in 1978

18:05.720 --> 18:12.840
called Communication Memory and Development, where I described these things theoretically.

18:13.640 --> 18:23.320
And in the same year, I published, you know, an early magnum opus called the theory of human memory,

18:23.320 --> 18:30.680
colon and then more stuff about what was in it. In fact, together they were book length and I

18:30.680 --> 18:37.480
originally planned to publish it as a book, but I was young and foolish. I didn't know what I was

18:37.480 --> 18:46.840
doing. And so, Robert Rosen, Bob Rosen, who was a very sweet and, you know, significant

18:48.360 --> 18:55.640
mathematical biologist, also was an editor of a book series called Progress in Theoretical

18:55.640 --> 19:04.360
Biology and he was eager to publish the two articles as articles, but by putting it in

19:04.360 --> 19:10.600
something called Progress in Theoretical Biology, it buried it from the viewpoint of marketing. So

19:10.600 --> 19:17.480
that was one of many naive things I've done in my life that I could kick myself for, but

19:18.200 --> 19:25.400
I'm just a naive guy, basically. And I welcome it because having a naive approach to stuff

19:26.280 --> 19:32.520
really helps you to be creative. You don't come in with, you know, too many preconceived ideas.

19:33.000 --> 19:40.360
There's a cost for it and so far the cost has been worth it. But I should have published a major

19:40.360 --> 19:53.640
book in 78 on mind and brain. As it is, I wised up a little and by 82, I published a book that

19:53.640 --> 20:01.560
brought together my articles, but, you know, and that I think a lot of people were influenced by.

20:02.680 --> 20:07.800
It was called Studies of Mind and Brain. I think it's still in print in some form.

20:10.360 --> 20:17.800
Anyway, so you have people like Edelman and Tanoni. I order information theories and

20:18.520 --> 20:23.080
integrated information theory. At some point, this is quite a lengthy quote, so bear with me.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.600
This is your words. I mean, they used the word information as a critical component of their

20:28.600 --> 20:33.800
hypothesis. But what is information? The scientific concept of information in the

20:33.800 --> 20:39.560
mathematical sense of information theory by Shannon requires that a set of states exist

20:39.560 --> 20:45.240
whose information can be computed and that fixed probabilities exist for transitions between these

20:45.240 --> 20:51.640
states. In contrast, the brain is a self-organizing system that continually creates new states

20:51.640 --> 20:55.960
through development and learning and whose probability structure is continually changing

20:56.040 --> 21:02.040
along with them. Without a theory that explains how these states arise and how their transition

21:02.040 --> 21:06.920
probabilities may change through time in response to changing environmental statistics and internal

21:06.920 --> 21:13.400
representations thereof, the classical concept of information is useless. You want to unpack that a

21:13.400 --> 21:20.200
bit for us. Well, I think you just did. I mean, I'm not sure what else. I mean,

21:24.920 --> 21:34.360
yeah, well, Jerry Edelman was a very brilliant man and a Nobel laureate. There are a lot of Jerry

21:34.360 --> 21:43.320
Edelman stories I won't go into, but he was a faculty member at the Rockefeller University

21:43.320 --> 21:49.080
when I was a graduate student there. And one of the more favorable descriptions of Jerry was

21:49.720 --> 22:01.800
the Black Knight. And I won't go beyond that in this public forum, but he made very

22:03.640 --> 22:09.240
many useful contributions. And then as many Nobel laureates decided, hey,

22:10.040 --> 22:17.080
you know, the next great frontier is brain, I'm going to get my next Nobel laureate in brain. But

22:17.720 --> 22:23.880
the problem was Jerry didn't know any data. You know, and I was lucky to grow up

22:23.880 --> 22:34.680
daved in data, which is where I comfortably live. And you can't go very far if you don't know the

22:34.680 --> 22:43.160
data. And to know me initially, although I haven't kept track of his work, he's a clever person,

22:45.480 --> 22:53.880
try to give a scalar to discuss, you know, whether I don't remember the details in such a long time,

22:54.840 --> 23:00.120
whether the system was complex enough to, you know,

23:02.600 --> 23:10.840
I think, do consciousness or something. My remark was, hey, you can't do anything with a scalar,

23:11.640 --> 23:19.800
you know, I mean, we have a brain after all for a reason. But to the extent to which

23:19.880 --> 23:23.560
everyone's contribution is useful.

23:27.480 --> 23:36.280
Hey, do it. I only view problems if work is useful, and it's not just hype,

23:36.280 --> 23:40.680
of which we know today there's a huge amount of hype. And

23:43.400 --> 23:47.320
if it's done in a solipsistic environment,

23:49.880 --> 23:57.240
I always taught my students and it was a policy about apartment. Whenever we were studying models

23:57.240 --> 24:03.400
to do it in a comparative setting, what are all the models out there? What are their strengths

24:03.400 --> 24:10.120
and weaknesses? If we have models we favor, do they have weaknesses that are the models have

24:10.120 --> 24:17.400
overcome? And if they have, how can our models be refined and further developed to also do that?

24:17.400 --> 24:25.000
So that's a certain attitude. And if everyone's making their proposal in the context of a

24:25.000 --> 24:34.840
comparative analysis, then hey, go for it, it's good. But if it's solipsistic and if it's aimed

24:34.840 --> 24:42.680
at selling any idea in a, I'll push it to the limit here, a cult-like setting,

24:42.920 --> 24:53.640
we know that's bad news. And to me, the worst part of it is students go into

24:56.440 --> 25:02.840
courses with famous professors or any professor who they like as a teacher.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.360
And they're going to try to absorb everything the teacher says

25:08.840 --> 25:15.720
at the time of life when you can learn better than at any other time in your life,

25:16.280 --> 25:25.880
if only to get a good grade. And it's really not proper, I would almost go so far to say it's not

25:25.880 --> 25:35.080
ethical to give kids a misleading view of the world that they're about to have to live in.

25:35.880 --> 25:41.080
If you know better, if you don't know something's out there, hey, you do the best you can, that's

25:41.080 --> 25:47.720
all any of us can do. But if you know something's out there and you try to shield your kids from it

25:47.720 --> 25:53.720
because, hey, your work isn't as good and you want your kids to do what you do so you can

25:53.720 --> 26:02.600
publish more papers or whatever, that's unethical in my mind. That's the strongest I put it. Usually

26:02.600 --> 26:13.400
I'd say it's just in a weak character, opportunism, marketing, those words are dead enough.

26:15.320 --> 26:21.000
The last, so the last time we went very in-depth on an adaptive residence theory in most of your

26:21.000 --> 26:27.560
work, obviously it's just scratching the surface of what is very complex. And as a scientist,

26:27.560 --> 26:32.360
I mean, huge respect for your work and everybody seems to have a consensus regarding that. So

26:32.360 --> 26:36.600
I've tried to frame this conversation slightly more philosophically so that people can get a deeper

26:36.600 --> 26:41.800
understanding of the science behind the work and what its implications on the heart problem as a whole

26:41.800 --> 26:47.480
are. And with that in mind, the understanding of other theories of consciousness are important

26:47.480 --> 26:52.920
because with yours you can highlight flaws within theirs, just the same way you did with the information

26:52.920 --> 26:58.600
aspect of this one. Along those lines of Nobel laureates doing that, you've got others like

26:58.600 --> 27:05.000
Francis Crick, Penrose, very different types of theories of consciousness. You've got someone who

27:05.000 --> 27:09.720
is approaching it from a pan-psychist perspective who's claiming that consciousness is that fundamental

27:09.720 --> 27:17.000
feature. And then you've got someone like Penrose who claims that consciousness is almost quantum

27:17.320 --> 27:24.360
in a sense and beyond what classical physics can interpret. And therefore the data in this case

27:24.360 --> 27:31.640
would not be as easily applicable. What do you think about that? Sorry, that was a very long question.

27:33.400 --> 27:42.040
Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but it's always, you know, what theories have the

27:43.000 --> 27:55.400
broadest and most principled explanatory range and how many of their predictions have been

27:55.400 --> 28:05.720
supported by subsequent data. And in terms of quantum brain, you know, there's an obvious sense in

28:05.800 --> 28:13.080
which our brain's a quantum, hey, well, matter comes out of quantum mechanics or some kind of

28:13.080 --> 28:20.120
quantum reality, even if quantum mechanics is not yet a complete theory as some people think and,

28:20.120 --> 28:29.720
you know, string theory and all that. So obviously, you know, the structure of matter would embody

28:29.720 --> 28:39.480
ourselves in a world that has a quantum substrate. But I take the kind of work I've done as an

28:39.480 --> 28:51.480
existence proof. And there have been many times in my life when I've been dying to use some kind of

28:51.560 --> 29:02.200
concepts to explain the kinds of phenomena that I'm really yearning to understand.

29:03.000 --> 29:10.280
And the existence proof here is that if you look at all the things that I,

29:10.280 --> 29:15.560
my colleagues have explained, which I think has the broadest and deepest,

29:15.560 --> 29:21.480
interdisciplinary explanatory range, linking brain to mind of any existing theory,

29:22.680 --> 29:36.840
I've never needed quantum theory, except, except for example, at the sensory level.

29:37.560 --> 29:46.760
So, for example, I mentioned briefly Gil Carpenter and I did some work on

29:50.600 --> 29:58.920
photoreceptor transduction and vertebrate cones. And what that means is photons come in,

29:59.880 --> 30:07.560
photons to the quantum constituents of light, you know, the whole thing with Einstein and

30:07.560 --> 30:17.400
Wake particle dualism and all those profound things. But photons come in. And the question is,

30:18.600 --> 30:27.480
how does a photo detector, which is at the front end of registering that there's something

30:27.480 --> 30:35.000
going on in the visual world, how does it generate a signal through the retina to the optic nerve?

30:35.000 --> 30:45.400
And one of the things we realized is that the brain, our brains in many species,

30:45.880 --> 30:53.720
I think we were doing turtle, I think with turtle photoreceptors because, oh gosh,

30:57.080 --> 31:02.760
you know, it's been so long ago. Some really wonderful experimentalists that worked up

31:03.480 --> 31:10.520
turtle phototransduction. And it was a parametric database, really challenging. And

31:11.320 --> 31:22.200
there were some really bizarre, at the first lush properties of the data curves. And what we

31:22.200 --> 31:34.280
showed is that if you had a temporal averaging of the photons, just so you're computing a photon

31:34.280 --> 31:43.000
density, and you know, it would rise and then it would fall when a little event occurred,

31:43.000 --> 31:49.560
we showed with simple ideas like that, you'd be quantitatively explaining all those data. So we

31:50.680 --> 31:54.440
faced the problem that you have to

31:55.400 --> 32:03.320
transduce from individual photons, which is on the quantum level, into a classical description

32:04.840 --> 32:12.600
of neuronal dynamics. We needed some stuff you don't use everywhere. And that

32:13.640 --> 32:20.360
is a simple version that goes way back in phylogeny. And I've talked about

32:21.320 --> 32:31.720
with some of my graduate students, we looked at multiple species that have these precursors,

32:31.720 --> 32:41.000
what ultimately, a discovery I may call spectral timing, which is

32:41.160 --> 32:53.800
both in space and in time. Our brains face the problem of going from,

32:55.560 --> 32:59.960
you know, you could respond to a single photon, but that's too short to register any

33:00.600 --> 33:11.720
microscopic event. Or in space, you could have a cell that's selective to just a very little region,

33:12.280 --> 33:18.920
but that's not going to influence your navigational behavior. So one of the things I

33:18.920 --> 33:25.160
talked about in my book, I like to sort of say it in a cute way, how do little nerve cells

33:26.120 --> 33:36.680
generate spatial and temporal representations that can influence adaptive behaviors. And

33:38.520 --> 33:48.920
a key ingredient in that turns out are called grid cells and time cells. And one of the things I

33:49.000 --> 33:54.360
loved about this modeling, much of which I did with Praveen Pilli, a brilliant

33:55.320 --> 34:04.440
PhD student of mine who then worked with me in much more senior positions before he got,

34:04.440 --> 34:09.880
I think, I think he's got quite an important job at Intel now.

34:10.200 --> 34:20.040
They obeyed basically the same laws, and they're in two parallel streams

34:21.160 --> 34:26.200
in the entorhinal to hippocampal cortex. And because of this

34:26.520 --> 34:39.960
homology between the spatial and temporal laws, I love to say, you know, give me a break here,

34:40.600 --> 34:50.280
space and time are one. And I called it neural relativity, because space and time are one.

34:50.280 --> 34:59.000
But the parsimony of it was breathtaking. Now, you know, the evolutionary precursors of that,

34:59.640 --> 35:08.520
someone else is going to have to look at, but I'm condensed. They'll love the answer,

35:09.320 --> 35:16.760
you know, and it'll be well worth their time. But to be able to say space and time are one and to

35:16.760 --> 35:22.840
show, you know, and we're talking about entorhinal cortex, I didn't know from entorhinal cortex when

35:22.840 --> 35:33.880
I was young, it's an acquired taste, you get forced into it by conceptual questions that you then get

35:34.520 --> 35:40.840
stuck on, you get hung up on until you've got to get an answer, not the final answer, there's no

35:40.840 --> 35:51.400
final answer, but a computationally effective and experimentally remarkably successful pair of

35:51.400 --> 36:01.320
models. They, Praveen and I didn't mainly the space part of it, but we were able to simulate

36:02.280 --> 36:10.360
quantitatively very challenging parametric data about grid cell dynamics. And then the time stuff

36:10.360 --> 36:19.080
I did with a series of other PhD students, Nestosh Mayak and John Merrill, among others.

36:22.360 --> 36:28.520
So I had called it spectral timing because there's a spectrum of cells.

36:31.320 --> 36:36.920
If you want to go from little nerve cells to temporal delays, you could bridge. So let's say,

36:37.880 --> 36:50.520
to give a simple example, let's say I'm a human or a pigeon or a rat, or let's say that I have to wait

36:51.640 --> 36:58.360
two or three seconds after a stimulus to make a response in order to get my reward,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.840
and if I prematurely make the response I might get punished.

37:02.840 --> 37:09.800
Not so different like a student in a classroom, you have to know when it's okay to raise your hand.

37:10.920 --> 37:16.200
And so spectral timing, you have lots of nerve cells, each with its own local

37:21.000 --> 37:29.160
firing delay because they all have different rates of firing. So one cell might fire a bump,

37:29.160 --> 37:38.120
another cell might fire a bump, another cell might fire a bump, bump, bump. And if the stimulus

37:38.120 --> 37:45.000
activates the whole spectrum, it turns out that each of those cells has an adaptive weight assigned

37:45.000 --> 37:54.040
to it. And the correlation between the stimulus and when the action is trained to occur is going

37:54.040 --> 38:04.440
to strengthen some cells in the spectrum better than others. So for example, you could train,

38:04.440 --> 38:11.640
I'm not sure if I can show you this. Steve, do you mind bringing more to your left?

38:12.840 --> 38:19.080
I'm going to jiggle. I didn't do it. Bringing more to your left, Steve, the other way. Yes.

38:19.880 --> 38:28.360
Can you see? Oh, there they are. They're the curves. So you know, it's in an

38:29.560 --> 38:37.320
time is plotted against activity. And for example, you can get spectral cells to fire

38:37.320 --> 38:45.240
selectively at two distinct times. And if you notice the bump at the earlier time is narrower

38:46.040 --> 38:54.440
than the bump at the later time, that is a signature of spectral timing. And you find it

38:55.400 --> 38:58.920
in the cerebellum, you find it in the basal ganglia.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.840
I'm blocking the several other parts of the brain, you find it and I can't

39:07.480 --> 39:16.040
pull it all up fast enough. It is a conserved mechanism. And you also find evolutionary

39:16.040 --> 39:26.040
precursors of it in very primitive organisms where it isn't even neural. It is a way of

39:26.040 --> 39:32.920
doing a kind of blocks law, a trade off between time and energy. That's what's behind it.

39:33.400 --> 39:41.640
But that kind of spectral time that I just showed you, you can record from in cerebellum

39:45.480 --> 39:48.360
parallel fiber, pecensio cell synapses.

39:51.640 --> 39:59.800
So Steve, I'm sorry, you finished that first? No, I was forgetting why I was telling you

39:59.800 --> 40:05.160
this. What triggered this reply? It's fine. Maybe if I ask the next question, it'll come back to you.

40:06.440 --> 40:11.640
On that note, you're talking about the fact that it's also not just in neural cells.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.320
There's work being done by people like Michael Levin. He's at Tufts University,

40:17.960 --> 40:22.680
where they started to show this blurry nature of what intelligence seems to be. Now,

40:23.480 --> 40:28.920
fair enough, some people might argue that defining the word intelligence here plays a big role. But

40:29.800 --> 40:34.520
in a nutshell, what he's trying to say is there's bio-electrical communication occurring

40:34.520 --> 40:41.880
between cells that goes beyond what our hardwired DNA is producing to communicate between cells.

40:43.800 --> 40:49.240
Because of that, they're able to actually do some incredible work at this lab. It's called Levin

40:49.240 --> 40:52.440
Lab. I don't know if you want to check this out afterwards, but they're able to create...

40:53.400 --> 41:00.840
I've interacted with Michael Levin at Tufts in the past, but you're not giving me a

41:00.840 --> 41:08.680
good focus and a prime need to remember what we were interacting about. Because there was

41:08.680 --> 41:14.520
something he was doing that I thought some of my work clarified, but I'm just talking about

41:14.520 --> 41:24.040
intelligence. I can't remember. In essence, he's work starting to almost confirm panpsychism as a

41:24.040 --> 41:31.960
theory of consciousness in the sense that panpsychism basically means that consciousness

41:31.960 --> 41:38.600
is a fundamental feature of reality, not in the sense that consciousness is just everywhere.

41:39.400 --> 41:43.080
A lot of people, technically, that is what they mean. But for the most part...

41:43.320 --> 41:48.840
Let me interrupt you there just because that reminded me of why I was telling you a lot of this

41:48.840 --> 42:04.200
stuff. The reason why I was telling you about some of these primitive and not even neural

42:04.520 --> 42:16.760
mechanisms is because, for example, there are very primitive processes which have

42:17.480 --> 42:24.040
properties of resonance, in fact, adaptive resonance. One of the ones that I talked about

42:24.040 --> 42:30.600
in my communication memory and development paper way back in 78, and then I review it in

42:31.080 --> 42:41.240
chapter 15 or 16, I forget, in my 17. And my magnum opus has to do with the process whereby a

42:41.240 --> 42:51.080
blastula during when you have a single cell, very early embryo, becomes a gastrula.

42:51.960 --> 43:04.200
You know, you start with a spherically symmetric set of cells after the first few stages of

43:04.200 --> 43:11.400
mitosis, and then some of the cells get selectively active and they start

43:12.200 --> 43:18.520
sending pseudopodia to the other side of the

43:20.680 --> 43:26.920
blastula. And on the other side, certain cells develop adhesiveness,

43:28.600 --> 43:38.520
and when some of those pseudopodia hit the adhesive cells, they stick. And then this

43:38.520 --> 43:45.240
accumulates until enough of these. It's an autocatalytic interaction until enough of these

43:45.240 --> 43:55.560
pseudopodes connect. Now, why is that going to do something? It's because the pseudopodes have

43:55.560 --> 44:01.000
contractal properties. You know, if they go up and they don't hit, they might come down and go up.

44:01.960 --> 44:06.520
If enough of them stick, it becomes like a primitive muscle,

44:07.960 --> 44:13.800
and they contract, and then they pull the cells on the two sides together,

44:14.680 --> 44:18.920
and that starts to create a gastrula. It's gastrulation. It's the next step

44:19.720 --> 44:25.400
in cellular development. And in my communication memory and development paper, way, way back,

44:25.400 --> 44:39.160
I began to realize that these morphogenetic processes already embodied primitive versions

44:39.880 --> 44:46.920
of things like adaptive resonance, because when the connections occur,

44:47.480 --> 44:57.480
the prediction is they get more and more tuned, which strengthens the sensation. And as I recall,

44:57.480 --> 45:03.080
there were some later data that were at least partially consistent, but very hard experiment

45:03.080 --> 45:08.680
to do directly. But my prediction would be it's a simple form of adaptive resonance

45:09.640 --> 45:20.360
in an early stage of morphogenesis, multiple species. And there are a number of examples of these.

45:22.280 --> 45:31.000
Remember, I talked about complementary computing, a kind of yin-yang fitting together. And that goes

45:31.960 --> 45:38.520
in multiple parts of biology, too. And although I'm going to make a statement now that,

45:41.960 --> 45:49.720
it's the rankest form of speculation that doesn't give you any predictive ability beyond what

45:49.720 --> 45:58.600
wonderful scientists have already done, I think an example of that complementary computing is

45:58.600 --> 46:12.200
the double helix, the DNA and RNA double helixes. It's a way of bringing complementary stuff together

46:12.200 --> 46:19.880
and into a more complete representation of the information you need to do stuff.

46:20.840 --> 46:32.040
I would love to see Barbara McClintock did wonderful work on dancing

46:32.840 --> 46:38.360
genes. I don't think that was quite it. But trying to get at the dynamics of how

46:39.320 --> 46:45.640
the double helix, which usually you see in a static form and some wonderful

46:46.040 --> 46:55.000
chemical architecture, but it's very dynamic. It's always doing stuff.

46:57.080 --> 47:04.600
So I think there's resonance and complementarity everywhere. And remember, last time I talked

47:04.600 --> 47:10.680
about the fact that in many parts of my work there are principles of complementarity,

47:11.640 --> 47:20.120
uncertainty and resonance. And we know, coming back to quantum theory, those are principles at

47:20.120 --> 47:26.600
the core of quantum theory. That doesn't mean that we are operating on the quantum level.

47:27.160 --> 47:35.880
It just means these are kind of universal principles of nature. And we, through evolutionary

47:35.880 --> 47:43.480
adaptation over the eons, have been built embodying them in a form that could support

47:43.480 --> 47:54.360
animal intelligence. So if you ask about anti-psychism and stuff, well, you're never going to get

47:54.360 --> 48:01.480
into that system just like you're not going to write an electron. But hey, they're built on very

48:02.440 --> 48:14.440
similar principles as we are. And I feel I've understood more by commenting about these three

48:15.240 --> 48:26.280
general principles that are conserved over phylogeny and evolutionary time than just saying the word

48:26.360 --> 48:33.720
pence, psychism, which I want to know exactly what are you talking about? Because it's a lovely

48:33.720 --> 48:39.320
phrase and it's important to have a lovely phrase, but I need to know where's the beef here?

48:39.320 --> 48:47.800
Where is the beef? Where is it? What's the beef? So just to define it a little bit,

48:49.960 --> 48:55.160
Mike once wrote a paper with Daniel Dennett. I think this would be a nice way to reel it in.

48:55.160 --> 48:59.640
It's called cognition all the way down. And the reason why I bring that paper up is because

48:59.640 --> 49:05.560
at some point I was going to mention it, you do mention it in your paper. And Dennett doesn't

49:05.560 --> 49:11.720
have a panpsychist view. So panpsychism is pretty much the, it pretty much means consciousness is

49:11.720 --> 49:16.680
everywhere, not always in the very mystical sense that a lot of people seem to think of it. They're

49:16.680 --> 49:24.760
pretty much trying to come across by saying that cognition or proto-cognition or even proto-consciousness

49:24.760 --> 49:31.240
can be found within smaller layers of reality in terms of a human. So you can go down into like,

49:31.240 --> 49:37.400
let's say tissues and cells and within those biological processes, you can find forms of

49:37.400 --> 49:49.240
proto-consciousness. Well, I don't necessarily agree with it. Wait, let me, you really have

49:49.240 --> 49:57.000
to be clear about what you mean by consciousness. Yes, I agree with that completely. I've already

49:57.000 --> 50:07.880
given you examples with guest relation and with talking about complementarity and resonance

50:07.880 --> 50:17.160
and uncertainty going all through the natural world that these things go all the way down.

50:17.800 --> 50:28.120
Now, the question is, what's the definition of cognition that you're using here and what's the

50:28.120 --> 50:38.040
definition of consciousness? There are these shared processes. As I remarked in our last discussion,

50:38.280 --> 50:49.480
I'm happy to believe that every species that solves the stability plus disability dilemma

50:50.680 --> 50:57.640
has some form of consciousness because, you know, my own work, I showed that to do that,

50:58.680 --> 51:06.680
at least in everything I've seen in experiments and models, you need a combination

51:07.400 --> 51:13.720
of learning expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony. And when you have all those things,

51:14.760 --> 51:24.440
if you're exposed to an external world that has stable enough events

51:26.040 --> 51:32.360
for you to actually learn something with spatial and temporal stability, then

51:33.000 --> 51:42.440
the process will also give you form of consciousness, either of recognition or of perception.

51:43.720 --> 51:49.800
But that was a big if, too. You know, what is the stable world that

51:51.400 --> 51:58.760
resonant events are interacting with? And is it what we would call consciousness or cognition?

51:59.480 --> 52:05.080
So I think that until I hear their definitions and how they've used to explain something

52:05.080 --> 52:12.520
interesting, I would be more comfortable just saying stuff like I said, giving examples of

52:14.360 --> 52:17.480
shared mechanisms like adaptive resonance and

52:17.640 --> 52:31.640
gastrulation and this complementarity all over the place. But cognizant all the way down, it's cute.

52:32.760 --> 52:42.280
In your paper, you mentioned. But as I pointed out in my book, Dan, who is a very bright

52:43.240 --> 52:53.240
leading philosopher of mind, also wrote things about neon color spreading that are just wrong.

52:54.120 --> 53:00.200
And then he became sarcastic about all the fools who actually believe it's a phenomenon.

53:01.400 --> 53:11.080
And it really sarcasm in science is that hominem and gratuitous. And he was especially embarrassing

53:11.080 --> 53:17.960
when he was wrong. And at a meeting where I invited him to speak because I don't only invite people

53:17.960 --> 53:26.440
who agree with. He said to the audience that he was wrong. But I'm not sure if after he left

53:26.440 --> 53:34.280
the meeting, he still said he would just surround it by good psychosis and neuroscientists and

53:34.280 --> 53:44.360
modelers and what exactly did he say? What exactly he well, I think part of my talk was,

53:45.240 --> 53:52.760
I think, you know, it's so long ago explaining a lot of data about how we consciously see,

53:53.640 --> 54:00.600
you know, brightness, perception, form, the end color spreading. You know,

54:00.680 --> 54:05.880
general surface filling in the complementarity of perceptual boundaries and surfaces.

54:07.720 --> 54:15.880
And he was one of two philosophers of mind I invited. Anyway, he just got up and started

54:15.880 --> 54:24.920
his talk with that retraction. Because what, you know, if he had claimed it again, people would

54:24.920 --> 54:35.880
say, but Steve just explained data about it. It exists. You can see it, you know, with your own

54:37.000 --> 54:43.880
mind. So I don't know where he stands on it now. He's very bright and very creative.

54:44.680 --> 54:50.760
But he went too far there and he was wrong. And what made what annoyed me was it's my

54:51.400 --> 54:59.000
current understanding that he first heard about neon color spreading. When he came kindly,

54:59.000 --> 55:04.120
I don't take it to granted, people come to my lecture, he came to a talk I gave on vision in

55:04.120 --> 55:11.720
which one of the kinds of data I was explaining was neon color spreading data. And, you know,

55:11.800 --> 55:22.440
as part of a more integrated view of a lot of visual processes, like neon color spreading is,

55:23.240 --> 55:30.440
you know, the reason it got popular. Well, one reason it got popular is because we

55:31.160 --> 55:42.520
pulled it out of anonymity, because I could see that it gave really good visible evidence

55:43.400 --> 55:49.800
of our predicted laws of how boundaries and surfaces interact, because there were colors

55:49.800 --> 55:54.840
where there shouldn't have been colors. And I actually

55:54.920 --> 56:02.920
emphasized it. And then Ken Akiyama and Mike Paradiso and other people picked up on it

56:03.480 --> 56:12.760
and started doing more experimental work on it. But it was lying, unnoticed, until the theory

56:12.760 --> 56:21.480
clarified how remarkable the interactions were and gave compelling evidence of surface filling in,

56:21.480 --> 56:25.800
which is precisely what Dan was saying doesn't exist.

56:27.640 --> 56:31.000
Yes, that is something you hear. And it's not the only one, you know, Mike,

56:31.640 --> 56:38.120
my very gifted colleague, Ben Jo Pina, has what he calls a watercolor effect, which is all about

56:38.120 --> 56:45.320
surface filling in. And, you know, you could say this is due to the first competitive state doing

56:46.120 --> 56:52.440
interacting with it. I mean, we can explain it, and you can see it.

56:54.120 --> 57:00.360
Are there any philosophers of mine who's working familiar with who you feel does

57:00.360 --> 57:06.600
represent your form of emergentism in a great way, or your view on consciousness in a similar way?

57:06.840 --> 57:17.080
Well, people don't have to do what I do in any way. I'm blocking on his name. The other philosopher

57:17.080 --> 57:29.480
of mine, who I invited to that meeting long ago, is a Canadian guy. And I forget his name.

57:29.960 --> 57:35.960
It's, I shouldn't to get it, but I, you know, I'd have to prime my stuff, my mind's else for now.

57:36.520 --> 57:41.960
And he gave a lovely talk. I really thought it was a useful, interesting talk.

57:41.960 --> 57:42.920
Is it Paul Churchland?

57:44.760 --> 57:49.160
No, it's not Paul. No, Paul also did serious work.

57:52.760 --> 57:53.400
I'm not sure.

57:54.360 --> 58:02.120
Anyway, but my advice to anyone who wants to talk scientifically about mind and brain is,

58:02.120 --> 58:07.720
read the data, and then read the state of the modeling community,

58:09.880 --> 58:11.880
because you don't want to make a fool of yourself.

58:13.800 --> 58:20.360
No, okay, so with that in mind, so we've discussed the people who have...

58:21.080 --> 58:23.480
Let me, let me make a remark about that. You know,

58:26.760 --> 58:34.760
I forget who said it, but I'm a very distinguished guy who I very much admired.

58:34.760 --> 58:41.960
And, and he gave a keynote lecture. And, and he said, you know,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.240
everybody thinks they can have a theory about how our minds work, we have a mind.

58:48.200 --> 58:55.720
But by extension, we also have electrons and photons and atomic nuclei.

58:55.720 --> 58:58.600
Do we feel we're immediately physicists, you know?

58:59.880 --> 59:05.240
I mean, it's people think introspective evidence will explain their mind, but

59:06.200 --> 59:12.760
remember the main point of cognitive and penetrability is that you and I can see each

59:12.760 --> 59:16.360
other, hear each other, have feelings about each other, learn from each other.

59:17.240 --> 59:22.680
Because we have no cognitive penetrability, we don't know what's up here.

59:23.400 --> 59:27.960
We don't know that even the brain is the seat of intelligence from our daily experience.

59:27.960 --> 59:35.080
And as, you know, anyone who studied the history of neuroscience knows, people originally thought

59:37.080 --> 59:44.360
that other organs were the seat of intelligence, the heart or the pancreas even.

59:45.240 --> 59:48.040
You know, so, yeah.

59:48.040 --> 59:53.000
So, so to you, I mean, fundamentally, the, that phenomenological first person

59:53.720 --> 01:00:00.440
subject of quality, a qualitative feel is explainable via scientific theory.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.040
I'm just, obviously, I'm just playing devil's advocate. I know what your view pretty much is,

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.280
but I want people to understand this as much as possible, that intentionality that people

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:15.000
that intentionality, the aboutness of, of reality for you, that's nothing

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.160
and special about this.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:23.080
Well, again, you have to be very clear about how you use the word intentionality.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:31.640
I mean, for example, an adaptive resonance theory, there are top-down expectations,

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.560
which were a form of intentionality.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:39.720
There are predictions of what's going to happen next, which are a form of intentionality.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:46.920
I'd have to know an example that would be different from that to realize that someone's

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.280
talking about something else.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.840
So you're using the nice word.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.680
Some words are better as chapter headings.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.840
And then you write what you mean by the word in and of themselves.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.320
They don't tell you, do you know what, what meaning of intentionality

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.640
is being expressed here?

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.960
Can you articulate it better?

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.280
I think I say something irrelevant.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.040
What would be, I think maybe the best way for me to do that,

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.800
let me define it from the Stanford X-cycle video philosophy is to make it easier.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.640
In philosophy, intentionality is the power of minds and mental states to be about,

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.240
to represent or to stand for things, properties and states of affairs.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.040
Now, I know in your theory, obviously you address these,

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:46.840
but to a philosopher of mind, this is considered almost a very special property, a qualitative,

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.600
it's difficult for me to actually explain it, to be honest.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.480
That's what all my work is about.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.920
Yeah, I know that's the tip.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.440
But that's what the work does.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:11.080
But when you're talking about what it's about, there are multi-dimensional aspects of that

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.880
knowing, including the perceptual, the cognitive, the recollective,

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:28.920
the emotional, the action, the appetitive, so it's too vague.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.600
The issue is explanatory power.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:47.400
As people have written about time and again in physics, people were doing natural philosophy,

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.640
until they could explain stuff and then it was called physics.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.400
I think that's true of philosophy of mind too.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:07.640
I mean, I took philosophy courses in college and what they were good at was opposing questions,

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:14.360
articulating questions, but if you wanted the answers, you have to turn to science.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:26.440
But also what I found is by getting to a deep principled understanding of something,

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:35.080
it helps me to articulate new questions that I couldn't have done just based on intuition alone.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.960
Intuition is limited.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:49.000
It is so important that because we can't consciously see, because we can't consciously feel and so on,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.840
that helps us to know at least, well, what are we trying to explain?

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.440
I want to explain how I see, how I see color and brightness and texture and

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:05.000
shading and objects and motion and all this stuff.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:13.480
So it gives us a whole series of chapter headings, but to actually explain it,

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.240
you have to think in a totally different way.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:27.000
And finding that way I have found requires an immersion into large databases that probe the

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
different aspects of the properties that you're trying to explain.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.080
You can't just, hey, hey, I bet it's like this and you were right.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.560
The chances are as close to zero as you can imagine.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.800
Hunches are good.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.760
Don't get me wrong.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.720
I mean, hunches help theorists think about, oh, I should have been thinking about that,

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:58.280
but the hunch you'll have after you know a lot will be very different from the hunch you have

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.800
when you know very little.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.000
Steve, you mentioned you know Paul Churchland.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.920
He was a very prominent...

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.480
No, I don't know Paul.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.440
Okay, but you know off Paul.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.920
I just knew, yeah, I knew that he did some good work, but I haven't looked at it for many years.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:20.520
Okay, so there was Paul and Patricia Churchland and they were the theory known as

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:27.160
Eliminative Materialism and what that was was it was it's a very radical claim basically

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.640
ordinary common sense terms.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.080
So common sense understandings of the mind.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.240
They claim to be deeply incorrect.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.200
They felt that folk psychological terms that we use.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.680
So even saying things like learning or thought, etc.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.760
Don't technically work in the physical world because when you take

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:53.320
materialism to be true, you have to realize that reality is just neurons firing.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:58.840
It's actually got there is no secondary reality in psychology where we could say things like,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:04.600
okay, that's thought, that's memory, that's conscious experiences because in reality,

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.360
that's just neurons firing.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.560
That's just blood circulating, etc. etc.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.280
So, yeah, well, what are you?

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:20.280
Well, well, well, first words like learning and thought are more chapter headings.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.160
You know, they're not theories, they're not principles, they're chapter headings.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.400
Then you've got to if you're going to continue using those words at all,

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.720
you've got to say what you mean.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:40.680
So for example, I invented the phrase adaptive resonance in order to describe

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:49.320
a brain process for which there was a great deal of evidence that I could explain.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.520
The word wasn't there before and I've done that.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.320
We've talked about spectral timing.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.200
I invented the word spectral timing.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.680
We talked about neural relativity.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.400
I invented the word neural relativity.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:12.120
You know, I mean, all these words come out of an analysis of lots of data.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.480
But, you know, again, we're just getting back to the problem of emergent properties.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:25.320
It's not just neurons, it's neuronal interactions that generate emergent properties

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:36.120
that often cause actions that lead to feedback that create a cycle of perception, cognition,

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.680
emotion, action over and over and over as you evolve in the world.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:50.200
And through that cycle, if there are statistically repeatable enough or stable enough

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:58.680
properties of that interaction, you will learn about them as appropriate to the circuits

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.400
that are resonating with those particular invariants.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:10.440
And as I mentioned last time, you know, we talked briefly about cognitive emotional

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:19.000
interactions. To me, it was very satisfying that cognitive and emotional circuits share

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:28.040
many properties. But one thing they don't share is their inputs and their outputs.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:35.560
Like with emotion, you have a lot of inter-receptive inputs of hunger, satiety,

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.800
pain, you know, whatever, belief, happiness.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:50.200
And with cognition, usually, there's a perceptual front end,

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:59.560
envision, audition, you know, tactile that drives those. And then there's an interface

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:08.360
that resonates. So a lot of the circuitry can be shared but specialized in order to

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:17.400
be able to resonate with particular invariants of the environments that they are trying to

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.720
understand. That's a bad word, it's a loaded word. To the environments for which they have adapted.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.080
Yeah, so emergent properties, emergent properties, emergent properties, which you

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:39.960
cannot understand without a sufficiently powerful and principled, computational,

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:51.640
mathematically rigorous theory. And there is that explanatory gap without theory.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.200
And in your work, I mean, you refer to this as establishing a linking hypothesis.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:07.800
Between brain and mind, yeah. Well, it's a familiar phrase, linking hypothesis.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:20.440
Yeah, and I don't want us to go in circles, but if you don't have a way to generate the

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:27.080
emergent properties linking to behavior, then you really can't mechanistically explain behavior.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:33.160
Okay, so I've got a lot of questions from fans and audience members in general, but

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:40.120
tell that some of them are going to take us in circles. Well, that's okay. You know,

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:47.720
I don't think it's bad to say the same thing more than once. I think I might have mentioned I

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:55.480
would sometimes give the same keynote at two different conferences, assuming that because

01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:01.160
they were in different continents or whatever, a lot of the people hadn't heard it. And then I

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.680
see in the audience, some of the same people and they said, you know, it's good to hear more than

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:14.120
once. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention, you know, there are, when it comes to my

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:22.680
2017 paper on the hard problem, I do have keynote lectures about that on my webpage,

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:34.280
my webpage, your relegation is sites, s-i-t-e-s dot b-u for Boston University,

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:43.960
dot e-d-u for education, slash Steve G, that's s-t-e-v-e-g,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:53.560
sites dot b-u dot d-d-u slash Steve G. So for people who want to hear that lecture given,

01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:01.320
I might have given that one in more than one form, I forget, and sometimes I will

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.160
have both of them put on my webpage. But there are a number of

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:15.560
keynotes that I try to make self-contained for interdisciplinary audiences. But, you know,

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.320
as we were joking before, self-contained depends on where you're coming from.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:28.840
No, exactly. But they keep inviting me back. So I assume I couldn't have been that bad. I keep

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:36.520
getting invited back. So. Well, here as well, we'll help to solidify some of these concepts for

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.640
people, because I think it does require repeat reading, repeat watching, and repeat listening,

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.880
just to get all of these, well, in your way, see, feel, and experience this a lot more, resonate

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:54.840
with it a bit. Well, I would recommend, you know, a discussion such as ours, I think,

01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:04.280
for me is successful if it motivates someone to want to learn more. And then I would recommend

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:11.240
someone go to one of the videos on my webpage or YouTube or wherever,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.440
and listen to the lecture. Yes. And maybe listen more than once and stop it and repeat if

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.600
what is he talking about. And after you've done that, until you feel I know a little better,

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:37.000
then go to some of the articles. And some of the articles are heuristic, like my 2017 paper is in

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.240
a way, even though it breaks new ground in a way, it's a review paper, because a lot of the

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:49.800
foundational mathematical work is earlier, or I wouldn't have had the nerve to write that paper,

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:57.320
because I knew everything I was writing is supported by mathematical models and computer

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:07.000
simulations of challenging data. So, you know, there were levels from an S, you know, our chat to

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:15.320
videos of self-contained lectures to reading, hopefully non-technical review papers to

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.640
technical ones. But really, the best resource I can recommend is my magnum opus,

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:31.960
conscious mind, resonant brain, colon, how each brain makes a mind. Because there I work really

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:41.480
hard to write a self-contained and non-technical synthesis and overview of my work in many different

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.800
areas, as well as to bring together and try to clarify the meaning of the work of

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:54.200
really hundreds of other scientists. So, but as we might have mentioned last time, you know,

01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:01.160
we are talking about this, and this is one of the hard things to understand in the world. So,

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.320
nothing that I would write about it, I hope, would be

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:13.720
trivial, but I hope it's, you could see, oh, he's writing clearly. I just have to stop and

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:22.600
think about what he just wrote. And one reason I have over 600 color figures is to help people to

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:33.080
visualize the concepts that the words are trying to express. Because until you can get a picture in

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:39.960
your mind, it's often hard to know what the hell someone's talking about. It's not only me, it's

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:53.160
anything. So, yeah. Steve, talk to me about one of the one of the other very leading theories of

01:15:53.160 --> 01:16:00.360
consciousness, which is global neuronal workspace. What are your views on that theory of consciousness?

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:13.640
Well, I'm not going to give a professional review like you would for a journal article.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:21.080
I'm blocking on who's, I know the very nice fellow who promotes it. What is his name?

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:29.720
Bernard Bos. Yeah, I know Bernie Bos. He's a very nice guy, and he's very dedicated and sincere.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:37.640
Just check what his predictive and explanatory range is. That's all I could say.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:46.520
I mean, it's not for me to try to give a review of Bernie's work. You should ask Bernie to review

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.920
his work. I think it's always intriguing to see where, I mean, you guys either align or disagree.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:58.680
It's fascinating, particularly for the audience, to kind of get a grasp of where you guys diverge

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:05.080
or intersect. Well, I could discuss it. Bernie had an explanation of a certain fact,

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.400
and I thought it was correct. I'd say, yeah, I agree. But if I thought it was incorrect,

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.800
I'd say, well, I would explain it as well as that I can do, but to give some holistic way

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.680
and waving evaluation of Bernie's hard work. No, I won't play that game.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:33.400
I don't think it's constructive. If people find value in reading Bernie's work, they should

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:38.680
read it. If there are still questions they'd like answered, and they can find some of those

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:43.080
questions given more complete answers in my work, they should read my book.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:51.080
There is a section within the book where you do discuss it, and the fact that that theory sort of

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:56.280
does provide a little bit more information when you compare it to the other ones that we briefly

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:05.640
discussed. Oh, yeah, Bernie is more serious, I think. Okay. Okay, let's let you know.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:15.000
I'd like to leave it at that. Was that one of the questions someone wanted to comment on?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.040
I haven't gotten to those. Well, you better get to that, because it's an hour and a half in,

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:27.560
I can go up the two hours or so, but let's go. So one of my friends actually asked this question.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.200
This question, this first question, one of my friends asked us, he wants to remain unnamed,

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.320
but he wants to know at what, so let me just read this.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:54.120
At what point would Professor Grossberg delineate between zero conscious experience

01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.840
and conscious experience? Are all conscious experiences considered to be resonant states

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:12.920
in that regard? Well, you know, later in my book, I talk about quite a few mental disorders.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:22.920
And for example, without talking about parametric properties of behavioral symptoms

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:30.040
and the mechanisms that cause them and what has gone wrong there in altering consciousness, you

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:36.520
know, if you don't have a sufficiently sustained and energetic adaptive resonance

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:48.360
that is resonating with either external stimuli or internal memory representations,

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.960
it won't get to consciousness. You know, what I'm blocking on his name now. Oh, he did very nice work.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:03.800
You know, I talk about it a little in my book where, you know, usually

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:15.160
the stimulation our senses get by the time we're consciously aware of it can be 150 to

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:25.320
300 milliseconds later. And that's partly because in addition to the

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:35.000
all the pre processing stages, you then have to activate resonating circuits that have to

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.720
resonate for a sufficiently sustained energetic interval before it becomes conscious.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:51.400
So anything that prevents that will not become conscious. And there are many ways that can be

01:20:51.400 --> 01:21:03.160
prevented. Yeah, your work, I mean, clearly, in your work, you also you address the fact that not

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.800
not all resonance states are conscious states, but conscious states are always resonance states.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:16.360
Yes, not all resonance states are conscious. And I give example to that.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:24.520
For example, I mentioned grid cells and play cells will enter Rhino hippocampal resonances,

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:33.640
which support the stable learning stable and coordinated learning of grid and play cell

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:44.120
receptive fields are not conscious. They are not linked to internal or external sources of

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:57.640
sensory experience. Not directly, you know, for example, grid cells are sensitive to

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:08.360
linear motions and rotational motions. But those sensors aren't designed to support qualia.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:17.240
And so, you know, there's just no nothing like a conscious awareness there. There are inputs,

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:26.680
but the inputs are very low level. Now it's another matter entirely if you try to link the

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:34.280
spatial representations that are learned in grid and play cells with information like optic flow,

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:45.560
visual cues that are being synthesized when you navigate. So you use combinations of visual

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.800
and motor information to know where you are. And then if you suddenly in the dark,

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:59.880
you use path integration information, that's what the information about the linear and angular

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.520
movement is all about path integration or integrating how far these senses think you've

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:19.080
gone. That's your ground truth. And my PhD student, Bill Gnat and I developed a rather

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:32.440
comprehensive animat model of how, for example, how an animat would under visual guidance learn

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:51.000
to efficiently acquire a food reward, say that's in a maze, you know, how you would, first, you

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:59.160
would just be randomly exploring the maze, you know, that would be endogenous exploratory behavior.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:09.400
And then how that, as you explore it, how that is transformed into an efficient goal oriented

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:16.440
series of actions to efficiently acquire the goal in some distal part of the maze.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:24.600
And there we do combine the visual and the path integration information to help

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:33.160
learn how to solve that problem. I forget what we call the model, it was, oh, the sovereign model,

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:45.320
sovereign for self organizing visual expectation, you know, let me wait sovereign, maybe I can

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:53.240
sovereign. And I think that Bill thought of this when I thought, hey, that's not that

01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:01.080
self organizing vision expectation resonance. And on and on, I can't even remember what the other

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:09.320
letters stand for, but it is an acronym that captures the essence of what the architecture's

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:18.360
doing. And I say architecture, because not just a model, it's a very, you know,

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:30.280
you know, sparse version of a full animat, it doesn't have higher cognition, but it has working

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:41.800
memory, you know, it can learn sequential actions, etc, etc. And there, you know, the

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.320
designer working memory, I don't think you talked much about that, but, you know, you can derive

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:55.640
all working memories from a couple of simple postulates, both having to do with stable learning.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:02.920
It's not surprisingly, but this is stable learning of sequences. So even though in a working memory,

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.800
it would be like, you know, to have remember the following series of letters five to eight, eight,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:17.000
nine, five, three. And, you know, you can repeat it back to me five to eight, eight, nine, five, three.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.840
But if I distract you and say, hey, repeat it back to me, you can't, because it's in a short-term

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:31.000
temporary working memory buffer, you know, in computer science algorithms, you sometimes call it

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:39.480
a blackboard, but this is more than a blackboard, this is a suborganizing blackboard. And one of the

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:47.800
key issues here is how do you know which subsequence of all the sequences you've just experienced is

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:55.320
predicted in a given context? And, you know, the theory gives a solution to that problem.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:03.400
You want me to... And what? Oh, sorry, you were, you, sorry, continue. Well, well, and, you know,

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:11.320
you can see immediately there are, there are issues. Let's say I have already learned the word

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:19.720
my, and I've learned the word self. And in particular, I've learned recognition categories

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:28.120
of my and self. But now for the first time in working memory, I represent myself a new word

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:39.320
with a new meaning. First problem, why doesn't adding self after my, undermine the previously

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:49.240
learned inputs to the my and self category? But the second problem is how do you learn a new category

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:56.280
for myself, given you have two perfectly good categories, my and self, that are already learned?

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:05.560
How do you overcome the salience of the known to self-organize a larger grouping that's unknown?

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:10.760
And of course, if you couldn't do this, you couldn't learn language or dance or

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.840
navigational sequential skills. Because we're talking here about short words, my and self.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.640
The same problem arises with individual phonemes grouped into words. And so,

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:36.680
you know, my theory of working memories off is a computational solution to that, you know,

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:43.960
based on very simple principle. Remarkably, that also was first published in my human

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:51.320
memory paper in 78 when communication memory and development came out. It was a good year. And,

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:58.440
and one of the reasons I got into it was because it often fails.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.720
You know, you might not know, but there was a, let me give you a simple example of it. I was

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:14.840
interested more in verbal learning from when I was a boy. But, but did you over here, George Mill is

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:23.160
the magical number seven plus or minus two? Well, George Miller was the person who introduced

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:32.040
the notion of a chunk. And he basically showed that most people, if you tell them a series of

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:41.160
numbers or letters or whatever, they can't repeat it right back to you without learning,

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:49.880
well, without actively trying to learn if the sequence is more than five to maybe nine, depending

01:29:49.880 --> 01:30:00.120
on the person, units. But then what he showed about chunks is that, you know, you could do that

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:08.920
for much higher level chunks. You know, like, let's say you're controlling the movements of a

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:17.160
dance. And you know, each movement, you're, you know, professional ballet dancer. And you can do

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:24.280
all of the individual movements. And now, you know, George Ball and Shane is teaching the new dance.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:32.760
Well, you have to be able to put that sequence of movements into working memory where each of the

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:42.920
items in working memory is a chunk of a familiar dance gesture. And so that he realized you could

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:53.320
have, you know, sequences of chunks, creating another chunk. And you could get higher and higher.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:59.800
And that's how we learned so many of the higher order things, because we chunked all the lower

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:07.400
order stuff and automated it. So we don't have to pay focal attention to things that are already

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:16.200
chunked. They more or less can be done under very much less oversight. Anyway, so that's what this

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:28.600
theory is about. How you get this chunking, really, by solving the myself problem by,

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:37.160
in a stable way, it's sort of like the stability plasticity, the limit solve to sequence learning.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:46.440
But that was too far afield, maybe. But it did get a new, it got a new information.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.600
Yes, at least. And it was in, oh, I was talking about sovereign, you need that

01:31:51.480 --> 01:32:01.000
to learn sequences of turns in sovereign. Yeah. Okay, so the next question is from YouTube.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:15.480
It's by ecstasy. Different functional modalities have been proposed to explain the emergence

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:21.560
of quality from physical properties. Under the given art framework, how would residents,

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:26.040
even in principle, explain the perception of a qualitative state?

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:34.600
I'm not sure what a qualitative state is. I don't mean to be perverse. I mean, the first thing that

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:42.840
comes to my mind, of course, is that we have to ask ourselves what flavor of what we're talking about.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:49.800
The category learning stuff, as I had briefly reviewed last time, is about feature category

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:57.400
resonances. But if you're talking about experiences from the external world, let's say a visual experience,

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.920
what you're often conscious of is a surface shroud resonance, which is a conscious seeing.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:14.120
And if you synchronize surface shroud and feature category resonances, you know and see about the

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:21.720
object or event, and then the surface shroud resonance via posterior parietal cortex can

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:28.520
control actions, which we've learned in response to that combination of events.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.400
But now I didn't understand the last two words there. I don't know what they mean.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:40.920
Yeah, I think this is basically referring to qualia, that qualia like state.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:50.040
Well, I just commented on that. You have surface shroud resonance. You have stream

01:33:50.040 --> 01:34:00.440
shroud resonances. They're not the same as basic category learning. And when I hear and see

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:09.400
and know things about you, they're coordinated synchronizations of surface shroud, stream

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:18.600
shroud, feature category, and to the extent of which you're processing sequences, you know,

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:25.160
they're item list resonances responding to all this, because that's where you get understanding

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.680
of speech and language. So there are all these resonances that are being coordinated quite

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:42.040
wonderfully. And, you know, you have resonance and reset, resonance and reset. So as our visual

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:50.600
representations of a momentary visual experience is reset by your movement, to what have you,

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:57.880
and I have another frame, and so I have a sequence of these, you know, likewise we're

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:04.520
updating all our working memories, because the sequential information that's forming the context

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:14.200
of them is changing. One of my articles, you know, I try to bring together a lot of

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:29.640
a lot of these ways of thinking in an article that I think that I published it in 2019, 2020.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:39.960
It's an article that starts, well, I think it's one of the latest, maybe it's

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:53.560
it's one of the latest chapters in my book. Let me do you have the chapter names in front of you

01:35:53.560 --> 01:36:05.640
by chance? Let me let me try to search for it. It's important that I make this comment.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:13.560
Okay, I'll go to my, okay. Let me see.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:23.480
Oh, I have to turn off airplane mode. That was to stop me from getting bothered.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:31.080
Airplane mode. Okay. I'll be there in a minute. I have no fear.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.640
It's fine. I'm just going to ask other questions.

01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:53.640
Okay, I think this is it. As a list of the chapter titles on the Oxford listing.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:59.080
Oops, I hit the wrong thing. Damn. Okay.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.560
Okay. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:21.640
Yeah, it was chapter 14. How prefrontal cortex works.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:33.720
Um, colon cognitive working memory planning in emotion can jointly achieve valued goals.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.360
And um,

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.800
Yeah. Sorry, Steve, my, my copy of the book isn't in this office.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:54.920
No, it's fine. I'm looking at it, but, but um, yeah, and I'm, it's not, I have the abstract and the

01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:03.960
keywords here. But it's, let me get the book one second. I'll get it. I have a copy in the next

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:10.680
room. Anyway, for people who haven't seen the cover, this is the cover and the background around

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:17.880
the brain is neon color spreading. If you look carefully at it, you'll see the red or the blue

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:26.520
spreading out of their crosses. Because I thought of that, you know, as such an important example of

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.800
the complementarity of boundaries and surfaces.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.920
And let me go here. Okay.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.000
Except for that aspect.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:45.800
What is that?

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.960
The artwork. Well, what, how did you come up with that? That is the idea for the artwork.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:39:03.960
Oh, well, um, I wanted to cover that.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:14.520
So I said what the book is about. So, you know, the title is on a brain and, um,

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:24.360
uh, the brain is into Hemifield and I fiddled with trying to indicate the complementarity of

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:29.240
the Hemifields cause the water and wet streams and stuff like that. Other parts of the brain

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:36.120
are complemented, made it too complicated. But so that said, it's just brain, but neon color

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:43.400
spreading, the spreading is an emergent property that happens in our mind. It's a property of our

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:50.040
conscious visual awareness. And I thought it would be nice to emphasize on the cover.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:40:05.000
It's about emergent properties. And I'm trying, I thought I, oh yes. Yeah, yeah.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:22.280
Um, I, Betsy Murray stimulated me to write, to make some of these discoveries cause Betsy told

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.880
me that they had all this wonderful data in prefrontal cortex that no one could explain.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:36.680
And so she sent me the paper and I realized that not only could I explain it, but I predicted

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:44.520
some of it and, you know, and they have, you know, words like desirability and availability

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:51.160
stuff like that, which are good words for the phenomena they were talking about. But, you know,

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:59.640
a macro circuit in complete one of, of the predicted adaptive resonance theory I needed for

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:08.760
this. I don't know if you could see that, but I couldn't put in the basal gaggle or a number of

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:17.480
other things. And those different colors, the red, green, what have you, are systems. And so it

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:28.040
just showed that like for prefrontal cortex, I needed and, and explained data from seven

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:37.080
interacting parts of the prefrontal cortex. It's not a unitary thing. It's a complex organ. And,

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:44.920
and then I also, in red, I had some of the main reinforcement learning kind of things that,

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:51.960
and then I'm just black and white. I had some of the main vision and spatial

01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.160
kind of things. Anyway,

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:08.040
Roy, you want me to move? I think the point, I would, the point was I was trying to clarify

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:19.480
that, you know, the prefrontal cortical work really is a synthesis of a lot of work.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:27.880
And I think, I think that

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.920
things really came together in a nice way.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.600
You know, with a number of points in my book, I point out, you shouldn't take for granted

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:52.120
that the next step could be taken. And this happened to me over and over again, how the previous work

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:58.600
sort of thrust me into a new area where I knew they were interacting with. And the same things with

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:06.440
the prefrontal cortical work, so many parts of the brain are interacting there to explain really

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:16.680
challenging quantitative data, physiological data mostly. But, you know, it's all an accumulation

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:28.440
of evidence. And if you're a really good theorist, you can weigh the amount of evidence for this

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:37.160
part or that part or the other part. You know where the weaknesses are, where you might have

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:43.640
variations on a theme that don't undermine any of the principles as you would expect

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:52.360
for species specific variations of the design. And you also know what you can't explain.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:44:03.000
And, and that keeps you up night until you can. So this is not, this is not finished. But I think

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:11.240
if someone wanted to get into an overview of some of my work after this discussion, and maybe looking

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:18.040
at a lecture of mine on my web, you might look at my magnum opens, and I want to emphasize one thing.

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:27.640
It's a long book. After you read the preface and introductory chapter one, I wrote it so that you

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:35.400
could jump directly to any chapter that's topic interested. You don't have to read at all. I don't

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:42.280
expect even interested people have the time or interest to read at all. The chapters are written

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:50.200
independently of each other. And so, you know, if you wanted to read more about art in the

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:58.040
sense of future category resonance, jump to chapter five. But if you wanted to read about

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:05.160
prefrontal cortex, you'd go to chapter 13. If you wanted to know about spatial navigation,

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.080
I think it was chapter 16. Yes. If you wanted to know about visual perception,

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.040
go to the first few chapters, and so on. Yeah, I really enjoyed that aspect. I said this the last

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:25.160
time. It's that easily accessible nature of the book, the way you can just jump from chapter to

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:30.840
chapter without having a preconceived idea of the previous chapter makes it very accessible.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.280
Steve, one last question, and this one's from Facebook.

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:44.600
This is a funny one. Francina, who resonates most in the Grossberg-Karperter household?

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:55.160
Whoa, now this is getting very personal. Who resonates most with why?

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.880
I have no idea. That's just the question. That's where the question ends.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:15.800
Well, all I could say is that Gail Carpenter is the love of my life. We've been together for a

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:25.960
half century. She has strict instructions that she can't pre-desease me, because she's younger

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:34.520
than I am. We already spoke on the phone earlier today. I'm in Truro on Cape Cod, and she's back

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:43.160
in Newton, where we have our main residence. I'll be talking to at least two, three more times today.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:57.960
She's a brilliant neural network modeler. She's done foundational work, as well as really doing

01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:07.560
some of the best work on large-scale applications, like she did really important work on remote sensing

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:16.520
on medical database prediction. One of the things she did that I think

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.360
should be studied more, and I think she'd agree,

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:32.600
is in a remote sensing context, where you can have multiple observers. They're each looking at

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:43.000
different pieces of a remotely sensed terrain, maybe with different combinations of sensors.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:51.320
They will create their own personal labels for what they're trying to describe.

01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:00.760
One person might say water. One person might say pond. Another person might say lake for the very

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:14.920
same object, and they only do this for a subset, usually a pretty small subset, of the remotely

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.800
sensed terrain, because it's expensive to get ground through. Someone has to be running around

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:29.400
down there. How do you input this kind of information, which may be

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:39.800
incomplete, probabilistic, sometimes self-contradictory, and out of it,

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:47.400
automatically learn a cognitive hierarchy of rules, including the confidence you have

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:57.320
of the links in the hierarchy, whereas you get higher and higher and higher in the rules,

01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:06.680
they get more and more abstract. I think that is a foundational contribution, a really quite

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:18.920
wonderful one. That needs a lot more work. Gail and I are both no longer teaching, we're both

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:27.320
emeritus, and it doesn't mean we're brain dead. I just published my last paper, I think a few

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:35.160
weeks ago, and I'm writing another book, but Gail is not going to work on that project again,

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:45.000
and that project could really be very interesting, especially if you're in some kind of a technology

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:54.120
AI lab. That's the kind of project that Google could really sink its teeth into,

01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:02.360
because you could do it for the whole world. Part of it, we got into it because

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:11.640
many years ago, I gave a lecture at the Optical Society meeting about some of the vision modeling

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:17.560
work, and there were several program managers from MIT, Lincoln lab there, which is one of the

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:26.600
great sensor houses in the world. They have laid on multispectral IOS and tetic aperture radar and

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:36.200
so on, and very much pixelated data with very intense pixels and dropout pixels and

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:45.800
a lot of noise, and they realized that the kind of work even then that we were doing in vision

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:54.840
modeling could help them process their sensor data. In fact, there was a very active project at

01:50:54.840 --> 01:51:03.320
Lincoln lab for a while doing that. They also designed a robot based on some of our ideas

01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:08.760
and sensor remote control course, some of the models I developed with my students and platform

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:20.520
independent, they work with wheels or legs or what have you. Yeah, so what more should I say

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:29.800
about my wife? My best friend, the love in my life, the mother of a wonderful daughter, and we

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:37.560
have wonderful grandchildren. We feel super lucky, super lucky. I love the way your face lights up

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.560
when you talk about us, Steve. Sorry for the personal question, but I thought it's quite cool

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.760
that you bought such great pioneers in this field, and I thought it would be a nice question to ask

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:54.440
from Mo while it wasn't mine, but I chose it. Well, to sum it up, we've been a real mom and

01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:02.120
pop show where I have many projects without Gail, she many without me, and we've done, I think at

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:08.440
least 20 projects together, and you know, they're sort of like our scientific children.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.840
Well, I think it's absolutely beautiful, and keep up the great work. Steve, thank you again for

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:23.880
joining me. So I really appreciate your round two. And you've also written a paper on illusions

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:28.200
enough that I find very fascinating. And I hope at some point we can also dissect one of those.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:32.200
And with that one, it will be far less philosophical and a lot more scientific. So

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:39.800
I think you'll enjoy it a lot more as well. Yeah, well, I love studying, especially visual illusions,

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:46.120
of course. You know, it's sort of like how very young people can get

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.800
excited by mathematics, some of the hardest problems in number theory, you can say to any child,

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:04.600
and then it takes firm math to solve it. But visual illusions, it's right there,

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:14.280
it's in your face. And immediacy raises questions of how do you see anything?

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:24.120
Well, thanks, Ted, for having me on. So this would be part, this would be part two of this series.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:27.400
Yes, definitely. Thanks so much. I enjoyed this.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.400
Thank you so much, Steve. I appreciate it.
