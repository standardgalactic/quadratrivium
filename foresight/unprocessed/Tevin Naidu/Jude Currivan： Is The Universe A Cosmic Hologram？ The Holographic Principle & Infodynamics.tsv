0	16640	Hello. Hi, Jude. How are you? I'm fine, Terv. How are you doing? I'm great. I'm so excited
16640	20240	for this interview. I mean, I've been absorbing so much of your information over the past
20240	25760	couple of this past few days. And as last week, it's been, it's been amazing. Our husband
25760	32240	on your side? Yeah, no, it's, it's great here. I mean, during the summer, I'm sort of getting
32240	38400	to a point now with the end of this month, it's been so full on that I'm really looking forward
38400	43280	to taking an in-breath, hopefully for a couple of months, which means I, there's a lot I'm feeling
43280	49440	coming in. So I really want to be open and have the space to really, you know, appreciate that and
50240	55280	try and sort of have a sense of what it is all about. I mean, I can imagine your work is, is
55280	60320	absolutely fascinating. There's so many different topics we could discuss today. I can only imagine
60320	65360	the inundated emails you're probably receiving from so many people who are keen to hear about your
65360	72160	work. Bless you. Well, it's, well, it's very busy in a really good way, because I do feel
72160	78720	that we're so much flowing that, you know, now is the time. And people, you know, are really
80720	88080	needing to have some hope that's authentic, to have some sense of an underpinning and a framing
88080	95680	to a sort of a healed worldview, you know, not a fragmented perspective based on the old paradigm,
95680	102800	but the, but the evidence-based authenticity of something that can really, you know, empower us
102800	107360	to come together, you know, because that's the time, isn't it? And I know for sure. I mean, I'm
107360	112560	great. I'm grateful that you've started already, because I mean, I love to just get started. And
112560	118800	at this point, I think the question I want to ask you, you talk about this cosmic hologramdude
118800	123760	and governed by information. I think let's explore this idea. I mean, it's been around for many years.
124400	130480	It's been around for decades, millennia in fact. But only now do we see a growing body of evidence
130480	134800	that supports this idea. And I think it would be amazing for the listeners and viewers to
135520	141360	listen to this evidence and for you to express yourself in a nice open platform where the listeners
141360	145840	and viewers can appreciate it. And just by the way, the audience are generally very technical
145840	150320	for this podcast. So go into as much detail as you want. Don't shy away from the physics.
151040	157040	Yeah, just I'm curious, this cosmic hologram and everything about it. I'm looking forward to this.
158080	163760	Okay, well, there's probably a couple of convergent points to be making here. But let's
163760	168720	let's talk about the holographic principle to start with, because that really, as you say,
168720	175600	it's been around for a while now. And the sort of very early intimations of it really date back
175680	182560	to David Bohm. So we're talking about, you know, for if not five decades, as a sense of what this
182560	189200	might mean. But of course, the big move forward came when researchers were looking into the
189200	196480	thermodynamics of black holes, and people like Gerrata Hooft and Leonard Suskin and Jacob Beckenstein
196480	204800	and others. And the question really was what happens to the information that's actually,
204880	210640	you know, making up a massive star, when at the end of its life, its nuclear fuel runs out,
211280	216000	and it collapses. And of course, the collapse is so gravitationally powerful that it actually
216000	221360	collapses within an event horizon. And therefore not even light can escape. I know there's a
221360	226880	nuance with that with the with Stephen Stephen Hawkins work. But essentially, you know, you're
226880	232720	not even like an escape. And so at the event horizon, you suddenly get this blackness
233520	238720	that we term a black hole. And of course, was the star collapses, a spherical star
238720	245040	collapses as a spherical black hole. So the idea was, well, the is infant, first of all,
245040	251360	is the information lost? Because if it was lost, that would blow quantum physics out the water,
251360	256800	literally. So there's a huge debate about firewalling and what's happening all of that. But as time has
256880	262800	moved on, that has more and more evidence has suggested that actually no, the evidence, the
262800	269040	information is actually held at the event horizon. But then the big question was, well,
270080	274960	what is that information? And when calculations were done that related it to the thermodynamics
275760	282320	of the of the black hole, it was realized that the it was that the information was proportional,
282320	288880	not to the spherical volume of the black hole, but the surface area of the event horizon. And
288880	296960	then a few light bulbs went off. Because that is very, you know, you know, reflective of what
296960	303360	happens when on on Earth, we create technologically create a hologram, you know, take a beam of light,
303360	309840	we split it into part of the beam is is focused on an object, it's bounced off the object and it
309840	316640	collects information in that reflected light from the object. It then combines with the initial
316640	321920	beam to form a two dimensional pattern of information that actually looks like an oil
321920	327600	slick. If you actually look at one at that point in its process, it looks like an oil slick. But
327600	336400	it's basically a wonderful ability of our universe to be able to transform information into waveforms
336400	342080	and waveforms into information through Fourier transforms. And this is absolutely critical,
342080	349680	not just to our human made technological holograms, but also how the holographic principle works at
349680	354080	the universal level, which we can come on to. But so essentially, there was a realization,
354080	359760	you've got this two dimensional informational pattern. And when you throw another beam of light
359760	365040	through it, it projects what we call a hologram. And the point of the hologram that it projects is
365120	372160	that the whole is in every pixelation. So if we have a high definition, pixelation, then we,
372800	378560	you know, all the wholeness, if it's an apple, for example, you get minuscule apples throughout
378560	384640	the whole hologram. But taking this now to our universe, it was realized that from black holes,
384640	389760	we could extend this, what became known as the holographic principle to the whole universe.
390400	394640	And we could go back into the evidence for this, because there is compelling evidence now at,
394640	399280	you know, all scales of existence and many different fields of research. But the sense
399280	405520	is that the appearance of our universe, the energy matter and space time appearance of our
405520	413600	universe is not its more fundamental nature. But the appearance arises from this deeper realm
413600	421760	of causation as meaningful in formation. And I always hyphenize in formation to sort of really
421760	428720	emphasize its meaningful nature. But that meaningful information is actually accumulated
428720	434800	on the boundary of what we call space time, and then holographically manifested as the
434800	441840	appearance of our universe. So if we go back 13.8 billion years to the very first moment
441840	449200	of space time, not in a big bang, we know it wasn't big. I mean, that was Fred Hall being very
449200	454240	facetious. But you know that the implication of a bang, it wasn't, it was incredibly fine
454240	462160	tuned and ordered, it began in its lowest informational state. So as time has flowed forward
462160	467680	ever since because of that entropic flow began its lowest informational state.
468880	474480	As time has flowed forward and spaces expanded, that holographic principle
474480	480560	allied to other laws of physics that we can come on to has meant that our universe has been able to
480560	487440	undertake this evolutionary arc from simplicity to ever greater levels of complexity, experience,
488080	494640	evolutionary potential, individuation, self awareness at those levels. Yeah, that's the
494640	500480	story of our universe, because that first moment, not of a big bang, but the first moment of a big
500560	507520	breath, an ongoing big breath. And the reason that space has to expand is because that is where
508080	514960	the accumulation of the emergent evolutionary information is held. So space didn't expand.
515760	521280	There could not be more and more and more and more information able to be expressed in its
521280	528480	evolutionary arc. And of course, what happens is the pixelation of the holographic boundary of our
528480	536800	universe as Jacob Beckenstein understood is pixelated at Planck scale. So in that sense,
536800	545280	our universe is the reality of our universe comes into form at the Planck scale, which is a basic
545280	551840	measures of space and time and energy matter as a result and temperature. And so it all hangs
551840	557840	together. But that pixelation scale, that Planck scale pixelation at a spatial level
558640	564560	is as small as to a nucleus of a hydrogen atom as a hydrogen nuclei, nucleus is to the whole
564560	572320	universe is 10 to the minus 35 meters, it's trillions of trillions of times more minute than
572320	579440	our best high definition of human holograms. And the point is that so that is the way that is
579680	584080	what we call the boundary of what we call space, the holographic boundary
584080	590400	is able to encode more and more cosmic and universal information. But the point is also
590400	598640	that the flow of time itself at every Planck scale temporal pixelation, which is 10 to the minus
598640	606800	44 seconds, get your head around that, you know, it's like every that every Planck scale time is
606880	615600	like adding another, you know, another movement of the whole universe's emergence. Of course,
615600	620480	it is so minute that it's rather like us watching a television screen, you know,
620480	625280	the pixelation is small to us. So we see the whole image, we don't see the pixels. Well,
625280	630640	this is the pixelation of the universe, our universe's reality. So that's a start anyway.
630640	634560	I mean, it's a brilliant start. And I love the way you articulate this because it makes it a lot
634560	638640	easier for people to understand when you're talking about the fact that it's obviously
639440	643360	expanding in the terms of the way while in the way that we used to express it. But now you're
643360	648080	talking about it as information rather than matter in the same way we usually discuss it.
648080	654240	People that I've seen a lot of people sort of mistake that for new content arising, whereas
654240	658400	we know that, well, according to the laws of thermodynamics, matter is neither created nor
658400	665920	destroyed. So you talk about entropy rather than entropy. And I do, I do. And as a child,
665920	672640	this is really sad. When I was about seven or eight years old, I was always asking why are the,
672640	677600	at the time it was mainly two laws of thermodynamics. Yeah. But there's a third law,
677600	682720	which is relating to a closed system where the temperature of a closed system is inversely
682800	689360	proportional to its entropy. So my question for a long time was why are the two laws of
690000	696480	thermodynamics? Because, you know, I'm a great follower of one of my great heroes, Albert Einstein,
696480	702560	and to paraphrase Einstein, you know, the universe as simple as it can be, but no simpler. And I add
703120	710320	to fulfill its evolutionary purpose. And that add-on is really key. Because what I realized
710320	715600	when I was writing the Cosmic Hologram, and also more laterally, the story of Gaia,
716400	722800	is we can actually restate those three laws of thermodynamics to what I call three laws of
722800	730720	info dynamics. So the first law, if we go back to the initial, you know, the initial
730720	737680	first of thermodynamics, began, of course, essentially with Boltzmann, saying, as you say,
737680	746240	the energy of a closed system cannot be destroyed or created. It can change through time,
746240	754240	but it cannot be created or destroyed. So if we take the science going further than Boltzmann,
756320	761680	and bless him, I mean, Boltzmann was doing his work before even atoms had been validated. So
761680	767280	he was amazing, again, pioneer and great giant, for which I feel we should all be very, very
767280	774080	grateful. But taking that on, we now know that energy and matter are equivalent equals MC squared.
774080	778800	So that says that the energy matter of a closed system cannot be created or destroyed,
779360	785200	just changed through time. We also, for our laws of physics to work at all, and this is
785200	790480	something that really still some folks struggle with, but all the evidence is really showing us
790480	797200	that our entire universe is a, is a content, I call containered system, because closed system
797200	804080	has a very specific topological perspective, and it can be confusing. So as a containered system
804080	811440	with this sort of holographic perspective, yeah, it means that the energy matter of our universe
812160	817280	from its first moment to its last, and there is also now more and more evidence that it's a finite
817360	824400	life cycle can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change. Now that essentially is the first
824400	832240	law of thermodynamics applied to our universe. But when we also appreciate that in 2012 and since
832240	838880	there have been experiments that have shown that information is every bit as real as any
838880	846240	thermodynamic measurements, so work, heat, etc. So we also now know that we can start to expand that
846240	854400	first law of thermodynamics to a first law of infodynamics, where information expressed as
854400	861680	quantized energy matter can neither be destroyed or created, but just changed through the cycle of
861680	867680	our universe. Now that's fine. Because that in its essence, which is quantum physics, you know,
867680	871840	because of course, energy matter is the domain of quantum physics in description terms.
872800	882720	That's all great, but it has no notion of space or time. So it's the seed, it's the framing for
882720	889760	how our universe can exist. But this then, the second law begins to answer my seven-year-old's
889760	894320	question, why do you need more than one law of thermodynamics? Because the second law,
895040	899360	which you say quite rightly, is about originally the notion of entropy.
900640	905520	So the idea is that the entropy of a closed, I'm going to say containered now just for
905520	913040	consistency, a containered system in, you know, it has to increase over time. And there's been a
913040	918800	lot of misunderstanding about this, because a lot of folks think of entropy as order to disorder.
919360	924640	But what Boltzmann was really talking about was the micro, the energetic microstates of such a
924640	931760	system. And when you think about it, I sometimes use an analogy of a pack of cards, if you take a
931760	938560	pack of cards out of its sort of box, they're very ordered. Yeah, you throw them up in the air and
938560	943680	they land all over the place and you come together and they're not in that initial order. But rather
943680	948640	than order to disorder, you're just increasing the number of states through time. So every time
948640	954960	you throw them up and they land, more and more states are formed. So it's this it's this progress
954960	965440	through time of increasing micro energetic states. But of course, we now also know that we can see
965440	972160	information. And again, we can go into a lot more detail of the evidence for this, as also being
972160	979280	expressed, not just as energy matter in its quantized, its quantized form, but in a complementary
979280	986720	way of space time, that's where the holographic perspective comes in. So that second law then
986720	993760	when applied to our universe can be restated and in informational terms, that first of all,
993760	999360	the entropy, because I'm now talking about information, whereas entropy is about energetic
999440	1006640	microstakes, I move from entropy to entropy. It just makes it easier. But the but the equation
1007360	1014080	that describes the informational content of a container system, and the entropy, the energetic
1014080	1021280	microstates of a container system is the same equation is originally defined by Boltzmann.
1021920	1028400	So we're onto something here. And so now if we look at the second law of info dynamics,
1029040	1032880	it says that the and of course, let me go back to the first law for a second, because I want to
1032880	1039440	bring in space and time here, because this is vital. So the second law of thermodynamics says
1039440	1046160	that the entropy of a container system can only increase through time. Okay, and we're talking
1046160	1052720	about container system here. So now we move into 20th century physics, and we now know the equivalence
1052720	1060240	of space and time. So relative space and relative time, lovely that they are, have to be conjoined
1060240	1066000	as invariant space time, if we're going to have a universe that hangs together. Yeah.
1066640	1070400	And we can actually talk about the universe that hangs together and the laws of physics and all
1070400	1078000	the rest of it. So we can then expand that first second law of thermodynamics from the entropy
1078640	1085200	of a container system only increasing through space time to the entropy of a container system
1085200	1093040	as its information content only increasing in our universe's case through space and time.
1093040	1100160	So literary space expands and time moves forward, the information content gets bigger and bigger
1100160	1107520	and bigger. And that's the entropy. Okay. Third law is this is cool. I love this because this
1107520	1113440	really came to me quite late on. Because I was thinking gosh, why is there a third law? Where
1113440	1119760	does temperature come into this? But the third law of thermodynamics, as I mentioned, says that the
1119760	1128400	temperature of a container system and its entropy now entropy are inversely proportionate. So we
1128400	1134640	now know that our universe began in its highest temperature form at the Planck temperature,
1134640	1142880	10 to the 32 degrees Kelvin, and its lowest entropy. So as time exploded and space has
1142880	1151600	expanded, the temperature has dropped. That drop in temperature is allied inversely to the increase
1151600	1157600	in informational content entropy. It is so simple to have. I mean, it all hangs together in this
1157600	1167600	glorious way. And then the final cherry on top of it is essentially that I talk about meaningful
1167600	1177280	information. Yeah. So the wholeness of our universe as meaningfully informed and holographically
1177280	1184320	manifested, it's framing can be can be done. It can be brought together with these three
1184320	1192320	laws of infodynamic. The first law is the most simple statement of quantum physics. The second
1192320	1199440	is simplest form of relativity physics. But together they combine within these three laws
1200160	1207680	of infodynamics, which with a hyphen, are three laws that bring together our universe that
1207680	1215760	meaningfully exists and purposefully evolves. I think it's incredible because this is what
1215760	1220080	we've been searching for for such a long time. People have been looking for a unifying theory
1220080	1224720	of this universe. I mean, it's been the goal when you think about Stephen Hawken and I know you guys
1224720	1229120	when you were the youngest participant and you won the award, I can't remember exactly where,
1229120	1234240	but you obviously met Stephen Hawken at that time many years ago. How old were you 19 at the time?
1234240	1241120	I was 19. And my my mental was Dennis Sharma, who was Stephen's doctoral supervisor when they're
1241120	1245920	at Cambridge. And then Dennis came over to Oxford. I was doing my physics at Oxford.
1245920	1251840	And Dennis, bless him, he just took me under his wing. And after Stephen and Roger Penrose,
1251840	1257680	who got the Nobel a couple of years ago, came together to present to the postgraduate
1258960	1263760	department. And Dennis invited me along, even though I was an undergraduate, I was the youngest
1263760	1268160	person in the room. I think I was the only woman in the room. And then afterwards, Dennis said,
1268160	1271680	why? Because it was all black holes. They were like, woof, this is coming forward.
1272320	1279120	And Dennis said, why don't you enter this essay competition? And I said, sure. And he said,
1279120	1285520	why don't you write about black holes? I went, sure. So I did. And I won the prize.
1286560	1292800	Was it 25 quid? It was 25 quid. In those days, this was the early 70s. That was beer money for a
1292880	1298080	term. The reason why I bring that up is, I mean, of course, we think of Stephen Orkin,
1298080	1302960	we think of theories of everything. I mean, there's unification of quantum mechanics and
1302960	1307200	spacetime general relativity. How do we combine these concepts? But also, when you think of
1307200	1312240	Stephen Orkin, you think of black holes, event horizons. I know it's coming forward. It's coming
1312240	1316720	full circle. It's quite extraordinary. And I want to go into that. I mean, unless you want to address
1316720	1320000	the evidence first, how would you like to approach it? Would you like to go into black holes now?
1320000	1325280	First, talk about the holographic principle and how we've gathered more evidence over time
1325280	1328080	and certain experiments that have helped to solidify this.
1328080	1332800	Yeah, I'd be happy to. And I think the other thing that's really key in all of this
1333520	1338640	is that our universe exists and evolves in this way, meaningfully exists, purposefully evolves
1340160	1347200	in manifested holographically and meaningful information. But the other key aspect of it is
1347280	1355040	our universe does so as a non-locally unified entity. And this, of course, if we can take a
1355040	1360720	couple of minutes just to nail this one down, I think, this is something that came out right in
1360720	1365680	the early days of quantum physics. And many of the quantum physicists were, of course,
1365680	1371680	scientists mystics, you know, and some of them went to India and started really appreciating
1372240	1378240	that the Vedic tradition of ancient India, the Rishis, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads,
1378240	1385600	were basically telling the same story that they were realising. And what became clear
1385600	1393360	is that for quantum physics, quantum mechanics to work at all, essentially our universe had to be
1393360	1398800	non-locally unified in its entirety. And of course, you know, Bell came out with his, you know,
1398800	1403600	sometimes called a theory, sometimes called an inequality. But nonetheless, it was a test bed
1403600	1410080	for this. And at the time, it was a theoretical perspective. And it was only many, many decades
1410080	1414800	afterwards, you know, we're talking 70s, 80s onwards, that researchers were able to start
1414800	1420320	to experimentally test this at greater than quantum scales, because it was clear it was happening at
1420320	1428000	a quantum scale, but was it able to be expanded to a universal level? So you had researchers
1428000	1434560	coming along and progressively increasing the scale well beyond any quantum levels to show
1434560	1443280	entanglement. And in 2017, then 2018, a group of, I think, it might have been four or five
1443280	1450080	universities, one of which I think the lead was MIT. And what they were able to do was
1450080	1455760	non-locally entangle photons of light in their laboratory, with starlight from 600 light years
1455760	1461840	away, but also triggered by light from a quasar, a very active galactic center,
1461840	1468800	two quasars actually, one I think was 7.8 billion, the other was 12.2 billion light years away.
1469440	1476480	And that was a triggering that actually created a level of entanglement that exceeded the inequality
1477040	1484720	test, you know, the thresholds of Bell. But beyond that, in late last year, the Nobel Prize for
1484720	1491040	Physics were given to three researchers who've been working on this for decades. Anton Zellinga,
1491040	1498240	who was also part of that MIT collaboration, Alan Aspect and John Clouser. And the Nobel Prize is
1498240	1503760	only given for settled physics. I often say Einstein didn't get it for relativity, because it was seen
1503760	1509920	as being quite contentious. He got it for the photoelectric effect. So the fact that we have now
1510000	1513520	the Nobel, we've got this experimentation at cosmological scales.
1514800	1520880	You know, we have all of the theoretical framing now to support this and the evidence across many
1520880	1528240	fields of research that also play into this. You know, it's an amazing and exciting time,
1528240	1534560	not just for scientists, because as we'll go on, I'm sure, to explore, this is important, this is
1534560	1538560	vital for everyone. A lot of implications. There's so many practical implications.
1539920	1544080	Exactly. I mean, when you think about it, as you said, Nobel Prizes are only given to settled
1544080	1549120	science. And I mean, he got it for the photoelectric effect. He didn't get it for what he's best known
1549120	1553520	for. And that's pretty incredible, because at the time, of course, I mean, he called it spooky
1553520	1557680	action at a distance. And we know that he wasn't comfortable with this concept. I mean,
1558320	1562640	he would have been now because I'm convinced he would have been now because, of course,
1562640	1569520	you know, he was he and the quantum physicists were working decades before the neutron
1569520	1575440	was discovered. I mean, let alone the hologram, let alone the cosmological understanding we have,
1575440	1582320	let alone, you know, the sort of leaps and bounds we've had to understand
1582880	1588800	the significance, the fundamental significance of information and meaningful information,
1588800	1593920	which means, of course, the slippery slope. Yes, please, of consciousness. You know,
1593920	1598560	we have to bring this front and center. Of course, what he did feel very uncomfortable about,
1598560	1604240	as did Planck and others, is that whereas quantum physics and what they're all come
1604880	1609360	really gave us the clues that mind and consciousness aren't something we have,
1609360	1614080	they're literally what we in the whole world are, that was literally pushed to the side.
1614720	1623360	And so it's taken almost another century and an inability with the old framing to reconcile
1623360	1628800	quantum physics and relativity physics, because they're at the appearance level of our universe
1628800	1634240	of energy matter space time, we've needed to understand this deeper level of causation,
1634240	1640640	which is meaningfully informationally driven, and then being able to show how information
1640640	1646480	expresses itself in these complementary ways, as the appearance of energy matter quantized energy
1646480	1654240	matter and entropic space time brought in the holographic principle, you know, I think he'd
1654240	1659200	be jumping up and down and going, yeah, because he was one of the folks who was saying, you know,
1659200	1662800	mind and consciousness are what we are, what the whole world is.
1663840	1666960	I mean, so Jude, I mean, for the listeners and the viewers, I mean,
1666960	1674720	I was introduced to work by Don Hoffman, and he told me it would be a very fascinating
1674720	1678880	conversation, and I clearly already is. But I remember when Don and I were talking about it,
1678880	1682960	he was telling me about your work, and I find it very intriguing, because I mean, Don has such
1682960	1688400	amazing work being done. They're currently doing the new test to experiment whether physics arises
1688400	1693440	from consciousness, and I think they just released it yesterday, I think it was, yeah, 26th of June.
1693440	1700000	So when you talk about consciousness, from an idealism perspective, because this is fundamentally
1700000	1705520	what the view entails from a philosophical perspective, it's an idealist view of consciousness.
1705520	1712160	Consciousness is what we are, and everything that there is technically in a sense. How do you work
1712160	1716720	around this concept of consciousness? How do you define it? How do you explain it to people?
1716720	1720960	Because obviously, this podcast is called Mind Body Problem, I mean, Mind Body Solution for a reason.
1722000	1729440	Absolutely. Well, you know, the very terminology, what's consciousness, you know, you'll get
1729440	1736880	five answers from four people. And I have a very broad church of consciousness. And, you know,
1736880	1742960	a friend of mine, Professor Max Velmans, differentiates mind and consciousness and
1742960	1748480	talks about consciousness as a level of awareness. Whereas mind is fundamental, you know, we can
1748480	1754560	talk about mind as being cosmic mind as Einstein would have called it, the ground of all being,
1754560	1764160	you know, and so in that regard, our universe is mindful. And, you know, the way I'm working with
1764160	1769040	this, and my next book will dive deeper into the, you know, the ground of all being and the rest of
1769040	1774720	it. But both for the cosmic hologram and for the story of Gaia, I really wanted to show how
1775440	1783520	what I would also refer to as cosmic mind, an eternal and infinite mind, has thoughts,
1783600	1788160	a thought, thoughts, that, you know, we turn our universe, which is very much,
1789360	1795520	you know, pervading universal wisdom teachings. And in my own explorations, you know, as a
1795520	1802960	noetic experiencer all my life is very much the way I've experienced realities. But by
1803680	1808880	being able to articulate it is as cosmic consciousness, cosmic mind,
1809520	1819120	expressing itself as the appearance of our universe through the articulation and digitized
1819840	1825120	meaningful information. You know, I mean, we're almost predisposed to this now because our
1825120	1832400	communications technologies, you know, take the image of me, gather all the information,
1832400	1838720	the meaningful information about me, translate it into digitized ones and zeros,
1839600	1847760	squirt it down a cable of a satellite to your computer, you know, recombine it as an image,
1848320	1854080	does the same vice versa. You know, this goes back to the incredible attributes of Fourier
1854080	1861440	transforms, the way our universe can, you know, make this beautiful play of information,
1862000	1868960	waveforms, it all hangs together. But it hangs together with the evidence showing that it has
1868960	1875120	innate meaning. This is the key, I think is this is not random data, just as our conversation. Well,
1875120	1881520	I don't know, some people may say it's random data, but hopefully our conversation is meaningful.
1881520	1888960	But of course, the meaningful nature of our universe is not dependent in any way on human
1888960	1898080	sentience. It's a universe that is itself living in that sense, mindful, informational,
1898080	1904480	where everything in it from, you know, atoms and molecules to planets and plants and people
1904480	1911360	have a part of that meaning and essential purpose. So it's a broad church,
1912560	1918800	but it's it's it's innately the same fundamental stuff, the nature of reality.
1918800	1921200	Jude, how what are your thoughts on Don's work?
1922720	1929200	I well, when I first got it, it was so lovely because Don and I met at the Science and Nonduality
1930160	1937040	Conference in in California before the pandemic, and had lunch together and really enjoyed being
1937040	1942160	together and have had a number of conversations since and I love his work. He's coming I'm coming
1942160	1949440	from this primarily as a cosmologist, and as an evolutionary biologist and a systems person,
1949440	1956720	and you could argue a philosopher, but many, many different hats. And because I'm so curious,
1956720	1962880	I like to join the dots and see where they lead. Don comes from it more from human consciousness
1963520	1970720	and how our human consciousness relates to this wider consciousness. And his book is very provocative
1970720	1979040	because of course, from the human consciousness perspective, our senses are not direct in direct
1979120	1985280	touch points with universal consciousness. We moderate, we mitigate.
1986560	1992480	Yeah, our sense of self through a number of ways of forming meaning. But when we met,
1992480	1999920	I realized that he wasn't in any way, decrying or not acknowledging universal
2000800	2007360	reality. He was only really exploring the ways in which we relate to that larger
2009040	2014000	understanding of reality. So, you know, as microcosmic co creators, as I call us,
2014800	2023920	of our universal living intelligence, he and I are very close. So, you know, I mean, we agree
2023920	2028400	very much. What I really love as well is he's working with a number of quantum physicists
2029840	2037920	in a sort of more specified way of how this works. But what I would say is the work that I've done
2037920	2042800	offers us the underpinning and framing through these three laws of infodynamics.
2043600	2050320	And I'm happy to sort of say to Don and the other guys, I'm really excited about what you're going
2050320	2055120	to come forward in this, because it's going to come, I just feel it's all convergent. It's all
2055120	2059200	the same direction of travel. I'm glad you brought up quite a quantum physicist, because I mean,
2059200	2064640	another theory of consciousness that circulates is that of penrose. When you think of Stuart
2064640	2069520	Hammerhoff and penrose, they talk about quantum consciousness and the microcubules of cells.
2069520	2073520	Your thoughts on that? Well, I'll write about this a little bit in,
2074080	2080720	well, I'll write about quantum biology in the story of Gaia, because whereas the cosmic hologram
2080720	2086160	was bringing the evidence and this underpinning and framing of these laws of infodynamics and the
2086160	2093120	cosmology and all the rest of it, that was back in 2017 in last year with the story of Gaia.
2093120	2099600	I wanted to tell the evolutionary story, not just of our planetary home, but our entire universe,
2099600	2107120	because the story of our universe, as my friend Brian Schwimm and I both talk about, is a story of
2107120	2113840	us. The hydrogen in our bodies is as old as the universe. We're not just stardust, even though we
2114400	2121600	are. We go back way back. We're all 13.8 billion years old. We're all 13.8 billion years old.
2121600	2128400	So in that sense, the evolutionary story is extraordinary. And what you see throughout
2128400	2134480	it and really came to me ever more strongly as I wrote the book or the book wrote me, I feel,
2135840	2142960	is a sense of evolutionary purpose. Because what you have all the way through is this almost
2142960	2149120	preparatory processes that things were in place that could then be assembled when the
2149120	2155840	conditions were right. If we go back before that our planetary home came into being about
2155840	2164000	five billion years ago, around five and a half billion years ago, the harbingers and the nutrients
2164000	2172240	that would create our sun and our planetary system, were all there gestating in interstellar
2172240	2181680	clouds of gas and dust, including complex molecules. And we start to get the sense of that quantized
2181680	2188960	nature of potential playing out there. Well, even within those complex molecules, we were starting
2188960	2198800	to get enzymes coming into being. And enzymes are vital to the speed in which proteins come
2198800	2206640	together and build biological organisms. Because the enzyme speed, those processes are
2206640	2212240	dramatically without in themselves changing. And the view very much is that that involves
2212240	2221520	quantum tunneling. And so when Stuart and Roger have been bringing these ideas of microtubules
2221520	2227200	forward, I don't think it's the most fundamental aspect of how this is playing out. But I think
2227200	2234960	it's an important contribution to the conversation. And other people such as Jim and Khalili has also
2234960	2242800	written on quantum biology. There is a view that some of them have expressed that photosynthesis
2242800	2248640	is quantized in nature. I personally haven't seen the evidence that's convinced me of that.
2248640	2255120	I think there are other processes that are at play that don't actually need that aspect.
2255120	2260240	But there are others where, as I say, in zomatic action and others, there are other ways in which
2260240	2270000	the DNA, double helix is formed and molecules such as posna molecules, and the way that that works,
2271280	2276320	that can really hold memory for a very long time, likely because of quantum resonance.
2277200	2282400	So I write about all of this in the story of Guy because it's very important. And it's very much
2282400	2290880	an emergent field of study. I'll definitely be putting links to your books below and to the
2290880	2297280	website, of course. I remember while reading, I was thinking to myself, there were two specific
2297280	2300560	experiments I wanted to ask you about while reading. It came to my mind immediately and I
2300560	2305680	thought of the observer effect and the double slit experiment. And I wanted to just know
2305680	2309280	your general thoughts on that. So I have one more question. But I think before I get to the second
2309360	2313600	one, just what are your general views on that? Because when I interviewed Don, I remember talking
2313600	2319200	about when we talk about consciousness being fundamental and the entirety of our reality.
2320400	2325200	And I labelled at the podcast a new experiment to test whether consciousness,
2325200	2329520	whether physics arises from consciousness, and someone commented saying,
2330080	2335280	have you ever heard of the observer effect as a joke? So I think with you, let's address that,
2335280	2344880	how that supports this. I really want to, though, expand this perception that the universe is the
2344880	2350000	universe, whether we're here or not. Yes. Yes, I think that's really important because so much
2350880	2356880	perspectives about consciousness is human centred. And I'm not suggesting that's problematic. I'm
2356880	2362880	saying it's both and. Yes. And the way that we as microcosms of our universe as macrocosmic
2363840	2370880	consciousness, sentience, livingness, mind, you know, because I think we can get caught up in
2370880	2375360	the languaging a little bit. And I want to sort of get a more so generic sense of this.
2377760	2385040	But yes, so going back to remind me, I think I'm losing the thread here. So with when we serve
2385760	2392880	observer effect, yeah, okay. The point is, we're embedded within a conscious universe.
2392880	2399360	There cannot not be an observer effect, because we're both observer and observed,
2399360	2404800	we are naturally embodied, we're inseparable. We are literally inseparable. But I think the
2404800	2411680	important point there is that the unity and unified nature of non locally unified nature
2411760	2417360	of our universe has two aspects. First of all, it means that although our universe exists and
2417360	2426320	evolves as a non locally unified entity, within space time, light is the cosmic speed cop signals
2426320	2432240	cannot go fast on the speed of light within space time, which means that we can have this journey
2432240	2438880	of 13.8 billion years, we can have a flow of time, we can have a causality. And this is important
2438880	2444720	when we start to explore super normal phenomena. Because although this both and
2445600	2451680	enable super, you know, naturalize a super normal phenomena naturalizes our intuitive
2451680	2458000	insights naturalize the synchronicities. It's a both and so there is this causality playing
2458000	2464000	through. So, you know, I was in a panel with Dean Raiden and the ions folks a couple of days ago.
2464560	2472160	And Don was being given a prize there, which is wonderful for his work. But essentially,
2472160	2478720	because it's it's it's a both and we are both observer and observed, we are inseparable,
2478720	2487440	but that unity is differentiated. It's unity and diversity, it's unit in radical diversity.
2488160	2494880	So yes, we're always we're informational beings within an informational universe,
2495520	2504000	whether we know it or not, we're in continuous dialogue, multi log. Yes, with all around us,
2504000	2509920	where we are, you know, we talk a whole world view of act local feel global think cosmic,
2509920	2515440	because we are all and we are uniquely our universe is breathing through us.
2516400	2522000	Each of us uniquely. So let's apply this this law of infodynamics, let's apply
2522000	2527280	infodynamics to different systems so people can get a better understanding of this. So let's
2527280	2532560	think of it from maybe let's take into account a biological scale or something like DNA, and apply
2532560	2537120	to something like human civilization, take it to economics, and maybe continue from there,
2537120	2542080	just maybe start off from a from an atomic scale, perhaps, and then let's work our way up.
2542080	2547280	Okay, let's do that, because what we're finding is that the informational patterns,
2547280	2555120	the relational dynamic informational patterns, many of whom we call fractals, not all the
2555120	2560240	relationships are a fractal per se, we have other relationships that we can come to,
2560240	2566960	for example, power laws, but we find the fractal relationships which are essentially geometric.
2567920	2574800	When Beckenstein was doing the the holographic work on information, and the pixelation at the
2574800	2581280	boundary of what we call space time, that plank scale pixelation on that two dimensional
2582080	2588320	boundary of space time is triangular. Okay, because then it can tile without a break.
2589040	2596800	It's the ideal geometry that doesn't overlap. So within each plank scale. Yes, pixelation
2597360	2602240	there is essentially one bit of information, and it's at such a minute level that when we scale
2602240	2610160	it up to atoms or quarks or neutrinos or and beyond, it has a lot of information already
2610160	2618640	at that accumulated scale. But what we find is that, for example, when an element is going
2618640	2624880	through a phase transition, for example, between an insulator and a metal, it's electrons cluster
2624880	2630000	fractally. Yeah, so from that scale, we start into because of course, the plank scale is much
2630000	2636320	tiny, that pixelation scale is much tiny. So we're out of atomic scale. We also find fractals
2636320	2642000	running through from that scale upwards. So for example, on a planetary scale, clouds are fractal,
2642960	2649360	in that sense, weather patterns are fractally based, river systems are fractal. But the key
2649360	2655040	thing here, and let me just go up to cosmic scale, and then I want to come back, because there's a
2655040	2661040	key point here, we find that at a planetary and a planetary scale, but also when we look at a solar
2661040	2670560	system scale, the solar wind is fractal. Some of the ways in which the resonances of planetary orbits
2670560	2676480	and planetary the planetary system as a whole have fractal relationships. We go into the galaxy,
2676480	2680240	we see fractal patterns here, we go to cluster galaxies, we see fractal patterns.
2680800	2689200	And in 2017, Afshadi and Skanderis and a group of folks looked at the cosmic microwave background,
2689760	2694640	which is, as you know, is the relic radiation left over from what's often called the recombination
2694640	2702240	era, around 380,000 years after the beginning of the big breath, where space had expanded enough
2702240	2706640	and temperature cooled down enough to become transparent, because before that,
2706640	2713120	space was transparent to acoustic signaling, but not to light. When that happened, again,
2713120	2719920	there was like a phase transition, where space became transparent, and therefore there was a
2719920	2726320	relic radiation that filled the whole of space at that time. And because the temperature that was
2726880	2731760	that was in play at that time, we think that it would have had an orange glow,
2731760	2737040	which I quite like the idea of really. Anyway, that filled the whole of space. As space has
2737040	2744080	continued to expand ever since, that those wavelengths have sort of lengthened to microwave
2745040	2749360	microwaves now. And so we call it the cosmic microwave background, and it fills the whole of
2749360	2757840	space. In 2017, an analysis from the W map, the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe map,
2759360	2764800	was able to show fractal patterns in the minute temperature differences throughout the whole
2764800	2770000	of the cosmic microwave background. So we have fractals all the way up and all the way back.
2770000	2776880	But going back to us, we find that the same fractal patterns that underpin, for example,
2776960	2782960	complex systems such as ecosystems, is the same fractal patterns that underpin the nodes
2782960	2790240	and the networking points of the internet. Yeah, we find, for example, moving beyond fractals.
2790240	2794880	So let's look at power laws. Let's look at the incidence, for example, of earthquakes.
2795760	2801600	We know that when we plot the incidence of earthquakes against the destructive power
2801600	2806960	on a logarithmic scale, the Richter scale, that they form a straight line. So in other
2806960	2812000	words, there's no such thing as an average earthquake. If you apply all the earthquakes big
2812000	2819120	to small on that, you know, that frequency, and then logarithmic destruction, they form a straight
2819120	2826160	line. It's called a power law, which says there's only one relationship for all of them, that an
2826160	2833600	earthquake that is twice as powerful logarithmically is four times less frequent. That's it. So there's
2833600	2839680	no such thing as an average, no Gaussian curve there. But at the end of the Second World War,
2839680	2846320	a researcher called Lewis Richardson, and then subsequently to that, a researcher at Miami
2846320	2852160	University, a gentleman whose surname is Johnson, but whose first name eludes me,
2852560	2859600	looked at human conflicts at all scales and measured them in terms of their frequency against
2859600	2865280	their destructive power in terms of human fatalities, and found the same relationship.
2866320	2871920	Slightly different pitch, but nonetheless the same relationship as for earthquakes.
2871920	2876240	Because what we're realizing, going back to what we're saying throughout this,
2876320	2882800	is the appearance of our universe emerges from deeper levels of meaningfully information, and
2882800	2890640	that applies to our human behaviors, our human consciousness, as well as universal consciousness
2890640	2897680	and planetary sentience, that brings forward these same relationships at all scales. But the
2897680	2906080	key here is if we have the collective awareness to make choices of conflict, then we can evolve
2906080	2911760	our collective awareness to make choices of peace. And this is, I think, one of the most
2911760	2919360	fundamental conversations of our time, because this is what this new understanding and this,
2919360	2926640	you know, this unitive narrative that can, you know, there's an underpin and framed by the evidence,
2926640	2930960	but also can underpin and frame our choices and their behaviors.
2931840	2937600	Exactly. And that's why, I mean, when I labeled this podcast, I said that this podcast
2937600	2942320	explores the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, but morality is a big part of it,
2942320	2947760	because whatever belief you have regarding the nature of reality or consciousness will determine
2947760	2954400	how you perceive your ethics, your morals, your values. And with your view, I see such a deep,
2954960	2960160	caring, healing nature towards it all. And I am definitely going to touch on these
2960160	2964240	practical implications. But before we do, I just want to definitely make sure that we
2964240	2968640	touch on as much of this, the science behind what you're talking about, because it's so amazing,
2968640	2974240	it's so intriguing. One thing I did want to touch on before that was, I mean, there was the big breath,
2974240	2980080	it all started, slow outbreath, you often talk about Vedic traditions and the Brahman and how
2980080	2984000	they started this concept. What happens as we go along all the way to the end?
2984160	2990000	Well, the evidence we've got now is suggesting that it's a continued outbreath.
2991760	2997040	For a long time, there was, is it going to be, is it going to do that? Or is it going to bounce
2997040	3003840	back? Or what's going to happen? And we find that the acceleration, very surprisingly for a lot of
3003840	3012720	people, that the expansion of our universe began to accelerate again, about five billion years ago.
3012720	3017840	So it started with an acceleration, the first time, you know, the first epoch of the big breath,
3017840	3022960	it then slowed down because the balance of gravity and dark energy and all the rest of it,
3023680	3030160	one out, one in. But then a space that expanded to the point of about five billion years ago,
3030160	3034640	the acceleration began again. And it looks as though that there's nothing to, there's no
3036320	3042000	way in which that that is likely to stop. And when I bring the third law of infodynamics
3042000	3048240	into the piece, of course, the temperature continues to drop, as the information continues
3048240	3054240	to increase, you can see that there's a sort of a cycle here. Because the temperature of our
3054240	3059680	universe, I said, began at the Planck scale at the first moment of the big breath, 10 to the 32 k,
3059680	3067120	it's now down at just over 2.7 k. So we're looking to see that this, this life cycle,
3067920	3074480	rather like a bubble, yeah, comes to a completion at some point. The other thing is there was some
3074480	3080160	really good work done by I think Dennis Sabral, a few years ago that I referenced in the Cosmic
3080160	3086080	Hologram, showing that the sort of the, the, the, the, the epochs of stellar formation,
3086640	3092960	and a big, big acceleration about nine billion years ago, then another, but progressively less
3092960	3099120	and less fewer and fewer, because the hydrogen to create new stars is being used up. So the view
3099120	3106000	is that probably something like 98% of all stars that could form have already formed. Many of them
3106000	3110960	have come to the end of their lives. And again, you know, as I write in the story of Guy, there's
3110960	3118560	this incredible evolutionary arc, you know, of massive stars at the beginning that formed black
3118560	3125040	holes and supermassive black holes and galaxies. And then, you know, it's just a beautiful, beautiful
3125920	3132240	journey, journey forward. So my perspective, again, with the evidence, you know, I'll follow,
3132240	3137680	I hopefully follow the evidence wherever it leads, but this is where it seems to be leading us,
3137680	3144800	that our universe is finite in form. It's a, it's a great thought form, but a finite thought form,
3144880	3150720	in that sense, in the mind of the cosmos. And we're probably closer to the end
3151360	3157680	than we are to the beginning in that regard. And I mean, it does work. So a lot of people seem to,
3157680	3161920	well, from what I've gathered, seem to think that you're not, you're talking about something
3161920	3165360	completely different, but you're not, you're actually taking the current work we have, and
3165360	3169920	you're framing it in a different perspective. And I think that's important to note is that it's not
3170000	3175200	that you're making new claims in a sense. You're more just changing it and adjusting it in a way
3175200	3181840	that completely shifts mindsets altogether. How do you feel this has impacted the scientific
3181840	3191200	community? Because you know how scientists can be. I'm pretty sure you've been, because anytime
3191200	3195280	someone talks about anything that goes outside of the status quo in science, you complete,
3195280	3200160	you're labeled as so many different things that how has it been on your receiving end?
3201440	3209200	It's been extraordinary, actually. It's been rather wonderful because in a way, because as you
3209200	3214080	say, I'm actually working with the evidence and I'm working with the evidence of tens of thousands
3214080	3221520	of researchers. I guess what I can bring is an ability to see patterns and an ability to join
3221520	3228080	up the dots, because so many scientists are working in this incredibly depth of work, but
3228080	3232720	they're not seeing what so-and-so is doing or so-and-so is doing in a different field of study.
3233360	3240560	And what I can do because of my breadth of interests is I can see the bigger picture
3240560	3247920	of what it's all coming with and the direction of travel. And also as a cosmologist,
3248880	3254080	we're getting folks like Professor Brian Cox, who wrote a book with Jeff Forshaw last autumn,
3254720	3261600	last fall, basically on black holes, but coming at the end of that book to say more and more it's
3261600	3266480	looking that the appearance of our universe is not its deeper reality. I don't know what that means,
3266480	3273680	he says. But that's the point that cosmologists are coming to, because that is where the evidence
3273680	3280080	is leading us. Now, you're right, I think, you know, I'm also a student of the history of science.
3280800	3286640	And I can see how certainly over the last, certainly until the 20th century, there was a
3286640	3293200	perspective very much of this separation of science and spirituality. And I can absolutely,
3293200	3298960	you know, I've studied all the reasons for this and get it. But we're coming full circle or full
3299040	3304720	spiral now, because the leading edge discoveries, and they really are only in the last few years,
3304720	3311600	the holographic principle, the understanding of information, you know, my, my redefinition of
3311600	3318320	the laws of thermodynamics to infodynamics, it's simple. Anybody could have come up with that.
3319200	3324480	The reason I did it is because I saw it with new eyes, as you say, and I wasn't caught with the old
3325200	3331760	perspective. And so in that sense, and that's what Marcel Proust of course said,
3331760	3337040	the journey of discovery is not discovering new lands, it's seeing with new eyes. And so I think
3337040	3344960	it almost is a situation where once somebody is willing to see with new eyes, it all fits into
3344960	3351040	place. And it's not in any way dishonoring everything that's come before. We've needed to
3351040	3357840	take every step it seems to me. So I'm not into blame and shame on any way. But we do have a paradigm
3358800	3364480	that's actually not even 20th century science. It's 19th century science of a mechanical,
3364480	3370080	mechanistic, materialistic, separatist universe. And that has been turned on its head. And when
3370080	3378480	we bring consciousness in, it's not, it's, it's, how can I put it, it's for all faiths and non,
3378480	3386400	it's human. It's who are we, it's remembering who are we, and not sort of making any labels
3386400	3391360	or anything else. But this is where the evidence is inviting us to remember.
3392640	3396240	Jude, before I go on to the next portion, where I'm going to talk about the practical
3396240	3401920	implications as well as the Eastern philosophical aspects of how you came to your views at some
3401920	3406640	point. The last thing I want to ask you is, is there anything you want to clarify in terms of
3406640	3412080	the way you approach infodynamics, cosmic hologram, all of this, anything that you feel has always been
3412080	3417520	misunderstood, that you've been itching to kind of just get out there and let people know this is
3417520	3425200	actually what I meant? Not misunderstood. But I feel that there's still a misperception of people
3425200	3431760	who work with entropy. And seeing it as this order to disorder I was mentioning earlier,
3431760	3436880	rather than as initially an increase in energetic microstates and now an increase in
3436880	3443680	informational content and now an information, an increase in meaningful informational content
3444400	3451440	is this perspective that came through with people like David Bowman, Prigga Joan, and others,
3452400	3459760	realizing that in what's called a dissipative system, such as our planet and a person, that
3459760	3466720	there seems to be a sort of a switch around of entropy. So entropy, it's not order to disorder,
3466720	3474320	it's somehow disorders become order. And so what I've been able to share and more and more people
3474320	3479920	are now getting it, is it's the old concept or the misperceived concept of entropy as order to
3479920	3486320	disorder, rather than from increased energetic states and now information. Because then what you
3486320	3492960	realize in dissipative systems, let's talk about our planetary home, a dissipative system,
3493680	3503440	actually, energy comes in, energy flows through, what's not needed to support the homeostasis of
3503440	3512560	that system is then dissipated. If you think of that as information coming in expresses energy,
3513520	3522000	information therefore used as a coherence to, you know, to support the coherence of that system
3522720	3529520	and what is not utilized gets dissipated. So again, that then correlates with this perception,
3530560	3537600	both of, both of the meaningful information, not just as underpinning, but the very stuff
3538480	3545040	of that system, that that throughput enables its coherence through its lifetime, whether it's a
3545040	3551600	human lifetime or a planetary lifetime. But also it shows that then going back to that third law,
3552320	3557760	that temperature difference is a measure of the entropic potential.
3557840	3566480	Yeah. So that so that in a planetary, you know, if we have a planet where that
3566480	3572080	dissipative process stops, the temperature difference between that planet and ambient space will
3573440	3578000	will will reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce. Yeah. When we come to the end of our life cycle,
3579280	3585600	our temperature when we die, when our physical bodies die, our temperature then correlates with
3585600	3593200	our ambience. So the ability by maintaining a temperature difference in a dissipative system
3594240	3601440	is a measure of its continuing entropic potential. I see. Yeah. Yeah, I get that.
3602720	3606400	That's the that's the one thing that I think people have quite a lot of because, you know,
3606400	3610960	terms like neg entropy and syntropy and all sorts of stuff's come in, they're not needed.
3610960	3615360	When you understand it in these terms, you can appreciate rather like the epicycles
3615440	3622560	of medieval astronomy, pre Copernican astronomy, you don't need it. And what you get is a much
3622560	3628880	simpler understanding when you're seeing it with new eyes. So you know, the Copernican,
3629440	3633680	putting soul in the middle of our solar system, suddenly you don't need epicycles and all that
3634240	3640640	complications. And you don't need the complications of neg entropy and syntropy, which of themselves,
3641600	3648800	you know, violate this universal continuing increase in entropy.
3648800	3652880	I think I think it's very apparent. I mean, if you if you have a hammer, you look for nails
3653440	3657760	and science, I mean, it's very objective. So you're constantly looking from an objective
3657760	3663120	standpoint. I mean, it's very difficult to get a step out of that. And I know I'm the same in
3663120	3668080	that regard, because when I started this podcast, my views and consciousness were very fixed and
3668080	3674080	firm. And the more it's gone on, the more it's continuously changed and non stop. I mean,
3674080	3678640	at this point, I question reality all the time. But it's something I've always done.
3678640	3682400	But I mean, that fixed belief is no longer there. It's something that's open to
3683120	3688480	exploring these new ideas. I don't think that the child in me would have explored concepts
3688480	3697520	like this with so much just openness. I love it. I love it. I mean, I love it.
3698160	3703440	Yeah, me too. I mean, it's all it's all a work in progress. It's all a work in progress. I mean,
3703440	3709840	for me, what's exciting is having had my first direct experience of, of, you know,
3709840	3713520	multi dimensional realities, you know, no ethic experiences from the edge of fall.
3714480	3721200	I've, I've also it's both and I've also really, really, really valued, you know, science as a
3721200	3728400	process, as long as this Francis Bacon, who is the father of the empirical method, you know,
3728400	3732560	follow the evidence wherever it leads. And I do feel he's been given a quite a bad rap,
3732560	3737040	which I would disagree with. Because as a friend of mine, another friend of mine,
3737040	3742320	Peter Dawkins, who's a wonderful Baconian scholar, you really has guided, you know,
3742320	3748080	like you, you've been my guidance with this is that, you know, 400 years ago,
3748720	3756720	when Bacon in 1623, when they published Day Augmentum Sientarium, which was the beginning
3756720	3763040	of the empirical method, you know, Bacon's philosophical, deeply philosophical perspectives,
3763040	3770560	it seems to me, were that it wasn't going to peripheralize the divine as he would have called
3770560	3777760	it, but to reveal the divine through its empiricism. Because of course, he was living in a time of
3777760	3785520	Queen Elizabeth II, and then James, the first of England, Sixth of Scotland, where superstition,
3785520	3791120	you know, ruled the, ruled the waves in that sense, and the church's authority. So it's almost
3791120	3798240	come this full journey now, where leading edge science is, is revealing that universality and
3798240	3804080	those wisdom teachings and the wholeness and the divinity within everything. Exactly. And I think
3804080	3809440	just to put it all together, because now, as we reached the end, well, the end of this podcast,
3809440	3815200	at least for now, maybe we'll do around too. But let's talk about, I mean, unity and non-locality
3816000	3820640	is the basis of all of this. And at some point, it all comes together for us to understand and
3820640	3827440	realize that everything is interconnected. There is no separation. This is the sort of
3827440	3832400	separating things needs to slowly dissipate. And this does have practical implications.
3832400	3838080	I think as we get into that, let's start from your East, the Eastern philosophy that's inspired
3838080	3842000	this and taken because we've spoken a lot about Western science at this point. And I'm curious
3842000	3846960	for you to apply the Eastern philosophy into how we should approach the practical and ethical
3846960	3852480	implications moving forward with this theory. Yeah, absolutely. Well, first of all, as you
3852480	3859520	said, I mean, you know, our worldview is our mindset, our narrative, our underpinning narrative
3860560	3865680	is the way we see the world and therefore the choices we make. And we've had a Western secular
3866560	3872720	worldview of, as I say, based on 19th century science. And all the structures that came from
3872720	3879040	that, because in the 19th century, with that mechanistic, separatist, materialistic perspective,
3879680	3885520	you know, our structures became hierarchical. You know, whether it's our education, whether it's
3885520	3892800	our organizations, our governance or whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever. And now that's
3892800	3898160	completely been turned on its head and converging much more with universal wisdom teachings and
3898160	3905120	very much those of the Eastern traditions and the indigenous traditions. And so, you know,
3905120	3911360	for example, the Chinese, Yi Qing talks about in the beginning is the one not was is the one
3911360	3917200	becomes to the two becomes three and from the three 10,000 things are born, you know, the yin yang
3917200	3924320	symbol. And we haven't even touched on the feminine masculine and all of that. But that's so important.
3925360	3932320	But you know, the yin yang symbol has, you know, the yang with the yin coming out and the yin with
3932320	3938960	the yang coming out. But the wave in that symbol is often not mentioned. But the wave is that
3938960	3945360	creativity of what this all means. And yeah, I talk a lot about trinities, philosophically
3945360	3950800	trinities, you know, the masculine, the feminine and the child. And in that resolution, and that's
3950800	3957920	again seen through many, many traditions. We talk about the Vedic tradition, as we have before,
3957920	3965440	Indra's net. You know, the tradition talks of Indra's net as a analogy of the reality where every
3966480	3973920	reality made up of beautiful gems of many, many different colors and all different facets and
3973920	3981440	each facet reflecting others and linked by golden threads. Well, that is a millennial old description
3981440	3987520	in my perspective of the cosmic holograms. In South Africa, we, because I'm Indian of Hindu
3988400	3994240	origin and descent. And but I was born and raised in South Africa. And the South African culture,
3994240	3999360	there's this word, it's called Ubuntu. I love that word. I love that. I am because you are.
3999920	4005920	And that's exactly what she's saying. Yeah, it's exactly that. And Ubuntu is so beautifully
4005920	4012000	inviting in. Because the other thing is that I love about Ubuntu, many things I love about Ubuntu.
4012000	4018480	But I talk about, you know, often we're now describing unity and diversity. But for a number
4018480	4025520	of years now, I've said, let's take that a step further, beyond even unity in inclusion to unity
4025520	4033840	in belonging. Because this is showing us that we all belong. And that is the very heart of Ubuntu.
4034800	4040000	Ubuntu is so fundamental because you don't have to be invited into that relationship.
4040000	4047040	You are inherently fundamentally part of that relationship. And this is what we're discovering.
4047920	4055920	And so altogether, I mean, this unification, this, tell me about the overall goal for us as a society.
4055920	4061360	How would you like this infodynamics and everything you've spoken about today to be applied somehow
4061920	4069920	into it all? Well, again, these things, have you ever heard of somebody called Mr. Magoo?
4069920	4074560	He's very much in America. Yeah. And he always backs into things and then looks around and goes,
4074560	4084640	oh, that's the story of my life, I think. So a couple of years ago, with all of this and writing
4084640	4089200	the Cosmic Hologram at the time, and then the story of Gary, sorry, writing the story of Gary
4089200	4095200	at the time Cosmic Hologram would come out. I came together with a number of change makers
4095200	4101760	and folks who'd been involved with the United Nations for decades, and involved with the
4101760	4107200	Sustainable Development Goals and what's called Agenda 2030. And we're getting more and more
4107200	4113200	frustrated because this realization that they were coming not necessarily from the people who were
4113200	4117680	trying to negotiate them, but certainly the way they were articulated and then
4118640	4126800	led out very much from this siloed perspective, 17 goals and lots of measurements, but the goals
4126800	4135120	themselves and the realization from these 150 or so change makers that they could never be
4135120	4140640	implemented with that sort of mindset. I mean, Einstein said, you can't solve a problem from
4140640	4148160	the same mindset that created it. Well, we have a problem because of an illusion of separation,
4148160	4155360	a dis-ease of separation, we cannot solve it from that same mindset. So all that I'm sharing and all
4155360	4163200	the evidence is pointing to is overturning that perspective and bringing in this realization
4163280	4170800	and understanding of wholeness. So what these folks were really wanting to say is how can,
4170800	4176320	because they were coming from this perspective, how can we bring this perspective of wholeness
4176960	4184640	into the SDGs and Agenda 2030? And one of the things that came forward was the need for a narrative
4185200	4190560	that could share this, because we're a narrative species, we're storytelling species, you know,
4191040	4197440	we sat round from the very beginning sharing stories and sharing perspectives, who we are
4198560	4202320	and what are we? Who are we in the world? Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?
4202880	4210640	And in that sense, making meaning of our existence. So we now have the evidence
4210640	4216000	that is converging, the scientific evidence that's converging with universal wisdom teachings
4216960	4224480	to offer us a unitive narrative, to underpin and frame us to be able to come together and serve
4224480	4229760	potentiality for transformational change. So I got involved with this group of folks and I put my
4229760	4237120	hand up and volunteered. That's my mum. My mum always said, volunteer, volunteer. You may not
4237120	4243040	know what you're volunteering for, but volunteer. So I did and I was one of the co-authors of a
4243120	4250400	unitive narrative, that these folks took on board and adopted and the evolutionary leader
4250400	4256960	circle of whom I remember also adopted and others. But what that's now doing that came forward
4256960	4262640	just over a year ago, what that's done in the meantime, is that late last year, the United
4262640	4272480	Nations for the first time in its 70 year history, adopted a group of NGOs and organizations founded
4272480	4279600	on the unitive narrative, this unitive narrative. And so this unitive cluster now has a voice, has
4279600	4285920	voices in all of the things that United Nations are doing. But that's just one thing, because the
4285920	4292640	other thing it's now underpinning is bringing together folks who are really wanting to transform
4292640	4300560	economics and finance system from a unitive perspective. Folks who will look at regenerative
4300560	4308640	economics, doughnut economics, living systems economics, but all of it underpinned and framed
4308640	4317760	by unitive narrative that then deepens it still further into unitive principles that serves
4318640	4322640	the health, the whole being of our planetary home and our people.
4322640	4330400	Unitive education. How do we share this story with folks of all ages and in so many different ways?
4330880	4339440	And how do we share this in ways through arts and culture? Because this is what this is about.
4339440	4346640	This is the many, many stories that can arise and be shared from this underpinning of a unitive
4346640	4353120	narrative. So that's what I'm doing pretty much most of my time now and sharing this
4353520	4361920	understanding, but it's vital that it moves beyond understanding. It has to be experienced
4362560	4367840	to be embodied. Well, I hope this podcast helps to get that message out, Jude. I know you're
4367840	4373360	time-sensitive and we've sort of reached the end of this conversation, but I just want to say thank
4373360	4378160	you so much. And to quote, I mean, your work and obviously Ubuntu, I am a Cosmic Co-creator because
4378160	4384560	you are a Cosmic Co-creator and thank you so much for being part of this creation with me and part
4384560	4392240	of this experience. Bless you, Tev. And it's folks like you. I mean, I've done so many podcasts now
4392240	4400400	and I'm in awe of each and every one of you as hosts because your passion, your clarity, your
4400400	4408000	service is so, so important because the folks you will reach in their own way will share this
4408080	4414720	in their own way. We don't know where this ripples, but we know it does because as you say,
4414720	4421120	Ubuntu, we are inseparable. We are each unique and we are inseparable. You know,
4421840	4427920	this offers us authentic hope. This, I hope, empowers us and inspires us. And this for me seems
4427920	4433120	that this is the invitation of the universe and our planetary home guy. You know, they're saying,
4433200	4439120	come on, items to this adventure. This has to be one of the most inspirational. Well,
4439120	4442400	I'm feeling well-inspired. One of the most inspirational talks I've had so far.
4444560	4449600	I'm liking it so far because there may be others who are even more inspirational to come.
4449600	4454480	Yeah, I've enjoyed it tremendously. Thank you so much, Jude. I wish you all the best and yeah,
4454480	4459920	I'm looking forward to chatting to you again sometime. I'd love that, Tev. Anytime. I'd love
4459920	4465680	that so much. Take care, Jude. And yeah, we'll keep you in touch. I'm looking forward to this
4465680	4475680	hearing. Cheers. Thanks.
