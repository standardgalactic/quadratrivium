0	14560	Thomas, I've been looking forward to interviewing you for such a long time. I mean, it's an
14560	18480	absolute honor and privilege, first of all. And I think the best way to start a podcast with you
18480	24720	would be to just go straight into the deep end. Let's start with two definitions. And maybe we
24720	29280	can differentiate between these two concepts, talk about the similarities. But let's define
29360	37840	what consciousness is to you and what the self is. Right. So consciousness is a folk
37840	45520	psychological umbrella term. Nobody knows what it means. You can always tell when neuroscientists
45520	49440	start their papers and they want to make some bold claims and they don't know what to say in
49440	55600	the opening paragraph. They always mumble something about what it is like and Tom Nagel.
56320	62720	And nobody knows what that actually means, what it is like, what that is,
63840	75360	what is to be explained there. A lot of people like to talk about qualia and 95% of them wouldn't
75360	85120	be able to say what that is, where it comes from. I think qualia don't exist. So one part,
85120	91920	as you know, I've been in that consciousness community for three, four decades of my academic
91920	97920	life. I'm one of the people who founded the association for the scientific study of consciousness.
98720	104480	And there's a persisting problem. There are naturalist philosophers like myself
105600	113280	who think that naturalism is not an ideology, but a research program. And that research program
113280	121040	consists in reformulating classical philosophical questions about consciousness in a way so that
121040	127680	they become tractable for the empirical sciences. So there's a continuity. It's not an ideology
127680	133680	because naturalist philosophers would be completely open if exactly empirical research
133680	141200	shows there is something that cannot be explained. So if you're an anti-reductionist, if you believe
141200	147360	there is something that is mysterious about consciousness and unexplainable in principle,
149360	156000	then you will have to become a naturalist because it's your goal to describe that
156880	163200	or can't be explained as precisely as possible. And you want to make progress. You want to
163200	168720	describe that, what is unexplainable, more precisely than it has ever been described
169440	174240	in the history before. So if you're an anti-reductionist, you have to become a
174240	181360	neuro-computational modeler, a neuroscientist, and you have to follow the naturalist program.
182720	189120	The persisting problem is we don't know what the explanation is. If you think about it
189920	199120	more carefully, nobody can really say what it is that needs to be explained. Here's an example
199120	209600	from our own life. So like 24 years ago, I spent a wonderful year at UC San Diego with the Church
209680	219600	Learns. And on a few occasions, I went to lunch in the faculty club with Francis Crick,
220480	227200	one of the most famous Nobel laureates we ever had. And he wanted to crack the problem of
227200	233440	consciousness after having cracked a problem of life. And I still remember one conversation
233440	240000	which got out of hand where I basically said, yes, but Francis, what is it that you want to
240000	246640	explain? And then he said, in the forthcoming book, I've described that conversation. You know,
246640	252640	you philosophers, you've had more than 2000 years time. I'll tell you what, if you want to make a
252640	259760	contribution, the best thing would be you just shut up. We're going to kill this thing in neuroscience
259840	265040	in the next two decades. And I said, yeah, that's great. I'm all for it. I'm a naturalist,
265600	270960	founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. What is it that you're trying to
270960	279520	explain? Then he mumbled something about that for strategic reasons. In the early phases of a
279520	287360	research program, it's not advisable to have two narrow definitions of your explanandum. I said,
287360	292960	yeah, of course, I understand you don't want to have overfitting philosophical models of
292960	299680	consciousness and all that nonsense. But it just, tell me, what is it that you want to explain?
299680	308960	And then he got really angry at me. You have this to this very day, whole people, whole groups of
308960	315760	neuroscientists have made a career in the neuroscience of consciousness. And there has been great
315840	323280	programs. But nobody can say what exactly it is they're trying to explain. And so that's,
323840	332400	we have an ill-defined folk psychological term consciousness, which has a long history.
333200	341200	For instance, it has a Latin history over centuries, conscientia. It has Greek precursors,
341200	347200	zenedesis. There are a lot of connotations in different cultures and contexts, and it's
348000	354480	not quite clear what we mean. So there's a job for philosophers in this research community,
355360	362800	still laying conceptual foundations. Now you asked about the self? That was your second question?
363280	371920	No such thing. You know me. I just had, you have to cut this out.
374400	378880	I got two messengers telling me I have a recording with you in 10 minutes.
382240	387360	Let me just. I was wondering what that sound was actually. I thought it was a frog.
387600	397280	Everything now. Okay. So what's the self? You don't have one. You couldn't have one.
398080	406080	The most naive way of approaching it is that people talk about their self. But this couldn't
406080	413760	be the case, because then it would be something that you own. You have an ownership relationship
413760	419840	to that self. This couldn't be the case. And that already shows how confused things get.
420560	429520	If there is a self in a certain way, you are it, there must be an identity. And I'm all okay
430240	436960	with people saying, for instance, okay, then let's call what you call the phenomenal self model
436960	447280	in the brain, the self in future, in the future. And if you want to change our rules for speaking
447280	455360	about the self in that way, in a scientifically grounded way, you can do this. But then it means
455360	461680	that is something that is highly intermittent, that is super unstable during REM sleep,
462240	471520	dreaming phases, that doesn't exist during non REM sleep. It is something that has multiple layers,
471520	479760	is highly incoherent over time. And most of all, not something that, as German philosophers would
479760	488880	say, hold itself in existence by itself. I think the proper English term would be ontological
488880	497840	self subsistence. So selves are not elementary building blocks, I think, of the universe,
498480	506480	or substances in the classical metaphysical sense of a substance, or some intrinsic essence or something.
507920	514480	They are high level phenomena. If you want to treat whole biological organisms as selves,
515440	522400	then they are pretty impermanent high level phenomena. If you want to just speak of the
522400	531520	experience of self consciousness, which as I think locally supervenes on brain properties,
532240	539600	at one and the same moment, then it is an even more abstract high level features some
539680	546800	computational property of a biological nervous system. If we want to talk like that, that's
546800	555360	fine with me. But that's of course, never what we meant by self. Yeah, when I read ego tunnel and
555360	560960	being no one, I remember just thinking that this is pretty much where my work was aligning to. At
560960	564880	that point, I remember thinking this is perfect for my dissertation. I remember thinking there's
564880	569920	so many chunks, I could possibly quote out of this out of these books. And I did, I remember
570800	576240	referencing you and taking a lot of your work in, I mean, you specifically you delved right into the
576240	581120	psychiatric phenomenon, and you spoke about every aspect of consciousness, the unity,
581120	587280	transparency, self-perspectivalness, temporality, first person and third person experience.
588560	592400	When you think about these concepts and how philosophers have debated this over time,
592480	598240	the story of the mind body problem. What would your story, if you had to tell someone the story
598240	602640	of the mind body problem, what story would you tell people? The reason why I'm asking this Thomas
602640	606720	is because I find that it's interesting to see how somebody has come to understand this problem
606720	611680	over the years, and how it evolved their own view of what consciousness is today.
612080	619600	Well, first of all, I think, and that is something that is
620320	626400	frequently overlooked, is that there is a pre-theoretical mind body problem,
626400	635920	and a pre-philosophical mind body problem in which all of us can feel, which people have
635920	643360	held over the centuries in different cultures. Usually one would say the modern history of
643360	648960	the mind body debate starts 350 years ago with Descartes and substance dualism,
649680	658160	but of course there are deep historical roots also in other cultures. But what makes Descartes'
658240	666080	view so very appealing to beings like us is actually, I think, a feature of our naturally
666080	675600	evolved self-model in the brain. And I'll tell you an anecdote to illustrate this,
676480	684400	the history of the mind body problem in my own life. I thought in about the fifth semester,
684400	689920	I thought philosophy was absurd. I thought these professors should be different than professors
689920	700160	of chemistry, so they should be wise and impressive. And I found them very narcissistic and pretentious
700160	709040	as a young guy, and I thought this was a very absurd academic enterprise. And then I participated
709120	719920	in a seminar where we looked at two lesser-known works by Descartes, The Treatise on Men, Lom,
721280	728160	and The Passions of the Soul. And there was a young lecturer at that time who made me see
728160	735200	something for the first time. So we looked very carefully at the passages where Descartes says,
736080	746960	in the pineal gland, that's where the soul interacts with the brain. And then he pointed
746960	755200	something out. He said, if mental entities have no spatial properties, as Descartes says, and only
755200	763520	bodies, corporeal entities, are divisible in space and have spatial properties, then it follows
763600	772720	that there cannot be a place in the brain where the soul interacts with the physical body. That
773440	782960	is a completely wrong question, a wrong research program. Where is the locus of interaction between
782960	791040	mind and matter? It cannot be like this. If one of the two principles only has properties in time,
791680	797440	the mind unfolds in time, but no spatial properties. And that's when I got hope.
798720	805840	That's when I had the feeling as a young man, that is a theoretical problem that is worth of my
805840	812640	attention. Because at the same time, 1977, there was Popper and Eklis, the self and its brain,
813280	820640	and they do exactly the same thing with their theory of three worlds. And they have this
820640	827760	speculative Nobel laureate, John Eklis, the speculative model of the liaison brain.
829120	834800	Today, this would be the minimally sufficient neural correlate of consciousness. And the idea is
834800	845040	that is where it is. Now, if it's really non-spatial, this could be the case. But then I started thinking
845040	853120	about the human self. And I realized that for all of us, there are some parts in my phenomenology,
854080	863200	my robust sense of selfhood, which are spatial, my limb movements, my gut feelings, my visor
863200	874320	spatial perspective, and everything. And other things are really not located in the body image.
875120	882800	My thoughts, emotions are very interesting. Moods are very interesting. I'll just start,
882800	890400	if one takes one's own conscious experience, seriously, I make the following claim, if one
890400	898480	really doesn't talk like one has learned to talk, if you see, say, a top down psychophysical interaction,
898480	907360	I decide to lift my hand and I lift my hand. I can observe something I could call the decision.
908480	914960	And I feel my arm moving. But what I do not observe is the actual causal link.
916240	921760	We talk like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know my decisions, my intentions cause my behavior.
922320	928560	We have grown up in this language game. But is our phenomenology really like this?
929840	939920	Or if somebody pinches my arm and I feel a pain? Is there a phenomenology of upward causation,
939920	948720	really? I think there's a gap. And I have, as you know, a long story to tell that the human
948720	955120	self model evolved because we had to jump from branch to branch and run away from predators.
955920	962800	And in the beginning, it was important to navigate and control a body as a whole to integrate
962800	970640	our sensory perceptions, all spatial things. Then we evolved social properties, language,
970640	977200	abstract representations, which were not really grounded in that body image anymore.
978720	987520	And that is why what I mean by the pre philosophical mind body problem, before we start even to think
987520	996240	about it, we can feel it beings like us beings on another planet with another evolutionary history
996240	1004320	might not have that kind of intuitive dissonance, that intuitive mind body problem. But what is
1004320	1015920	happening? Other beings might not be able to imagine their mind as independently flying away,
1015920	1022800	floating in somewhere after their body has died. But for us, we have these
1024320	1030960	philosophers also say modal intuitions, intuitions about what is possible and what is necessary.
1031760	1038320	And for us, it seems to come necessary that my mental processes could somehow
1040320	1045760	go on without body perception of any kind of space spatial or sensory perception.
1047280	1055040	And these, these intuitions are grounded, I say, in our biological evolution in computational
1055040	1062880	properties in our brain, and they make Cartesian intuitions. There is something that doesn't belong
1062880	1071840	to that animal machine body. They're so plausible. And if I read Descartes, now, I mean, I don't
1071840	1080160	believe it. But Descartes still has a strong appeal to me. And that is because it directly
1081120	1087840	plays to a representational divide in my phenomenal self model. That's would be my terminology to explain
1087840	1095680	it. If that is true, many philosophical problems might actually have phenomenological anchors,
1096800	1106320	might actually look like a deep and important problem to beings like us, because they are anchored
1106560	1111760	in the model of reality that we have evolved on the history of this on the surface of this
1111760	1118160	planet with these brains. So that's the pre philosophical mind body problem. And then
1119200	1128240	we have, of course, a century long history, as you know too well. And I think one important
1129040	1137920	thing to understand the problem of consciousness is not one problem. It's a bundle of theoretical
1137920	1145840	issues and a bundle of more empirical relations. The mind body problem equally is not one. Okay,
1145840	1152480	you can say what is the causal and interaction or what is the metaphysical interpretation of
1152480	1157440	correlation data between brain and mind or something like that. But there's a whole
1158560	1167360	how do you say a spectrum of theoretical issues. Some are very old. Like, what is the mechanism
1167360	1175440	of interaction? Some are very young. For instance, Daniel Dennett, I think has done us all a great
1175440	1183280	service in his today rather unknown 1969 book content and consciousness to introduce this
1183280	1190800	distinction between sub personal properties and personal properties beings like us can have. And
1190800	1199280	then there's this whole Donald Davidson story and so on. In the old debate, that personal level
1199280	1206800	properties like the having of beliefs, the having of intentions and desires can in principle,
1206880	1213760	in principle, for conceptual reasons, never be translated down, reduced to sub personal
1214640	1222000	theoretical entities in the brain or so. So you have multiple distinctions sub personal personal.
1223840	1230160	What what is causal? What is the most rational metaphysical interpretation of the empirical
1230160	1239200	data we have. And now to come back to you and psychiatry and being no one as you know, I mean,
1239200	1243440	for me, it's a strange experience that you ask about this because this was another guy.
1244320	1249200	This was a quarter century ago, right? And then at some point the difference in how it's changed
1249200	1257920	over time. Yeah, you know, now I it is a very many authors know this, you know, now I will get
1258720	1266240	a very substantial and angry email from some Chinese PhD student. But it was
1267520	1276080	25 years ago, when I sat in the eighth floor of the humanities building in at UC San Diego,
1276080	1280720	opposite to the office of Paul Churchlet and wrote this. And now I get all the heat
1281680	1284880	because because people
1287760	1293680	actually can work with it. And one of my goals was I think philosophers should do that
1295520	1302960	is to develop conceptual instruments and tools that people in other disciplines can use.
1303920	1309600	So if a psychiatrist and just like you, I have interacted with psychiatrists a lot during
1309600	1317600	certain phases of my career comes and says, that is really useful. I can use that in my own research
1317600	1323520	that I don't understand that that's nonsensical. But this idea is really helpful.
1324720	1330880	Then I've made a contribution, you know, in interdisciplinary research. And the
1330880	1338240	psychiatric case studies in being no one, which I used, which are of course now outdated and one
1338240	1345360	could do many much more precise stuff there than I did 25 years ago. There's also now
1345360	1356160	computational psychiatry, for instance. So I wanted just to show what is not necessary.
1357360	1364480	So, you know, to have the more fine grained representational architecture of the conscious
1364480	1373280	self. Because I realized many philosophers at that time, excellent analytical armchair
1373280	1380880	philosophers, just didn't know what is possible for a human mind, like, I don't know,
1380880	1387280	quotas in Rome or something like that. How does it play a role in your own work?
1387600	1397360	So here, are you a psychiatrically informed philosopher or a philosophically informed doctor?
1397840	1403920	So I was, there was a time where I was, I thought of being a psychiatrist. So I'm currently just a
1403920	1408960	medical doctor with a master's in philosophy. But the focus of the masters was in the philosophy
1408960	1415360	and ethics of mental health. So it was primarily while I was working in psychiatry and doing this
1415360	1421760	masters. And it was interesting because the textbook was the Oxford textbook and handbook
1421760	1428640	of philosophy of psychiatry. And that's a very important thing. So it was philosophers of mind
1428640	1433440	should be uniquely intrigued by psychiatry, the same way psychiatrists should be uniquely intrigued
1433440	1438240	for what philosophers of mind have to say. And I think that's what drew me to your work in the
1438240	1442560	first place was because you, you were not just taking philosophical arguments and discussing
1442560	1448720	these concepts, but you were trying to practically apply these to the real world. And, and I think
1448720	1452000	that's what you're currently doing with your latest book as well. You're trying to find ways
1452000	1457920	to apply these, which we'll definitely touch on. But for me personally, I think I love both. I love
1457920	1462880	the, I love the search for these answers, the philosophical journey, I would say, as well as
1462880	1468160	the way this would impact my own clinical decision making, because, yeah, because all these first
1468160	1472960	person's subjective experiences matter when it comes to treating patients who are telling me
1472960	1478800	third person objective stories. And I think that's very fundamental. And you touch on that
1478800	1483200	beautifully. I mean, the, oh, just by the way, Thomas, I just wanted to ask, because you spoke
1483200	1488160	about Francis Crick before I forget about this. And the big discussion you guys had, what did you
1488160	1494160	think of David Chalmers and Christoph Cox final end to the, to the whole debate?
1494480	1503840	So I didn't go there this year, because I sensed this might be turned into a big self marketing
1503840	1515200	show there. But I was of course, the guy who organized ASSC two, this was ASSC 26, and firmly
1515200	1522320	put the society on a map with a huge conference in Bremen. And that is where Christoph and Dave
1522400	1530240	actually created that wager that bet they made over a beer. And that was where it was actually
1530240	1537840	made. I still remember it was a horrible experience. I worked practically a whole year of my life on
1537840	1546080	that conference with 400 people. And then the computer science department had the famous Easter
1546080	1552720	crash. And everything was down for three weeks. And we had lost all registration data. So we didn't
1552720	1560480	know who had paid. We didn't know who had reserved a room for what time. So there were large groups
1560480	1566880	of students standing when people were streaming into town and faking it and saying, Oh, what's your
1566960	1577520	name, Dr. Naidu? You had tell me again, because we just didn't know how many bookings we had,
1577520	1586880	and payments and everything. And I also know that I had 60,000 marks at the time to organize the
1586880	1599120	conference. And it cost me 110,000. And if that was not a famous, now deceased old neuroscientist
1599120	1607120	who came to my rescue afterwards, I would have been in big trouble. So this was when Dave and
1607120	1615440	Christoph were still young guys, and I'm making this. Yeah, so I haven't been there.
1618880	1626960	Many people think, you know, I have edited this 2000 book with the MIT Press Nora correlates of
1626960	1635120	consciousness, which reflects some contributions to that conference. And many people today think,
1635200	1641120	I've heard Julia Tononi tell me this the last time that the NCC approach is basically
1642400	1648640	failed now. And that we have an enormous amount of data, of course, about neural correlates.
1649280	1656800	But it hasn't generated the theoretical breakthrough. And now, of course, a lot of the smartest young
1656800	1664720	people are giving a lot of work and effort into computational modeling, using cough,
1664720	1674480	resistance, mathematical instruments. And I think this is where we might go in the future,
1674480	1684480	which, by the way, changes things for young philosophers. When I grew up, I got a lot of
1684480	1690880	trouble with the philosophical establishment, because I said, and I created young people like
1690880	1696720	this, you have to be good in one area in philosophy, and you need an interdisciplinary
1696720	1703360	photo, just as you have psychiatry. There must be one area in neuroscience, like color vision or
1703360	1710160	dreaming. That's your second hobby. And where you're absolutely up to speed in the empirical
1710160	1718160	literature, then it gets interesting. Or you go have something in AI, or in evolutionary biology,
1718160	1726160	or in animal consciousness. And a large part of the philosophical establishment didn't want this,
1726160	1732960	and I could have made a much better career if I hadn't said this. So now things have changed.
1732960	1743120	If you today say a young philosopher who wants to do philosophy of mind should have one foot in
1743120	1750480	neuroscience, it's almost a bit outdated. They should have a diploma in mathematics.
1752560	1760240	If the journey goes on, as I predict it does, using the free energy principle and the conceptual
1760240	1768080	tools involved, then it simply excludes a lot of the best young philosophers who don't have this
1768080	1776560	math, just as I don't have it at their fingertips, from the debate. If that's where the edge of research
1776560	1786080	moves to, this is also a sociological event. Because then, you know, when I was young, many
1786080	1792640	German philosophers were trying to hide the fact that they could not participate in international
1792640	1798880	debates because their English wasn't good enough. But now, it could be that you can't participate
1798880	1806080	because your math isn't good enough. And this might also apply to many psychiatrists. If this
1806080	1815760	project of computational psychiatry goes through, I'm not going to say anything about
1815760	1823200	psychoanalysis. I'm going to be polite, but a lot of this stuff is going to look
1824960	1831600	like some outdated New Age fantasies or something like this, some esotericism. And I must say,
1832560	1839120	in philosophy of psychiatry, tell me what your experience is. But I've had conflicts
1840000	1848960	with German psychiatrists who are very well-meaning, because there is this branch of phenomenological
1848960	1861120	psychiatry where people actually are on the theory level of 1940, Ludwig Binswanger, that kind of thing.
1861680	1867840	That's where they stopped thinking about philosophy and theory. And then their practice
1867840	1875040	a whole lot. And if they have a certain subgroup, you tell me if this is the same in South Africa.
1876320	1885040	And psychiatrists have an anti-reductionist ideology. And that's very strong for them. It goes
1886000	1891680	together with pop phenomenology. And I think that's all fine. They should believe that.
1892240	1899040	But what I don't like, if somebody acts out their own ideology on suffering people,
1899040	1906480	on people who have a real serious problem, in these cases, we need just the best evidence-based
1906480	1913680	theories we have. And we have to be super rational. But I found in my research career in
1913680	1920720	interacting with psychiatrists, then many of them are a little ideology-driven. And
1923040	1930480	are neither well-informed about empirical facts in neuropsychology or neuroscience,
1931360	1937440	nor do they know anything about current debates in philosophy. Would something like this be true
1937440	1941760	in the South Africa? I think yes, very much so. I think especially because we saw
1941760	1945920	culturally diverse here in South Africa that you tend to notice when someone
1945920	1949920	from a completely different background is treating a patient who completely does not
1949920	1954880	understand what this person is talking about. And you see these culture clashes sort of playing
1954880	1961520	a big role in how it's very miscommunicated constantly. And the person who comes from their
1961520	1966560	own different culture sort of indoctrinates the other person or almost talks down to them.
1966560	1972080	If it's, let's say, a doctor who's well-educated, a psychiatrist who feels superior and talks to
1972080	1976880	someone who, let's say, grew up on a farm in the middle of a region of South Africa that's
1977440	1984880	very rural and non-educated. And you can tell the sort of ideologies that this person has
1984880	1988800	and is placing on this person. Perhaps someone of African culture and descent who
1988800	1994960	believes in completely different gods, completely different ways of living, values clash completely.
1994960	2000480	And it's opening up certain spheres of philosophical debate. There's one known as
2001840	2007200	African values-based practice where you have to sort of incorporate values and understand
2007200	2013200	that even when we treat patients, implicitly, there's normativity applied to everything we
2013200	2018560	do on a day-to-day basis. And we can never forget this. And psychiatrists often forget this. And
2018560	2022560	it was a part of that. When I learned about this, I realized the blurry lines between
2023040	2027280	when you dissect psychiatry philosophically, it really does change the way you perceive the
2027280	2032560	field altogether. And not you can actually trust neural correlates of consciousness the way we
2032560	2038240	talk about it or not. And how we should actually apply this knowledge that we have. Because most
2038240	2042640	of the time, we don't really even know the difference between physical illness, bodily illness,
2042640	2049040	and mental illness, and the direct or indirect links they really have. And that makes it very
2049040	2057760	tough on this side as well. Yes, you know, at first, where I first saw something, when I studied
2059520	2067200	philosophy, it was even if you wanted to get women, it was very important to do something
2067200	2073280	with psychoanalysis and Marxism. That was the hottest and the coolest stuff that's where all
2073280	2083600	the good-looking women were. And I realized that it's a bit like poetry, but the psychoanalysis,
2083600	2090240	but I don't know what is wrong with it. And then then once in passing, just said this,
2090240	2096000	we talked about personal level properties and sub-personal level properties. And he said,
2096000	2105360	if you introduce little persons in the brain or somewhere to explain personal level properties,
2105360	2110400	you explain nothing, you've just explained them uncally. And then he suddenly said, well,
2110400	2117040	the super ego and the id, these are actually, they don't explain anything because they are
2117040	2123680	themselves described as personal level properties. And that was sometimes in your life, somebody just
2123680	2131360	says that in passing. And it really opens a perspective to your life. That's when I understood
2131360	2140400	that this is really also not open to improvement, to empirical improvement. But to this day,
2140400	2148720	I don't know about South Africa, but in Germany, in Europe, I mean, it's firmly established psychoanalysis
2148800	2156000	as a completely false theory of the human mind guides therapeutic action. And
2158240	2164720	I've heard psychiatrist friends of mine say, well, as long as you can make a living and earn
2164720	2174240	money with it, that long, you will have that. And so psychiatry is actually an interesting case
2174240	2181360	where people have, they must have theories of mind or theory of what the conscious mind is.
2182000	2189280	And they try to heal, they try to alleviate suffering. And then there are other people in
2189280	2196720	philosophy who have also theories of mind, who are absolutely clueless. If you tell them, yeah,
2196720	2202720	but you know, you can consciously experience thoughts without ownership. It's not necessary.
2202960	2211440	That there is a thinking cell. I mean, I know times where colleagues said this is conceptually
2211440	2219680	excluded. This cannot be the case in this world. So many old fashioned philosophers have these
2219680	2229520	a priori assumptions about what is necessary in the human mind. And then nobody listens anymore,
2229520	2236640	because now we have so many empirical data will show that it can be otherwise. But then again,
2236640	2245600	psychiatrists, this has to be said, who also have a very high workload in their everyday life,
2246160	2253360	and are under pressure. And you cannot really demand from them to read peer reviewed papers
2253360	2259760	from analytical philosophy of mind. It's a difficult situation. It needs these conceptual
2259760	2266560	instruments. But they are in this everyday, you know, they have to make decisions.
2268240	2276400	Under time pressure. And with great suffering. At the time when I was writing also in German
2276400	2282880	and speaking about the self model, I often had patients contacting me, which was often a
2282880	2293360	harrowing experience. So something that's a time back. I had schizophrenics find me out
2294800	2301200	privately or their relatives. And they were seriously convinced they had a philosophical
2301200	2308560	problem. You know, they read the ego tunnel. I see. And then I said, no, please listen to me,
2309120	2316000	you have to go into treatment. 1% of the world population have this. And then they say, no,
2316000	2321600	no, no, you don't understand. I just want to understand the self model. I say, no, please.
2324000	2332240	Is there a relative in the room? And I've had a lot of moving experience. For instance, one time,
2333120	2340480	I was invited to the psychiatric department at the University Clinic of Frankfurt, my hometown,
2340480	2347120	gave a big talk about the self model. And in the course, you know, a lecture hall
2348240	2356480	of explaining that there's no such thing as a self. I realized that a considerable number
2357040	2363040	of bored patients in how do you say in English, they're nightgowns. Yes, and they're,
2363760	2371360	you know, they're comfortable house shoes had walked in from the ward that there were actually
2371360	2380000	patients sitting in there. And not only psychiatry professors. And watching the faces during my talk,
2380880	2388560	I realized this is not good, what I'm doing. There are some people in this audience who shouldn't
2388560	2395760	be here that they shouldn't, they shouldn't hear that. It's shocking for them. And somebody let
2395760	2403360	them in. I don't know, do you let your patients go to lectures? That's what I'm saying. It's
2403680	2410960	it's such a difficult bridge to tiptoe on because you never know, even with philosophy in general,
2410960	2414800	you never know what type of philosophical insights might trigger a psychotic episode.
2416800	2421040	I mean, there's so many different, and that's what my master's focused on. And it really,
2421040	2425200	that's what actually almost swayed me away from psychiatry, because I didn't go through with it.
2425200	2429920	Now I just practice as a regular medical doctor, which just happens to have a master's event
2430000	2435040	out that I'm not really technically I'm not applying it, but I think I'm always applying it.
2435040	2439920	But because there's so many different facets behind this, how do you approach it philosophically?
2439920	2444240	How do you approach it psychiatrically without ignoring the philosophy? Because
2444240	2448400	these two fields are completely intertwined, and we can never really separate these two. And I
2448400	2453920	think it's in order to do that. I think you cannot approach both of these topics without
2453920	2457920	including the other often say that when you try and make a conclusion regarding the mind-body
2457920	2463200	problem to not incorporate the atypical or the illness side of the mind, then you've
2464080	2469120	completely uninformed decision. And I think that's why it's great that at the moment you're
2469120	2475600	applying this all the time. And you mentioned Dennis and this passing moment and how he did that to
2475600	2481760	you. I want when you think about Thomas, your view on consciousness altogether, because I know
2481760	2486640	you consider this self to be an illusion. I mean, we're obviously, it's a phenomenal self model that
2486640	2491120	we've created. When you take it far as consciousness, do you sort of head towards
2491920	2496640	Dennis' definition of consciousness? Do you take it to an illusionism view of consciousness as well?
2497280	2506880	Well, I have to confess, I'm getting sidetracked again, because listening to you,
2507680	2520160	I have to make a footnote first. My psychology professor friends all know that they have a
2520160	2526240	large population of students who come actually come to university with a self-healing project.
2527920	2534320	In philosophy, you do have office hours too, you know. And the truth is,
2534960	2542880	there is a small but considerable subset of philosophy students who take the subjects
2542880	2550560	because they want to find a reason not to commit suicide. And I have seen this, just what you
2550560	2561760	mentioned, to study philosophy properly can cause psychological crisis in some serious young people,
2562720	2571520	some, you know, for instance, when they come from Muslim backgrounds or Catholic households,
2571520	2577920	and they are for the first time confronted with arguments for atheism or something like this,
2577920	2584400	and they go into it for a whole semester seriously, it can create big problems. But then,
2584720	2591920	of course, there are also people who say it's people from South Africa who have good arguments
2591920	2597600	to say that non-existence is to be preferred over existence, and you will have
2600560	2608240	some young people with whom this resonates very strongly. So philosophers know this
2609120	2615920	in another way. Now, before I get to illusionism, I have to say I think the way out is to change
2615920	2621280	the incentive structure in the educational system and in universities. We need something
2621920	2627600	that I have called died in the rule inter-disciplinary. So we need a whole generation
2628480	2633280	of students who do, for instance, psychiatry and philosophy in parallel,
2634240	2640160	but who get rewarded because it's extra work to be good in two disciplines at the same time,
2640160	2646160	who have an incentive structure to do that. What we do have is this fake inter-disciplinarity
2646720	2652240	in writing grants together and trying to get money, and then we all just, as soon as we have the money,
2652240	2659040	we pursue our own hobbies, you know, and not that. So it has, you actually have to create a new
2659120	2665040	generation of young people, and if the political system doesn't manage it, to make it attractive for
2665040	2673760	them, to, you know, be to track research personalities, psychiatry and philosophy, and invest the
2673760	2683520	extra work, then there will take other trajectories in the academic career universe, and you will not
2683520	2692640	have the psychiatrists you are asking for. Illusionism. My confession, not with Dennett,
2693280	2700560	but I have perceived this as, and I may be absolutely wrong, as one of these constructed
2700560	2708640	debates, some people organize to get traction and eventually get tenure and create a little debate.
2709600	2714800	So you can tell me a little bit about what illusion, because I really haven't followed
2714800	2725200	the research literature. So where I start is, I have sometimes in my popular writings said
2725200	2733120	something that was false, that one shouldn't say, namely the self is an illusion. This is
2733200	2737440	false for at least two reasons. One, illusions are somebody's illusions.
2739680	2748880	Second, if you define your terms properly, a hallucination would be a sensory misrepresentation
2749520	2754480	where the object actually does not exist, whatever the voices, whatever you see.
2755280	2762880	An illusion would be a sensory misrepresentation, a distortion, where a perceptual object
2762880	2768560	actually does exist in the outward. These are the proper definitions. In that sense,
2769200	2775200	consciousness cannot be an illusion. In that sense, so I always had the feeling at the beginning,
2775200	2781200	this is a bit flaky, vague, right at the beginning, I get what they're saying,
2781280	2792000	I want to try to get at. But of course, if you know my own theory about the PMIR,
2792640	2799680	about the phenomenal model of the intentionality relationship, I have said that the self model
2799680	2809200	is not just about the emotions, the thoughts the organism has, but that there's actually
2809200	2816240	in the human conscious model of reality a representation of what philosophers like
2816240	2822240	Franz Prentano or Edmund Husser have called the era of intentionality, the intentionality
2822240	2832320	relationship. So being directed at a perceptual object or being directed as satisfaction conditions
2832320	2842080	at an action goal is actually that is something that is represented in us. And that is also what
2842080	2846320	a first person perspective is, you know, it's very dynamic.
2849280	2855600	Now, of course, it is part of most of our self models
2856560	2864640	that we are conscious right now. And in the forthcoming book, I will say,
2865920	2873040	and provide empirical evidence that exactly this is false. It's not you that has the property
2873040	2880560	of being conscious, but the epistemic space as a whole. It's just normally I call this the
2880640	2887120	contraction principle, and it's maybe a bit too much to go into details here. It's contracted in
2887120	2893440	normal non altered states of consciousness. It's contracted in the experience of a knowing self.
2894560	2902240	I call this an epistemic agent model. So the model of an entity that wants to know
2903200	2912000	selects goals of knowing forms concept directs its attention. That is an agent that an epistemic
2912000	2918880	agent and active information hungry system that tries to know learn more about the world and
2918880	2927840	itself. That's an epistemic agent. And an absolutely central part of our self model is that epistemic
2927840	2936960	agent model. Now, if you see where this goes, you know, you also spoke about when I watch,
2936960	2941440	I think that I was watching one of your lectures on, you were talking about an autonomy, the mental
2941440	2945600	self control, the veto control, and then you did bring this up at some point. I remember
2945600	2949280	you did bring about the fact that we have these epistemic agent model as well.
2951600	2955680	And was this the lecture you gave on where you spoke about wandering minds at that point?
2956320	2961680	I think so. Yes, I'm not working in this field anymore, but I have published four
2961680	2969200	philosophical papers on mind wandering. And I'm kind of proud that the first one is basically the
2969200	2980160	first one for a century, because I thought for, especially for philosophers. It is very important
2980160	2986640	to take note of the new empirical research on, as I call it, task unrelated spontaneous thought,
2987440	2995040	mind wandering daydreaming, because the very simple factor, a lot of details is that
2996480	3003440	we are not in control of our own cognitive processes for more than 50% of our conscious
3003440	3014480	lifetime. That's a safe conservative estimate. And I still remember when truly I talked to some
3014480	3020720	eminent philosophers about mind wandering and the repeated collapse of the epistemic agent model.
3020720	3027200	So I think when you have control over your focus of attention and listen to me, you have a stable
3027200	3033360	epistemic agent model, but then you very often have a brief attentional lapse and think about
3033360	3039440	what you have to do tomorrow or what your next question should be. And then that epistemic
3039440	3049040	agent model collapses and has to be reconstructed. So in my view, mind wandering episodes always
3049040	3055600	begin with a collapse of the epistemic agent model. That doesn't mean that the daydream cannot
3055600	3062160	be about a future epistemic agent model that complicates things. But then you come back to
3062160	3068480	in the present moment after a certain time, right? And I still remember some years ago,
3069120	3075680	I talked to these really excellent philosophers, and somebody I really like, William Seger from
3075680	3081600	Toronto said, now after the talk, come on, now this is, I have been listening to you for 60 minutes.
3083520	3089840	Are you saying I have not been listening? That there were interruptions
3090800	3100560	and I said, yes, maybe a few hundred, maybe a couple of dozen. And he said, but you're not,
3100560	3105920	this is not phenomenologically realistic. You don't say while I'm listening,
3105920	3112000	have been listening for one hour to you, I've had constant interruptions and lapses in listening to
3112000	3119440	me and say, yes, that's what the data show. And the interesting thing was Bill and some
3119520	3126560	others just didn't believe it. Just didn't believe it. They say, this is not true. This is not my
3126560	3134800	own experience. I'm a stable knowing self. I've listened to you for many minutes. And that's
3134800	3141200	an interesting discussion, you know. I feel sorry, I think my mind wandered off a bit there,
3141200	3145920	because I accidentally took you off track there. When you were talking about these epistemic,
3145920	3151520	these agents and these minds trying to understand your theory of consciousness a little bit more,
3151520	3155760	do you feel that it's more of a linguistic problem that we are? Linguistics are playing a
3155760	3160720	big role in us and our limitations in describing these phenomenological experiences. Do you believe
3160720	3167200	that that's a major factor that hinders us from solving this problem? Well, that's the deep classical
3167200	3176720	insight of analytical philosophy of mind. It of course does. But now I think we have a much better
3176720	3183280	and fine grained way to describe what is actually happening. There's a hyper prior landscape in
3183280	3191120	our brain, a landscape of very abstract assumptions. For example, about what a thought is, who the
3191120	3201680	thinker is currently, and what the epistemic agent is. And you can have, if you have through
3201680	3208240	cultural embedding and through language games you've played, you have a strong assumption
3209280	3216800	that you are actually a continuous entity, a continuous epistemic agent. You need very careful,
3216800	3222960	you need meditation retreats, you need a meditation practice, you need very carefully trained
3222960	3232320	introspection to discover that that's actually not true. As you will top down shape your own
3232320	3239120	experience of your own thought flow like this, and you will of course speak like this, this will
3239120	3246480	reinforce the whole process socially, and you may not discover subtleties in your own experience.
3246960	3255920	Unless neuroscientists come and do experiments with mind wandering and say, yeah, but people,
3255920	3264320	if you test it, they have so many lapses. And they don't realize them. So the interesting thing
3264320	3272720	about it is that just as most people walk through their everyday life, automatically thinking,
3272800	3279760	neurotically planning, being haunted by unbidden memories, without even noticing that they are
3279760	3290400	thinking. The same, of course, happens with these lapses and the mind wandering. Most people
3290400	3296960	do not even realize that they're absent-minded. Unless you do something like experience sampling
3296960	3303360	and fix a buzzer, a buzzer to your arm and whenever it buzzes, you ask yourself,
3305200	3314480	have I been on task? And you're like, no, I was planning the holiday. But if the buzzer
3314480	3320720	hadn't been there, you would think I was just washing dishes and I was paying attention all the
3320720	3331680	time. And so I think if one refines introspection with the help of empirical research, one may
3331680	3337680	discover that many philosophical assumptions about the human mind, for instance, the stability of
3337680	3345280	the epistemic agent model, actually falls. And you're talking like this all the time,
3346240	3355840	reinforcing it. Maybe some psychiatric patients are very sensitive people who have a
3356720	3364800	better than average introspection and discover these discontinuities in themselves and get
3364800	3371040	buried by them, could be. I was on that note, I was speaking to, when I spoke to Carl Friston,
3371040	3377440	we spoke about this phenomenon in psychiatry where someone who's acutely psychotic,
3378640	3384080	schizophrenic patient, acute psychosis, and you know the visual illusions, the checkered
3384080	3390240	board illusion, all those famous ones, the blue dress, those types of famous visual illusions.
3390240	3394960	A lot of the times when these acutely psychotic patients are having this episode,
3394960	3398240	they don't tend to fall for it as much as the average human does.
3399200	3406800	And that's a very fascinating set of research done because it begs the question of how this
3406800	3413200	psychosis has completely revamped the way they perceive reality. So while we might consider
3413200	3418880	them to be acutely psychotic and quote unquote not seeing reality for what it is, they're actually
3418880	3424800	seeing reality for a little bit more verticality than we are actually seeing. So there's something
3425040	3431920	hyperacuity and that hyperacuity might of course be lower into higher levels and then
3433920	3443520	cause problems there. Yes, I've had interesting conversations with people in a closed ward.
3445040	3453280	Unfortunately, both close friends who both are dead now. The most interesting thing for me is if
3453280	3461200	you have a very careful conversation and you go along and you can say, you know that this step,
3462080	3469920	this is not consensus reality anymore. This is what nobody believes. This isn't there, the towers,
3469920	3477840	the towers where they're watching you. And they are absolutely aware of it. They can even say,
3477840	3484000	I know this is not your reality, but it is my and I cannot help it.
3488320	3495280	That is very interesting. It also has to do with the transparency of reality models. I mean,
3495280	3502400	I don't know what the solution will be, but a very interesting question is of course how
3503200	3506720	to become representations of the world that the brain generates
3507840	3514960	real, like irrevocably real, and how do they become opaque and just
3516000	3525840	like say in derealization syndrome or something become unreal. What are these mechanisms? I've
3525840	3530640	also been fascinated by this. Most philosophers just think, well, this is just reality, perceptual
3530720	3540080	reality out there in a household person. But in epileptic seizures, under the influence of hallucinogens,
3541120	3548400	there is phenomenological hyperrealism. It's just like the volume control for
3548400	3557200	realness can be turned up and down in depression, in depersonalization, as you know, much better than
3557200	3568800	I do. The realness can go down even the realness of one's own body. What is that? And I have great
3568800	3579120	hope that computational psychiatry will be able to describe this. What makes it real?
3579680	3588560	One thing I'm already only recently beginning to understand is it may be that we have a better
3589920	3596560	theory about how psychosis happens, how complex hallucinations occur.
3597840	3606480	But this might still not mean that we can help people or cure people, because the human brain,
3606480	3618960	the human mind is such a complex thing. Do you have any view on how this might be brought into
3618960	3626240	therapeutic efficacy? Yeah, I think there's certain ways. I know what Carl Friston we spoke about.
3626240	3629920	So when you think about free energy principle, and actually when I wrote that paper where I
3629920	3636880	quoted you a couple of times, I spoke about how when you use that principle, or if you use
3636880	3644240	hierarchical Bayesian brains and active inference as a theory to approach psychiatry,
3644240	3648080	and then you go into computational psychiatry, you can then talk about the prior information
3648080	3652960	that you take in and the posterior conclusions that you make. So let's say you use virtual
3652960	3658160	reality for an example, or you take a bunch of virtual reality headset and place it on a patient,
3658160	3662640	you can almost try and shift the prior information they constantly get on a day-to-day
3662640	3668880	basis, tailor their reality to something that we have to first prove, obviously with evidence,
3668880	3676080	seems to lower the episodic rate of psychosis. So if we almost put them into a new reality
3676080	3682960	that slightly aligns with their physical reality a bit more, and almost remove some of the deluded
3682960	3688560	thoughts or the perceptual hallucinations that they experience, you can almost assist them in
3688560	3694560	that regard. But then we end up falling into the trap of possibly inducing psychotic. So it's
3694560	3700400	because we've altered the perception of reality, and this is why I find it so difficult to apply
3700400	3705760	many of these. Yeah, I mean, the tools are coming. There are some very interesting
3706320	3715920	results I vaguely remember with anorexia and body distortion, perception disorders.
3717200	3724000	A very interesting but also sobering thing I saw many years in Milan and in Italy
3724880	3730800	is they took a number of psychotic patients without insight and professional actors from
3730800	3740560	the theater, and the actors played the patients exactly what the patient says and what he or she
3740560	3749040	does. And the interesting thing was that caused insight. So while they're watching somebody
3749040	3755440	playing themselves, they suddenly realize they're ill and there's a reason that they're here. But
3755760	3765760	the curtain closes again after the intervention. It's not a lasting insight. And that's, of course,
3765760	3771360	an interesting question. Like, how do you get, I mean, you are ill, you think you're someone.
3771360	3777760	How do you get a lasting insight into the non-existence of self? A question Buddhists
3777760	3783920	have asked, of course. And a big part of a mental state examination is, and while often
3784560	3792000	psychiatrists will use a MSE, is what they call it, and MSE, so mental state examination. So
3792560	3798400	one of the main factors is insight in judgment. So when they're assessing you, one of the key
3798400	3803360	things they'll write down is either poor insight in judgment or maybe fair insight, poor judgment.
3804400	3809200	Because sometimes, even if they have all the insight they need, the judgment regarding the
3809280	3814560	insight they have still doesn't correlate and correspond. So it's so difficult to actually get
3814560	3820240	down to what they really want or need. Another thing you could use, let's say virtual reality for
3820240	3827280	would be exposure therapies. So if someone has a serious fear of heights, maybe just to slowly
3827280	3832560	bring them while knowing they're in a safe environment to utilize it in that regard. But
3833520	3838480	that's just technology, though. That's not necessarily an application of a theoretical model,
3838560	3846640	I would say. So an ordinary, so-called neurotypical and healthy citizen,
3847760	3856640	how do you rate them on insight? That's exactly what the focus was on. I'm both
3856640	3861280	offered from Oxford. I mean, that's what he takes books about, is that we just cannot draw lines
3861280	3867680	like that. It's such a blurry spectrum in general, which is how I see consciousness at this point.
3867760	3872720	We don't really know. There's so many different ways to define it. How do you actually draw lines
3872720	3877600	with anything? But does that relate? Can we come back to your question of illusionism?
3877600	3885520	Oh, yes, yes. Imagine an extreme case, rare case of Quotas syndrome,
3887600	3896640	where a patient will claim that he is dead and asks for the body to be disposed of.
3897680	3908240	And will claim that he's not conscious. I mean, that is something we know. It can happen
3909040	3916160	that human beings are firmly convinced that they are dead and also have no mind.
3917840	3924400	Does this tell us anything about illusionism? Or is this just rare anecdotal material?
3925200	3931600	Well, I think it actually could tell people that the phenomenon is possible. So that's where I
3931600	3935760	think someone like the I don't know if you're familiar with the new defenders of these types
3935760	3942880	of theories like Keith Frankish, who firmly, what he describes is more of a ways I phenomenal
3942880	3948160	experience. So he says that these experiences are existing. It's the way we're defining them
3948160	3953120	to be more real than they actually are. So we're giving them this almost essence like quality.
3953760	3957520	And I think that's where he specifically says, no, this is not actually correct.
3957520	3962720	It's quasi-phenomenal. It is something that's happening. It's more the phenomenal nature of it.
3963600	3967600	That intentionality or the aboutness that a lot of philosophers talk about
3967600	3970400	is what he's referring to that's not necessarily there.
3971760	3974960	So and I think that's where Dennett also goes with it as well. But honestly,
3974960	3976800	I can't speak for them. I don't really.
3977360	3990080	Well, I think there is a completely underrated paper which appeared in 1988
3991120	3997680	by Kathy Wilkis, also the late Kathy Wilkis, an Oxford philosopher,
3999040	4006320	who has a very simple point. She went through all languages and said that way over 90% of
4006320	4011200	the languages that have evolved on this planet do not have a word for consciousness.
4012960	4019040	I don't know if this would still stand to test by today's linguistics,
4019040	4027440	but I believe it's probably true. So she makes this very funny move that she says,
4027440	4033120	yeah, that happened after the Cartesian catastrophe. That's a problem that emerged in
4033120	4040480	certain small circles in Europe 350 years ago. The rest of humankind never had a problem of
4040480	4050160	consciousness. You know, they have to be infected with it a little bit. And that is also
4053200	4059920	interesting. Why have so many human beings or cultures not evolved?
4060880	4069760	The concept of consciousness that puzzles us so much now. It's like they never saw the need
4070800	4076880	to describe something. I think they will understand what wakefulness is.
4079040	4084000	I think most human beings will understand that what it means to be awake.
4084560	4095360	You can also possess. So I haven't read Frankish or I don't know this debate. But would it tell us
4095360	4106240	something to know that there are certain kinds of coma where you have all the physiological
4107200	4115280	signs of being awake. You have a sleep wake rhythm. You even have gaze following movements,
4115280	4122320	sometimes which make it very hard for the relatives. But definitely also retrospective
4122320	4127200	reports, no conscious experience. The patient doesn't know they exist.
4127280	4137120	And at the same time, in ordinary folks, we have wakefulness plus a conscious experience of
4137120	4144080	wakefulness. We can feel wakefulness. I say a lot about this in the forthcoming book where I have
4145280	4151280	500 reports where meditators from 57 countries in the world describe the experience of pure
4151280	4158560	awareness itself. And of course, it has a lot to do with just clarity and the experience of
4158560	4168640	wakefulness. So you can be awake and not know it. And you can be awake and awake. Like hopefully
4168640	4174880	the two of us are now doing. Does this tell us something about illusionism?
4175600	4183600	That's a tough one. Look, I remember when I wrote my essay back, this was years ago as well.
4184480	4190880	I at the time believed in it quite firmly. And not anymore. I mean, I think that I think this
4190880	4196240	podcast specifically has completely changed the way I perceive consciousness in general. And I've
4196240	4201760	spoken to so many different philosophers, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists,
4202400	4210240	that at this point, I find myself just not knowing where I stand. I often say I'm ontologically
4210240	4216080	agnostic regarding this concept at this point. I'm very intrigued by all the epistemology,
4216080	4222320	everything we can talk about, but I'm almost unconvinced by all of them and very convinced
4222320	4229200	by most of them at the same time. Okay, let me add to your confusion. I think
4229200	4237760	consciousness is not a subjective phenomenon. Because we have empirical evidence
4238880	4245920	for conscious experience without a first person perspective. So I'm not going to go into details,
4245920	4254240	but say empirical data on ego dissolution under psychedelics, or the phenomenology of
4254320	4260160	advanced practitioners of meditation, where there is just awareness without anybody we see
4261840	4269920	that all the stronger philosophical notions of subjectivity, like epistemological notions,
4269920	4278160	or even metaphysical notions, I would claim are grounded in our conscious experience of
4278160	4287280	being a knowing self directed at the world. That's where this issue comes from consciousness is
4287280	4291520	an intrinsically subjective phenomenon. And that's why it cannot be explained.
4293200	4301600	But now we do have mounting empirical data that conscious experience can actually exist without
4302560	4312400	an experiential perspective, somebody directed at it. So couldn't it in these cases be something
4312400	4323840	that not a person has, but that an organism has? Even Thomas Nagel said that in an unknown paper
4324320	4330960	called the boundaries of inner space in 1969, he says, if we, he said, we may have to fall back
4330960	4338480	onto the notion of an organism, if we cannot describe it as a personal level property. So the
4338480	4346720	brute awareness or the consciousness of it all. So could it actually be that
4346800	4355600	we are blinded by the fact that in almost all cases where we actually enjoy conscious experience,
4356480	4365440	there is always a knowing self and a perspective? I agree. I think it's, it's, it's one of those
4365440	4369360	things. There's, there's some great work being done at the moment by Michael Levin.
4369920	4376880	Uh-huh. Tell me. And so he, well, he works with bioelectrical networks and what he slowly
4376880	4380480	tried, I also don't want to, I'm just going to paraphrase, because honestly, his work is so
4380480	4384960	complex that I even barely understand some of the concepts myself. But for the most part,
4384960	4390880	he's trying to blur this line completely of what intelligence is and what a big role this plays
4390880	4396160	for our own understanding of what consciousness is. And to show that even cells, even, and I'm
4396160	4400800	not talking about neurons, I'm talking about general cells, um, have electrical communication
4400800	4406400	that occurs, that if you disrupt or disturb it or even reprogram some of the electrical
4406400	4412320	communication, you can fundamentally change the way the cell will proliferate and develop
4412320	4417040	general. So that means this communication between cells that go beyond just chemical.
4417040	4423040	And, and rather this is neurochemical communication and intelligence nonetheless.
4423040	4427120	And the goal, I think, I mean, he's working, there's other people like Chris Fields,
4427120	4432800	Mark Psalms, Carl Friston, that they're sort of combining all these different fields together
4432800	4438880	and, and coming up, drawing slowly conclusions using Markov blankets and just various different
4438880	4444080	as fields. Yeah, just to sort of show us and blur this line even more of what we really consider
4444080	4451200	to be intelligent, conscious, um, in general. And I think it's sort of a fantastic program and great
4451200	4459360	work. Yes, it's exciting times. And from my point of view, the real question is if you can
4460640	4469520	find scale invariant abstract principles that go through from physics to biology
4471040	4475600	to the expression in our own brains with conscious experience. And I think they're
4475600	4484560	basically there. I mean, Carl's story is basically anchored in statistical physics.
4485280	4493520	And we can see how this can be nested on different timescales. But still, I think
4496160	4501680	there's no such thing as panpsychism. Of course, these abstract computational properties
4502320	4510000	that go through the levels, they will have different strengths or so. But if you would say
4510000	4518400	that cells or even protons have proto-phenomenal properties, that's one of the sexy stuff people
4518400	4528000	like to hear. Then you get, then you get just another question. So why is our expression
4528000	4535920	of this form of being conscious so very different and so, so much richer? You just kick the, you,
4536560	4544400	how do you say, you re-confront the problem on a higher level. If you say there are similar
4545920	4551600	principles at work through all scales. But there is, of course, something unique
4552400	4559520	in waking up from dreamless deep sleep. There is something very dramatic happening there.
4560400	4570000	And the question is, of course, it's also a bit unsettling. I think the motive,
4571360	4578800	the unadmitted motive for many people who are interested in the metaphysical side of consciousness
4578800	4588160	and all that, is that they look for a clever way to satisfy one of the deepest emotional needs,
4588160	4595040	all of us have, which is mortality denial. So if you want to make a career in a philosophy of
4595040	4602320	consciousness, you have to find some, you can't say anything crazy or wrong, but you have to
4602320	4611600	offer people a sexy back door, something like proto-phenomenalism or something like
4611600	4619680	panpsychism. Then you get a lot of intention. And that is because of often unadmitted basic
4619680	4628160	motive is, but could it exist after death? Could it exist after the biological brain has died?
4628160	4641840	And this deep need, which also is something computational. I have introduced a term that's
4641840	4650960	called existence bias. And David Benatar would immediately understand it. We are beings who
4650960	4658400	will always opt to continue their own existence, even if it's not in their own best interest,
4658400	4665760	even if it's obvious, even to them, that this will just increase the overall negative balance
4665760	4674240	of suffering. And there's a reason for this. I think Karl's story helps us to understand
4674320	4681840	why we suffer from existence bias, because we have to stay in a very, very narrow window
4683760	4692320	of certain parameters to stay alive. The process can be described as finding evidence for one's
4692320	4700960	own existence, as predicting, continuously predicting our own existence, to put it
4700960	4708000	falsely and in a very primitive way. We were never meant to simulate future worlds in which
4708000	4715680	we didn't have a lot of healthy offspring or in which we were dead. Of course, for short-term
4715680	4720640	risk management, we have to recognize I might be dead if I do that. That's a separate thing.
4721200	4728960	But in principle, also, I say in the new book, we are an embodied existence bias.
4730240	4740000	We are resistant, resistance. We resist thermodynamics in an amazing, highly improbable
4740000	4746480	way. You know how improbable it was that you and I haven't dropped dead of our chairs during this
4746480	4752000	conversation? Physically, it's a bizarre event. You know, that systems like that
4753360	4760960	should evolve that far away from thermodynamic equilibrium somehow create a stable state,
4760960	4767600	but we do it. And this is one of my favorite philosophers, Jacob Howey,
4769040	4774720	at Monash University, as described in a recent paper, because we follow an inner norm.
4775680	4785120	And that norm is this existence bias. Now, my point is the existence bias on a psychological
4785120	4793280	and psychiatric level leads to mortality denial and to what the Buddhists have called
4795120	4802080	the thirst for existence. We have this thirst for continuing existence, non-existence,
4802160	4810400	somehow almost is no option for us. And as long as we're healthy, as long as we're
4811760	4819280	mentally healthy. But my point is this also spills over in our theoretical treatment of
4819280	4828960	consciousness. Most of us normal human beings who are not monks, who have renunciated the world
4829520	4835120	and are ready to go into non-existence. Most of us that read these books about consciousness
4835120	4842960	have this deep, and this is not something intellectual, my existence bias. It's a
4842960	4852800	computational principle I embody in my cells, existence bias. And we want to find out, can
4852800	4862960	this help me, proving my own existence? Can this help me developing a delusion? Because
4862960	4871360	now part two is we have a problem that probably no other animal on this planet has. We know,
4873600	4880240	I'll express it in free energy terms again, that our predictive horizon will eventually shrink
4880240	4890640	to zero. We know that we will die cognitively. That is what I call in the new book a toxic form
4890640	4900880	of self-knowledge. It's a major danger to our self-model. Evolution didn't want this. If we want
4900880	4909120	to stay functional in seeing our own mortality so clearly, we need to tweak our model of reality.
4910000	4916800	States of consciousness are phenomenal models of reality. And that is where religious delusion
4916800	4927520	starts. This is where we have to find a way to come to terms with this, to deal with our mortality
4928240	4935680	because we are an embodied existence bias. And that is a big problem most people don't see if
4935760	4942400	you want to make a theory of consciousness. Because nobody wants to hear eliminative materialism.
4943200	4949920	Everybody wants to have something that's a little mystery. You know what I mean?
4949920	4954320	Yeah, I get completely what you're saying. I mean, it's almost that little bit of an
4954320	4959040	Iain Vitelle, something that makes you special, something that almost you're going.
4959920	4971920	Yes, of course. And you want any solution that doesn't leave a door open for that prediction,
4972480	4981680	simulation of future selves might go on after physical death. Everything that says no,
4982080	4988480	your predicted horizon will shrink to zero doesn't feel right to beings like us.
4989360	4999600	It feels unhealthy. It feels not good for the integrity of our self model. And that's the problem
4999600	5005760	materialists are really ruthless scientists or philosophers have, because there's a crowd out
5005760	5015520	there. And the crowd says, yeah, but this is a disenchantment of the world. On a God level,
5015520	5023760	this doesn't feel like, I like the heart problem of consciousness. I like that better. And isn't
5024480	5032320	panpsychism that, you know, that has an appeal? And that's a major barrier in making a theory of
5032320	5038240	consciousness. Thomas, the name of your book, it's a very German word. Do you want to just say it
5038240	5043200	for me quickly? And just for the listeners in the US? What? The name of the book, the forthcoming
5043200	5050960	book. Or the forthcoming book is where we use MIT Press in English, The Elephant and the Blind.
5051840	5057360	And of course, there's a German version of it too. How do you say the German word? Because I've been
5057360	5067840	trying to pronounce this for a while. The Elephant and the Blind. Okay. And it is, of course, that
5067840	5074880	metaphor is describes exactly our situation in trying to understand what consciousness is, you
5074880	5080880	know, some people have a flank, some people have the trunk, some some blind people have the tail.
5081520	5088320	They're all right. Then complete disagreement with each other. And the way I was actually
5088320	5094000	talking about is is Bavoud Steinskultur. Is that is that the word? Oh, that is the latest book,
5094000	5099680	which hasn't found an English publisher yet. That is out since 6th of January. Yes, yes.
5100800	5107120	That is a different. Do you want to know about Bavoud Steinskultur now?
5107840	5114960	I know how to pronounce that one. That that was about creating a cultural context, where we also
5114960	5120960	ask normative questions, questions like what is a good state of consciousness? Yes, yes. Will,
5120960	5126960	of course, apply to psychiatry? Sure. I mean, you spoke, I think there was a point where I
5126960	5132240	heard you discussing the fact that you look for what is it a negative utilitarian approach to
5133200	5138320	yes, to life. And I was really curious to know about a bit more about that work on your view on
5138320	5149360	that and how it touches on the mind in general. I'm a bit hesitant to go into that for two reasons.
5150880	5157120	One is I'm not up to speed on the technical literature on negative utilitarianism. I have to
5157120	5164960	say that. I just, I mean, I've peeped into it a bit and I have certain intuitions, which I can
5164960	5171360	explain. And second, I have found that it is one of the question you have just asked is
5172800	5177920	one of the philosophical issues that are hard to discuss in the public.
5178640	5183840	Yes, not true. Because they hurt some people too much. I think some people don't want to go.
5183920	5187840	That question. Let's just, we'll scratch that. I'm going to edit that. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going.
5189120	5196720	I think it's a very tenable position. I don't know about Benatar's specific exposition and the
5196720	5203520	argument, but it's a very tenable position that life is not worth living and that existence is not
5203520	5211440	in our own best interest. I even have put a thought experiment out on the web, which is called
5211440	5220960	the barn scenario, which is called benevolent artificial antinatalism, which makes the assumption
5220960	5229200	that a superintelligence emerges. And it is not in any way misaligned with our interests or unethical,
5230320	5235280	quite the opposite. It is, of course, much better in moral cognition than ourselves.
5235840	5241120	It's fully on our side. It's not an end event. It's a benevolent superintelligent.
5242000	5249600	And it discovers that nonexistence is in our own best interest and that for reasons
5249600	5256000	of self-deception mechanisms that evolution has put into our brains, we are not able to see this
5256000	5263040	fact that nonexistence is better. For me, it's completely obvious that we just state this that
5263040	5271680	if you see humankind as a whole, it is an ocean of suffering and confusion. I would even
5274320	5281120	expand this to sentient life on this planet. I think evolution is nothing to be glorified.
5282160	5288640	On this planet, it has created an ocean, an absolutely unfathomable ocean of suffering,
5289360	5297520	this fear of death, anxiety in an enormous number of conscious individuals that didn't
5297520	5304800	exist at this place in the physical universe before. So actually, we are in a highly problematic
5304800	5311760	situation or highly problematic here. And I mean, of course, evolution is also something
5311760	5319440	fantastic that has created all these beauties and the forms. But I think for me, it is highly
5319440	5331680	intuitive that an ordinary human life contains more suffering than joy. And I call this NP,
5332960	5340640	negative phenomenology, very simply defined as all states which the system,
5340640	5347520	if it had a choice, would rather not live through. And I can, if you want to, do you want two more
5347520	5357040	minutes about this topic? We can. Yeah, we can go. Yeah. So I wanted to do an experience sampling
5357040	5370000	study, but never got to it. But I did a pilot study with, I think, 12 or 17 of my PhD students
5370080	5380960	in my group. So it was, so the question was this, you're going to get for one week,
5381520	5389680	you're going to get random SMS messages at different times. And whenever your phone buzzes,
5391920	5398400	you check, is this a moment I would take with me into the afterlife? So the thought
5398400	5406320	experience is like that. There is an afterlife. But it's called the eternal playlist thought
5406320	5414080	experiment. But you will not have any new experiences after death. You can make a selection
5414080	5420880	from those experiences you have created before you died. And they will buy a random randomized
5420960	5429280	algorithm that will be played back to you in eternity after death. So the question is how
5429280	5434560	many moments in your life do you actually have if you look there, where you say, oh, I would take
5434560	5446720	this with me into life after death. So I think we did, I have to, I think we did 100 samples.
5447600	5453680	Then you lose about 30 people don't hear the phone buzzing, you get 70.
5455440	5466080	70 data points from every student. And the two arguably two smart ones were embarrassed to say
5467760	5474720	that they had no, in the course of a whole week, they had no moment that was so good
5474800	5481760	that they would take it into the afterlife. Other people made other ugly discoveries. For
5481760	5486320	instance, they got into trouble with their girlfriend because the girlfriend realized
5486320	5491200	when they're hanging out of the court couch with her in the phone buzzes, he never says this was
5491200	5502000	a good moment. He never does anything on his phone. So I think the average was something like seven to
5502080	5509600	eight good moments or less per week. And then philosophical discussion exploded. That was
5509600	5514560	even more interesting. So all these brilliant young PhD students said, yeah, but this doesn't show
5514560	5521280	anything. And I'm writing a PhD thesis and I'm making a contribution to mankind. And it absolutely
5521280	5527840	doesn't matter if I'm lonely, or if I'm unhappy. This doesn't say anything about the value of life
5527840	5534080	or boom, I couldn't say anything anymore. The defense mechanisms were up. But what I would
5534080	5542080	really like to do is a large, hurl bird style, experience sampling studies, just asking people
5542720	5547760	a large number of people this last moment before the buzzer rang. Would you want to
5548720	5557120	take it into the afterlife or not? As a criterion for a moment that where life was worth living.
5558640	5564320	And my working hypothesis is these moments are rare, much rarer than we think.
5566640	5572880	We all confabulate, like patients confabulating. No, I'm having a great life.
5572880	5577120	Yes, we've got that positivity bias built in, just remembering all the good times.
5578000	5585840	Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think there is a point to be made that phenomenologically.
5588400	5596400	And I find it so interesting that the free energy principle actually tells the same story
5596400	5605440	that a human life is one big uphill battle. In my view, if we are honest to ourselves,
5606000	5615360	it's a strenuous affair to stay sane in a world like this. I mean, to protect your mental health
5616400	5625360	or your dignity, another topic in a world like this. It's difficult. It costs a lot of energy.
5626640	5633440	And it would probably be much better for all of us if we could at least partly
5635520	5645440	admit this to each other, maybe also doctors to patients that life is very often not easy for us.
5646480	5652160	And that we frequently, all of us have experiences of losing control.
5654560	5658800	The philosophical problem, of course, is, you know, there's all this in the consciousness
5658800	5666000	community, all this talk about color vision and, you know, cell food. But we don't have a good
5666000	5673200	theory of what suffering is. I mean, what is psychological suffering? What is that the nastiness
5673200	5679040	of it? Can there be a common computational principle? I think they came, you know, maybe it's
5681280	5686000	if the rate of prediction error minimization goes down unexpectedly,
5686880	5692240	you know, if you unexpectedly see that you're not doing well,
5694080	5700640	that that gets existential and psychologically unsettling. I think it would be a major
5700640	5708080	achievement to have an abstract theory of suffering. And then ask the question,
5708080	5716160	how can this be alleviated? Because I think if there's any norm, so you asked about negative
5716160	5724960	utilitarianism, I think, because for two reasons, I make it very simple, there's more suffering in
5724960	5732000	the world than joy. And second, there is a shared moral intuition in almost all cultures
5732720	5739440	that we can draw on, not get into deep philosophical debates, that it is more important
5740560	5746880	to help a suffering person suffer less than to make a neutral or happy person more happy.
5747840	5756320	Almost all people can agree on this. And I think a practical ethics can be developed from this,
5756320	5762880	that one say, admit to each other that we're suffering beings and focus on the alleviation
5762880	5770160	of suffering. The important point, of course, is that this also applies to those people who are not
5770160	5778240	yet born to future persons. They are suffering matters too. And, you know, climate catastrophe
5778240	5785200	and everything, they have no party in parliament. They have no lawyers who fight for them.
5785920	5793600	That's why David Benito's work, sorry, sorry. That's where that huge chunk of David Benito's
5793600	5801280	work. I mean, he's probably not too far from here. Because UCT is a UCT professor in Cape Town.
5801280	5806640	Well, I think he was. But yeah, I mean, when I read that work, I find it very intriguing.
5807520	5812640	But in your own work, I mean, how do you deal with it as a medical doctor?
5813600	5817600	Does it not sometimes creep up on you that there's so much suffering?
5817600	5822320	At all the time. I mean, every time you see it. And it does make you question. I mean,
5822320	5826880	I've questioned it many times myself, like, whether do I want to have kids? Is this?
5827840	5828240	Do you?
5829280	5835840	I think I don't know. I don't really, I don't have kids yet, but really not sure. And it's mostly
5835840	5840880	because of what you're talking about. I think factoring all the problems that we've got so far
5840880	5846000	and and what they can expect. I mean, it doesn't look too bright. It doesn't look too great.
5846000	5852480	No, no, of course. In Germany, there's now an increasing number of young people
5853520	5860800	who have themselves sterilized or do not have children, not because of grand philosophical
5860800	5866480	arguments, but because of the climate catastrophe, because they just think it's reckless.
5866960	5875440	I was there 40 years ago. It has always been quite obvious to me. But I also find,
5877440	5886800	I mean, if you start discussing these issues, in a way, it's as if you begin to confront the
5886800	5894640	power of evolution itself, the resistance in people will be so strong. You know, if you say,
5894720	5903120	have you ever thought about the possibility that you may have inbuilt mechanisms of self-deception?
5905760	5913280	For most people, and I also think one shouldn't force discussions or things like that on people who
5914720	5920080	just do not want to hear about this. But of course, there is a classical philosophical
5920080	5927680	issues and I mean, there are classical answers. Christians have said this is a serious place.
5928240	5938800	Buddhists have said all life is suffering. And I have one paper in this edited volume,
5938800	5944880	The Return of Consciousness, which is called Suffering. I think this speaks also a bit to
5944880	5950480	the shallowness of the current debate. Because there are a lot of people who are trying to make
5950480	5958320	a brilliant academic career in neuroscience or philosophy with very smart ideas. But
5959600	5964560	there's this elephant in the room that conscious experience not only involves
5965360	5970560	out of body experiences and color vision and stuff we're all interested in.
5970880	5979600	But that it is maybe a mechanism to drive a gene-copying device forward.
5984240	5993680	I mean, I have no final verdict on this and I'm not sure if I were to read up on the technical
5993680	6000960	literature on negative utilitarianism if it is at all tenable. What the situation on the
6000960	6008320	analytical research frontier here is. But I see when we share an intuition there.
6009600	6015040	I think so. I think we definitely do. Thomas, sorry about that break because South Africa
6015040	6021760	we have load shedding. It's called load shedding. Literally, this is a thing in South Africa where
6022320	6027200	the country is so corrupt and we've got so much going on where they cannot generate enough power.
6027200	6031840	And because of this, they have rolling blackouts in the country and sometimes up to four hours,
6032400	6037040	four times a day. So you get stuck with almost half the day with no electricity. So right now
6037040	6041520	I've got no power. I'm using a generator and inverters to sort of kick everything in.
6042560	6051440	Well, I hope one time in my life I make it. I'm the Asia guy. I've traveled a lot
6051760	6059840	in the South East Asia in my life. I've never made it south of Morocco or Egypt.
6061280	6064320	I think if you do come to South Africa, you come straight to my city Cape Town.
6065680	6070160	Yeah, it's beautiful. You'd love it. And you'd also love a lot of the academic work that's being
6070160	6077520	done on the side is quite amazing as well. So I think we've touched on certain ethics
6078240	6082720	applications of how we can understand consciousness from the mind-body problem
6082720	6088400	to the practical implications of psychiatry. Your forthcoming book, The Elephant and the Blind,
6089840	6093120	can you give us a little synopsis of what we can expect from it?
6094400	6103120	Yes, I can. So there's an open access paper out there which you can look at,
6104080	6112000	which is a psychometric study with meditators. It's in public library of science and it's called
6113280	6125200	the MPE92M study. You'll find it. My co-author's name is Alex Gamma. So over the last three years,
6126160	6130880	I've tried to develop a completely different approach to consciousness. There is a kind of
6131680	6138240	explanation most people don't know about. It's called a minimal model explanation.
6138240	6145760	And it means that you subtract everything from your target phenomenon that is superfluous
6145760	6152720	and not necessary for the causal emergence of the phenomenon. So I've asked myself,
6152720	6158160	so what is the simplest form of conscious experience human beings have? What can you
6158160	6163120	subtract? You can subtract color, vision, and you can subtract conscious thought.
6164400	6172880	And I have a candidate now. The candidate, it's completely hypothetical, is the experience of
6172880	6180320	pure awareness and meditation. For the simplest state of conscious experience, you must know I'm
6180320	6187840	also a long-term practitioner. I've meditated twice a day for more than 46 years and done a lot in my
6187840	6194320	private life about which I've never talked so far. Now, after we've done that first psychometric
6194320	6201760	study, there's a much bigger one coming now. We're also non-meditators. Can describe if... Let me
6201760	6208320	just ask you right now. If you look at all the conscious experience, you have the colors, the
6208320	6219040	sounds, my voice, your interceptive sensations. Can you attend to the quality of consciousness
6219920	6228880	as such? Honestly, I don't think so. Right. Okay. See, that is the question. And the idea is that
6228880	6238080	there's actually a phenomenal character to awareness as such, which is completely transparent to
6238080	6245760	almost every normal human being. You never feel it. But meditators could be a population that
6245760	6256320	cultivates this awareness of awareness, meta attention, attention to attention. Okay. So we
6256320	6267760	did the psychometric studies and we had some results and we had about 3,624 surveys of which
6267760	6275520	we could use 1,403. And then we said, if you don't have to do this, but if you want to describe in
6275520	6282960	words, a paradigmatic experience you've had in which you experienced consciousness as such,
6284320	6292640	please give us a written description. And that led to 841 reports from 57 different countries
6292640	6300160	where people described what they think is that what you think is unknown to you. And of course,
6300160	6306560	there may be confabulating, there may be misinterpreting, they have their own philosophical ideas and so
6306560	6316640	on. But in that book, I've tried to make a step forward before going into any grandiose philosophical
6316640	6323120	theorizing about pure awareness or demanding research programs before one knows what we're
6323120	6328800	talking about. I've just made an attempt to take the phenomenology very seriously.
6329920	6336880	And I've presented excerpts from about 500 reports by meditators how they describe the pure
6336880	6343920	awareness experience. And it's for a wider audience. So every chapter has a first part where you can
6343920	6351040	just read the descriptions. And then there are some ideas from neuroscience or philosophy.
6352160	6360560	And then you find common denominators. Very simple. So I have it here. So the first chapter is just
6360560	6368640	called relaxation. That's trivial. For most people, there is a phenomenology of being deeply relaxed.
6368640	6376560	The second most frequent thing is people describe it as peace. No thoughts absent of mental conflict.
6376560	6386160	Then you have silence. Mental silence. Then you have wakefulness. There's some people describe a
6386160	6394480	distinct phenomenology of being awake. And now let me ask you a question. Has it ever happened to you?
6394720	6401760	Sometimes one wakes up maybe two or three times in a year, a little too early even,
6401760	6406880	and one has had a particularly good night's sleep, a particularly good rest.
6406880	6414800	Yeah, that actually happened last night. Yeah, you had? Yeah. Now, if you don't make the mistake,
6414800	6422960	imagine you haven't made the mistake to look into your phone or connect to the internet.
6423920	6431600	And you haven't made a mistake to talk to anybody. You just got up a little early,
6431600	6438000	super fresh, and maybe with your first cup of tea or coffee, you just sat out on the terrace,
6438000	6444480	on the balcony, and just sat there. And you were just wide awake and super nervous,
6444640	6453120	nothing dramatic. You listen to the birds, you sip your tea. There was maybe a time where there was
6453120	6464640	a gap between two thoughts, maybe a two second gap. That is it. It's so simple. Every human
6464640	6470400	being knows it that you overlook it. Yes, I can say fancy things about it. For instance, I can also
6470400	6480960	say the phenomenal character of tonic alertness. And if one describe it, it has interesting other
6481680	6488720	phenomenological characteristics, for instance, density or soundness. And then you get
6489600	6495040	into deeper aspects of it, like non-vulow awareness, absence of itself, it can take different forms.
6495040	6502640	But I think one possibility is, and by the way, I'm not going to go into this book, so you have
6502640	6510240	500 reports, and I'm trying to offer the community a careful phenomenological description of pure
6510240	6518000	awareness. I'm creating appetizers, and people shall cook their own main courses. That's the idea,
6518000	6524000	right? I'm just preparing for a minimal model explanation of consciousness.
6525360	6534000	But there are interesting things in there. For instance, I would say, in Carl Friston's term,
6534560	6541920	what everybody has overlooked is that the strongest source of perturbation, that's my theory, the
6541920	6548720	strongest external stimulus that has to be explained away is not something that comes in
6548720	6554560	through sensory modules or through interception in the thalamus, but is the activity of the
6554560	6561600	Formatio Reticularis, the ascending activation system in the brainstem. That is actually
6561600	6568560	biophysically the most massive, completely unexplained signal source within the body.
6569360	6578480	And this happens when you wake up in the morning, and what we need to control our own level of
6578480	6586400	tonic alertness, so my highly speculative theory goes, is a predictive model of the level of
6586400	6592720	cortical arousal, the level of tonic alertness, different aspects to that, that allows the organism
6593280	6601840	to control its own long-term wakefulness. And I think that might be the simplest form of
6601840	6610400	conscious experience shared by all human beings. And if you listen to that, I found that in Mark
6610400	6615920	Song's latest book. Yes, The Hidden Spring. It's exactly what I was thinking about. Yeah.
6616800	6623840	There's this tradition, there's this tradition, the Amazio, Pankse, Mark Song's, where they have
6624480	6629040	more of the idea that this is actually a homostatic auto-regulation, or it's that
6630160	6636560	I've said that, I've said that in being no one, that it is elementary bioregulation,
6636560	6643840	that you, so to speak, you feel the sheer fact of aliveness itself, the organism
6644800	6649920	trying to stabilize itself homostatically. I think there's one step below this.
6652240	6659120	My thinking is very parallel in that respect to Mark Song's. There is this very low,
6659920	6665600	this very fundamental subcortical signal source, which I think has to be predictively
6665600	6671440	modeled by the brain. And that creates the experience of wakefulness. But I think
6671680	6680720	in my terminology, it's not aliveness, but sheer epistemic openness, as I call it. It is,
6682400	6689520	as neuroscientists would say, stimulus readiness, the experience of stimulus readiness,
6691040	6700960	the availability of executive control without having to exert it. And I think there's an
6701040	6711600	overlooked, very subtle, very simple phenomenology of just being awake and aware. And
6714000	6719360	I think that could lead to a minimal model explanation of consciousness, because
6720480	6728240	that is what I'm very much interested in research right now. There are rare advanced
6728240	6733680	practitioners of meditation who report about something that is sometimes called clear light
6733680	6741760	sleep or witnessing sleep, an experience of being awake during non REM sleep. No dreams,
6741760	6747920	no content, don't feel the body don't hear the environment in the bedroom. If that could be
6747920	6755600	proven, it's not proven. But if that could be empirically shown that this phenomenon exists,
6756560	6764720	pure wakefulness in a completely paralyzed body in the non REM state. I think that would be
6764720	6771200	a major pro progress in the consciousness community, because then we have subtracted all
6771200	6778720	perceptual content, we have subtracted the self, we have subtracted the first person perspective.
6779440	6786080	But we have some phenomenal experience, this embodied even, although it is of course neurologically
6786080	6792880	speaking, you experience a part of your brain, which is of course then politically incorrect
6792880	6799600	and all the meditators don't like it, because it interferes with their mortality denial.
6799600	6807040	So this gives you an idea where I go, I think we should try to aim at a minimal model explanation
6807120	6814640	and actually say, what is that which cannot be subtracted from conscious experience?
6816080	6824480	And I think it is the silent clarity involved in wakefulness somehow. And that's the elephant,
6824480	6831920	and there are many blind who touch it from very, very many different directions over the centuries.
6831920	6836080	So that's a bit where I'm going, of course, I have more to say.
6837680	6845920	You can't spell all the beans yet. We'll have to wait to read it. No, Thomas, I'm super eager to
6845920	6851680	read this book. I've got two of your books on my bookshelf, Being No One, Ego, Tunnel Life,
6851680	6856000	Sitting Up There. I've actually got them very close to Dennett's books.
6856960	6862400	It's like I've seen my books in a certain way. And I sort of put certain things because we've
6862400	6866880	had similar views, maybe not the same, but I tend to put them in similar places.
6866880	6872240	No, I think I've learned a lot of things. It's very fashionable to criticize Dennett. I still
6872240	6878000	know when I was a PhD student, I was allowed to peep in at the big guys at the Center for
6878480	6885600	Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld, Germany. And there were all these heroes, you know,
6885600	6893920	Jake Won Kim, and Robert Fangulik. And I met Dennett in a swimming pool, I still remember.
6895440	6901120	You know, many people have this and that criticism, one never knows what he really says,
6901120	6905440	and what is actually is the thesis, and what is the argument. But I think
6905440	6911840	what we all underestimate is how much we have learned from him, from his books.
6912880	6919360	You know, how important consciousness explained was in 1991 for many people, people forget that.
6920240	6925600	But he has been a real trailblazer, and I think a lot of people have learned a lot from him.
6926320	6932160	Yeah, I think that's a perfect note, because something I often ask my guests as we conclude is
6932880	6940320	if you had to think of around your perfect, what's it called, your perfect dinner,
6940320	6945360	good guests, or your Mount Rushmore, a favorite scientist slash philosophers,
6946480	6950480	who would those people be? You're like a top four. If you had to really think
6952800	6956800	best philosophers in history, or greatest or most influential to you at least.
6956800	6965680	Well, of course, in the modern debate of the mind-body problem,
6967280	6975440	since, say, all in tea place, after Gilbert Ryle, the concept of mind, people who stand out
6976640	6981920	to me are Hilary Putnam and Jaguar Kim. I've greatly profited from them.
6982880	6988960	But actually much more interesting is the completely unknown young people.
6990160	6996400	There are brilliant young people who are not going to name, because they will be embarrassed,
6997120	7003520	and probably would find a dinner with me boring, and had to be polite. But there are, you know,
7003520	7010800	there are what fascinates me. On a planet with eight billion people, there are some people
7010880	7017680	where everything went right. They have been smart. They had a normal, you know,
7019360	7026240	childhood experience with parents. They were in a rich country. They could go to a good university.
7026240	7033920	For some people, it works out. They found mentors. And there's a breathtaking new generation in the
7033920	7041440	consciousness community. You will only know their names in 15 to 20 years, but the standard
7041440	7053760	has really risen since my time. And if I look at this, they know math. English is like a second
7053760	7061360	language for them. They swim in the internet like fish, you know, and they will take this thing further.
7061920	7071440	And I'm not criticizing you, but I always find it stupid how journalists or television people
7071440	7078480	only want their prominent old people, you know, while there are so many good people in their
7078480	7088000	end 20s around, which breathtaking ideas, but it will take 15 years until anybody takes notice.
7090400	7097600	So I would probably prefer if I could just quietly sit with these
7098000	7110160	young people who impress me by having a meditation practice, smoking five methoxy DMT,
7110800	7118240	and being good academically at the same time. There are some. And
7119760	7121440	sounds like my friends that I had made school.
7122400	7125840	Oh, yeah, right. How did that turn out?
7127040	7132000	Very so. Some people did a lot of crazy stuff. Some people quit smoking completely. Some people
7132000	7136720	stopped drinking completely. Life changing things. Some people stopped drinking, some failed.
7139440	7145600	So what I really appreciate is people who do their homework academically.
7146480	7154960	But for whom this is also something existential, not just careerism and who in their own life do
7154960	7161760	something, you know, to explore this. I've been this guy for all my life to explore this from
7161760	7170800	different angles and not just by reading books. And, you know, consciousness is not like any other
7170800	7177760	theoretical problem. In the end, it has something to do with your own life. And you can't just
7179040	7181520	be a nerd. It doesn't work.
7181520	7186080	Yeah, exactly. Now, I think I completely agree with you. I think it takes,
7187040	7191120	that exploration has to be part of it. You can't just sit idly and read books the whole time. You
7191120	7196880	have to actually engage with this. And it's the mind body problem is often say it's something
7196960	7202880	that's difficult both intellectually and practically. You have to sort of engage with this
7202880	7205760	within both spheres. And I think you do that wonderfully.
7206720	7210720	I think that is also what this idea of a bewilderment school tour
7210720	7215440	alludes to there's a risk. I've seen this in training young people. You can be
7216960	7221200	in the top two percent and be a little bit on the autistic spectrum
7222160	7232160	and study perfectly well, write a PhD thesis, be superb, and then have no good ideas at 32.
7233200	7239440	Just have no good ideas. Because you were only always good at passing all tests and knowing
7239440	7248880	everything. And this also has to do something with the, you know, the educational idea or idea
7248880	7256880	what academia is in an ideal world. It should be possible to also live an examined life and
7256880	7264160	experiment with your own mind and your own consciousness. But I see the chances I don't
7264160	7269840	know about South Africa, but they're becoming slimmer and slimmer, because everything is so
7269840	7278480	competitive. And there's this fierce competition and scarce resources. And it breeds a certain
7278480	7285920	kind of researcher personality. And that may be very effective in some fields.
7287440	7294880	But somehow, I think in consciousness research, we need people with a wider perspective somehow.
7294880	7300480	Yes, you can't have that one, you can't have those students who are purely committed to
7300480	7305600	trying to grow their career. Whereas they're not really trying to actively engage with the topic
7306560	7313360	in that it incorporates meditation, for example, I mean, not many of them are going to actively do
7313360	7317680	the day to day meditation, if they know that they could just read one more book and pass the exam.
7318880	7326720	Yeah, it's in the time I have, you know, I've taught in eight German universities until I retired.
7327280	7334960	They are under stress. When I studied philosophy, it was a much more interesting time. I mean,
7334960	7341840	I also had time to go to demonstrations and have myself beaten up by cops and go to India.
7342720	7348960	They don't have this time anymore. They are nervous about their CV. And they have these
7348960	7355200	modular, I don't know if you have this in South Africa, this fully modularized BAMA system.
7355760	7362320	Where they really have to plan how they study and what examinations are coming up.
7363680	7369120	They can't waste a year on get falling in love with nature or some strange
7369120	7373920	philosopher and nothing comes of it, you know. Yeah, especially with an overpopulation crisis,
7373920	7379840	I mean, it's pretty much do or die at this point. It's either you get up and do it or you're just
7379840	7387600	going to fall behind. So it gets quite competitive. Yes. And somehow, we need protected spaces,
7388480	7396480	which are not an excuse for just hanging around and doing nothing. There's something really
7397840	7404480	a problem to be resolved there. Of course, because we know the other extreme, of course, exists too.
7404480	7407760	Yeah, exactly. It's always about finding that perfect balance. I mean, you're looking for that
7407760	7411440	perfect amount of book smart and street smart at the same time, just bringing them together.
7412880	7419920	Isn't it true, I mean, to study leave alone psychiatry, but to study psychiatry,
7419920	7427600	to study medicine is a very demanding path. It is, right? But he doesn't leave much space.
7427600	7432480	How did you do that? That you could still read philosophy books? How could you do that?
7432480	7436240	I mean, it was very difficult. But I think it was, I think when you question things
7436240	7440720	philosophically, there was a period in med school where I went through its deeply, deeply
7440720	7446000	depressed mood for a long while. But it was during that time where, I mean, as you brought up earlier,
7446640	7451280	I read a lot more philosophy journals. I mean, I read so many more philosophical books.
7452720	7458320	And I mean, it was tough. You often feel guilty because you have to read the textbooks. You have
7458320	7464240	to constantly study all the time. I just made a plan because I felt like this is just too intriguing
7464240	7468320	to not do. You reach that one point where you just got to sacrifice something else,
7468320	7472960	perhaps maybe not go out with your friends once in a while and read a philosophy book every now
7472960	7478720	and then or go out with your friends as well and get some sort of a philosophical view out of that
7478720	7484560	experience as well. So you're a bad doctor now, a bad but philosophically informed doctor.
7485600	7492000	Oh, hopefully not. I'll let my patience decide that. Now, I think it's, it's all about finding
7492000	7497520	that balance. And I think I did that. Well, I often used music as that, as that guide to
7497520	7502480	sort of that meditative practice for me, I think is music and like playing an instrument. I think,
7502480	7507360	yeah, so I think that's, and yeah, meditating as well. It's something that deeply enjoy.
7507360	7514960	I mean, another area that is very relevant. We haven't talked about is in philosophy is applied
7515040	7522880	ethics. I once founded a research unit for ethics of neuro technology, like new interventions in
7522880	7529600	the brain becoming better. And of course, in medical practice, you are really confronted
7530160	7538080	with ethical issues. I mean, I once had to go, I had a very sad time in my life, and I had to go
7538080	7545680	to a bone marrow transplant ward and see 40 people die and not a single person survive there of
7547040	7555360	leukemia. And afterwards, I always said as a philosopher, the patients have me to be protected
7555360	7564400	from the interests of the medical industry. And after I had seen the fantastic job, these gay,
7564400	7571360	intensive care nurses do at quarter to three at night, get paid a really bad salary for it.
7572320	7578800	I thought two things. I thought, no, it's all wrong from what I really saw at bedside,
7578800	7584640	the patient has to be protected from their relatives and the emotional needs of their
7584640	7592000	relatives in that dying process. And second, all the lazy people in my philosophy department
7592000	7598160	should be fired. And these people should be paid a better salary, you know, these intensive care
7598160	7606880	nurses. I drastically changed my views from seeing what is really happening on on such a ward. And
7606880	7616240	of course, they confront these issues. Never. I mean, about say, how do you call this assisted
7616240	7625760	suicide, I think is that I mean, they have to make these decisions. And nobody ever technically
7625760	7633200	discusses the they would use little philosophy seminars. And of course, many of the solutions
7633200	7639920	they find are even illegal, they have to do them undercover at their own risk. They have to deal
7639920	7648160	with angry relatives. I've seen the situations where the patient is ready to die. And the doctor
7648160	7656400	is ready. Everything's clear. But the relatives aren't. You know, and speaking of alleviation of
7656400	7664240	suffering, it would be good, I think, if there were specialized applied ethic courses for intensive
7664240	7671920	care nurses and doctors, so that they can think about these things in a more structured way.
7673840	7680560	When people ask them for help, and people ask for help, and then they basically try to do the
7680560	7688240	right thing. I don't know if that appears in your practice. And in South Africa, it's very much the
7688240	7693440	same. I think the amount of philosophy that doctors are told, or even I mean, I think patients in
7693520	7697360	general, that's why I think once I've heard you say that you think it should be important that
7698560	7704800	in schools, they have certain practices that are fundamental to us growing into sort of,
7704800	7709280	I wouldn't say better adults, but I mean, certain things like being taught about meditative
7709280	7716240	practices, being taught more philosophical ideas at a young age. I mean, this sort of grooms this
7716240	7721520	would this would in practice groom a relative from a young age to actually be supportive for
7721520	7726720	that person, the sort of human skills that we tend to lack or tend to focus on ourselves.
7727360	7730800	So I completely agree with you. I think that's a field that needs so much work.
7734000	7740960	Have you ever been exposed to medical ethics or applied ethics? Is this part of your study?
7740960	7747440	Yeah, we do. We don't do enough, I can tell you that. So they generally fall into very,
7747440	7755200	very superficial topics. They focus very much on principalism and certain ethical.
7756720	7761840	Yeah. So you get into those just beneficence, non-maleficent. And then you just get stuck into
7761840	7766720	that. And then you go into casuistry where you focus on just case-based ethics. Then we go into
7766720	7772160	everything else, utilitarianism and every other form of it. But it tends to majority of the focus
7772160	7776960	is on that principalism. And then as long as you're not doing harm, you're doing good,
7776960	7782560	it's kind of like you don't. And this is actually a way of defending yourself from
7782560	7789440	the messiness of real life situations, isn't it? In your practice, do you ever encounter
7790240	7797760	a situation where you think, oh, God, I would really like to be able to call somebody now,
7797760	7802960	a professional ethicist and ask for advice? Oh, yeah, a lot. Should it be something like
7803040	7807600	an information clearance house or something like that? No, definitely. So if you work in a hospital
7807600	7812480	in South Africa and if you have these ethical dilemmas yourself, you actually do, you call an
7812480	7818080	ethics board. There is one. Yeah, you get the team together and you actually have ethical
7818080	7823280	discussions regarding what is the best plan for the patient. So it is a fundamental feature of the
7823280	7827840	healthcare system in South Africa. The unfortunate reality of our South African healthcare system
7827840	7834320	is that it's overburdened, under-resourced, corrupt, and so there's just so many other factors.
7834320	7839040	So we never really get the chance to actively implement these in the best way they possibly
7839040	7848560	could. But for the most part, we do. Yeah. But yeah, Thomas, this has been a great conversation.
7848560	7855920	We've gone through so many different topics. Sorry about this. I think it's partly my fault.
7855920	7861040	I mean, I had a structure planned and then I just let it go. But it's been great. I mean,
7861040	7864640	I've enjoyed it so much. Anything from you, any final words, anything you want to say?
7865760	7870240	No, no. I thought this was a great experience. We've lost the red thread completely.
7871600	7877200	I hope it is good for some of you readers, some of you, some of your audience.
7877760	7882160	Definitely. I can tell you one thing. They will love the episode. If there's one thing I've
7882160	7887040	realized, the mind-body solution listeners, they come for the philosophy, for the applied ethics,
7887040	7891440	for everything we spoke about pretty much within the niche of this podcast. So
7892240	7898160	nothing swayed out of the podcast niche. So I'm happy with this conversation. Even though
7898160	7901920	it's called mind-body solution, it doesn't mean we focus solely on the mind-body problem.
7901920	7908080	It's an exploration of morality, ethics, mental health, all of it. So it fits perfectly.
7908720	7916640	Maybe just point to one general problem I see that will also occur, for instance,
7916640	7922400	in medical practice. I think in the consciousness community, of course, there is
7923120	7928320	a lot of discussion and they're competing in models, but we are getting somewhere.
7928320	7935280	A lot has happened since 1994 and there is progress. And of course, many people would
7935280	7942400	disagree, but there is a general picture appearing on the horizon. And one thing I'm
7942400	7952480	quite concerned about is that 80% of humankind on this planet still live firmly in religious
7953200	7960320	images of what a human being is in a religious worldview and are also quite immune to rational
7960320	7969760	criticism. And they will not like what science and philosophy eventually tell them about
7971040	7976560	computational structures, consciousness, evolution, the nature of the self. They will
7976560	7986080	not like it. I think the general world public is not ready. And there are other things coming
7986080	7994400	to them, the climate catastrophe, AI, and so forth. And what I have called the naturalist turn
7995840	8004480	in the image of humankind, in the image of man, large parts of the population are not ready for
8004480	8014560	this. And this also includes you as a philosophically informed doctor may work under an image of man
8015200	8024640	that many of your patients do not share. And a big problem is how one can still firmly defend
8025440	8033920	science, a rational evidence-based approach, but keep respecting each other, respecting
8033920	8040240	each other's vulnerabilities, belief systems, solutions people have found for themselves in
8040240	8047760	their own life. That's a major task, you know, to stand the ground of science and rational philosophy.
8050560	8057920	But still respecting all those others on the planet who are completely somewhere else
8057920	8064080	with their belief systems. And maybe we should also give some thoughts to that.
8064800	8069920	I think that's a beautiful thought to leave the listeners with. I think that's something that
8070000	8073680	we're all thinking, everybody's trying to figure out how to balance that fine line.
8073680	8076960	And I think you said it perfectly. Thank you, Thomas. Thank you so much.
8076960	8078560	Thank you for the invitation.
8078560	8081920	It's been an absolute pleasure. I hope one day we can have a round two.
8081920	8084880	Perhaps in our round two, I will set a nice structure plan.
8085760	8087040	Okay, okay, okay.
8087040	8092080	But I enjoy this immensely. This was wonderful. Thank you so much. And I've been looking forward
8092080	8096480	to chatting to you for such a long time. Your work has deeply impacted my own work.
8097280	8099680	And I thank you for all your contributions to the field.
8100400	8104480	Yeah, and for being such a fill, thank you for being such a philosophically informed,
8105680	8112080	you know, as medical doctors, we need, we can't have more enough of people like you.
8112640	8120960	One detail you might want to mention, I don't know it, but that book we have been talking about,
8121040	8127280	talking about will go in the brand new direct to open program of the MIT press.
8127920	8132160	That means it is freely available to every of your listen, everyone.
8132960	8137440	It could be end of October. I don't know when they get the act together,
8137440	8140080	but you don't have to pay for it. You can just download it.
8140080	8143440	Oh, fantastic. Once the book's out, I'll definitely be putting a link to it
8143440	8146480	in the description. So as soon as the book's out, I'll have a link ready for you.
8146480	8146960	Okay, good.
8147440	8152880	Thank you so much, Manu. I really appreciate it, Thomas.
8152880	8154480	Thank you and have a great evening.
8154480	8156480	Yeah, have a great weekend. Bye-bye.
