00:00.000 --> 00:16.800
Chris, talk to me about how you define consciousness. I think I'm going to use your paper, The

00:16.800 --> 00:22.000
Neutral Basis of Consciousness, as the foundation for how I'm going to approach the questions

00:22.000 --> 00:27.280
for this interview. How would you define consciousness and why is it important to make

00:27.280 --> 00:33.840
certain differentiations, for example, contents of consciousness versus level of consciousness?

00:35.040 --> 00:42.080
Yeah, let's run through that. Well, I follow most people in defining consciousness as

00:42.800 --> 00:50.400
having subjective experiences. And I think that the distinction between level and content is

00:50.400 --> 00:56.800
important because it probably involves different ways of doing the experiments and thinking about

00:56.800 --> 01:03.840
the brain systems involved. So level of consciousness at one extreme, a high level of

01:03.840 --> 01:11.440
consciousness, you are having subjective experiences. And then of course, you can go into a low level,

01:11.440 --> 01:17.680
sometimes, for example, people who are in this minimally conscious state after brain injury,

01:17.680 --> 01:23.440
they will sometimes have contents of consciousness, but maybe not. And then when you're unconscious

01:23.520 --> 01:30.720
or in coma, you're not having any subjective experiences. Now, the contents of consciousness

01:30.720 --> 01:37.680
is, of course, is talking about what are the subjective experiences. And in particular,

01:38.640 --> 01:47.200
I and many others in the brain imaging world have been fascinated by the observation that when we

01:47.200 --> 01:54.400
are conscious, we are aware or conscious of some things that are impinging on us and not aware

01:55.360 --> 02:02.400
and other things that are impinging on us. And perhaps the most famous example of that is the,

02:03.840 --> 02:11.360
which I'm sure you have seen the video of the gorilla. So this is where you're instructed to

02:11.360 --> 02:15.760
watch this video. And there are people playing basketball or something, and they're in red shirts

02:15.840 --> 02:19.920
and white shirts, and you have to count how many times the people in the white shirts pass the

02:19.920 --> 02:26.480
ball to each other. And at the end, you ask them, did you see the gorilla? And they say no.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.160
Even though if you hadn't been given that instruction, I'd been looking for other things,

02:32.160 --> 02:36.080
you would have obviously noticed the gorilla. So there are many situations where you can show that

02:37.120 --> 02:44.400
even though your senses are being stimulated, this doesn't actually reach awareness. It goes into

02:44.400 --> 02:49.200
the brain, but it doesn't become conscious. And that's exciting, because you can then ask the

02:49.200 --> 02:53.280
question, what's the difference between the brain activity associated with things that you're aware

02:53.280 --> 02:59.600
of, and the brain activity associated with things that you respond to, but are not aware of. Now,

02:59.600 --> 03:04.960
in that case, that's not about the level of consciousness, because in both, this is the

03:04.960 --> 03:11.360
level is the same. But then you're aware of some things and not of others. And that's why I think

03:11.360 --> 03:16.000
that's important. I mean, it's also important for us clinically, because you're working,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.400
obviously, from a clinical perspective, I mean, even myself as a doctor, we have to know,

03:20.400 --> 03:25.520
we use the Glasgow Coma Scale or whatever sort of steps you try and differentiate between how

03:25.520 --> 03:31.200
conscious someone is versus how conscious they're not. But it's very different from subjectivity.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.280
When it comes to the neural basis of consciousness, Chris, how often do you get,

03:37.360 --> 03:43.840
let's say, feedback from people in a negative manner, trying to tell you that there's no way to

03:43.840 --> 03:50.800
find a neural basis of something that is subject. The neural correlates of consciousness do not exist,

03:50.800 --> 03:56.320
and nearly correlations. How often do you get this? And what are your responses to that?

03:58.480 --> 04:04.480
Well, I mean, since they are correlations, that's why we call them the neural correlates of

04:04.480 --> 04:11.280
consciousness. So they don't, as on their own, explain how consciousness emerges, or why

04:11.280 --> 04:18.720
consciousness emerges. So one often gets this question. And I guess I would want to say the

04:18.720 --> 04:25.840
way I would try to get around this problem is to start asking questions about what is the function

04:25.840 --> 04:36.240
of consciousness? What is it for? And as I say in the paper, I think that consciousness is a sort

04:36.240 --> 04:42.720
of biological phenomenon. It's rather than something that physicists can tell us about.

04:43.840 --> 04:51.920
And that means that I think it evolved so that in early organisms, we're not conscious.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.880
And it's only more recently, in evolutionary time, that consciousness has emerged. And then

04:58.880 --> 05:02.800
from that point of view, you have to say, it must have had some advantage. It must have given some

05:02.800 --> 05:10.000
advantage in order for it to emerge. And then you can, you can then ask very difficult questions,

05:10.000 --> 05:15.200
like at what point in evolution did it emerge? What sort of creatures of consciousness are

05:15.520 --> 05:21.200
conscious? And what sort of creatures are not conscious? And that's beginning to approach a

05:21.200 --> 05:27.600
sort of mechanistic idea, because if you, if you can work out what consciousness is for,

05:27.600 --> 05:33.040
what advantages it gives you, and then you can look at the neural correlates of that,

05:33.760 --> 05:39.200
you might start to think about how you could actually make something conscious,

05:40.160 --> 05:43.520
which I'm talking about AI now. I mean, what would you have to,

05:44.240 --> 05:48.720
how would you program a computer or a robot so that it actually was conscious?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.400
I say I have no idea, but

05:53.120 --> 05:57.920
I was going to ask you, like, what do you think? Let's, there was something I was going to ask

05:57.920 --> 06:03.520
you about later on. I mean, if this is something that has evolved, it must have other ways of

06:03.520 --> 06:09.280
evolving. I mean, if the virtual selection has done this, possibly artificial selection is going

06:09.280 --> 06:14.480
to do the same with us. Do you think it's possible for us to do this? Considering that the framework

06:14.480 --> 06:19.360
we use today, I mean, you using the Bayesian brain framework, I mean, for the listeners,

06:19.360 --> 06:23.920
just so that I can give them some context, I've quoted you in my dissertation a couple of times,

06:23.920 --> 06:29.440
and I mean, I used your work to help, help my work. And so thank you for that. First of all,

06:29.440 --> 06:34.640
your contributions to the field. But the way you guys approach it, I mean, Friston,

06:34.640 --> 06:41.280
yourself, I've read so many of you guys' papers. It's very much part of this Bayesian framework.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.320
And we'll talk about its implications with schizophrenia, etc. later on. But do you think

06:48.320 --> 06:59.120
we're going to do this with AI? Yes, I think so. I mean, I remember, I mean, this has been

06:59.120 --> 07:03.200
sort of floating around for a long time, even before we got DeepMind and all these people. I

07:03.200 --> 07:09.840
remember about 30 years ago, down to a meeting where an engineer was presenting this computer,

07:09.840 --> 07:18.720
which he had programmed to show attention, it could attend to some things and not to other

07:18.720 --> 07:22.400
things. And then he was saying, isn't this amazing? And this is probably the basis of

07:22.400 --> 07:28.480
consciousness. And then some elderly philosopher in the back of the lecture theater got up and said,

07:28.480 --> 07:30.640
have you got ethical permission to turn it off?

07:34.800 --> 07:35.840
That's a very good question.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.360
So that's sort of been hanging around. But there are all sorts of ethical implications

07:43.360 --> 07:51.520
of this. I think, I mean, I don't know what the timeline is. I suspect not in my lifetime will

07:51.520 --> 07:59.120
we have a conscious robotic type device. But one of the questions that I have asked the

07:59.120 --> 08:04.480
roboticists who are trying to do these sort of things is it's all very well developing this

08:04.480 --> 08:10.000
in this way. But I would the question I would ask, how would you know when you had achieved

08:12.000 --> 08:17.200
your conscious machine? And I think that's one of the most difficult questions to answer.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.000
Because it's so blurry, the lines. I mean, where do we draw these lines? It was the same

08:22.000 --> 08:28.800
with humans. We made the Ian Vitale. What is life? What is not life? I mean, blurry questions.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.160
That's very good. I mean, I'm very interested in that because I think in the olden days,

08:35.840 --> 08:40.800
like in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for example, there was no distinction between life and

08:40.800 --> 08:45.920
consciousness. If you gave it life, you also gave it consciousness. And of course,

08:45.920 --> 08:51.360
the monster in the original is hyper conscious. It doesn't bear any relation to the thing in the

08:51.360 --> 08:58.080
film version. And what's changed as we were indicating is we now have a very good idea of

08:58.640 --> 09:04.800
what life is. And in some sense, can make it without genetic manipulation and so on.

09:05.360 --> 09:11.360
And it's very much become divorced now from consciousness. So we would probably be happy

09:11.360 --> 09:17.520
to say that viruses are not conscious and amoeba are probably not conscious.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.400
So this distinction has now been made. But the big problem now is, as you say, is where does,

09:25.200 --> 09:27.840
at what point does consciousness emerge? And how do we know that?

09:28.480 --> 09:34.480
Exactly. Do you think that every time science makes progress in a certain field,

09:35.200 --> 09:40.240
doubters and skeptics will find another way of adding a layer of importance to us?

09:41.680 --> 09:48.720
Yes, well, I may be responsible for doing that myself, as we will see later on, probably.

09:48.720 --> 09:56.640
I mean, I tend to show thought disorder you'll discover. So there's an example of this, I think,

09:56.640 --> 10:02.880
in psychiatry. There's a very nice book that I had to review for Brain, which is about the

10:02.880 --> 10:08.720
sort of history of psychiatry. And what was fascinating is that as soon as some psychiatric

10:08.720 --> 10:16.880
disorder is resolved, it ceases to be part of psychiatry. So you had what was it tertiary

10:16.880 --> 10:23.200
syphilis, which at one point, most of the mental hospitals had patients with this.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.680
And then it was resolved and it was discovered precisely what it was. And then it ceased to

10:27.680 --> 10:32.400
be psychiatry and also was more or less cured. And the same with epilepsy, that used to be part

10:32.400 --> 10:36.960
of psychiatry, but it's now part of neurology, hunting is career now part of neurology and so on.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.680
So psychiatry is always left with the things that no one can explain.

10:44.240 --> 10:49.040
And I think that's the same phrase as you're suggesting, even if we explain consciousness,

10:49.040 --> 10:53.280
there'll be something else. Or I think what will happen is there are all sorts of different

10:53.280 --> 10:56.960
aspects of consciousness, and it will probably divide up into different things and people who

10:56.960 --> 11:02.240
have already had different definitions of it. And there'll always be parts of it that we

11:02.240 --> 11:06.720
haven't resolved yet. And the ones that we have resolved will say, well, that wasn't really a

11:06.720 --> 11:11.760
part of, that's not what I meant by consciousness. So Chris, what do you think then about those

11:11.760 --> 11:17.760
people who say that, I mean, subjective experience is merely just a form of introspection. I mean,

11:17.760 --> 11:22.800
Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, I mean, this is just something we think we have. And it's just

11:22.800 --> 11:28.560
because we're articulating it to ourselves and self-sufficiency, but what are your thoughts on

11:28.640 --> 11:30.720
illusionism then as a theory of consciousness?

11:32.320 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, I think there are two aspects that I don't really understand the idea that

11:36.000 --> 11:43.280
consciousness is an illusion, because we all experience it. I'm more sympathetic, although

11:43.280 --> 11:50.800
the idea is wrong, the idea is it has no function. And this goes back actually, at least as far as

11:51.520 --> 11:59.280
Thomas Huxley, who had this nice metaphor, he says consciousness is like the whistle of a steam

11:59.280 --> 12:05.680
engine, has absolutely no effect on the functioning of the steam engine. And my response to that is

12:05.680 --> 12:15.600
it has a big effect on the functioning of other steam engines. And that's exactly why at some

12:15.600 --> 12:21.680
point, I mean, when you're talking about other species interacting and humans, how important

12:21.680 --> 12:25.920
it is for social interaction, social interaction, that's where you go about with this.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.520
Yeah, that's right.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.720
You want to touch on that? Let's talk about that. Let's get to that topic for a while.

12:32.080 --> 12:40.640
Well, I'm trying to remember. One of the problems in this neuro-based studying neuro-based

12:40.640 --> 12:45.680
of consciousness, and indeed studying subjective experience in general, is that we know about

12:45.680 --> 12:51.440
our own subjective experience, but we don't know about anybody else's. And we rely on them telling

12:51.440 --> 12:57.600
us about it, which is, as you say, is to do with introspection. And this, in fact, has a long

12:57.600 --> 13:03.440
will, and for psychological terms, has a long history, because this is what Fechner was doing

13:03.440 --> 13:09.360
in 1860, which is called psychophysics, which you basically make a noise and you say how loud

13:09.360 --> 13:18.240
was that, which is a subjective report. And you get very, very robust, reliable results using

13:18.240 --> 13:24.320
this. You can show that loudness, you know, follows an exponential scale in relation to the

13:24.320 --> 13:31.520
actual physical intensity of the stimulus. It's very robust. So it really works. And then it

13:31.520 --> 13:36.560
went into dispute because of behaviorism coming in and saying, you can't trust these reports.

13:36.560 --> 13:41.760
And I think that's because people just didn't do the reporting properly. But certainly in the

13:41.760 --> 13:46.080
studies of the neuro-based of consciousness, you have to say, for example, were you aware of the

13:46.080 --> 13:54.000
gorilla or not, for example. And you rely on, or you can sometimes slightly more sophisticated ones,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.040
where you say how aware of the gorilla, were you on a four point scale or something. And then some

13:59.040 --> 14:04.000
people say, well, this is all very well. But when you see these neural activity, is it because of

14:04.000 --> 14:11.360
making the report rather than just the experience? And my answer to that is that the ability to

14:11.360 --> 14:16.960
make the report is actually a very important part of the experience, because this is this rather

14:16.960 --> 14:23.920
wonderful thing that humans especially can do is we can tell each other about our subjective

14:23.920 --> 14:32.640
experiences. And I think, and we can get onto that, but I think this actually creates all sorts of

14:32.720 --> 14:42.000
advantages, which we can measure. And that gives you one reason why this ability might have evolved.

14:42.800 --> 14:48.480
But I'm, I used to believe, I couldn't really quite understand how you could have conscious

14:48.480 --> 14:54.480
experience without being able to, without knowing about it or being able to report it. But I'm now

14:54.480 --> 15:01.040
persuaded that there is an earlier stage where you have the experience, but in a sense, you're not

15:01.040 --> 15:06.240
aware of it. You're aware of the stimulus, but you're not aware of being aware of the stimulus.

15:06.240 --> 15:11.440
This is this higher level, sometimes called meta consciousness. But I think for the one we're

15:11.440 --> 15:17.520
studying human consciousness, the fact that we can report it is actually a very important aspect

15:17.520 --> 15:22.640
of the experience. But then how important do you think linguistics plays a role here? Because we

15:22.640 --> 15:29.520
obviously can't express ourselves as as great as we think we do. I mean, there's so much more

15:29.520 --> 15:34.400
going on inside here, compared to what I can articulate to you. So do you think that's actually

15:34.400 --> 15:38.160
could be a hindrance to the way we try and express ourselves to each other?

15:41.600 --> 15:49.520
Well, I know, I think, in a sense, there's too much. If we try to express everything, we collapse.

15:49.600 --> 15:58.960
And there's some work called coarse grainy or something you can actually, by reducing,

15:59.840 --> 16:05.280
by using these clever ways of reducing what we're talking about to some simplified system,

16:05.280 --> 16:10.400
we can actually get a better account of it than if we tried to put the whole thing across. So

16:10.400 --> 16:15.440
there is that aspect of it. But I think also by talking to each other, we can discover first

16:15.520 --> 16:20.960
what are the important things to tell each other about. And secondly, we can discover ways of

16:21.520 --> 16:27.760
talking about them. In a sense, that's what art is all about, this new ways of

16:28.480 --> 16:34.320
approaching experience and talking about experience and demonstrating experience.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.720
And we're getting better and better at that. And this has become as complicated, because this is

16:38.720 --> 16:46.160
all very cultural. And we would, there's, I don't know whether people really believe this,

16:46.160 --> 16:53.200
but there's some idea that in ancient Greece, there was a big switch between the Iliad and the

16:53.200 --> 16:58.960
Odyssey. And this was to do with the way they thought. So there's an earlier stage where

17:00.000 --> 17:07.280
introspection consisted of hearing the gods telling you what to do. And it's only later on that this

17:08.240 --> 17:15.600
became awareness of this is what you wanted to do. So there was actually a fundamental change in how

17:15.600 --> 17:22.160
you understood yourself, which would obviously influence very much how you explained your

17:22.160 --> 17:26.880
behavior to other people. So we, and you have this with children, for example,

17:28.000 --> 17:33.840
when my grandson hits his twin sister, he says, you know, that was a mistake, I didn't intend to do it.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.560
Whereas presuming an ancient Greek child would have said Zeus told me to or something.

17:40.560 --> 17:45.520
So there are these very interesting cultural changes, which mean although our brains are

17:45.520 --> 17:51.600
essentially the same as they were, whether it was 100, I can't remember the numbers 100,000

17:51.600 --> 17:56.960
years ago, the way we use them and the way we talk to each other are dramatically different.

17:58.320 --> 18:02.800
That's because of consciousness. What are the differences between the self and consciousness?

18:03.520 --> 18:08.320
Or do you think that it was just one thing? Self consciousness is just its own thing?

18:12.880 --> 18:17.520
No, I'm not sure about that. I mean, I think the self is a very important aspect of consciousness,

18:17.520 --> 18:23.280
but there are all sorts of things that I am aware of that are not just about me, by hope.

18:23.680 --> 18:33.840
Yeah. And certainly when we interact with other people, we become aware of what they are like.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.120
So I think there's more to, I mean, I think the self is an important aspect of consciousness,

18:39.120 --> 18:42.240
but it's not the whole of consciousness. Do you think it's just a model we've built?

18:42.960 --> 18:47.760
Do you think? Yes. I mean, this is getting back around slowly to the Bayesian idea. Yes,

18:47.760 --> 18:53.840
there are all these models, and we have a model of ourselves, which is very much determined,

18:54.640 --> 19:00.480
in fact, by other people. So my model of myself is probably largely what I think other people think

19:00.480 --> 19:11.200
of me. With this Bayesian idea, I know that when you look at, let's say, for example,

19:11.200 --> 19:15.440
schizophrenia, it shows such a wide variety of experience of conscious experience. You can see

19:15.440 --> 19:20.720
it as sort of a spectrum. I know Fletcher also does work on this, where he shows you how inherently

19:20.720 --> 19:29.360
all perception can be seen as hallucination or all belief can be seen as delusion. And it's based

19:29.360 --> 19:34.640
on these prior expectations and how we experience that. What are your thoughts on that? I mean,

19:34.640 --> 19:39.840
because clearly, then everything is technically hallucinatory or delusional.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, yes, I partly imagine how I use the words, but this goes back along at least to Helmholtz,

19:48.640 --> 19:55.200
is the idea that perception is not like being a camera. It's not the world coming into my eye,

19:55.200 --> 20:00.160
and then I somehow make sense of it. I can only make sense of it if I have some prior expectation

20:00.880 --> 20:06.800
of what is out there. This is what Bayesians call the prize, but it's really past experience,

20:06.800 --> 20:17.120
prior expectations. An example of this is that story, I think it's maybe from India, I'm not

20:17.120 --> 20:24.720
sure. It's about the five blind men who come across an elephant. And one of them feels it's

20:24.720 --> 20:28.880
trunk and says this is a snake, and then another one feels its leg and says this is a tree, and

20:28.880 --> 20:37.920
another one feels its tail and says this is a lion or something. So because in every case,

20:37.920 --> 20:42.560
they're using their past experience, what this ought to be given what I'm experiencing now.

20:46.320 --> 20:52.240
And similar to the whole bunny duck situation, if you've grown up in a place where you've never

20:52.240 --> 20:58.080
really seen that rabbit duck illusion, where it's one of you duck, if you grew up in a place where

20:58.080 --> 21:02.560
you've never seen a rabbit before, you're automatically going to see the duck. Yes, exactly.

21:03.920 --> 21:08.880
And there's this very strong illusion that you must know about the inverse mask illusion. Yes.

21:10.240 --> 21:14.800
So if you have a mask of a face and you see it from the inside, where it's effectively an inside

21:14.800 --> 21:20.240
out face, you cannot see it as an inside out face, because inside out faces don't exist.

21:20.320 --> 21:26.000
So yes, that's an example of the prior experience taking over.

21:29.440 --> 21:33.840
And there's lots of data supporting this idea, I think.

21:36.640 --> 21:44.320
I mean, basically, our sensations are extremely crude and minimal. I mean, vision,

21:44.960 --> 21:49.600
we have this, we don't realize this, but there's a very small area in the middle of our field of

21:49.600 --> 21:55.360
view where we see things in detail. And beyond that is all blurred, but we're not aware of that.

21:55.360 --> 22:02.000
And we fill things in. And there's the famous example of the, what's it called, the blind spot.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.280
So there's this bizarre situation that the retina is the wrong way around. So the blood vessels

22:07.280 --> 22:12.800
are in front of the receptors. And then they all have to go through a small hole to get back to the

22:12.800 --> 22:18.800
rest of the body. But we're not aware of this hole. We fill it in on the basis of what's immediately

22:18.880 --> 22:24.240
around it. And you can fool the system to fill it in wrong and so on like that.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.640
With that blind spot, even if you do, because there's that experiment, I mean, you close an eye

22:28.640 --> 22:31.680
and you slowly move your thumb away and then suddenly your thumb disappears.

22:32.480 --> 22:38.400
And still we know it's there and yet your brain, it's gone, can't help.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.680
And there are many, many optical illusions like that. I mean, there's the Muller-Lauer

22:43.680 --> 22:49.520
illusion where you see these two lines of different lengths, even though you know they're not different.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.760
With the arrows at the edges, once you're close.

22:55.760 --> 22:59.600
And the neck of cube, because it's in two dimensions, it can have three,

23:00.320 --> 23:04.960
in three dimensions, it has two possible versions and you just switch between them.

23:06.080 --> 23:12.240
But then how do we meet our beliefs and our perceptions, Chris? How do we, as scientists,

23:12.240 --> 23:16.720
as people trying to figure out this neural basis, how can we trust anything we see?

23:18.320 --> 23:24.160
Well, I mean, I think I would say one version of it, which is what Arnold said, I think, is that

23:24.960 --> 23:32.560
our perception is a hallucination constrained by reality, which I also said in my book.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.080
And as long as the constraints are good enough,

23:38.480 --> 23:44.880
we're fine. I mean, that's the sense that we have a model of the world. What we perceive is our model

23:44.880 --> 23:50.320
of the world, not the world. And as long as our model is good enough for what we're trying to do,

23:51.440 --> 23:57.120
that is sufficient. And science operates the same way. So a nuclear model of how the world

23:57.120 --> 24:03.840
works, which marks it works incredibly well. And then Einstein came along and showed us a little

24:03.840 --> 24:10.160
bit at the edge of this model, didn't actually work and produced general relativity or whatever it was.

24:10.720 --> 24:16.800
It was like Mercury. It was like one of the few things that Newton's theory just couldn't solve.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.880
And so I think our perception is very much the same. It works most of the time. And occasionally

24:24.880 --> 24:30.880
with these optical illusions, you find where it's gone wrong. And we can now understand them.

24:31.440 --> 24:36.960
And what I mean, of course, my being so interested in the social aspect is that, say, we have our

24:36.960 --> 24:44.240
own models of the world. And not only can we test it by seeing what happens, making predictions and

24:44.240 --> 24:51.600
so on, but we can also test it by comparing it with other people's models. And there's a nice

24:51.600 --> 24:56.480
cartoon I found somewhere, you know, which says that reality is a shared hallucination.

24:57.440 --> 25:04.560
And that's interesting, because, in a sense, what goes wrong, perhaps in schizophrenia,

25:04.560 --> 25:10.960
is they stop sharing. And then they can go off in these weird directions, because they're no

25:10.960 --> 25:19.440
longer constrained by how other people see things. Yes, that's a very speculative idea.

25:20.400 --> 25:28.080
Yeah. But so in other words, we're all having these hallucinations. And the only reason why

25:28.080 --> 25:32.960
they work is because we're all sharing the same hallucination. And it's once someone diverges

25:32.960 --> 25:38.160
on the spectrum, that they're no longer in touch with reality. And that's what obviously

25:38.160 --> 25:45.120
something like schizophrenia or psychosis is. Yeah. And occasionally, we discover that we're

25:45.120 --> 25:52.720
not sharing it. So, for example, people who are colorblind often don't discover that they're

25:52.720 --> 25:59.280
colorblind until they're adults. So a friend of ours didn't discover he was colorblind until he was

25:59.280 --> 26:03.600
a doctor and they complained that he was feeling the form was wrong. And that's because he didn't

26:03.600 --> 26:11.040
realize they were different colors for different things. And perhaps the most famous example of

26:11.040 --> 26:16.240
this is the dress. Yes. Where suddenly people wear that some were seeing it this way and other

26:16.240 --> 26:22.000
people were seeing it the other way. Yeah, the blue and black and white and gold. Yeah. And it

26:22.000 --> 26:27.600
turned out blue and black because they then went to Photoshop, right clicked on it, checked exactly

26:27.600 --> 26:32.320
what color was in the dress is actually blue and black. When I told some of my friends that

26:32.320 --> 26:36.800
they still they still think I'm lying to them. And this is not a story. And yet,

26:36.800 --> 26:43.680
you know that we perceived it differently. One theory is I'm sure you know this is to do with,

26:44.720 --> 26:53.520
of course, our perception of color is very depends on what we think is illuminating the scene.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.680
And one theory about the dress is if you think it's being illuminated in daylight,

26:59.680 --> 27:03.280
it looks one color if you think it's being illuminated in artificial light, it's another color.

27:03.920 --> 27:10.640
So I mean, and again, this is an example. That's nice for me because of course, that's the prior.

27:10.640 --> 27:14.640
Your prior is what you think it's been illuminating in which you have to take into account to

27:16.000 --> 27:20.640
actually work out what the colors really are. Basically like the checkerboard illusion where

27:20.640 --> 27:25.040
you see the shadow and the two grays. Oh, yes. And they look completely different. Yeah,

27:25.040 --> 27:29.440
I think we think the different color. And it's not people tend to think that we're lying to them

27:29.440 --> 27:33.680
when you show them that this is actually the same color. You have to legitimately prove it.

27:37.120 --> 27:41.200
What did you think about a fixed firm belief? Because that's obviously what some of us have

27:41.200 --> 27:45.600
and there's this cognitive dissonance when you show them that our perceptions are not really

27:46.560 --> 27:51.920
always that accurate. Well, that's it. I mean, I would follow Carl

27:51.920 --> 28:00.080
Friston here and say there's a sort of hierarchy. And at the bottom of the hierarchy, you have what

28:00.080 --> 28:08.240
is the real color of this square. And you have priors and about what is being illuminated and

28:08.240 --> 28:12.160
you could be persuaded that actually it's a different kind of illumination. But at the

28:12.160 --> 28:19.360
top of the hierarchy, you have belief like perception is accurate. And that's very,

28:19.360 --> 28:25.040
that could be very firmly fixed. And in the sense in schizophrenia, I think you have

28:27.200 --> 28:33.280
something eventually goes wrong at the top. So the idea that everybody is trying to deceive me

28:33.280 --> 28:38.560
because this high level prior that cannot really be changed. And it's very difficult to come up

28:38.560 --> 28:43.040
with evidence against that idea that everybody is trying to deceive you, because of course,

28:43.040 --> 28:48.880
you're one of the people who's trying to deceive them anyway. And it's funny because in those

28:48.880 --> 28:54.080
schizophrenic patients, some of the psychotic patients, these optical, these perceptual illusions

28:54.080 --> 28:59.920
don't work on them. Yes, that's right. Which shows that their priors have changed.

29:03.520 --> 29:09.440
But that's very confusing. And I think that's more research is needed, as they say, because

29:10.160 --> 29:14.720
in some cases, their priors are too strong. In other cases, their priors are too weak.

29:15.280 --> 29:20.720
So there has to be some solution to this observation has to be made.

29:21.600 --> 29:26.640
So Chris, tell me, what do you think then about because part of when I worked, I mean,

29:26.640 --> 29:30.960
we did the philosophy and ethics of mental health, you see how we've had three biological sort of

29:30.960 --> 29:36.080
revolutions in psychiatry, for example, when Prozac was invented. I mean, that was one of them.

29:36.080 --> 29:43.440
People went crazy. This was the new craze. And it's functional MRIs, better neuroimaging.

29:44.320 --> 29:51.200
When is psychiatry going to actually get a hold of you that they really want to do?

29:52.000 --> 29:56.480
Is this going to happen in your opinion? Or do you think we're going to continuously fail at this?

29:56.480 --> 30:04.560
Because I guess like what I was saying earlier, I think, for example, there's these very rare,

30:04.560 --> 30:09.760
I can't remember what is it, 1% of people who get a diagnosis of schizophrenia actually have an

30:09.760 --> 30:18.640
autoimmune disease. Okay, I didn't know that. There's a book. Someday there's a journalist who

30:18.640 --> 30:27.760
this happened to. And she describes it very well. And I think what will happen is that there are

30:27.760 --> 30:36.480
multiple causes of schizophrenia and psychosis. And they will gradually be discovered. But not all

30:36.480 --> 30:41.600
of them. I was a bit like in the olden days, I think there used to be something called mental

30:41.600 --> 30:52.320
deficiency. And currently, you know, every week, another 1% is explained by some unique genetic

30:53.600 --> 31:01.840
alteration, which is gradually explaining all these things. And I think something analogous

31:01.840 --> 31:07.360
might happen with schizophrenia, though, they'll be found, you know, there'll be a genetic version

31:07.360 --> 31:14.480
and there'll be an autoimmune version and there'll be various other versions. And each time that will

31:14.480 --> 31:19.680
then become part of the neurology and what's left will be unexplained and left to the psychiatry

31:19.680 --> 31:26.160
so somehow. I want to try to figure out the sort of evolutionary basis for psychosis and

31:26.880 --> 31:31.520
schizophrenia. And I remember, I think I was reading something in evolutionary psychiatry,

31:31.520 --> 31:35.760
it was a journal, I can't remember the name, but we were talking about how a lot of foreigners,

31:35.760 --> 31:40.640
people who move from one country to another, into develop schizophrenia at a higher rate

31:40.640 --> 31:46.080
than those who stay in their own place. And if you have to think about the evolutionary advantage

31:46.080 --> 31:50.720
of that, it would be trust people around you a little less, because you don't know them and

31:50.720 --> 31:54.880
they might not have your best interest at heart. So it's fascinating to think that there might be a

31:54.880 --> 32:01.200
lot of evolutionary basis behind some of these mental illnesses. That's right. I mean, I'm very

32:01.200 --> 32:08.720
interested in this game, that's the Bayesian story. There's this idea of volatility. So if you, if

32:08.720 --> 32:15.040
you're, so this is a new way of looking at learning. So you can have fast learning and have slow

32:15.040 --> 32:21.520
learning. Normally we think of slow learning surely bad, but this is, it entirely depends on

32:21.600 --> 32:29.760
the environment you're in. If you're in a stable environment, then it pays to learn slowly,

32:29.760 --> 32:34.240
because what you've learned in the past probably still applies. So you don't need to change very

32:34.240 --> 32:41.760
much. But if you're in a volatile environment, you have to learn quickly, because the situation

32:41.760 --> 32:47.520
keeps changing. And I guess if you move to a foreign country, you're precisely in a more volatile

32:47.520 --> 32:52.480
environment. And it's interesting that this does seem to have an effect on the dopamine system.

32:53.760 --> 33:01.120
So that in the, yes, I think as you increase the amount of dopamine, the learning rate will

33:01.120 --> 33:06.160
increase or learning faster, which is good for a volatile environment. And of course, if you have

33:06.160 --> 33:12.240
a high level prior that says I'm an involuntary environment, when you're not, this could be

33:12.240 --> 33:19.360
produced all sorts of peculiarities. While we're on the on neuro anatomy, I mean, when you talk

33:19.360 --> 33:24.480
about how we might have emerged or evolved consciousness, and which parts of the brain

33:24.480 --> 33:31.840
do you think are most responsible for this? This is very controversial, as you probably know.

33:33.440 --> 33:40.480
I think there are two aspects to this. I think first of all, I think it's pretty well agreed

33:41.200 --> 33:47.680
that consciousness requires long range connectivity between different brain regions.

33:47.680 --> 33:55.360
And if this breaks down, you become unconscious. Now, certainly in the case of self conscious or

33:55.360 --> 34:03.440
meta consciousness, I think the frontal cortex is critical. Because in a sense, it's at the top

34:03.440 --> 34:12.000
of this hierarchy. And it is where we don't know much about it yet, where you're modeling how the

34:12.000 --> 34:18.480
rest of the brain works. And I think that's necessary for this, say this high level of

34:18.480 --> 34:25.600
consciousness for sentience, which is what I like to call this lower level of consciousness,

34:25.600 --> 34:34.480
which we probably share with many, many animals. That probably doesn't involve the frontal cortex

34:34.480 --> 34:40.960
to the same degree and is probably much more dependent on the long range connectivity.

34:41.840 --> 34:48.720
So one of the things, if we think about sentience, for example, one of the things that has fascinated

34:48.720 --> 34:57.200
me for a long time is what's it called corollary discharge and the reafference principle.

34:58.320 --> 35:05.680
So when we move, and again, Helmholtz was involved in this as part of the reason, when we move our eyes,

35:08.640 --> 35:12.400
obviously the image on our retina is jumping about all over the place.

35:12.720 --> 35:18.800
But we don't see the world jumping about we perceive it stable. And this goes right back to the very

35:18.800 --> 35:25.760
beginning of evolution, when organisms were able for the first time to move under their own power.

35:28.320 --> 35:33.120
Almost immediately, they had to be a mechanism which enabled them to recognize the difference

35:33.120 --> 35:37.840
between movement out there due to something else moving and movement out there due to them moving.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.160
And this is where the reafference or corollary discharge comes in, because you basically,

35:42.160 --> 35:48.000
when you move yourself, you have to say in the signal to the receptive parts of the brain to say,

35:48.000 --> 35:55.360
this is not the world moving, this is me moving. And I think that's perhaps that sort of interaction

35:55.360 --> 36:00.720
between brain areas is the start of something like sentience. And if that's the case,

36:01.520 --> 36:06.800
and if that's the case, it's certainly present in fish and insects and

36:08.960 --> 36:17.120
all sorts of much lower organisms and us. I was speaking to Ian McGillchrist, I'm not sure if

36:17.120 --> 36:20.880
you're familiar with him. We were speaking just the other day, and we're talking about like

36:20.880 --> 36:27.120
Kazanica's work, for example, his work, how important that copus callosum is in terms of

36:27.120 --> 36:32.480
that long range connection you're talking about, because you split that and a lot can happen.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.160
Well, what comes to your mind when you think about split brain patients?

36:36.160 --> 36:39.360
How does it affect anything in terms of your view of consciousness?

36:41.120 --> 36:43.840
Well, I'm a little bit dubious about this.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.000
I mean, one problem is that they don't do the operation anymore.

36:54.960 --> 37:02.800
So we can't sort of replicate the results. The other problem is that occasionally people

37:02.800 --> 37:08.640
turn up who never had a copus callosum, and they seem to be remarkably normal,

37:11.280 --> 37:19.280
compared to the late cases where they are split. So I mean, clearly,

37:19.680 --> 37:26.800
so I guess I'm not really sure what I would predict ought to happen. I mean, a lot of the

37:26.800 --> 37:34.720
brain imaging work, in a sense, went against this idea of distinct properties for the left

37:34.720 --> 37:40.560
and the right brain. So for example, language was always used to be very much in the left brain,

37:40.560 --> 37:44.880
but the brain imaging show there's all sorts of aspects of languages in the right brain as well.

37:45.120 --> 37:54.160
There's this interesting phenomenon of left sided neglect, where there does seem to be some

37:54.800 --> 37:59.440
lateralities of attention so that one side of the brain seems to attention to both fields

37:59.440 --> 38:08.560
and the other side to any one, which is slightly odd. So I'm very confused about the role of

38:08.560 --> 38:17.280
laterality. In terms of that, that it's sort of a hemispatial neglect, Professor Michael

38:17.280 --> 38:23.920
Graziano at Princeton, he has ancient schema theory. So he sort of says that it's more about what

38:23.920 --> 38:29.600
we're attending to, and then we build models to tell us what we're attending to, and that's what

38:29.600 --> 38:36.320
we sort of call consciousness. It's more of a caricature. We're not really seeing reality as it

38:36.320 --> 38:42.400
is. We're just everything we see. Yes, I mean, that's another version of what we were talking

38:42.400 --> 38:46.240
about earlier. We have a model of the world, and that's what we see, not the world itself.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.600
But I think, yes, his ideas are very interesting in relation to how attention works, and particularly

38:51.600 --> 38:57.120
the idea that we, once we, you know, we can model our own attention, we can perhaps model

38:57.120 --> 39:01.280
other people's attention, and I would even go as far as to say, maybe it's the other way around,

39:02.160 --> 39:06.720
that we start off by having to note, it's very important to us to work out where other people

39:06.720 --> 39:13.200
are attending to. I mean, this is not just for us. I mean, there's always nice work with Thomas

39:13.200 --> 39:19.840
Sello on chimpanzee. So the low ranking chimpanzee has to make sure the high ranking chimpanzee

39:19.840 --> 39:27.120
can't see the food, so they can then go and get it. So knowing where other people are attending to

39:27.120 --> 39:31.520
is very important. And maybe once we have worked out how to do that, we suddenly realize we can

39:31.520 --> 39:38.960
apply it to ourselves. There's a similar version in relation to theory of mind. So the sort of

39:39.520 --> 39:43.920
standard idea was we first of all learn how to think about our own minds, our intentions,

39:43.920 --> 39:48.320
our beliefs and desires, and then we apply it to other people. But some people have suggested

39:48.320 --> 39:53.600
it's actually the other way around. We find it so useful to work out what other people are wanting

39:53.600 --> 39:59.200
and knowing and desiring that there's a pressure to find that out. And then we find we can apply it

39:59.200 --> 40:05.680
to ourselves as well. Fascinating. So what I'm going to do is, Chris, the podcast is obviously

40:05.680 --> 40:11.440
called Mind Body Solutions. So we're trying to figure out the infamous mind body problem. So

40:11.440 --> 40:15.920
I'm going to run through a couple theories with you or a couple of philosophical views. And I just

40:15.920 --> 40:19.520
want to hear your thoughts on them. Let's start off with panpsychism. What are your thoughts on

40:19.520 --> 40:26.320
panpsychism? Yes, I don't really understand this. I mean, as I said at the beginning, I think

40:26.320 --> 40:32.480
consciousness is a biological thing. So I expect to find it in biological entities or

40:34.240 --> 40:40.720
machines that are built to represent sort of copies of biological entities. So it could

40:40.720 --> 40:47.120
be in silicon. And I don't really, I mean, the philosophers say that this doesn't solve the

40:47.120 --> 40:54.320
hard problem of how you get subjected to experience out of a physical entity. And I guess I would say

40:55.840 --> 41:01.040
I don't really worry about that at this stage. But the idea that spoons are conscious in some

41:01.040 --> 41:07.280
sense doesn't really help me with what I'm trying to do. Do you think it's a problem with semantics

41:07.280 --> 41:12.720
here? We're just all just saying the same word in a very different way? I think that's partly,

41:12.720 --> 41:19.280
yes, I mean, what it depends on. I mean, does it make any sense to say that spoons are having

41:19.280 --> 41:25.680
subjective experience? But if you then think about something like IIT integrated information theory,

41:26.480 --> 41:31.520
do you think that's following a similar path? Or because they're also trying to search for a neural

41:31.520 --> 41:37.040
basis of consciousness, of course. I mean, they're clearly searching for a neural basis of consciousness.

41:37.120 --> 41:42.960
And I think I would agree that long range connectivity in the brain is very important.

41:44.080 --> 41:49.520
What I don't quite get with integrated information theory is that they start from,

41:50.240 --> 41:55.520
I can't remember five principles of how what consciousness is. And I don't agree with them.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.000
I can't at this moment, because I don't agree with them, of course, I can't remember what they are.

42:02.000 --> 42:08.720
But I think, for example, that it's integrated. And for example, semi-executive was always saying

42:08.720 --> 42:15.360
that consciousness wasn't integrated at all. And it was very messy and so on. So I think their starting

42:15.360 --> 42:23.200
point of what consciousness is, is not the same as mine. Do you think global workspace theory

42:23.200 --> 42:28.880
does a better job at explaining it? Yes, I think that's one of the best ones around at the moment.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.440
Why do you think that?

42:32.480 --> 42:40.560
Why do I? I mean, lots of partly because I stand the heart of a friend of mine. But I think

42:42.480 --> 42:49.760
but it also I think it fits the data very well. In my paper, I point that out so that

42:50.800 --> 42:54.400
if you think it's to do with working, it goes back to the idea of working memory.

42:55.360 --> 43:01.120
Working memory very much involves Prato and frontal cortex. You find that Prato and frontal cortex

43:01.120 --> 43:08.080
are the bits of the brain that are less active and disconnected in coma and vegetative state and

43:08.080 --> 43:12.960
things like that. In the experiments, I actually did when I was still doing brain imaging, where we

43:12.960 --> 43:18.800
were showing looking at the difference between things that you were conscious of and things

43:18.800 --> 43:23.760
that were affecting the brain that you were not conscious of. When you were not conscious of a

43:23.760 --> 43:29.680
face, for example, the face area lit up. But when you were conscious of that face, then Prato

43:29.680 --> 43:36.880
and frontal cortex lit up as well. So that sort of fits with this sort of story. I guess my

43:37.680 --> 43:43.680
worry about global workspace theory is that I don't really quite understand the

43:44.320 --> 43:50.000
ignition story. And of course, it doesn't bring in other people, which

43:50.320 --> 43:57.200
is a question. And how the reporting works and all that sort of thing. But I think it's the best

43:57.200 --> 44:08.000
one around at the moment. Though I also like, of course, Hakuenlau and David Rosenthal's

44:08.000 --> 44:14.800
higher order theory. Can you give me some reasons for that one as well?

44:15.760 --> 44:20.320
Well, that one, I think what is that may be talking about a different thing. So I think

44:20.320 --> 44:25.360
higher order thought theory, I think, is actually talking about this metaconsciousness,

44:25.360 --> 44:30.640
which is this higher level where you're aware that you're aware. And there's lots of evidence that,

44:31.600 --> 44:39.040
for example, we talk about explicit metacognition, which metacognition being means thinking about

44:39.120 --> 44:44.640
thinking. So I'm particularly interested in our ability. When we make decisions,

44:45.680 --> 44:51.840
we can actually think about how likely is this decision to be right? How much confidence do I

44:51.840 --> 44:57.440
have in this decision? And we have this feeling of confidence, we can actually describe how confident

44:57.440 --> 45:03.280
we are to other people. This is actually useful in when we work with other people

45:04.240 --> 45:09.440
to compare our levels of confidence. And again, there's lots of brain imaging work,

45:09.440 --> 45:15.440
particularly from Stephen Fleming, showing that when people have to use confidence,

45:15.440 --> 45:20.640
they're actually using a particular part of the frontal cortex, that is the frontal polar area,

45:20.640 --> 45:27.360
BA10, which seems to have a special role in thinking about thinking. And it seems to be

45:27.360 --> 45:33.520
thinking about thinking is very closely related to this higher order thought theory of consciousness.

45:36.080 --> 45:42.480
So I like that idea. Yeah, I think it seems like a lot of these theories have so many good

45:42.480 --> 45:48.480
ideas that somehow just going to accumulate and provide us with one at some point. It's almost

45:48.480 --> 45:53.680
like they all kind of need each other a little bit. Yes, I think that's right. And then, of course,

45:53.760 --> 45:59.200
there's an interesting paper recently, which looked at all these different theories of consciousness

45:59.200 --> 46:03.360
and the way that they test themselves. I mean, the experiments they do to test them,

46:03.920 --> 46:09.360
which quite nicely showed, as you might expect, that they test their own theory, but it has no

46:09.360 --> 46:13.760
impact whatever on any of the other theories. So the tests that you use for global workspace

46:13.760 --> 46:19.520
theories, Jolly Good for global workspace theory, but has no relevance for IIT or higher

46:19.520 --> 46:24.400
order thought. So in a sense, they have to somehow come together, which is beginning to happen.

46:24.960 --> 46:29.120
I remember when I was chatting to Michael Graziano, he was telling me how you can take

46:29.120 --> 46:34.800
attention schema theory and actually plunk it onto global workspace theory. And then you have

46:34.800 --> 46:40.880
a much better theory of consciousness as a global workspace theory is one of the better ones in

46:40.880 --> 46:49.040
terms of explaining. I think that's right. But I'm reminded, I don't know whether you read these

46:49.040 --> 46:55.440
novels by Sebastian folks. But one of them, I can't remember what it was called, but it's in fact,

46:55.440 --> 47:02.640
it's a series of five different stories. And one of them is about this neuroscientist in Italy who

47:02.640 --> 47:09.200
discovers the basis of neural basis of consciousness. And I was involved because he asked me to comment

47:09.200 --> 47:14.640
on this before everyone knew whether it was plausible and so on. And the hippocampus had a

47:15.440 --> 47:21.200
major role. But what I found quite nice about this story was that when she does define in the

47:21.200 --> 47:24.960
story, she finds the neural basis of consciousness and everybody agrees it's neural basis of

47:24.960 --> 47:35.680
consciousness. And then everybody loses interest. This podcast becomes completely relevant. Let's

47:35.680 --> 47:43.760
hope no one can forget it. That's exactly what happened with the Yarn Vettel. I mean, going back

47:43.840 --> 47:52.080
to what you said earlier. Once it's done, once we figure it out, it's like magic. Nicholas Humphrey

47:52.080 --> 47:58.160
and I were chatting about it, because he calls it phenomenal surrealism. No longer considers it

47:58.160 --> 48:04.800
an illusion. He thinks it's more real than real, like red, even redder than red, because we perceive

48:04.800 --> 48:12.800
it as red. But yeah, he sees it as magic. That's a good point. Actually, it says consciousness is

48:12.800 --> 48:19.440
more real. I think his paper is redder than red. I can't remember exactly the name.

48:20.080 --> 48:27.120
Yes, but just on the same topic, though, once the magician tells you the trick, I mean, you're

48:27.120 --> 48:35.120
done. The search is over this whole magical experience. It's finished. Yes, I think so. Some

48:35.120 --> 48:40.240
people, I won't name names, like to keep their theories, has a little bit of magic. It has a

48:40.240 --> 48:47.920
little bit that no one can quite understand. Do you think when people make these definitions,

48:47.920 --> 48:53.680
let's say, like when we claim that it's a hard problem of consciousness, that we're adding the

48:53.680 --> 48:58.320
element that we don't need? I mean, Daniel Dennis is trying to quine qualia, a quining qualia or

48:58.320 --> 49:02.960
a way to make it easier for us to actually find a neural basis of consciousness. You think that's

49:02.960 --> 49:08.400
a better approach? Not necessarily an illusion, but to at least make... I think it is a better

49:08.400 --> 49:13.920
approach. Yes, I mean, the other extreme is, is it McGinn? Is it the people who call themselves

49:13.920 --> 49:25.520
mysterious, who say we won't ever solve it? And I think that that's clearly a, what's the word,

49:25.520 --> 49:28.880
a challenge. If you say it's impossible to solve, then it's like, right, we're going to do it.

49:30.320 --> 49:34.160
You think this is a way for philosophers just to keep their jobs in certain...

49:38.720 --> 49:44.400
Tell me, Chris, when it comes to theory of mind, I mean, you and I, if you've done such great work

49:44.400 --> 49:52.000
in terms of working together, humans, why are we meant to work together? Over time, how do you think

49:52.000 --> 49:58.400
that this has led to such crazy amounts of technological revolutions? I mean, in terms of

49:58.400 --> 50:03.600
what we've done as a species, why do you think humans have done so much more than, let's say,

50:03.600 --> 50:12.080
our cousins, chimpanzees, bonobos, etc.? Well, I think, yes, I think the basic reason is that,

50:12.080 --> 50:16.880
as we were saying earlier, that we are able actually to share our subjective experiences.

50:18.560 --> 50:23.440
We can, as a result of this, we can actually alter our subjective experiences and make them,

50:23.440 --> 50:29.040
in some sense, more accurate, better models of what the world is like, because we can talk to

50:29.040 --> 50:33.360
each other about what the world is like, and we can get better theories. I mean, this is what

50:33.360 --> 50:38.000
science is all about. You have the better and better model of the world. It never gets there,

50:38.000 --> 50:48.560
but it gets better each time. And we can... I mean, there's this lovely book by Celia Hayes,

50:48.560 --> 50:54.960
which is all about cognitive gadgets, which is about cultural, has given us ways of...

50:55.920 --> 51:04.960
new ways of thinking. And these may be more important than... these cognitive tools may

51:04.960 --> 51:11.440
be more important than, say, stone tools or iron tools or whatever. I mean, mathematics is an example

51:11.440 --> 51:19.840
of a tool which has been created by humans interacting together. So, I mean, and writing

51:19.840 --> 51:27.920
is another example. So, I mean, universal literacy has only been around for the last

51:29.440 --> 51:34.240
hundred years or so. So, these are the things that have made us...

51:37.280 --> 51:41.120
given us all these advantages, which means that we're now dominating the world and probably

51:41.120 --> 51:47.280
about to destroy it, but that's another matter. And the other thing, it's very frightening,

51:47.280 --> 51:53.440
it could all be lost. Exactly. I mean, that's the... I mean, I often ask this, I mean,

51:54.080 --> 51:59.120
I don't believe there is any sort of teleology. I don't... I'm very agnostic regarding anything

51:59.120 --> 52:04.960
regarding the origins of the universe or why we hear what we are to do. But do you think,

52:04.960 --> 52:10.640
for example, AI would be the next evolutionary step? And do you think it's meant to be? Do you

52:10.640 --> 52:16.480
think that's what humans are actually here to do, in a sense? Well, in some sense, yes. I mean,

52:17.120 --> 52:22.480
you could... Yes, we wouldn't want to say it was meant to happen, but we would say the way the

52:22.480 --> 52:28.960
system works means it will happen. It's the next logical step. That's obviously something that will

52:28.960 --> 52:35.600
survive, let's say something a bit more catastrophic on the planet. Should we send it into space or

52:36.720 --> 52:44.800
whatever with it? I mean, that's very interesting. And I'm sad that I probably won't live to see this

52:44.880 --> 52:52.160
happening. But I'm certainly very interested in, yes, what's happening in AI and DeepMind and all

52:52.160 --> 52:57.120
this sort of thing. Sort of quantum computing. I mean, they're doing a lot of intriguing stuff,

52:57.120 --> 53:02.480
but I also don't think I'll be alive, to be honest. But I still don't think most of us would be alive

53:02.480 --> 53:08.480
at that point. Things are going down south very quickly. But I think even DeepMind, the amazing

53:08.480 --> 53:15.280
things they're doing is all happening at this lowest level from a biological point of view.

53:15.280 --> 53:20.720
I mean, in my paper, I show this diagram at three levels. And the bottom level, we have

53:22.000 --> 53:26.240
model-free learning, as it's called, which depends on having huge amounts of evidence

53:26.240 --> 53:32.320
and doing statistical learning. And I think that's what AI can do at the moment.

53:33.200 --> 53:38.080
So, sorry, continue, Chris, what were you saying?

53:38.640 --> 53:42.800
No, I was just going to say the next step up is to start making models and they're beginning

53:42.800 --> 53:46.640
to do that. But I'm not sure whether that's how far that's gone yet.

53:48.720 --> 53:54.560
Michael was telling me that they are applying that theory to certain AI. And it's starting to

53:54.560 --> 54:00.880
work quite well. I mean, they're making some progress, but they're just very far away to

54:01.120 --> 54:05.840
do it with obviously to the complexity that we've reached over billions of years. It takes a long

54:05.840 --> 54:11.760
time. But I think we'll get there. I don't know. I mean, certainly, in relation to theory of mind,

54:11.760 --> 54:17.680
there are, I mean, my worries about our ideas about how theory of mind works is we don't really

54:17.680 --> 54:24.080
have a good computational account of how that works. And people are beginning to develop it

54:24.080 --> 54:32.480
like, what's his name, 10 and down? But the, I think it's not quite there yet. And they typically

54:32.480 --> 54:35.920
say, yes, we've solved this with that. Well, that's not what I meant by theory of mind.

54:37.840 --> 54:43.040
Do you feel that, I mean, we're obviously following this computational approach right now, but

54:43.040 --> 54:46.880
it's because this is the current framework we live in. I mean, people often have this argument

54:46.880 --> 54:52.000
that when we understood the way pumps work, that's how we thought the brain worked when the train

54:52.000 --> 54:56.800
station, we thought it works the same way. Do you feel that perhaps there might be something

54:56.800 --> 55:00.160
we'll figure out in the future that we'll go beyond this computational model? Or you think

55:00.160 --> 55:06.880
we got it this time that we're almost there? No, I was thinking that there were certainly

55:06.880 --> 55:10.800
better things. I guess that's very interesting point, because that's absolutely right. I mean,

55:10.800 --> 55:14.880
what was wrong with Freud's approach? Because he started off by having this model of the mind

55:14.880 --> 55:20.640
that it was basically hydraulic. And he didn't know about information flow and such like, so I

55:20.640 --> 55:27.280
think that was a big step forward is to go. So he was just talking about energy. And the switch

55:27.280 --> 55:34.560
to be able to talk about information, I think was a crucial step in this direction. And there may

55:34.560 --> 55:38.800
well be another crucial step, of course, because we haven't made it yet, we have absolutely no idea

55:40.240 --> 55:46.240
what it is. But in some sense, I mean, this is a sort of Turing story that you can model anything

55:46.240 --> 55:52.400
on a general computer. So you could model your hydraulic system, you could model your steam

55:52.400 --> 56:00.240
engine type system. What we don't know is what we should be modeling, I guess. But I mean,

56:00.240 --> 56:06.640
I agree entirely that we're always using the technology we currently have. But I think we're

56:06.640 --> 56:13.680
beginning to get a sort of meta technology. So we have a technology of technology, which may be

56:13.680 --> 56:25.600
the critical step to the next stage on idealism. Idealism. I guess I'm not quite sure what that

56:25.600 --> 56:31.760
means. Do you mean in the sort of platonic sense? So basically that it's all mind, because there's

56:31.760 --> 56:37.280
a lot of theories now. I mean, for example, Donald Hoffman, Bernardo Kerstrup, there's a lot of people

56:37.280 --> 56:44.400
who are saying that it's all in the mind, everything is mind. And making some very good

56:44.400 --> 56:49.040
physical theories like physics, using a lot of physics to actually prove that space time, for

56:49.040 --> 56:54.320
example, isn't as real as we thought it was, according to the mathematics, and then trying

56:54.320 --> 57:00.400
to figure out how consciousness could be fundamental to that. Yes, I haven't really thought about that.

57:00.400 --> 57:05.600
Is this a bit solipsistic in the sense that say we are creating the world out there?

57:07.040 --> 57:13.440
I think, yes, I'm not so happy with that. I mean, I'm very keen to believe that there is a real world

57:13.440 --> 57:24.640
out there that we're trying to find out about. But I agree that the way what we impose upon it is

57:24.640 --> 57:30.960
obviously must be, to some extent, created by our minds. I mean, this is almost a sort of Bayesian

57:30.960 --> 57:38.560
thing that we, the priors come from within. So in that sense. A sort of naive realism. We know

57:38.560 --> 57:43.200
that there's something there, but we're just not seeing it as accurately as we might. Yes, I'm a

57:43.200 --> 57:47.520
naive realist, I think. So I think, yes, we're getting more accurate. But I believe that there is,

57:48.160 --> 57:52.480
I mean, if we don't believe there's anything out there, there's no way we can improve our accuracy.

57:52.480 --> 57:58.080
We have to be something, I mean, I'm very keen on prediction errors. I mean, that's a sort of

57:58.080 --> 58:03.360
Bayesian story. Errors are a very good thing because they tell us about what we don't know.

58:05.600 --> 58:10.720
So I'm keen on the idea that there are things that we don't know that we will be able to find out

58:10.720 --> 58:17.840
a bit about. Tell me, Chris, when you started out with this, because there's a book by John

58:17.840 --> 58:27.120
Hogan or Hogan or Hogan called Mind Body Problems. And what the author does is look at different

58:27.120 --> 58:33.120
scientists, philosophers, Christoph Koch, for example, each one, and it almost goes into a

58:33.120 --> 58:39.040
personal deep dive into their life and how their personal experiences might have led them to their

58:39.040 --> 58:45.280
current belief in consciousness. So for example, if someone was very spiritual or very religious,

58:45.840 --> 58:51.040
somehow things consciousness will be fundamental. Someone who's not, grows up very atheist,

58:51.920 --> 58:57.840
tends to think consciousness is an illusion. So how do you think your spiritual views and beliefs

58:57.840 --> 59:05.120
have shaped the way you think about consciousness today? Well, I was certainly brought up in a

59:05.120 --> 59:17.840
very religious family, Anglican, of course. But I still get a great deal of pleasure from

59:18.880 --> 59:28.160
services and singing psalms and peculiar rituals of this sort. So I quite like to be an Anglican

59:28.160 --> 59:31.760
on the grounds that these are the Christians who don't actually believe in God. So that's

59:32.560 --> 59:40.800
so from that, I mean, so there's that side of it. I guess my main interesting consciousness

59:40.800 --> 59:48.160
probably was because I very early on trained as a clinical psychologist. And I actually

59:48.160 --> 59:54.480
interacted with people with psychosis, who had hallucinations and delusions. And I became

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.400
completely fascinated by what an earth hallucination, what it meant to be having a hallucination.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.960
And of course, I was also reading Philip K. Dick, which is a very strong experience.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.480
And his theme, of course, is that, you know, reality is not what we think it is.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.360
And what we, you know, we have been, it's an illusion that's been created by evil

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.000
capitalists of some kind to keep us down. So I mean, so those two sides may be extremely

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.120
interesting hallucinations. Why should my belief, my beliefs about the world be any better than

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:37.600
these patients that I was interacting with? And I guess that was my start in thinking about.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.840
So I was thinking about hallucinations. And I realized very rapidly that this is actually

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.920
all about consciousness. So hallucination is the extreme subjective experience, because it

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:57.120
doesn't actually, it's not based on what's coming into the senses. So it's almost subjective

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.640
experience without reality. So that was, and I guess that was my main starting point.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.400
And then at some point, I mean, in your book, Making at the Mind, I remember reading it a

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.560
long time ago, for the first time. And I mean, it blew my mind as well. I mean, you talk about

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.920
various different things in your papers, in your books, altered states of consciousness,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.720
so one of them. How do you think altered states of consciousness give us a better idea of

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:29.680
understanding of consciousness in itself? Well, there's some very interesting, I mean,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:36.480
I talk about this a bit in my paper. But I think the altered states of consciousness make us realize

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:47.120
that, you know, there's more to it than we typically experience. And I mean, that certainly

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.120
it's a very basis for studying levels of consciousness when you're talking about altered

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:59.840
states due to lack of various things. But also the use of psychedelic drugs reveal that you can

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.880
have states of consciousness that are not like what we are used to. And again, I think that's

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.800
very important. It's rather like the dress to realize that there's more to consciousness than

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:20.160
perhaps we realize. I'm not quite sure in what direction this is going to go in. But one of the

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.520
things it's maybe important is going right back to us why and how we started talking about how do

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:32.880
you study subjective experience. And there is always this problem of psychology that introspection

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:40.400
is difficult. And we need better tools for doing introspection. And I think studying altered

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:47.760
states is one of the ways of improving the tools because it in a sense, defines different dimensions

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.520
within which we might describe our conscious experience. So it's giving us a better sort of

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.440
framework for beginning to talk about our subjective experience, which is what we

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.920
desperately need. So that's

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.280
There are a lot of universities nowadays studying like the effects of psilocybin,

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:12.320
as the certain drugs on patients with depression, etc. And it seems to be very promising.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:22.320
Yes, I'm still a little bit suspicious. But it's certainly worth looking at further.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.400
I think the one I read, I remember there was a five or six month follow up on patients who

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:37.680
had taken a high dose psilocybin trip programs at very high dose. And most of the patients'

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.960
experiences seem to be back to normal at their baseline, which obviously needs to still be peer

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.560
reviewed a lot more and tested. But that does seem to be quite promising. Because currently,

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.360
if you look at our current approach, treating depression, I mean, anti-depressants are not

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.240
not up to standard. It's a point, actually, how effective they are.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.400
Well, no, that's a big problem. I mean, also in the study of psychosis, because

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.160
basically, big pharma has stopped doing any research. Because there's no

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:17.440
there's no obvious direction to take. So we certainly need to somehow get back into that.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.880
Although, I'm not quite sure where that would take us. But no, I think this is interesting. But

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.360
as I say, bigger trials are needed. And there's also the work on ketamine.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.160
Yes, there's been a lot of studies on that as well.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:46.240
I think it's Joanna Moncriff, who wrote a book on big pharma and how a lot of these drugs are

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.760
just completely controlled by the pharmaceutical industry. And now it's taken over, it's taken

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.240
a life on its own that the way the science no longer really matters at this point.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.320
Do you feel the same way as a clinical psychologist that look in psychiatry? I mean,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.760
these patients are all no longer sorting out the psychological elements and the social elements.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.880
I mean, it's partly to do with a matter of expense. But I mean, the drugs,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.800
they're still giving the same drugs that were discovered based in the 50s. And as I said,

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.120
the sum of useful companies are no longer interested in trying to develop better drugs,

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:29.920
because they don't know how to. There's a lot of work with what's it called cognitive

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:36.640
behavior therapy. Although this is not quite as good as we were hoping.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:46.080
Sorry, that was something I was going to say. But it's partly,

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.760
when I was studying schizophrenia a long ago, there were these huge mental hospitals,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:59.680
which were full of patients and they were all closed down. And it was believed that this would

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.640
help them and they would no longer be institutionalized. Now, this has not worked. It was effectively

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:13.600
a money saving enterprise. And they're now treated in the community, which is a euphemism for not

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:24.960
being treated at all. I'm sure that much better procedures could be applied if there was the money

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:32.560
to do so. But we still don't, I mean, whether this is not about cure, this is about management.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:40.640
And apart from these odd things like the very rare cases that have autoimmune

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.200
problems, which can actually be cured, the rest of it, we still don't know.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.720
When you look at autistic patients, I mean, mines are clearly better than one. I mean,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.520
you speak about this, you've got a graphic novel, you've got, you've done a lot of lectures on it.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.640
Yeah. How do you think that patients with on the autistic spectrum

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.000
differ from the average person in terms of how they perceive the world from a theory of mind

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.280
perspective? Well,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:24.960
certainly at the more extreme ends of the spectrum, I think they generally have difficulty in

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:35.760
recognising that behaviour is driven by beliefs, rather than reality. And therefore,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:41.760
the difficulty in understanding that people can have false beliefs, difficulty in understanding

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.360
that people can, I mean, this is the dangerous part, people can be deliberately deceiving you

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:53.840
by trying to impart a false belief in you. So they can be over trusting.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.680
So there are these sorts of problems. They, the other area where they may have difficulty

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.880
is recognising, you know, which is part of the same thing. Things like white lies that you

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:15.760
can deceive people for good reasons. And you don't always have to obey the rules. So they

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:21.360
tend to be very ruled down because of not recognising these sort of grey areas, which

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:28.320
can make them difficult to work with because they object to people doing minor infringements,

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:36.480
which I'm sure our Prime Minister would suffer from. I think that's one of the things that I

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.720
do like most about the Bayesian brain approach is that you try and explain these with using

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.000
Bayes theorem and using these priors. I mean, it does explain quite a lot of psychiatric disorders.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.440
I mean, too many incorrect priors fix more. Yes, I think the dangerous it may be explains too much.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.680
And I mean, I think it explains things on a low level, but we need much more

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:10.640
testable predictions. So it's perhaps too good at explaining things, but we need to actually have

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:18.640
some new hypotheses that we can demonstrate. And if you okay, so we've done we've spoken about

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.040
panpsychism, idealism, so people just thinking all in the mind. What about those who believe in

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.120
quantum consciousness? I mean, this isn't the microtubules you've got to hammer off.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:39.040
This is something more. I don't think we need it. I mean, I think the microtubules

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:45.120
is largely discounted as far as I understand it. But I'm not convinced that we need

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.840
a special as yet, we don't need to bring in these rather

01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.640
abstruse physical mechanisms to explain

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:10.560
how the brain works. I had I'm what I had once had an interaction with Penfield about

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:19.920
I mean, and one of his arguments is that the brain cannot be a computer because

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:27.360
you know, people can solve non computable problems or some other details. And I was objecting to

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.960
this because I was saying was, I mean, in fact, when you look at the computation involved,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.400
at an unconscious level, we do actually much better than we do at the conscious level. Our

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:44.000
conscious processing is actually much more primitive than the unconscious processing. So

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:51.120
if we really need quantum type explanations, it may apply at the unconscious level of how

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.920
well the brain works, but we don't really need it for the conscious level. It seems to me that's

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:01.520
a different problem. In a few weeks, I'm chatting to Mark Swalms. I'm not sure if you're familiar

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:09.920
with his work. Mark Swalms. Oh, yes, psychoanalysis. Yes. So he sort of thinks it's a bit more

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:17.680
a lot more primitive, actually, that it's not so much to do with the prefrontal cortex and that

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.120
sort of communication out downward, it's more from the bottom up that we consciousness sort of

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.640
evolves. Do you have thoughts on that? Yes, I mean, I think that goes back to this idea that the

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.000
frontal cortex is particularly involved with self consciousness and meta consciousness, and that

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.360
sentence may well be much more bottom up. I'm not myself too keen on psychoanalytic approaches

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:48.080
to this, because I don't quite know how they fit, or what it's all about. But I would certainly

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:55.200
agree that there's a lot of, I mean, the bottom end of sentence, which as I say, is probably

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:02.800
shared with fish and bumblebees and so on. The frontal cortex may not be so relevant, and this

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:11.600
is certainly, in that sense, very primitive. When you think of other species like, let's say dolphins,

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.720
what else, let's just octopi, I mean, is it octopuses or octopi? I'm not sure what the correct

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.840
term there is, but a lot of people have done studies now with octopuses, and they seem to think

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.720
that they're a lot more complicated than we thought. Yes, I think that's absolutely true.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.880
I mean, one task, which I mean, there's this chapter on the virtues written a great deal about

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.720
consciousness is a philosopher about invertible consciousness, and I think makes a very good

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:51.200
case for octopuses, which I think, anyway, to the extent that the, it's now, I think the government

01:12:51.200 --> 01:13:00.400
has recognized that octopuses and squids should be protected in certain ways. But there's a very

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:08.080
interesting task, which I talk about in my paper, which I, which is this reversal learning, you know

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:17.840
about this, this is, so it's a very simple task. For example, you can have two food wells, which

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:24.320
have, you know, one's red and one's blue, and food is hidden under one of them. And most creatures

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:32.240
can learn with trial and error that it's hidden under the red one. And so they do that for some

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:38.720
time, and then you switch without telling them you switch the reward to the blue one. And then

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.560
after a few trials, they realize they were wrong, and they realize it's down to the blue one, and

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:49.840
you can go on doing this, this is very boring, and a very simple model free learning device

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.440
can learn this. But every time you switch, it takes a certain number of trials until it gets

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:02.800
the right answer. But most creatures show something which is called learning to learn. So after a few

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:10.400
switches, they can switch much more quickly. And this involves actually a higher level,

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.680
you now have to go up to a level which recognizes that the world has two states, it's either the

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.720
the red's good or the blue's good. And you have to recognize when the state changes.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.680
And this is also very interesting from a Bayesian point of view, because when it's in the,

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.960
this is all probabilistic. So even when it's, when it's usually under the red one,

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:39.520
it's only under the red one, say 80% of the time. So very occasionally you'll find it's

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.120
under the other one, you'll be wrong. But because you realize it's a state, you say this

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.400
I know this is just noise. So I ignore these prediction errors. This is very becoming very

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:58.560
sophisticated. You say prediction errors are not, not always important. I can, in some situations,

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.680
I ignore them. But you've also learned that after a certain amount of time, it's going to switch.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.520
And therefore we start saying, well, I'm reaching the point where I suspect that these

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.720
prediction errors are becoming important. Because they may be telling me there's going to be a

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.440
switch in the state of the world. So I'll start attending to them. And that's how you can switch

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.520
very rapidly, because you roughly know where it's going to be. And as soon as their prediction

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.120
error, at this point, then you say, I'm going to switch to the other one. So this is highly

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.360
sophisticated and enables you to switch quickly. Now, what is interesting is that

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.360
most creatures can do this.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.840
This is what Jonathan Birch points out, this rapid learning to learn this

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.600
reversal learning switch can be found in many animals, you know, go fish, probably I haven't

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.920
done bumble bees yet, but they probably will. And I think this is a marker of sentence. You

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.600
now have a model of the world that it can be in two different states, rather than just learning

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.600
this response is good, or this response is good. That's the difference between the model free learner

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.840
who just knows whether the response is good or not, and has to learn it. And the model

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:23.200
determined learner who realizes there are two different states of the world. And this is what

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.000
I have to learn about. And I think that's where sentence is. And if this really is a marker

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.840
of sentence, then many creatures have it. That's quite intriguing. So even goldfish are able to

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:41.200
do this. That's pretty cool. And let's see, that's fascinating. When you think about

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.160
virtual realities, I mean, we're reaching a point where meta, we're talking about things like meta

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:54.000
and metaverse, people are thinking about how we're all at some point going to be computerized,

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.760
we're going to plug ourselves in, become part of a virtual world. Do you think that it's possible

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:06.400
that this is actually a virtual? Do you ever have those sort of philosophical thoughts as a

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.040
very prominent figure in the neuroscience and psychology field?

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.840
No, I have to say, I mean, I've certainly been interested in the idea of a brain and a fat.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.040
And this really goes right back to Descartes, who was worried about, you know,

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.800
there's an evil demon that's determining what I'm perceiving.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:33.680
And I guess, but I've never really taken that on board. And I guess it's, again, it's to do with

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:41.600
interacting with other people who have slightly different views of the world, who have slightly,

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:47.360
you know, they have different past experiences. And it doesn't, if we were all brains in vats,

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:53.200
I just thought that similarity would be much greater. Or maybe it depends on how

01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:01.920
sophisticated the programmer is. But I think, so I'm not really taken with that. I mean,

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.720
so I'm certainly very interested in the idea that, you know, with virtual reality, we do become

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:12.800
brains in vats. But interestingly, we can choose which that we're in, which is quite

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.400
interesting. But so far, I have not been very impressed with the virtual reality.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:27.040
I have tried, but I'm not very good at it. I mean, who was once asked to be on the jury of the,

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.000
you know, every year they have some competition for the best new game or something. And so we got

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
lots of these games to play. And we found that we were completely incompetent at playing them.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.880
So that was probably the reason why I'm not impressed by the

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.600
virtual world, because I'm just not very good at getting into them properly.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.960
If you had to...

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:56.080
Trinity, Chris, to actually put your brain, download your consciousness and keep it alive

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.440
and keep it going, would you do that?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.160
That's a very interesting question.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:09.520
Probably not. Unless the virtual worlds are much better than they are now.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.360
And I'm very, I'm very mystified about this idea that we'll soon be able to download our brain

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.680
into a computer or something, because I am becoming more and more complicated. I mean,

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.680
the recent work says that you would have to take into account, you know, every synapse,

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.960
not just every neuron.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.280
Exactly.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.160
And I think that's not enough.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.360
And you lose a lot of competition in the sense that we are very much embodied beings functioning.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:39.120
I mean, a lot of our perceptual experiences come from the fact that we have hands,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.560
and we can't have 10s because we've got these 10 fingers.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:43.920
Yeah.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.440
So there's a lot that we'd lose out in terms of information.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's very important. I mean, the other thing I've been very fascinated

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:58.400
by is that the people have started working on theirs. Occasionally, people have six fingers

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:04.400
instead of five. And it's to some extent genetic. And I think there's a family in Brazil where

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.400
they all have six fingers or something. And there's some very interesting work on what they do with

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.360
their mobile phones, and they're actually able to do more things.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.720
I'm going to read up on that after this.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.080
And that's another that's called augmented reality, I think. But I mean, we're going to get

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.320
things, I mean, machines or whatever, extra bits so that we can actually have more fingers or

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.920
more arms or whatever it is. So that would be quite, I mean, I guess I'm more interested in

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:41.200
that aspect of interacting with reality than the virtual reality.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.600
It's fine because now David Chalmers has completely left consciousness. Well,

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:51.200
he hasn't left it, but he's now very much focused on virtual reality and the philosophy of virtual.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.960
How do we behave? What are the moral, what are the ethical principles here, etc.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:01.200
But I think that's interesting because I would be more interested in what he thinks about, you know,

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:09.440
having more hands on. And there's also work on having new senses. So for example, you can wear a

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:15.440
belt through which you can feel where Magnetic North is. Is that useful?

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:23.040
It's quite interesting because if you grow up learning how to use it, it definitely takes your

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.120
priors. Yeah. And that's again, goes back to consciousness because

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:35.280
and our subjective experience depends a great deal on what sensory inputs we have.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.080
And presumably someone who is blind from birth has a very different

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:46.240
conscious experience from other people. And likewise, if we can have these extra senses,

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:53.520
what will that do to us? I mean, again, I've jumped around a bit, but you know,

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.680
this recent discovery that some women have four color receptors rather than three.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:10.480
Does it make any difference? Can you make use of it? So I guess I'm more interested in these

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.360
developments. David Eagleman does a lot of work on sensory substitution. And how you like,

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:23.120
he can wear a you can wear a sort of vest that will vibrate in a certain way. If you are blind,

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.400
then you've got glasses and I need to like take in information via a camera and then

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.120
vibrate in a certain way on your vest and then you know what reality is. You paint a new picture

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.960
for yourself. But then that leads to the question, how much more could we augment this real experience?

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.200
I agree, which is a lot more intriguing to think about.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:53.920
Do you believe in free will, Chris? Yes, I've been, I've took a long time. But again,

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.880
it's very social thing. I think the experience of having free will is to some extent a social

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.760
phenomenon. I mean, like I was talking about the ancient Greeks, perhaps didn't have,

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.800
didn't think they had free will because the gods were telling them what to do.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:13.360
But if you then re-attribute that to me telling me yourself what to do, then

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.640
you do have free will. But I'm very interested in, I mean, there's this interesting relationship

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:24.400
between free will and responsibility. And we're all brought up to feel responsible for our actions.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:33.120
And this is why I was said very early on, my grandson would, if he hits his twin sister will say,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.480
I'm not responsible because it was an accident. So he's learned very early on to make the distinction

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.120
between things you do deliberately and things that you do by accident. And this has become very

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.200
important, at least in Western cultures, about, you know, it's a basis of legal things. You have to

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:57.920
be, you have to have the intention to do something, not just, that didn't just happen. And I think

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:02.640
this is something we learn on very early on. And we have this feeling that we're responsible for our

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:09.920
actions. We have particularly a strong feeling of regret. And the mere fact that we can feel

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.760
regret that I should have done something else implies that at the time we could have done

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.520
something else. Otherwise, this doesn't make any sense. So I think, again, the feeling of regret,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:23.600
the feeling of being in control of our actions, these are very important aspects of our conscious

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:30.320
experience. And they are the basis of our belief in free will. And they're very important for

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:36.800
social cohesion and the rule of law, and understanding people, because we believe that people do

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:44.560
things for reasons. And in that sense, we expect people to have, to some extent, free will.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.480
So I think that's very important. It's a cultural phenomena, but to some extent,

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.800
is created by culture. And it's also very important for making culture work.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:01.120
So even though we have these experiments by Benjamin Libet, let's say, or

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.920
Uri Maus does certain work on it as well, you still believe just because it's because of

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.600
this fundamental link with moral responsibility, you have to take it into account.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:18.960
Patrick Haggard has followed up the Libet experiments in many studies. And what he has

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.320
shown is that the experience of action is just like other perceptions. It's very Bayesian. So

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.760
you have a prior, and you have an outcome. So your experience of performing an act is you have a prior

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.600
intention, and you have the outcome, and they're bound together to give the experience of the action.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:43.600
And I think what Libet, the reason that Libet finds that, you know, say when I had the decision

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.640
to do the action is later, is because of this binding phenomena. And you can move it around.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.040
That's what Patrick Haggard has shown. You can move the timing around by what happens afterwards.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.560
So in a sense, what happens afterwards is bound into your

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.040
subjective experience of the act. So I think the timing is not the fact that it happens after

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.400
the brain starts working, is not relevant to the problem of whether we have free will or not.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.520
It's part of it. It's the way the experience is created.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:27.360
To close, Chris, there's listeners they often love to when some of their favorite neuroscientists,

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.720
psychologists, philosophers tell us some book recommendations or author recommendations in

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.760
general with your favorite philosophers. If you had to give me five, at least.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:45.760
Within the field with two, I mean, relevant books. I mean, the most the book on consciousness

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.880
that people should now read is Hacquan Lau's new book. In consciousness, we trust is that I think

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:58.720
it's called it. Who's it? Sorry, repeat the author's name. Hacquan Lau. I haven't read it.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.400
Oh, I mean, he's worked with. Yes, it's very new. It only came out a month ago.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:14.320
So that tells you great. It's tough. It's not like analysis. It goes into the nitty gritty of

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.200
how you do experiments and so on. Okay, so it's not like being you. I think Anil's is being you.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:31.680
Yeah, yeah. I'm basically recommending all my friends. Nick Shea wrote a few years and what's

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:38.960
good about this Hacquan's book is it's I think it's often in the university press, but it's free.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.600
You can download it for free. Nick Shea is the philosopher who wrote a couple of years ago a

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:53.440
book about representation, which is very important in neuroscience. And I can't remember what it's

01:27:53.440 --> 01:28:04.000
called, but that's also you can download it for free. Of course, the best, best philosophy book,

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.320
if you're interested in Wittgenstein and people like that is Lodgy Comics.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:16.080
Have you, you know that one, which is the graphic novel on the life of Bertrand Russell?

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.560
And obviously you have to read a Philip K. Dick book if you want to understand.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.200
I've got a really cool Philip K. Dick box set from Folius.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.600
But yes, do do androids dream of electric sheep is the sort of classic.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.120
But there's another one which has the lovely title of the penultimate truth.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:51.120
Gosh, it's very difficult stuff. I put you in the spot there. I know a lot of my guests

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.000
can't get caught in the spot at that moment when I asked them that question.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.280
But I haven't, I'm not very good on books.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.880
If you think about the philosophers who or psychologists who really influenced your view

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.080
and made made you the person you are today in terms of the thinker you are,

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.040
would you think played some big roles?

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.600
Well, I mean, there's Tim Shannis's book,

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.040
which is called Neuropsychology and Mental Structure. I mean, that's quite an old book,

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:29.120
but that that was very influential on my work. And obviously, I read, I mean,

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.240
I read all the old stuff like Donald Hibbs, what was it called?

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.400
Principles of behavior? I'm not sure.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.120
And going by even further, because I had to give the

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:52.560
Bartlett Lecture recently, I read Frederick Bartlett's book called Remembering,

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.640
which is from 1932. But that has all this sort of Bayesian approach

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:05.840
that the memory is constructive and so on, and has a second section on social psychology,

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.680
even the effects of culture.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.920
Probably anything on Helmholtz as well.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:19.120
Oh, yes. Well, Helmholtz is very difficult. There is a little book on Helmholtz,

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.040
where I have to confess my German is not good enough to have read the original.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:32.960
I mean, the book that very much influenced me in early stages was this one,

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.760
or his. Oh, nice. Okay.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:47.680
And what is it? He has labyrinths, it's called. But he has, I mean, they're all very short stories,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:53.920
but one of them is called Funes the Memorias, which is about someone who has some sort of brain

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.200
damage, which means they can, their memory is completely altered, and they can remember everything,

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:04.800
their episodic memory is perfect as a result of which they abandon concepts.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.040
Because they don't need to simplify. That's fascinating.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.720
Chris, thanks. I mean, everybody, when people look, read it, when people read your work,

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.920
when people read like people like Friston's work, I mean, they're always curious,

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.840
like, how do you guys get to the point where you are? Who are the thinkers who make you,

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.880
who you are? It's fascinating to see the journey you guys take to get, to get to that point.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.000
Well, it's random, basically.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.520
You guys are there for us. I mean, like one day, if somebody asks me these questions,

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:48.800
I'm going to say, like Chris, I mean, so it's great to know who influenced you and who played

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:55.760
that big role for you guys. Do you think so, Chris? I mean, of course, it's mind, body, solution.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.280
Do you think we're going to find the mind, body, solution?

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.960
We're going to solve this mind, body, problem anytime soon?

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.440
I hope not.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.080
Is it the magic is gone?

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.840
Where's the magic is gone?

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.320
Yeah.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:15.360
But honestly, thanks to you at least listeners. I've taken one step closer to the mind, body,

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:20.960
solution. And I really appreciate you accommodating me, knowing that we're having some

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.360
horrible weather conditions here in South Africa.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.400
I gather, yeah.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:29.520
It's been crazy, like lots of flooding, lots of death. It's been quite intense.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.560
Right. But you're getting, it's getting back to normal.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:40.800
Guys, I appreciate your time and for rescheduling the meeting with me.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.600
Yeah, that was fine. Yeah. No, thanks. I enjoyed this chat very much.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.120
Thanks, Chris.
