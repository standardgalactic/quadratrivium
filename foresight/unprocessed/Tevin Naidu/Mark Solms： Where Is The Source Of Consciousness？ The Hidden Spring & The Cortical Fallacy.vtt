00:00.000 --> 00:15.440
Mark, tell me, why is it that there is something it is like to be me?

00:15.440 --> 00:18.480
Why is it that there is something it is like to be you?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.440
How is this possible?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.160
Well, there are two questions there.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.600
The one is why there is something it is like to be me.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.320
Or to be you, and the other is how is that possible?

00:35.920 --> 00:44.560
The why question, I believe, has everything to do with the fact that the fundamental,

00:44.560 --> 00:50.880
and I say fact, and I'll have to substantiate that later, but it has everything to do with the fact

00:50.880 --> 00:56.960
that the fundamental form of consciousness is feeling, in other words, affect.

00:57.840 --> 01:07.040
And affect arises from a monitoring of our homeostatic imperatives.

01:08.240 --> 01:16.720
We living things have to remain within certain viable bounds, and simpler creatures have reflexive

01:17.760 --> 01:24.320
mechanisms which maintain them within those bounds, but obviously reflexes have a limited

01:25.280 --> 01:32.000
generalizability. There are many situations that living things find themselves in which are

01:32.000 --> 01:40.880
unpredicted by their evolutionary past, and so they can't navigate uncertain or novel

01:41.760 --> 01:52.240
situations, and so most of them expire in those situations, but a lucky few survive,

01:52.240 --> 01:58.320
because they just happen by chance to do the right thing, and then they have progeny,

01:58.320 --> 02:03.120
and so that contributes to the evolution of those reflexes.

02:04.880 --> 02:12.800
There's therefore an enormous advantage, an enormous adaptive advantage for creatures to be

02:12.800 --> 02:19.440
able to experience how they're doing. Is this going well or is this going badly?

02:22.480 --> 02:29.040
When acting voluntarily, in other words, not reflexively, not automatically, they now can,

02:29.040 --> 02:36.320
by trial and error, try different things out, and if it's going well, then they feel it.

02:37.280 --> 02:44.720
This feels like a relief, and if things are going badly, the opposite applies,

02:44.720 --> 02:51.120
and so they avoid what feels bad, and they approach what feels good, and in this way,

02:51.120 --> 02:56.320
as I said a moment ago, they have the enormous advantage of being able to navigate

02:56.640 --> 03:06.480
unknown, unpredicted, novel, uncertain situations, and then to learn from the experience during life

03:06.480 --> 03:14.160
rather than for it to require generations of phylogenetic learning, in other words,

03:15.360 --> 03:20.240
learning by natural selection, or rather adaptation by natural selection.

03:20.960 --> 03:29.120
So, I believe I, with others, it's not my own idea. This is a building on the work,

03:29.120 --> 03:36.400
first of all, of Jagdpanksepp, and secondly of Antonio de Marzio, and others. We believe

03:36.400 --> 03:41.760
that that affects or an extent or feeling is an extended form of homeostasis.

03:42.560 --> 03:52.720
There, you can see in what I've just said, there's an intrinsic value system. The value system of

03:53.520 --> 04:00.000
all living things, the value system which simply underwrites the whole of evolutionary biology,

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
is that it is good to survive and bad not to. So, good feelings predict your likely survival,

04:10.640 --> 04:17.440
and bad feelings predict your likely demise. So, that's the valence, as we call it,

04:17.440 --> 04:25.360
the valence of affect, the unpleasant pleasure dimension. It is intrinsically valenced,

04:26.480 --> 04:32.160
doing well and doing badly. In order to make choices, and remember that's what I'm speaking

04:32.160 --> 04:39.440
about, the animal having now the capacity to make choices. In other words, to not behave compulsively

04:39.520 --> 04:45.680
according to reflex. That capacity has to be rooted in a value system, because how else do

04:45.680 --> 04:50.560
you make a choice? Something has to be better than something else. So, there has to be some

04:50.560 --> 04:55.120
value system which determines what's good and what's bad, and that's what I've just

04:55.120 --> 05:04.160
explicated. Now, on top of that, we have multiple needs. We complex creatures have multiple needs,

05:04.160 --> 05:07.840
but actually, you don't need to be that complex a creature to have multiple needs,

05:08.800 --> 05:15.680
like for example, to have energy balance needs, and thermoregulation needs,

05:16.400 --> 05:26.240
and hydration needs, and oxygenation needs. There you have four, and each of these has to

05:26.240 --> 05:34.160
be met in their own right. So, you can't reduce them to a common denominator. You can't say,

05:34.160 --> 05:44.720
I have 8 out of 10 need for sleep, and a 2 out of 10 need for nutrition. Therefore, I have a 10

05:44.720 --> 05:50.400
out of 20 total need, so all I need to do is sleep, and I'll reduce the number, and never eat.

05:51.280 --> 05:58.080
You have to do them both. So, why I'm emphasizing that is that this is something in addition to

05:58.080 --> 06:04.880
valence. We also have categories of need. So, valence is a continuous variable.

06:06.880 --> 06:12.880
You can say from minus 50 to plus 50, that's the range of badness to goodness,

06:14.000 --> 06:22.880
but the categorical variables that represent our different needs are by definition because

06:22.960 --> 06:27.760
they're categorical variables. They are qualitatively distinguished from each other.

06:30.640 --> 06:38.160
So, this is why feelings have both a goodness and a badness, and a particular quality, so that

06:38.160 --> 06:44.720
sleepiness feels different from hunger, and from thirst, and from respiratory distress, and so on.

06:45.120 --> 06:52.320
So, when you said why is there something that is like to be me or to be you,

06:53.280 --> 07:01.360
I believe in the most basic form of consciousness, that's why. It enables us to know how we're doing,

07:01.360 --> 07:08.480
to evaluate how we're doing, and it is necessarily qualified. In other words,

07:08.480 --> 07:18.400
qualia arise from the fact that we have multiple such needs. Then there's the second step, which is

07:18.400 --> 07:24.000
if I can, you know, obviously the simple creatures that first evolved, when I say simple, I don't want

07:24.000 --> 07:30.560
to be derogatory, they're not that simple as I've been saying, but the first creatures that evolved

07:30.560 --> 07:38.080
feeling, they weren't verbal, so they wouldn't have been able to say what I'm now going to say,

07:38.080 --> 07:44.320
but it's as if their feelings say, I feel like this, you know, it tells you how you're doing,

07:44.320 --> 07:52.720
and then secondarily, it's a matter of I feel like this about that, and so feeling gets extended onto

07:52.720 --> 07:58.960
perception and cognition, so because you have to develop policies about what you're going to do,

07:59.760 --> 08:06.880
and so affect is the fundamental form of consciousness, which then gets extended onto

08:06.880 --> 08:14.400
cognitive and perceptual consciousness, which gives rise to the forms that dominate our

08:15.040 --> 08:23.280
conscious experience, and because our capacity to plan and think about what we're going to do is so

08:23.280 --> 08:29.840
highly developed. The second part of your question, you know, about how does this happen, well I've

08:29.840 --> 08:37.280
partly described the mechanisms of how it happens, but if you're asking about the hard problem,

08:37.280 --> 08:44.880
in other words, you know, how does physical, physiological processes of the kind that I've

08:44.880 --> 08:53.440
just described, how do they turn into, how do they somehow transform into subjective experiences,

08:53.440 --> 08:56.720
that's another story, so you'll have to tell me if you want me to go into that.

08:57.520 --> 09:03.120
I think, look, okay, there's so much to touch on, I mean, first of all, I just want the listeners,

09:03.120 --> 09:07.200
or for the viewers, we're both in South Africa, this is quite cool because it's the first time

09:07.200 --> 09:12.400
I'm actually chatting to someone in the same time zone, we're both in Cape Town, and just for

09:12.400 --> 09:16.320
everyone who's wondering why the screens are so dark on your side, it's because in South Africa,

09:16.320 --> 09:22.720
we have what's called low chatting, our country just does not give us electricity every now and then,

09:22.720 --> 09:28.320
so Mark's unfortunately on the one side of it right now, just for some context for the viewers,

09:28.320 --> 09:33.520
but okay Mark, let's go to the hard problem, I mean, I've read The Hidden Spring, I mean,

09:33.520 --> 09:37.520
I've read The Neuropsychology of Dreams, your writing is very fascinating, I like the way you're

09:37.520 --> 09:44.240
sort of blending neuropsychology, neuropsychoanalysis into neurobiology and trying to link these

09:44.240 --> 09:50.640
fields together, so you're definitely working at that interface between mind and body, so let's

09:50.640 --> 09:54.960
discuss the hard problem, what are your thoughts on this hard problem of consciousness, is there a

09:54.960 --> 10:00.000
problem, I mean this podcast is called Mind, Body, Problem, Solution, because the aim is to find a

10:00.000 --> 10:06.320
solution to this problem, do you think we're able to find it using what your theory sort of claims?

10:08.720 --> 10:15.520
Well, I don't claim to have solved the hard problem, but I do claim to have given us a

10:15.520 --> 10:23.200
hint as to what direction we need to go in in order to be able to do so, so let me unpack

10:23.760 --> 10:31.120
that story, I could do it in two ways, let me preface it with the first way and then I'll come

10:31.120 --> 10:38.640
to the second way which I'll tell you in more detail, I think that the hard problem arose

10:39.280 --> 10:47.280
because we focused on visual perception as our model example of consciousness, in fact I might

10:47.280 --> 10:52.480
go further and say we focused on human visual perception as our model example of consciousness

10:54.320 --> 11:04.880
and of course conscious vision has everything to do with cortex, so I might sort of you have to

11:04.880 --> 11:13.680
start somewhere, so let's start with Francis Crick's famous book from 1994, it was called

11:15.360 --> 11:25.040
The Astonishing Hypothesis and the subtitle was The Scientific Search for the Soul and there he

11:25.840 --> 11:35.840
explicated a methodological program as to how we might go about sort of saving

11:36.720 --> 11:43.040
the problem of consciousness from philosophy, rescuing it and bringing it into international

11:43.040 --> 11:50.720
science and he proposed this concept of the neural correlate of consciousness, he said all we need to

11:50.720 --> 11:57.840
do, consciousness is nothing special, it's just another biological function, all we need to do

11:57.840 --> 12:04.000
is find the anatomical and physiological substrate of this function, in other words we need to identify

12:04.000 --> 12:11.040
its neural correlate, we need to then once we've isolated that correlate we can start seeing okay

12:11.040 --> 12:17.440
well how does this thing work because this must somehow explain why there's something it's like

12:17.440 --> 12:26.640
to be you and me, it's a sort of reasonable commonsensical reductionist strategy but the

12:26.640 --> 12:36.720
unfortunate choice as I just said is that he focused on human vision and I say it's unfortunate but

12:36.720 --> 12:43.120
it's not difficult to understand why, I mean human consciousness is dominated by visual perception

12:43.520 --> 12:53.840
and also more cortex is given over to visual perception than any other form and we understand

12:53.840 --> 13:01.920
it rather well so it seemed like a reasonable place to start, why I think it was an unfortunate

13:01.920 --> 13:08.480
place to start is first of all you shouldn't start with human beings the most complex form of

13:08.480 --> 13:22.400
consciousness and you know cortex is many, this is more fundamental point, the function of visual

13:22.400 --> 13:30.400
perception does not require consciousness, you can have visual perception without consciousness

13:30.640 --> 13:42.400
so when the very next year after Crick's book was published came David Chalmers's famous paper

13:42.400 --> 13:48.560
in the Journal of Consciousness Studies where he said well you know why doesn't all this information

13:48.560 --> 13:55.760
processing go on in the dark and etc, I don't need to tell you what he said but I think it was a

13:55.760 --> 14:01.360
reasonable question from Chalmers precisely because visual information processing can go on in the

14:01.360 --> 14:10.400
dark so it is mysterious why do we why does it have to feel like anything at all, we know that

14:10.400 --> 14:17.520
not only the superior curriculae can see unconsciously but you know the visual cortex can

14:17.520 --> 14:26.080
see unconsciously and it can discriminate things like pretty elaborate things like color

14:26.080 --> 14:31.920
you know you can you can discriminate color unconsciously so why does it have to be something

14:31.920 --> 14:40.080
it is like to experience red versus blue if you can discriminate them without experience

14:40.480 --> 14:49.680
now that I do not believe applies to feelings you can't have a feeling without feeling it

14:50.480 --> 14:57.600
and I've just explained to you why we feel our feelings it is it is a it is a necessarily

14:58.320 --> 15:05.600
subjective monitoring of my own state with existential consequences for me

15:06.400 --> 15:13.760
and it has to have this goodness and badness has to have value and it has to have a categorical

15:14.400 --> 15:20.320
qualitative differences so you know had we started there had we started with affects

15:20.320 --> 15:26.560
which are not generated cortically and that's another big story they are generated they are

15:26.560 --> 15:33.280
generated in the in the midbrain for the most part but certainly they are generated subcortically

15:33.280 --> 15:40.560
in general had we started with those much more ancient much simpler structures

15:41.280 --> 15:47.760
and I think that the hard problem would never really have arisen I think it's you know to say

15:47.760 --> 15:56.080
why must you feel pain you know why must you feel hunger this is mysterious why don't you have

15:56.080 --> 16:02.240
why don't you unconsciously navigate uncertainty and make choices of existential consequences

16:02.240 --> 16:07.360
within qualitatively distinctive variables and it's just you know just is when you describe

16:07.360 --> 16:13.920
that function you're just describing a feeling and feelings as I said feelings have to feel like

16:13.920 --> 16:20.880
something unlike visual perception which does not have to so that's the the first I said I'm

16:20.880 --> 16:27.120
going to tell the story in two parts that's the that's the the first part but let me now move

16:27.120 --> 16:32.560
from neuroscience to to a more sort of philosophical perspective on this thing

16:33.520 --> 16:42.640
and I said the question the hard problem put in its most basic form you know is as so put it you

16:42.640 --> 16:50.640
know how how does the brain get over the hump from electrochemistry to feeling and how do electrochemical

16:50.640 --> 16:55.920
processes turn into feelings literally turn into them you know what kind of weird metaphysical

16:55.920 --> 17:04.960
transduction occurs there and and and here I think the problem is that the the the physiological

17:04.960 --> 17:13.520
processes do not turn into experiences I think this is remember I'm saying this is a philosophical

17:13.520 --> 17:20.480
perspective yes I think it's a matter of observational perspective on point of view so

17:21.200 --> 17:32.800
um no if you if you look at the processes going on in my brain when I am feeling let us say

17:33.760 --> 17:41.280
excitedly motivated you will see activation of mesocortical mesolambic dopamine circuitry

17:41.840 --> 17:48.720
and you literally will see it if you for example put me in a positron emission scanner you will see

17:49.200 --> 17:56.160
that circuitry lighting up and you can you can use all sorts of methods to you know drill down

17:56.160 --> 18:01.600
into what exactly is going on physiologically there but that's looking at me from the outside

18:01.600 --> 18:06.800
I mean you are now looking at me in the dark from the outside and you're seeing a body

18:07.840 --> 18:14.000
and you can then you know you can start scanning this body and you can see in in more granular

18:14.000 --> 18:18.800
detail what's going on within it but the the crucial issue is you're taking an external

18:18.800 --> 18:26.160
observational perspective on me I on the other hand have another observational perspective on me

18:26.160 --> 18:33.280
that is being me I am me so I have another perspective which is the subjective mark songs

18:33.280 --> 18:39.600
as a subject as opposed to mark songs as an object so I can look at myself in the mirror

18:39.600 --> 18:45.200
and I recognize oh yeah that guy's me it's mark songs but I could also when I first wake up in

18:45.200 --> 18:52.160
the morning before I've even opened my eyes I can have this dawning subjective experience of being

18:52.160 --> 18:59.520
me and that's can only be described as my mind then I stagger over to the bathroom look at myself

18:59.520 --> 19:06.160
in the mirror and that's my body but both of them are me so you know they're not two of them

19:06.160 --> 19:11.520
there's only one of them there's only one mark songs it's just that we're observing

19:11.520 --> 19:19.840
him from two different perspectives so so to say how does how does my subjective experience of being

19:19.840 --> 19:26.080
me produce the physical or I should rather put it the other way around how does the physiological

19:27.120 --> 19:34.160
embodied version of me produce the subjective experience of me is like asking you know how

19:34.160 --> 19:39.920
does something objective produce something subjective objectivity doesn't do subjectivity

19:39.920 --> 19:48.240
they're two different perspectives um now the if we are one and the same thing you know then

19:49.360 --> 19:54.480
it's like actually let me use another analogy lightning and thunder you know with you with

19:54.480 --> 20:00.560
your ears you hear a clap of thunder with your eyes you see a flash of lightning

20:00.640 --> 20:07.760
that they're two different things you know the they're utterly different perceptions

20:08.480 --> 20:12.960
but but they're not they're not actually two different things they're two different manifest

20:12.960 --> 20:18.320
depends what perceptual perspective you take on is it an auditory perspective or is it a visual

20:18.320 --> 20:24.480
perspective we don't ask it would be unreasonable to ask how does lightning turn into thunder

20:24.560 --> 20:30.960
you know we realize these are two different ways of of of perceiving the same underlying process

20:31.680 --> 20:37.680
and then we ask what is that underlying process and then we start going into physics

20:38.400 --> 20:46.320
and we start speaking about you know georelectrical potential differences in the atmosphere

20:46.320 --> 20:52.480
and you know and that's the ultimate description of what's going on the ultimate description

20:52.480 --> 20:59.360
is of the causal mechanisms that we infer from the observational the observable data

20:59.360 --> 21:06.320
and that's how we come up with the basic theory a basic and a fundamental science of lightning

21:06.320 --> 21:13.440
and thunder um you know which is the theory of electricity um and and I think that that's what

21:13.440 --> 21:21.440
we need um in in neuroscience or neuropsychology if we're going to bridge the divide between the

21:21.440 --> 21:27.440
psychological and the neurological between the subjective and the objective perspectives

21:27.440 --> 21:34.960
on the being of a creature then we need to find a more fundamental language which explains

21:34.960 --> 21:41.200
both both sets of phenomena we don't we don't want to ask how does the one set of phenomena

21:41.200 --> 21:47.280
cause the other set of phenomena because they don't so what I'm saying in essence is that

21:47.280 --> 21:54.160
the hard problem is made a lot harder than it has to be uh if we if we conceptualize it

21:54.160 --> 22:00.800
that way if we ask the question how do how does the brain get over the pump from electrochemistry

22:00.800 --> 22:06.560
to feeling it's it's it's a question that can't be answered because it's wrongly framed um

22:07.200 --> 22:13.920
but if we ask you know what is it that produces both the electrochemistry and what explains

22:13.920 --> 22:20.800
the behavior of the electrochemistry and the behavior of the feeling then we then we have a

22:20.800 --> 22:30.400
mechanistic theory and and I I think that um the the prospects of finding such a mechanistic theory

22:30.400 --> 22:38.400
are greatly increased by shifting our focus away from these very complicated visual perceptual

22:38.400 --> 22:44.400
processes which as I've already said uh these cortical processes are way down the evolutionary

22:44.400 --> 22:51.840
line uh they're much later developments they're a secondary application um of what feeling is for

22:51.840 --> 22:58.320
and what feeling does and focus instead on the primary form of feeling in the brain stem which

22:58.320 --> 23:05.040
is as I've also already said an extended form of homeostasis then we say okay so we have a

23:05.040 --> 23:11.200
fairly good clue as to what the mechanism is that we're looking for uh it's it's homeostasis with

23:11.200 --> 23:21.520
some version of homeostasis and I I think from that starting point uh obviously there's a lot

23:21.520 --> 23:28.480
more that could be said about okay so then how do we do it how how does uh homeostasis mechanistically

23:29.040 --> 23:35.680
how does it explain the behavior of the predictive brain and how does it explain

23:36.240 --> 23:43.920
the experience of being an of an intentional being with with with with calls and and aims

23:43.920 --> 23:51.440
and purposes and so on I think that from that starting point it can be done um and my my own

23:51.440 --> 23:59.280
efforts in this area have been have been along those lines trying to trying to begin to um

24:00.000 --> 24:11.280
sketch what what what what this what this uh this monist uh um mechanistic uh um causal

24:11.280 --> 24:20.320
explanatory process might be whereby uh we we have the the particular physiology of consciousness

24:20.320 --> 24:25.920
and the particular phenomenology of it I'm glad you you just mentioned monist and asked because I

24:25.920 --> 24:30.160
was thinking I mean we spoke about some of the history of philosophy we we spoke about David

24:30.160 --> 24:36.640
Chalmers and his 1995 paper I mean do you think Descartes-René Descartes when he started this this

24:36.640 --> 24:40.720
question of this mind-body problem when he started with this dualistic approach do you think that

24:40.720 --> 24:46.480
also had a big impact on the way we perceived this problem in the first place very much so

24:47.440 --> 24:53.600
and and David Chalmers makes little uh secret of his admiration for Descartes

24:55.040 --> 25:04.080
I I think yeah I mean I I I wholly concur with the title of Demasio's famous book Descartes' Error

25:04.640 --> 25:12.560
it was a horrendous error so so the the philosophy that I find myself much more sympathetic with

25:12.560 --> 25:19.840
is is is that of of Spinoza uh that that I think is a great advance over Descartes

25:21.840 --> 25:26.160
um I'm actually going to chat to Demasio about in a couple days so I'm very

25:26.160 --> 25:32.000
looking I'm looking forward to that but Mark seem to be my best wishes I'll definitely like him very

25:32.000 --> 25:37.040
much yeah so I'm looking forward to discussing Descartes' Error in quite a bit of detail well

25:37.040 --> 25:41.760
when you're looking at this brain stem you're looking at this midbrain you're talking about

25:41.840 --> 25:46.640
ancient consciousness I know sometimes because the main goal of this podcast is for me to provide

25:46.640 --> 25:53.040
you someone who has a an excellent new thought process on this problem to explain their view

25:53.040 --> 25:58.880
express themselves openly and to also address any objections people might have or to their theory

25:58.880 --> 26:04.640
but when when you talk about the ancient brain you feel that's giving people a sort of a misconception

26:04.640 --> 26:10.560
on what you mean by ancient consciousness because I feel like I've I've read blogs I've read a

26:10.560 --> 26:15.520
couple things where people think you're taking it too far I've talked to some scientists about it

26:15.520 --> 26:20.720
some some philosophers and they think you're taking it too low but yet you're explaining

26:20.720 --> 26:26.560
exactly why the cortical versions of this are not the same do you think that they're mistaken

26:26.560 --> 26:37.200
consciousness with intelligence I do I do very much so think that uh although um I don't deny

26:37.920 --> 26:45.600
uh that very simple creatures like a bacterium has an intelligence it's obviously in it's nothing

26:45.600 --> 26:54.960
like our intelligence and it's it's a it's a perfectly understandable state of affairs

26:54.960 --> 27:02.240
that we start with human consciousness well we are human for one thing for another thing the

27:02.240 --> 27:08.640
problem of other minds dictates that the only form of consciousness we can ever observe directly

27:08.640 --> 27:14.480
is our own so you know it's it's it's not an unreasonable place to start it's not it's not

27:14.480 --> 27:21.680
hard to understand why we began there but it's quite a different thing to say that therefore

27:21.680 --> 27:27.840
human consciousness is the definitional form you know that anything which doesn't conform

27:27.840 --> 27:36.400
to our type of consciousness isn't really consciousness um you you started this podcast

27:36.400 --> 27:44.560
by asking me the question why is there something it is like to be me that is uh of course charmer's

27:44.560 --> 27:52.800
definition building upon tom nagel's definition from 1974 um it's notoriously difficult to get

27:52.960 --> 27:58.160
a neuroscientist or for that matter anyone to agree on a definition of consciousness

27:58.160 --> 28:06.240
but I think if there's one definition that has more or less uh united us it is that it is something

28:06.240 --> 28:12.000
it is likeness you know it's it is parliad that's what we mean by consciousness and so there's nothing

28:13.360 --> 28:21.360
there's nothing complicated about that it doesn't it doesn't have anything more in common

28:21.360 --> 28:32.240
with Descartes thinking uh cogito ergo sum than it does uh in common with the the the the raw

28:32.240 --> 28:40.240
feel of pain you know there is something it is like to feel pain so when you say I'm going too far

28:42.800 --> 28:49.840
philosophically speaking all I'm saying is I want to stop I want to I want to define consciousness

28:49.840 --> 28:56.640
as as something it is like to be in that there is something it is like to be in that state

28:57.360 --> 29:03.120
and that's not a controversial definition of consciousness and then I'm saying well there

29:03.120 --> 29:10.960
is something it is like to be in pre-verbal non-verbal uh states of raw ethic like pain

29:10.960 --> 29:17.840
I find it very hard to to imagine how anyone could argue against that you know there is

29:17.840 --> 29:24.080
something it is like to be to be hungry there's something it is like to be thirsty this there's

29:24.080 --> 29:29.120
something it is like to be in pain there's something it is like to experience separation

29:29.120 --> 29:34.720
distress with which all mammals experience and display um there's something it is like to feel

29:34.720 --> 29:42.560
fear and you know and you don't need to be able to reflect upon the source of your pain it's a very

29:43.360 --> 29:49.840
very great advantage to be able to but you don't have to have any theory of pain or any

29:49.840 --> 29:56.720
explanation of pain or any knowledge of pain as mechanisms etc or even just know anything about

29:56.720 --> 30:02.880
what caused me to feel this all you just need to know is I feel it that's that is that is I think

30:02.880 --> 30:12.640
a very defendable position that that's what we mean fundamentally by a conscious state

30:13.200 --> 30:20.400
um you know I I grant of course that these higher forms of consciousness add all kinds of

30:20.400 --> 30:27.600
bells and whistles and uh I'm very grateful to be the proud possessor of all of those bells

30:27.600 --> 30:32.080
and whistles and I don't want to forego them you know so therefore I'm well aware that they

30:32.080 --> 30:38.160
add a hell of a lot more but I don't think it's the right place to start if you're wanting to

30:38.160 --> 30:46.640
understand the basic mechanism whereby something it is likeness appeared on this planet you know

30:46.640 --> 30:53.120
how it how and why it evolved that that creatures started to quote Tom Nagel he said

30:54.160 --> 31:00.480
that something like I'm paraphrasing but he said an organism is only conscious if there is

31:00.480 --> 31:05.520
something it is like to be the organism something it is like for the organism you know that's

31:05.520 --> 31:13.200
that's that's a compelling definition for me of what consciousness is and and and it makes

31:14.080 --> 31:19.920
mean in terms of everything else we do in biology you know we take an evolutionary perspective we

31:19.920 --> 31:25.440
we try and understand you know what this thing how this thing evolved why this thing evolved what

31:25.440 --> 31:32.080
does it add what does it do that's why once it once it evolves it gets it gets conserved because

31:32.080 --> 31:39.440
it continues to perform that function and that function bestows such enormous additional

31:40.320 --> 31:48.800
survival potential that that it just hangs around now you've got to look at the arguments

31:50.080 --> 31:54.240
so I've just given you in principle arguments about why I think that's a

31:54.240 --> 32:01.680
fine place to start it's in fact to me the obvious place to start although I can understand

32:02.640 --> 32:08.320
why we started in another place I think that it was a mistake in retrospect and now we can

32:08.320 --> 32:14.320
correct that mistake and start in a better place but it's not just a matter of principles

32:14.320 --> 32:22.240
you know it's a matter it's also an empirical matter when you start looking scientifically

32:22.720 --> 32:31.120
at what is the minimal architecture for for consciousness you you know you

32:32.480 --> 32:38.720
and you know you you you can start with human beings even you know if you if you produce

32:40.000 --> 32:48.720
not deliberately so let me rather say if it so happens that you suffer a lesion

32:49.680 --> 32:58.080
in the reticular activating system that lesion can be as small as two millimeters cubed in other

32:58.080 --> 33:03.280
words the size of a match head if it's in the peri-brachial complex the right part of the

33:03.280 --> 33:12.960
peri-brachial complex that will produce a coma in in any and in every human being you the the

33:12.960 --> 33:21.440
fish's meta fish's analysis of all of the scans of stroke trying to identify what is the small

33:21.440 --> 33:28.880
what is the common denominator what area is always lesion in patients in coma it's the

33:28.880 --> 33:34.800
it's it's a it's a small two cubic two cubic millimeter area of the peri-brachial complex

33:34.800 --> 33:42.160
so that wipes out something it is likeness reliably you know I mean you can at my prediction

33:42.160 --> 33:48.880
is lesion that area the animal will go into a coma bingo it always happens the prediction

33:48.880 --> 33:57.920
is confirmed each and every time now by contrast what about the cerebral cortex the cerebral cortex

33:57.920 --> 34:06.080
in fact since the 1880s where has been removed in experimental animals with gay abandon and

34:06.720 --> 34:13.040
even in the 1880s it was already observed that goats for example did it in dogs the dogs didn't

34:13.040 --> 34:20.720
go into a coma they just they became what goats described as idiotish in other words they became

34:20.720 --> 34:25.600
stupid they they lost their they lost their knowledge their understanding of the world

34:26.800 --> 34:34.480
but they still behaved you know purposeively they they they behave and I'm telling you about

34:34.480 --> 34:43.120
goats but since then for decades you know a decortication has been performed on on innumerable

34:43.120 --> 34:49.760
mammal species and the opposite if it's done neonately you know the the the observation is

34:49.760 --> 35:00.400
always the same that they they play they show fear they get enraged in situationally appropriate

35:01.040 --> 35:12.000
ways they copulate with each other they rear little little pups to maturity I mean not perfectly

35:12.000 --> 35:17.920
but they do they play they hang from bars they swing around you know they they in fact yark

35:17.920 --> 35:27.360
pangsit used to he performed a little sort of an experiment it's not really an experiment but

35:27.360 --> 35:34.000
each of his new cohort of graduate students he would show them two groups of rats in two

35:34.000 --> 35:40.800
different cages the one group had been decorticated and the other group had had a sham decortication

35:40.800 --> 35:44.880
in other words they had the little bandage on their heads but but they they hadn't had the

35:44.880 --> 35:51.520
operation and he asked them which of these two groups has no cortex and and every year he had

35:51.680 --> 35:58.560
the same result you know that the students identified the animals that were were were intact

35:58.560 --> 36:04.480
as being the decorticate ones and he said why and they said because the other ones are more lively

36:04.480 --> 36:11.680
in other words in reality the decorticate rodents are more lively they're more emotionally expressive

36:11.680 --> 36:17.120
that's because they don't have the cortical modulation of the but now we're talking about

36:17.600 --> 36:25.520
rodents and and dogs and what more what about human beings if the cortex was the seat of consciousness

36:25.520 --> 36:32.880
then there's a easy prediction which is that you know just we don't do neonatal decortication

36:32.880 --> 36:40.000
in human beings but sadly they are neonates who are born with no cortex and this is a condition

36:40.000 --> 36:46.480
known as hydrogen and cephalin and the prediction would be if the cortex was the seat of consciousness

36:46.480 --> 36:52.080
that these kids should be in a coma they got no cortex and at the very least

36:53.040 --> 37:00.400
they should be in a in a persistent vegetative state but that's not what you observe they are

37:00.400 --> 37:08.720
not vegetative you know the vegetative state is also called non-responsive wakefulness non-responsive

37:08.720 --> 37:15.600
wakefulness these kids are utterly responsive they and just as I described for the for the

37:16.000 --> 37:22.480
animal studies they are responsive they are emotionally responsive in situationally

37:22.480 --> 37:28.400
appropriate ways in other words you tickle the child she laughs you frustrate the child she

37:28.400 --> 37:34.400
arches her back and complains you give the child a fright and she startles and and they show

37:34.400 --> 37:39.840
behavioral initiative they they approach things that they like and they avoid things that they

37:39.840 --> 37:47.200
don't like you know anybody who has anybody who has studied these children seriously

37:48.560 --> 37:55.440
you know they they come to this conclusion and people philosophers you know who are all

37:55.440 --> 38:01.200
skeptical about this I really invite them to just interact with these kids you know it's it's just

38:01.200 --> 38:08.080
it's it's it's very very difficult to sustain the argument so so I was saying it's it's very

38:08.080 --> 38:13.120
hard to sustain the argument that these kids are not conscious if you actually interact with them

38:13.760 --> 38:19.040
but you know it is ultimately because of the problem of other minds it's ultimately

38:19.040 --> 38:28.560
a matter of of inference and what my colleagues say I mean when I say colleagues here I'm not

38:28.560 --> 38:35.200
only referring to philosophers there are many neuroscientists who who are very skeptical about

38:35.200 --> 38:45.200
the claim the claim by I hasten to add not only me you know a good many of us who actually have

38:45.200 --> 38:50.880
interacted with these kids find it very hard to believe that they're not conscious they are

38:50.880 --> 38:56.240
feeling creatures who behave in every way like feeling creatures the the argument that is made

38:56.240 --> 39:04.800
against this is we cannot know for sure that they are not just reflexes yes well remember

39:04.800 --> 39:09.840
what I said about reflexes at the beginning of our discussion you know in reflexes there's an

39:09.840 --> 39:17.040
entirely predictable response there's no variation there's no trial and error there's no intentionality

39:17.680 --> 39:22.240
you know this is not what you see in these kids it's also not what you see in the deco ticket

39:22.240 --> 39:29.680
animals so it's it's you know anyone who knows anything about how the reflexes of the nervous

39:29.680 --> 39:36.400
system work know that what you see here ain't reflexes or instincts you know they are not

39:36.400 --> 39:42.480
they are not reducible I mean they are dominated by instincts that's true these kids are you know

39:42.480 --> 39:49.840
they are not like you and me but they show they show goal directed intentional

39:50.400 --> 40:00.000
purpose of and voluntary behavior and if you read the the descriptions by the pediatric neurologists

40:00.000 --> 40:05.360
who studied these kids and the neuroscientists who studied these kids you see you know the

40:05.360 --> 40:14.960
detailed evidence for that but you can't be sure say my colleagues so let me just hasten to add

40:14.960 --> 40:21.040
you can't be sure that your pet dog is conscious you can't be sure that your pet cat is conscious

40:21.760 --> 40:27.280
you can't be sure that anyone other than you yourself are conscious and then the argument

40:27.280 --> 40:35.440
is given well reportability gets us out of that problem you know it's true that our dogs and cats

40:36.160 --> 40:40.960
can't report their conscious state so there's room for skepticism there you know but

40:40.960 --> 40:45.680
Tevin Naidu and Mark Solms can say there's something it is like to be me let me tell you

40:45.680 --> 40:51.200
what I'm experiencing right now I'm experiencing x y and z I don't know why that's considered such

40:51.200 --> 40:59.680
wonderful evidence you know because a robot can do that a robot can report its states

40:59.680 --> 41:03.440
you know you can write a very simple program just say you know whenever you're in this that

41:03.440 --> 41:09.360
or the other mode say I'm experiencing it but how do you know it really is experiencing

41:09.360 --> 41:16.320
so I don't think reportability is I mean by the way on the reportability thing we're saying not

41:16.320 --> 41:20.880
only that our dogs and cats aren't conscious we're saying that our preverbal kids aren't conscious

41:20.880 --> 41:29.040
humans you know exactly so we need better we need we need better ways of deciding the question

41:30.160 --> 41:35.040
when you go on the internet and you're trying to access something and it wants to know that you're

41:35.040 --> 41:40.320
not a robot it doesn't say please tell me please declare you're not a robot you know it gives you

41:40.320 --> 41:46.640
an ambiguous situation a problem and you have to navigate some uncertainty there and solve the

41:46.640 --> 41:54.640
problem you know why why why is that the case what if declaring your states you know was was

41:54.640 --> 42:02.160
such a wonderful method for determining that does seem to be the case sorry did you want to add to

42:03.120 --> 42:07.680
that before well sadly I have a lot to add to it so let me rather let you get a word in

42:07.680 --> 42:13.120
eduism then I'll carry on no you can continue I'm enjoying listening so that's why so what I do

42:13.120 --> 42:19.440
what I say to my colleagues is okay well let's take you know you guys don't claim that the

42:19.440 --> 42:26.480
whole of cortex is the seat of consciousness the the the general view is you know that there's

42:26.960 --> 42:33.760
all this information processing going on there which is then accessed by some sort of overarching

42:34.720 --> 42:41.280
global workspace or or something of the kind and where is this thing located well the standard

42:41.280 --> 42:50.960
argument is prefrontal cortex the the other well known or widely held position which is I think

42:51.680 --> 42:57.680
probably a better one is that it's insular cortex I why say better because insular cortex

42:57.680 --> 43:03.200
has to do with feelings which I've already told you is the basic in my view form of consciousness

43:03.920 --> 43:12.400
but if the prefrontal cortex were and many people say this I mean my dear colleague and friend Joe

43:12.400 --> 43:18.400
the dude says that that all of this stuff you know he's an expert on sub cortical

43:19.680 --> 43:27.920
affective circuitry specifically fear circuitry and and specifically the amygdala and he says

43:27.920 --> 43:34.560
all of that stuff going on the amygdala is unconscious until it is until it is read out

43:34.560 --> 43:40.240
by the cortex literally he uses the word label you know in other words until you use until

43:40.240 --> 43:47.760
you can have this concept I am feeling fear you're not feeling fear so so what happens

43:47.760 --> 43:54.240
if you remove again we don't do it experimentally but it happens in nature that they are patients

43:54.240 --> 43:59.680
with no prefrontal cortex in fact I'll tell you it's not unusual to have patients with large

43:59.680 --> 44:05.840
prefrontal cortical lesions on Joe the dude's view they should be less affective they should be

44:05.840 --> 44:12.480
less emotional consciousness but there's more I mean since since Phineas gauge we've learned

44:12.480 --> 44:22.560
frontal patients have too much emotion but I have a patient case W who has no prefrontal cortex

44:22.560 --> 44:29.200
whatsoever and he not only is he like all such patients or frontal patients you know he's a

44:29.200 --> 44:38.080
hyper emotional he's very overwhelmed by his feelings not only that but you know he he answers

44:38.080 --> 44:44.800
questions that I put to him about what is it like to be you I asked him to imagine a scene in his mind

44:44.800 --> 44:51.360
which had to do with I said imagine you have two dogs and one chicken can you picture them he says

44:51.360 --> 44:57.200
yes I said now tell me can you count their legs and tell me what the total number of legs are

44:57.200 --> 45:02.800
and the answer of course is 10 two dogs and one chicken so to my great disappointment because I was

45:02.800 --> 45:07.680
trying to prove is there's somebody home you know he's there with mental imagery and he can

45:07.680 --> 45:14.560
and he can experience it to my great disappointment he said eight the answer was eight I said eight

45:14.560 --> 45:24.240
he said yes the dogs ate the chicken so you know no prefrontal cortex there's a sentient being there

45:24.880 --> 45:33.040
and Domazio reported a case patient B who had absolutely no insular cortex and the same thing

45:33.840 --> 45:38.640
Domazio interviewed him about you know and the patient keeps on referring to me and I and I yes

45:38.640 --> 45:45.200
of course I have a mind and yes I'm experiencing this and and Domazio's patient also had heightened

45:45.200 --> 45:51.520
affective feelings not a reduction in affect which is what but Craig's theory but Craig is the guy who

45:51.520 --> 45:57.520
said you know the insular is the is the is the seat of the fundamental form of consciousness

45:57.520 --> 46:04.240
feeling well Domazio showed that with no insular cortex you still have feeling I showed with no

46:04.240 --> 46:11.760
prefrontal cortex you still have feeling and you have sentient being reportable conscious states

46:11.760 --> 46:17.920
so then my colleagues say well it's due to the remaining cortex so you see I can't win because

46:17.920 --> 46:23.760
they say the case with no cortex they can't declare their states so therefore we don't know

46:23.760 --> 46:28.480
so I say careful let's take this with no prefrontal cortex they say well maybe it's posterior cortex

46:28.480 --> 46:35.120
take one with no posterior cortex well maybe it's anterior cortex so that's now I'm near the end of

46:35.120 --> 46:42.720
my argument which is that so let's look at other methods other than lesion methods so if if the

46:43.200 --> 46:49.280
feelings are actually generated in the subcortical structures I mean literally in in other words

46:49.280 --> 46:56.560
they're not being read out by cortex because everybody knows of course these affective mechanisms

46:56.560 --> 47:02.960
are subcortical but the idea is they're not conscious until they read out by cortex so

47:04.160 --> 47:12.080
if that were the case then if you if you take for example positron emission tomographic images

47:12.960 --> 47:19.040
of human beings who are in intense affective states which they can report so they say I am

47:19.040 --> 47:26.480
feeling really sad you know I am feeling absolutely joyous I am feeling trepidatiously

47:26.480 --> 47:32.880
fearful or I am feeling really angry each of those four states and I'm not just saying I am

47:32.880 --> 47:38.480
feeling I mean people who who really are in the grip of intense affects if you scan them

47:39.120 --> 47:46.080
with pet imaging what is the prediction if it's if it's the if it's the brain stem

47:46.080 --> 47:53.040
and the and this limbic circuitry arising from it that is responsible for those effects

47:53.040 --> 47:57.040
then that's where you should see the highest rate of metabolic activity that's

47:57.040 --> 48:02.720
that's what we that that seems to be an acceptable method for everything else in neuroscience so

48:03.280 --> 48:10.880
you know so yeah we're saying well if the if the greatest if the if the hot spots are in the brain

48:10.880 --> 48:16.400
stem then that's where the state is being generated and that's exactly what you find

48:17.360 --> 48:25.760
if you if you image people in intense affective states you see intense arousal of brain upper

48:25.840 --> 48:33.360
brain stem structures and the circuits the olympic circuitry but not cortex you know now

48:33.360 --> 48:40.400
what about another method so in other words the prediction is confirmed yes now what about another

48:40.400 --> 48:48.240
method deep brain stimulation the the prediction is if the if the affects are generated in the

48:48.240 --> 48:53.760
brain stem you know then if you generate if you stimulate those structures that you are saying

48:53.760 --> 48:59.200
are generating the affects in other words reticular activating system the prediction is

48:59.200 --> 49:06.400
you will stimulate you will generate artificially an intense affect and and conversely you won't

49:06.400 --> 49:11.520
if you stimulate cortex and that's what happens you know you stimulate cortex you get just about

49:11.520 --> 49:15.520
no affects and when you do it's they really thought they're not affects they kind of like

49:15.520 --> 49:21.840
you know i'm remembering this time that i was a bit down you know but you stimulate this when i

49:21.840 --> 49:28.800
speak about a bit down stimulate substantia nigra you produce within five seconds depression

49:28.800 --> 49:35.440
clinical depression like suicidal depression you know and and you switch off the stimulator

49:35.440 --> 49:41.680
90 seconds later the person is out of the depression and i'm talking about reticular

49:41.680 --> 49:46.640
activating system but it's not only reticular activating system it's periaqueductal gray

49:47.280 --> 49:54.800
periaqueductal gray which is which is in the mid-brain there's a greater variety of affects

49:54.800 --> 49:59.920
generated by stimulating the periaqueductal gray than any other brain structure and the

49:59.920 --> 50:06.240
greater intensity of affect and so that's a third method so the lesion method you know

50:07.040 --> 50:13.280
you add it to the functional imaging method you add it to the to the deep brain stimulation

50:13.280 --> 50:21.840
method then there's also pharmacological probes you know if you it's no accident that the major

50:21.840 --> 50:29.520
psychiatric drugs the the the psychopharmacological agents that form the mainstay of of clinical

50:29.520 --> 50:37.520
practice these days they are like like antidepressants SSRIs what are they doing they are

50:37.520 --> 50:44.320
increasing serotonin where is serotonin sourced it's it's it's sourced in the reticular activating

50:44.320 --> 50:52.160
system in the rife nuclei where is where is dopamine you know antipsychotics block dopamine

50:52.160 --> 50:56.720
where's that sourced apart from the substantia nigra which i mentioned earlier the type that's

50:56.720 --> 51:01.680
important for psychosis is sourced in the ventral tegmental area which is part of the

51:01.680 --> 51:08.400
reticular active aging system noradrenaline is sourced in the locus cirrhulius complex you know

51:08.400 --> 51:15.840
you you modulate noradrenaline or you you you block noradrenaline to block anxiety so if these

51:15.840 --> 51:24.320
nuclei you know are are the targets or at least the the the the the source cells of the neurons

51:24.320 --> 51:30.640
that the cell bodies of the neurons that are targeted by all of these psychopharmacological

51:30.640 --> 51:36.080
agents but they they're all in the reticular activating system this tells us something you know

51:36.080 --> 51:41.920
so so i'm saying i'm sorry i'm speaking so much devon let me just come back to my to my main

51:41.920 --> 51:47.920
argument which is that it's not when people say moxons is going too far to say well you know

51:47.920 --> 51:54.480
these brainstem structures and simple effects are the model example of consciousness i told you

51:54.480 --> 52:00.160
in principle why i think effects are the right model example and then i said and empirically

52:00.160 --> 52:06.640
you know the you look at all of the evidence all of the evidence speaks to speaks for the

52:06.640 --> 52:13.600
conclusion that actually effects are generated there where in the part of the brain that we've

52:13.600 --> 52:22.720
known since 1949 is the is the basic prerequisite for all other forms of consciousness the only

52:22.720 --> 52:28.560
problem is in when magoon and maruzzi discovered that and nobody disputes it that it is prerequisite

52:28.560 --> 52:33.920
you can't have a conscious cortex unless it's activated by the reticular activating system

52:33.920 --> 52:39.360
yes but when they discovered that they said yes but the reticular activating system produces

52:40.320 --> 52:46.720
around produces what did they call it the level of consciousness yes a quantitative sort of like

52:46.720 --> 52:53.120
volume of consciousness but it hasn't got any phenomenal content and that's what i've just

52:53.120 --> 52:59.280
shown you isn't true you know it has phenomenal content the content i grant you is not cognitive

52:59.840 --> 53:04.880
but it is effective there's a there's something it is like to be in those states that i've just

53:04.880 --> 53:11.920
described therefore they are they are qualitative states they're not just quantitative states

53:12.720 --> 53:19.760
and they have content the content is you know the the the feeling of pain versus the feeling of

53:19.760 --> 53:24.640
hunger versus the feeling of sleepiness those that's that's the content that's what those states

53:24.640 --> 53:31.280
are about so if if the upper brain stem was was only about some quantitative dimension

53:31.280 --> 53:37.200
the level of consciousness it would only be of interest to an anesthetist yes but

53:37.840 --> 53:43.280
it's the characteristics of tinkering with those with those circuits so yes so there you have it

53:43.280 --> 53:47.920
in essence the youth i mean we've used this clinical differentiation between contents

53:47.920 --> 53:52.400
of consciousness versus a level of consciousness but you're clearly showing that in essence they're

53:52.400 --> 53:59.440
both very much linked i mean they're they're one in the same in a sense with whether you're

53:59.440 --> 54:04.160
whether your level of consciousness is slightly lower in terms of less the gcs scale doesn't

54:04.160 --> 54:10.160
necessarily mean that the person doesn't have effective qualitative experiences

54:11.680 --> 54:17.760
exactly so i find it's a very it's a totally artificial distinction there is no

54:17.760 --> 54:24.800
such thing as i mean how can you how can you have blank consciousness you know it's what is such a

54:24.800 --> 54:30.320
what is a blank consciousness so you know you can't be conscious without being conscious of

54:30.320 --> 54:36.800
something i mean we've known that since Brent Arno you know it's uh so i think that that's

54:36.800 --> 54:44.320
distinction drawn by Maguna and Maruti uh all those decades ago was because they were so

54:45.200 --> 54:51.120
completely flabbergasted by the finding which remember they weren't in any way expecting

54:51.840 --> 54:58.960
that if you disconnect the cat cortex from the cat reticular activating system there is no more

54:58.960 --> 55:05.520
conscious cat you know the the the the the the the the cortical consciousness cannot

55:06.480 --> 55:14.880
just just disappears without without reticular arousal and so it was a way because everybody

55:14.880 --> 55:20.640
knew that the cortex was the seat of consciousness they had to explain this somehow and so they

55:20.640 --> 55:29.280
came up with this totally artificial distinction between um this this waking state which is

55:29.280 --> 55:36.080
contentless um and you know and then the phenomenal qualities and and contents of

55:36.080 --> 55:41.680
that the cortex had i mean but that's what i like about your book as well is that you you do do that

55:41.680 --> 55:47.680
you show different methods of how you can prove this and predict what your theory claims that well

55:47.680 --> 55:52.080
because ideally that's what we want in the scientific theory of of anything you want so

55:52.080 --> 55:57.520
you want different ways of proving the same thing which is what you've basically shown in many ways

55:57.520 --> 56:03.280
what i find very fascinating mark is that others neuroscientists like let's say for example michael

56:03.280 --> 56:09.760
graziano he also pays a lot of attention to the tectum optic tectum which which we call the superior

56:09.760 --> 56:15.360
coliculus but then natural completely different conclusions they regarding i mean he uses this

56:15.360 --> 56:23.040
as the attention schema theory where we're building models of attention but we're not really um aware

56:23.040 --> 56:29.600
in the sense that we have qualia we rather introspectively conclude that we have this

56:29.600 --> 56:33.440
so i still find it quite fascinating that some people are using similar brain regions and

56:33.440 --> 56:38.160
brain structures and drawing different conclusions what are your thoughts on that yeah but but but

56:38.160 --> 56:45.920
let me clarify there um i am not uh i don't i don't disagree with that the the the the optic

56:45.920 --> 56:58.880
tectum or or or superior coliculi they they are they are receiving information from the sensory

56:58.880 --> 57:06.240
end organs sensory motor end organs but that doesn't mean that that information is conscious

57:07.920 --> 57:13.360
i mean the famous example is blindsight with with the cortically blind cases

57:14.160 --> 57:21.600
who nevertheless can navigate an obstacle course they are completely unaware that they're seeing

57:21.600 --> 57:28.800
anything and yet they can avoid things that are in their way and the the the the most widely accepted

57:28.800 --> 57:36.400
explanation for that is it's because the the the optic tectum is is is processing the information

57:36.400 --> 57:42.960
unconsciously i'm fine with that it's unconscious and and and it also receives auditory information

57:43.040 --> 57:51.840
and somatosensory information and so on um and uh the so these kids for example the the the the

57:51.840 --> 57:58.880
hydranin cephalic kids uh i the the reason they're able to respond to their environments is because

57:58.880 --> 58:08.080
they're receiving information about the environment from their sensory epithelium and but it is

58:08.080 --> 58:16.320
unconscious then they it evokes a feeling in them uh all they know all they experience on

58:16.320 --> 58:22.960
the evidence available to me it leads me to the conclusion that they i i don't think i can claim

58:22.960 --> 58:28.240
that they experience anything more than just a feeling they don't have to know what the feeling

58:28.240 --> 58:33.920
is about where it came from what made me feel this what is the thing out there in the world

58:33.920 --> 58:39.920
it it it's not necessary so i'm saying because remember the the the superior

58:39.920 --> 58:45.920
curriculae well well the the the whole of the tectum the superior and inferior curriculae the

58:45.920 --> 58:55.840
whole of the tectum uh is is absolutely adjacent to the periaqueductal gray so all of the well

58:55.840 --> 59:06.640
not smell but all of the other senses of projecting unconscious visual auditory somatosensory

59:06.640 --> 59:16.000
information to the to the tectum uh and that in turn uh is is coupled with uh all of the

59:16.000 --> 59:21.520
homeostatic mechanisms that we've mentioned at the beginning of our discussion all of the

59:21.520 --> 59:28.160
homeostatic mechanisms the affect mechanisms including the emotions because they are bodily

59:28.160 --> 59:35.840
affects and their emotional affects they all send their residual error signals to the periaqueductal

59:35.840 --> 59:42.720
gray immediately adjacent to the tectum so so it's it's something like it's something like

59:42.720 --> 59:50.480
you know where things where things stand now in the outside world which is not consciously

59:50.480 --> 59:59.120
registered uh and where things stand now uh from the from the endogenous perspective of the organism

59:59.920 --> 01:00:06.720
and and then uh the feeling is about those things but the feeling is all that the that

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:13.600
that the creature experiences you then need higher uh structures and the thalamocortical

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:20.480
structures make it possible for that feeling to be applied to a stabilized grip because the

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.280
tectum is just like a sort of salience map it's an attentional I agree with that description of it

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:33.920
but the cortex has the stabilized detailed mappings uh of it's not only that they detailed

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.360
mappings of the outside world filtered through a lifetime of experience of it because cortex is

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:46.080
memories memory space but it's also that it can be held in mind in working memories so you can

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.600
actually you know okay I feel like this about that so what am I going to do about it you know

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:58.320
that's that's what the cortical consciousness adds and and and and perhaps even more important than

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:06.320
that is that you can then manipulate those representations virtually in other words you

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:13.440
can you don't only have to feel your way through the world here and now by trial and error bearing

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:22.080
in mind that trial and error involves errors which are which are costly so so thinking where you have

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.520
virtual representations of if I were to do that what would happen and if I were to do the other

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.840
thing what would happen then and feeling you feel your way through these virtuals and all of this

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:41.280
is what cortex adds um and uh I keep on saying I'm very grateful to have that and I recognize that

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:48.400
that is a way more complex form of consciousness than the elementary form but for all the reasons

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.080
I've already said I think that the elementary form nevertheless is the right place to start

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.480
and the elementary form nevertheless qualifies as consciousness defined as there being something

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.520
it is like to have it what what I really like is that at some point I mean when you're talking

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.080
about homeostasis you're talking about how we're trying to figure this out and quantify a lot of

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:16.240
these qualitative experiences you that your work then somehow links with a lot of Karl Frister's work

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.960
and I mean Karl Frister is definitely one of the like most I mean he's the most cited neuroscientist

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.080
on the planet I think um and your work seems to coincide quite well do you want to touch on that

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.920
because I find that very intriguing the way you guys have linked up I read the paper that you guys

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.040
did together as well and I even used a part of my dissertation that you were very generous to

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:44.240
help me with uh but yeah let's touch on that a bit so I said earlier that uh I'm a dual aspect

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:52.400
monist in other words I think we have two different ways of observing uh the the the mental instrument

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:58.720
um you can look at it from the outside as as an organ uh you can look at it from the inside

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:08.000
as as a as a phenomenal state of mind but these two things are reducible to one causal mechanism

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:18.240
and that is something you infer from the data of of of observation and and I said that if you

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:25.360
if you accept that the elementary form of consciousness is feeling and that feeling

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:32.160
is an extended form of homeostasis then you have a rather simple mechanism you know you have a you

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.920
have a good place a tractable place to start because homeostasis is not difficult to understand

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:48.000
and so Karl Friston published a paper in 2013 in one of the journals of the royal society it's

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:56.320
called royal society interface and the paper was titled life as we know it and in which is a

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:07.600
wonderful title and and in that paper he basically explicated uh in in in ordinary you know physical

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:17.200
uh terms how by which I mean by which I mean you know physical mechanics how how does how

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:26.960
does homeostasis work um and so I said to him on upon reading that paper you know the the the

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:35.200
mechanism of of homeostasis which you so beautifully uh you know reduced to equations in in uh in that

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:41.760
paper if if consciousness is an extended form of homeostasis and by the way all those brains

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.840
then nuclear are not all of them but I mean the the fundamental homeostasis of the of the human

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:56.320
body are are are you know sort of like hypothalamus and midbrain and I said it should be possible to

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.960
extend then these these mechanistic accounts that you provide of homeostasis count of feeling

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:09.120
so that's what the paper that I wrote with him was about um so that's background uh to move a

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:15.920
little bit further forward so as everyone knows so I'm not going to go into this chapter inverse

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:24.240
Friston has has the flag that he's tied to his mast is the free energy principle

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:34.000
which is which is basically a statement of the the that self-organizing systems

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:41.680
systems which persist which continue to exist they have to do something to continue to exist

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.920
that this is this is what distinguishes I'm not saying all self-organizing systems are living

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.920
systems but what what but all living systems are self-organizing systems and what distinguishes

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.080
living systems from non-living ones is that they oppose the second law of thermodynamics in other

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:07.040
words they don't just dissipate they have they have they have preferred states and they work to stay

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:14.240
in those states and that's how they stay alive you know in the end the second law wins we don't

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:21.760
stay alive forever but you know the whole the essential feature of living systems is that they

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:28.240
are acting on their environments in such a way as to increase their chances of carrying on

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:35.280
existing as systems so the free energy principle is just a formalist a formal understanding of

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:42.640
the mechanisms whereby that work how self-organizing systems a resist entropy and by the way when I

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:49.440
said not all self-organizing systems are living systems that's a good thing because living systems

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.240
evolve from non-living systems you know so the fact that we can have a physics that explains

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:03.440
the this basic tycov system which then became the living system is a necessary thing you know we

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:10.080
have to be able to explain life in terms of things that were around before life came into existence

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:16.000
and by the way the same applies to consciousness we must be able to be conscious life evolved

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.080
long before consciousness evolved so you know there must be something it must have it must

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.320
have been constructed out of ingredients that were already there and I'm saying self-organizing

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:34.160
systems provide us with those ingredients so the free energy principle explains that how

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.680
self-organizing it formalizes the mechanisms whereby self-organizing systems in order to

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.120
continue to exist they have to minimize their free energy which is basically the same thing as to say

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:51.360
they have to have a model of the world because how else can you act in that world to to to

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.920
maximize your chances of surviving so it's a predictive model it's a model that if I were to

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.680
do that in the world this would be the sensory consequences that's how I maintain homeostasis

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.640
say if my sensory state is I'm moving out of my homeostatic bounds I'm getting too hot

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:15.440
I'm getting too thirsty then I must do that I must get out of the kitchen or I must drink some

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:21.760
water you know that will bring me back into my viable bounds so that's the basic and and the

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.280
free energy principle says to the extent that what you predicted will happen in consequence of your

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:34.240
actions to the extent that it does not happen that's called surprise all average surprise all

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.440
basically is free energy in other words you must be using your energy you must bind your energy into

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:47.040
actions which lead to the outcomes that you require in order to survive free energy in other

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.720
words energy that is not being efficiently used must therefore be minimized in other words the

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.240
gap between you what you what you expect to flow from your actions and what actually flows from

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.920
your actions that gap must be minimized so that's the whole of Friston's work basically just boils

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.560
down to that I mean I don't want to diminish it it's absolutely genius you know but that principle

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:18.000
explains homeostasis and it explains the goal directed behavior is the allostatic

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.880
imperative you know in order to maintain within my homeostatic remain within my homeostatic

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.320
bounds I have to do things in the outside world and I have to have a good understanding of how the

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:36.720
outside world works in order for me to know what things to do and while I'm busy learning that

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.720
I make lots of mistakes and I slowly improve my predictive model in order to minimize those

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:49.520
mistakes that's what the whole of cognition is for and what is cognition therefore doing it is it is

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:58.080
serving the the the the free energy principle in other words it's minimizing homeostatic errors it

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:04.080
means that is in other words it is it is reversing negative effects and turning them into positive

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.560
effects that's so affect which is the demand for mental work is a demand for predictive work

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:18.960
and the predictive work is what our cognition is all about so I've given you a very broad brush

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.880
stroke sketch there but that's what we worked out together in that in that first paper that we wrote

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:32.320
together which I then expanded into my book it's showing that you know I said I don't believe that

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.040
we've solved the hard problem but I believe we've given a good clue as to which direction we should

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:45.440
be going in that is a monistic account it's a it's a it's a tractable quantifiable statistical

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:52.000
mechanical account of the the the machinery of the mind and brain which is an information

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.840
processing machinery in the service of minimizing free energy in order to maintain the organisms

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:06.640
within their viable bounds so that they can survive that's it so some more I mean like

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.480
you're taking a physicalist monist account of this what are your thoughts and then other theories

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.200
of consciousness in terms of philosophical theories let's take panpsychism for example

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:24.800
or idealism what are your thoughts on those types of theories I think panpsychism is a little easier

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:36.160
to deal with than idealism so let's start with the problem of other minds which is the big problem

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.080
when it comes to consciousness science it really is the because conscious states just

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:52.000
are subjective states you can only ever know your own so we start there this this this might be

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.640
considered a really simplistic argument against panpsychism but it's the one that I start with

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.880
I can't know whether computers are conscious and tables are conscious and walls are conscious and

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:10.720
rocks are conscious you know I do know I'm conscious so now am I conscious of everything

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:17.040
that's going on inside of me no I'm only conscious of things that are going inside of my brain

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.320
my brain the brain states are only the conscious of other bodily states to the extent that those

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.360
other bodily organs are represented in the brain so so the brain and this this is not just a

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.160
commonsensical argument it's an empirical demonstrable fact you never lose consciousness

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.280
by removing any part of the body other than removing the brain if you lose consciousness by

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.960
removing the heart it's because the heart is no longer perfusing the brain you know etc so it's

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.880
like clearly the case that consciousness is in the brain and so you know all of the other bodily

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:02.240
processes are not conscious I empirically I can tell you that in my own case you know there's the

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.200
only way I get to know about and there's a hell of a lot of processes which never become conscious

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:15.440
like blood pressure regulation for example you know it's going on all the time thank god for that

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.960
but you know there's no conscious why is there no consciousness involved in that by the way

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.000
it's because it's entirely predictable you can't leave that to reflexes you know there's

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.080
there's there's no novel situations there that you have to feel your way through

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:37.760
so panpsychism if you take if you take as your starting point well you know the only thing I can

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.400
know empirically is what I am conscious of well I know even in my own case there's a hell of a

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:53.040
lot going on within the outer surface of this thing called Mark's arms that Mark's arms is not

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.080
conscious of so you could start then saying well of course it is possible that your muscles are

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.120
conscious of themselves and they're not reporting it to you and then you know then you should start

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.760
getting into into Never Never Land because yeah that's possible I mean anything's possible

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:16.160
it's possible you know that you know that that pigs can fly but I've never seen one you know and

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:24.000
so you know that's my argument against panpsychism now I'll take that's a very simplistic argument

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.280
because it's and I start with that one because it's an empirical one it's the only empirical one

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.560
because you have to start in your own case even within the brain Tevin there's a hell of a lot

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:40.400
of brain activity brain structures which the activity of which we never become conscious of

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:47.680
you know so so consciousness seems to be something quite special limited to very particular kinds of

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:55.360
structures and so you know then I that's another argument another way of tackling the problem

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.680
of panpsychism is you say well let's look at the mechanism what these parts of the brain

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.280
that we know are generating conscious states like these homeostatic brain stem mechanisms

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:14.640
let's look at what you know what they're doing there's a very particular kind of functionality

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.520
there a very specific mechanism which is not you know you don't find it in everything there are

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:28.240
many things which exist which are not displaying active inference in other words they're not

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:35.360
trying to model their environments in order to in order to persist and you know if that is the

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.840
mechanism of the one and only knowable form of consciousness which is ours you know we we know

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:48.480
that the the brain stem mechanisms that generate our consciousness they seem to be doing this kind

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.240
of thing we can then look to every other creature that has similar mechanisms which by the way is

01:15:54.240 --> 01:16:01.200
all vertebrates and we can make testable predictions we can say I predict if I stimulate dorsal

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:09.280
periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish you know it it won't like it it will avoid the stimulus if I

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.520
stimulate the the ventral periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish it will like it and it will approach

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.600
the stimulus and the prediction is confirmed so you know that's that's that's and that happens

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.600
every time in every creature that has the same architecture as us that we know generates

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.280
affective basic feeling states in us all the evidence suggests that they're doing the same

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.880
thing in these other creatures and also that they can make choices you know the the behavior of the

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:44.480
animals is consistent with our understanding and then there are other creatures which don't have the

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:52.720
same architecture like cephalopods and insects and so on there I'm less sure that they're conscious

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.200
you know I'm not saying they're not I'm just less sure and I I use the criterion of well

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:05.280
can they make choices can they feel their way through a novel situation and survive it and

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:12.240
they can so you know well possibly they're conscious too but there are many creatures

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:19.760
simple simpler creatures like bacteria whose behavior is completely predictable there's you see

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:26.480
no new ideas coming from a bacterium you know the only way that they that they advance is is

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:34.240
through over generations through through natural selection you there's there's no there's no new

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:42.880
problem solving you know so I'm saying that even in living things Tevin starting with myself there

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:50.480
lots of my own bodily processes that I know from my own case are not conscious and then I know which

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:57.120
parts are generative of consciousness I know what those do roughly speaking I know what their

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:08.800
functionality is when I test in other animals the prediction arising from the the the inference

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:16.160
that those structures and that mechanism is what gives rise to two feelings the predictions are

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:24.560
always confirmed where those are not present in living creatures that those structures and those

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:31.360
functions the prediction again is always confirmed that they don't show the functionality that that

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:39.280
seems to underpin consciousness in us then you know that's so so compelling but then you know to go

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:46.560
from that to non-living things I mean to claim that non-living things are conscious it's you just

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.200
outside of the not only the bounds of testability you're outside of the bounds of reasonableness

01:18:53.200 --> 01:19:00.720
just like why would you say that and you know starting from the observables that's where that's

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.320
the conclusion you just have to arrive at if you start from first principles and you say well

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:13.760
it's possible that there's something it is like to be anything then well yeah it's possible

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:20.800
but anything's possible I don't see any reason why one would hold that view

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:27.200
unless one starts from the assumption that consciousness is a fundamental property of the

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:34.400
universe which I have to say is not not not different from the idea of God yeah that at the

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.800
time of the Big Bang there was a consciousness maybe but that's outside of science you know to

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.600
those kinds of claims that if you think about it that's something that people like Julia Tononi

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:52.320
and Christoph Koch have done fundamentally taking consciousness as phi they can't get as far as

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:59.840
fundamental and doing a lot of but I think they did it in a different way so so like let's take

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:09.680
Tononi's case as you've just said the the the idea that consciousness can be can be can be

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:19.360
objectified as as a quantity of of integrated information processing if you hold that theory

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:27.200
then it leads you down some some rabbit holes that you then have to go down you know because if you

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:34.000
say well okay the amount of integration in the information processing is what determines the

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.440
degree of consciousness then you have to say well there's no there's no you know as long as there's

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.120
any amount of information processing there must be some degree of consciousness and conversely

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:54.000
you have to say anything that has the requisite you know number must be conscious therefore

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:03.040
any highly integrated information processing system like the internet you know my theory

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:11.200
with me if I'm Tononi my theory requires me to say yep the internet's conscious yes so

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.880
fundamentally information at this point which is how a lot of people are seeing it

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:25.520
then in essence everything has a level of fire yes everything has that you know what's what's

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:33.120
what's a curious little historical fact is that charmers you know I'll tell you something

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.400
else which is another curious fact many people who bang on about the hard problem of consciousness

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:45.680
have never read charmers' paper you know if you actually read charmers' paper there's this thing

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.560
that I'm going to tell you now there's another thing which I'll tell you as an aside at the end

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.440
of the paper charmers says the hard problem is hard but there's no reason to believe that it will

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:03.280
forever remain insoluble and he then you know so he's saying it is soluble and and and he even goes

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.760
so far as to then present a possible solution and this is the thing I was going to say

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:19.920
his possible solution is that all information has a subjective aspect and that is consciousness

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.000
and it has an objective aspect which is this mechanistic thing that we see you know it depends

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.720
what kind of substrate you're using but like our computers there they are they're processing

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:37.280
information but the being of the computer says charmers you know because it's an information

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:43.040
processing device that there is some small amount of consciousness associated with it because the

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.440
internal aspect of information is consciousness therefore because information processing has

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.640
been going on since forever consciousness has been around since forever and it's a fundamental

01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.720
property of the universe so I don't want to lose sight of the aside I've made there please note

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.120
charmers says the hard problem can be solved he said it himself in 1995 so all these people who

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:13.520
revere this problem has been completely insoluble that it's a metaphysical problem which can never

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.680
be solved by physical science that's not what charmers said but he then proposes his own theory

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.720
which is a panpsychist theory which is when it's something approaching a panpsychist theory he

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:33.840
doesn't say everything is conscious he says all information is conscious which is a which is a

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:40.240
reasonable place to start because what we know about the brain and the mind what they have in

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:45.760
common is that they're processing information you know and not everything in the universe is

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:51.280
processing information so you know that's why it's approaches or heads in the direction of

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:58.640
but now here's the rub for me if you read so information in Shannon's sense

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.800
which is the sense in which charmers uses the word he actually says so in that paper

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:15.040
so Shannon's paper which brought information into the concept of information into into physics into

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:23.280
the idea that there's a quantifiable thing called information and that it has causal property

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:33.040
does stuff you know in the physical world that for that realization and conceptualization of it

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.360
we have to thank Claude Shannon and you read his paper which was published in if I remember

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:46.640
correctly 1948 it's called the title says it all it says a mathematical theory of communication

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.040
it's not a theory of information it's a theory of communication because why information has to

01:24:53.040 --> 01:25:00.560
have a source and a receiver it's information doesn't just exist information something is only

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:08.160
informative to a receiver of that information so information and I'm speaking pure Shannon here

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:16.880
information is an answer to a question you know it's is is the coin toss heads or tails you know

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:25.200
is it heads yes or no that's one or zero you know that is the binary digit that is the bit that is

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.160
the quantum how we quantify information so how many questions I have to ask determines how much

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:40.400
information I receive from from my interaction with with my environment so this information

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:50.560
exchange is a question asking and answering exercise and the crucial point is that the information is

01:25:50.560 --> 01:26:00.240
subjective it's received by me who asked the question the the the system doesn't and a system

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:06.720
doesn't contain an objective amount of information it depends on what question you're asking of the

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:16.960
system so you know so the the very same I mean if for example there's a bag of of balls and we

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.960
you and I both know that the yellow red and blue ones in there and we know that they're 30 balls

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:30.240
I know that 10 of them are red you don't know that that that bag contains more information

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.320
for you than it does for me you know so it depends on it depends on how so information is a measure

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:45.440
of of uncertainty the more the more unpredictable is the outcome of an event the more information

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:51.920
that carries for the observer of the event and you and I might have more or less prior knowledge

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.720
so that will be more or less predictable or unpredictable to us so so the why this is also

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:05.120
important is that when you speak about information whether you're charmers or you to know me you

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.880
have to ask yourself the question of well who is the recipient of this information and so you're

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.720
back to the question of well where's the subject with like in the internet where's the subject

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:24.480
or the conscious subject of all of this information processing it's integrated you know for what it's

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:31.280
so it's just like a very weird way of thinking about I think to say that information in and of

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:38.880
itself you know is is or the integration of that information in some objective arms length sense

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:45.440
you know is is the mechanism of consciousness I think misses the point so so my way of thinking

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.720
about it which I tried in a very brief and rough and ready way a few minutes ago when I

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:58.880
spoke about Carl Friston and my work on this problem our starting point was well an infam

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:06.480
a self-organizing system which has to predict the behavior of the world has to ask questions of the

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:13.600
world you know is if I were to do this what would happen kind if I were to do this what would

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:21.520
happen to my free energy is basically the question that every every biological self-organizing system

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:29.520
has to constantly ask so the information processing that gives rise to feeling in my view is that kind

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:36.240
of information it's not all information it's infam it's it's it's it's it's it's it's the

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:43.280
answering of questions by systems that give a damn about that they need to ask questions and they

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:50.640
give a damn about the answers that is I think the kind of system that is the information processing

01:28:50.640 --> 01:29:00.080
within which can can can can can feasibly or plausibly rather be be conceptualized as a as a

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:08.640
sentient system I must like for example mark on when I came into this podcast so when I first

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.160
started thinking about consciousness I'm very much on a similar page as you I think I think we're both

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.520
very monist physicalist we're trying to reduce it trying to figure out a nice biological approach

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:25.680
to it but I must say someone who came very close to really changing that my mind on that a little bit

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:33.200
was Donald Hoffman I don't know if you're familiar with his work yes I'm not in detail but yes I know

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:39.040
the basic ideas yeah so it's pretty fascinating to see that a lot of physicists nowadays are

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:45.760
starting to show that space time itself is not a concept that we can actually understand or

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:52.480
really even perceive in any real way and and therefore well now when he takes it further

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.320
by obviously making the his own conclusion that conscious agents must be fundamental

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:03.680
so that's a separate story but what is a bit strange is the fact that physicists are not

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:09.520
showing us that the reality that we're trying to reduce is not a reality that is possibly

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.640
reducible because we see we have absolutely no access to this reality what do you think about that

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:27.120
well um so if you if you you or any of our viewers read my book in in in the penultimate

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:36.240
chapter it's titled back to the cortex and there I speak about so the most of the book is about

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:41.680
effort it's about you know this fundamental form of consciousness and how it is generated and

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.640
what that what the implication oh sorry it's not the penultimate chapter it's the third last chapter

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.640
the second last chapter is on charmers and the hard problem the last chapter is on artificial

01:30:52.640 --> 01:31:00.160
consciousness the third last chapter is on this this this this question of of cognitive and

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:06.080
perceptual consciousness you know the the type of consciousness that that we have for for the most

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:13.520
part focused on and there I make the argument which is again not not a a novel argument it's

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:19.040
it's very similar to Hoffman's although I don't cite him because actually I'm embarrassed to admit

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:25.600
I didn't yet know his work at the time that I was writing that book but I was aware of other

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:33.280
people in the predictive processing tradition you know like like Andy Clark and and and and

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:39.680
Jacob Huey uh speaking about you know perception as controlled hallucination

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:47.760
and that you know the the reality and and Dan Dennett uh you know the this whole thing of the

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:54.640
the use illusion and so on and I find yeah and Neil Seth I mean that whole group of him

01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:01.280
and Neil Seth is in that same tradition and Neil Seth extends it from the extra receptive

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:08.160
domain to the inter receptive domain in very interesting ways um actually if we have time

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:15.520
I will come back to that because I think that the that that that affect is not the same as

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:22.320
interception you know I I have a little a little quibble about that but I don't think it's important

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.640
for our present purposes so what I'm saying is that in that tradition with although Hoffman

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:33.760
doesn't come up from a predictive processing background I think it's it's it's it's entirely

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:43.760
compatible you know the idea that the reality that we are that we are acting in is a representation

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:50.560
of the of of something in my language beyond the mark of blankets all I can know is my blanket

01:32:50.560 --> 01:33:01.600
states and that that is a that is a statistical generative model you know of of of the of reality

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:07.840
minutes you could even say can't it's a cantium view you know I have no problem with that whatsoever

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:16.160
so but you know I don't think it's a and is anything spooky about that and and I don't think

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:24.960
that it requires us I mean all you need to say is the retina the retinal ronson cones

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:33.360
light waves impinge on the retina and the those cells transduced those light waves into nerve

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:41.920
impulses so what we um you know you never actually are you're not that you're not receiving light

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:48.400
waves you are representing them as spike trains you know that that's enough for me it can see

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:53.280
there's nothing spooky there you know and those spike trains all they are are ones and zeros so

01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:01.520
from that I then have to infer the the the the causes of these of these sensations in other

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:07.840
words of these signals and I and I model it you know I'm perfectly fine with that

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.880
so I but but you know I don't see why that leads to all kinds of spooky conclusions that's

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:23.360
that's there are few steps beyond that that I don't think follow when I spoke to Donald when I

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.000
asked him about it because I mean a lot of us in biology in neuroscience we know that we don't

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.680
see reality every radical sort of truth we sort of represent something but his physics and his

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.880
work with a couple other mathematicians show that spacetime is fundamentally completely different

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:44.800
so we're not even seeing a mild representation or like something similar to reality or close

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:50.480
it's completely different but he does eventually say that however his conclusion that consciousness

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.760
must be fundamental is something he's willing to accept might be wrong he's just trying to figure

01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.880
out a different solution so he actually doesn't take it to that point where he he claims that

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.480
consciousness is fundamental he's just trying to find some relative because reality is the problem

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.000
in essence we don't we know a lot about mind but we know almost nothing about matter pretty much

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:21.200
yeah I wouldn't but by the way as you can see my lights came on so so hallelujah the the load

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:27.840
shedding has ended for I hope my doesn't see what happens yes let's hope there's not a reciprocal

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:35.680
interaction between where you are and where I am but look there's there's much that I could say

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:47.840
about about quantum physics and that the seriously strange nature of reality and how

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.560
utterly different it is from the from the high level average states that we are able to represent

01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:02.240
and so on you know that and those things all interest me very much I I will just say about

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:10.800
that that the the the approach that Carl Friston and I take which is the free energy principle

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:17.680
approach it's called variational free energy this is this is you know there's there's

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:23.200
thermodynamic free energy and there's chemical free energy and then there's informational free

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:32.400
energy and and some people no less than chains for example thinks the informational free energy is

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:42.080
is the fundamental explanation of the thing the all of those are probabilistic it's a probabilistic

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:47.920
theory the variational free energy has to do with statistical mechanics it has to do with

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.400
probabilities when I was speaking earlier about you know your uncertainty and the palpating of

01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:00.240
your uncertainty and all of that we're talking about probabilities and so I think that there's a

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:07.600
very deep link is that there's a I think that the the whole free energy principle inherits from

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:16.880
the traditions that that have replaced Newtonian physics so there's there's that in all of that

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:23.280
interests me very much but I in the time remaining to us I would rather because I'm aware we have

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.840
limited time remaining I would rather start with this observation which is which is more concrete

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:41.120
you know I'm a clinician I work with neurological and neurosurgical patients every day and so I

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:48.320
witness you know what happens if a piece of your brain is missing and I've been around for a sufficient

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.800
number of years to have seen many many many patients with the same piece of their brain missing

01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:01.280
and the curious or the interesting fact is that they all misperceive reality in the same way you

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:09.600
know that that's for example an excellent example is right parietal low patients who

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.920
they paralyzed on the left side and they believe they're not and it's patently obvious that they

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.840
are you know but they say no I'm not and so you know you see one and another and another and

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.560
eventually you realize hang you know if you haven't got a right parietal low you just there's a piece

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.760
of reality that you just don't get and never can get why because you've got a piece of your

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:40.400
brain missing that you need in order to be able to get that so you can from that observation

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:47.680
you can you can extrapolate that well all of us have a piece of our brains missing in the sense

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:53.520
that you know we we only have this what if we were to all have an additional lobe or an additional

01:38:53.520 --> 01:39:00.080
hemisphere how much more would we be able to to register and compute and comprehend you know

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:07.920
than we currently do so so all I'm saying there is that I again on the basis of my own empirical

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:16.320
clinical experience you know I'm totally ready to believe that we have a horribly limited

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:27.600
conception and perception of reality I'm totally sympathetic with that however you know we are

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.040
where we are so you can either say okay I'm going to become a mystic you know because I don't do

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:39.120
anything I'm just going to believe everything or you know it's all you all you say well you know

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:48.720
given given the limited nature of my instrument you know I must do the best I can to to to expand

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:57.360
its bounds to test my hypotheses and you know be ready to find that my predictions were wrong

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:04.560
and I must update my predictive model and so on I didn't see what else we can do I so so so although

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:12.800
I am totally aware of the limits of the of the human brain it's just obvious from what I've just

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:20.960
said and of the limits of science because it's a method it's a it's a method ultimately you have

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:26.320
to have we were talking about idealism and never got back to it but you know ultimately you have

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.360
to have faith and I use that word advisedly that there is some reality beyond what I'm perceiving

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:41.120
that I'm probing and that you know I that I that the the the inferences that I draw

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:49.280
and the models that I build each time are less bad you know that that I that they they they

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:58.480
of course they're not reality of course they are a pathetic you know scrap of what we are

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:05.360
capable of grasping of the nature of the universe really but it's but we're making progress each

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:13.280
of us in our own lives and as a species over generations we have less bad models less less

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.400
bad understandings and but it is all based on faith you know that that this method is a reasonable

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.840
way of of proceeding um it is a matter you know you rarely can say well because it's so limited

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:34.720
because it's so so um unknowable reality in itself and all of that I'm just going to give up

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:40.400
that that's another approach that but I would rather take the scientific approach I just think

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:46.080
we need to have humility as scientists and recognize how how little we know but the very

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:56.960
physics that Hoffman um um sites as evidence for how little we know is the product of that method

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:04.080
you know that it has led us to know that reality is weird and it is very different from from how

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.920
we perceive it but but you know Hoffman couldn't have couldn't have come to that view if it wasn't

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.360
for the application of the scientific method to arrive at that physics in the first place when

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.360
Hoffman when Hoffman so apparently he did the calculations and he and he asked like what are

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.880
the probabilities of that our perception of reality would give us an accurate representation

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:30.800
of reality based on natural selection and fitness and actually evolving and surviving

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.280
and when you when you when you notice that the probability came to zero apparently had to take

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.400
a seat because he's very much a scientist and he loves the scientific method natural selection

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.440
all of it so you're here to take a seat because it like messed him up with his fundamental

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.200
perception of reality because he was very much materialistic thinker in terms of consciousness

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.840
and so it's on that note if what are you you spoke about faith there Mark I mean part of

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:02.800
this podcast also is for the people questioning these big topics often are trying to also find

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.920
meaning and purpose while not understanding what's really going on what are what are your

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:15.520
religious or spiritual beliefs and first of all I want to come back one step in our conversation

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:23.840
to this materialist the idea of materialist and mind versus matter and so on you know I to me

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.240
mind and matter are the same as what I was saying earlier when I said that there's a there's a

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:38.320
dual aspect to our monistic essence matter for me is an aspect in other words I don't think

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:44.000
matter is a fundamental property I think matter is a way of representing things and and that's

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.760
entirely consistent also with the the the the recent physics that we were talking about earlier

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:59.760
matter is not a fundamental property of the universe and the the the the so I'm not a

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:08.960
materialist this segues into your question now you know I I'm not a materialist I'm a dual aspect

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:16.400
monist who says that the material and the ideal that these are two different ways of knowing

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.840
of perceiving something which is ultimately unknowable and that's what you and I have just

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:27.040
been talking about the limits of science the humility that scientists have to have in the face

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:37.360
you know of the of the of the massive uncertainties in the universe so so my spiritual position

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:45.600
arises from that in other words it's one of humility I'm sorry maybe you've got the impression of me

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:55.360
as a kind of a pompous or noisy guy I don't know it might be hard for you to to equate

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:03.360
my my personality with humility but it really it is as a scientist and as as a spiritual being

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:11.120
my not only is it my belief that I even find solace in it Tevin I find solace in

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:17.600
what I don't know think I what I know I don't know you know these things are way beyond my can

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.720
questions like what happens after I die they're not empirical questions I can't

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:30.000
any prediction I come up with I can't test it until I'm dead you know so so and I accept that

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.600
and I say again I take I take comfort in it is there a god you know is there an afterlife

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:45.520
what does it all mean you know I genuinely don't know and and and so it's a kind of an

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:53.120
agnostic position but it is not a materialist and not an atheist position yes but but within that

01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:00.640
within those parameters and I'm sorry I'm sort of repeating myself I then have to say okay

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:07.760
given those limitations what is to be done and I say well you've got to do the best you can with

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:16.000
what you've got and so you know so the best I've been able to come up with is science you know I've

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:22.720
read okay which of these things you know which of these things gives me the greatest confidence that

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:28.240
well yeah I might find answers or at least I might find less ignorance that's that's the

01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:36.640
approach that that that I take and fully fully aware of the limits of the you know the limits of

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.160
the conclusions that I can come to now within that frame of reference and this is probably

01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:47.120
be the last thing that we'll talk about I in other words using a scientific

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.520
methodology a scientific epistemology to to try to address these questions

01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:04.960
I I think that our values you know I was talking much earlier in our conversation about

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:10.560
the fundamental value system of living things is that it's good to survive and bad not to

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:22.800
that that built upon those fundamental values or other also phenotypic values you know like

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:30.240
it's like it's it's bad to be in danger that's fear you know it's it's it's irritating and

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:37.520
frustrating to have an impeding things preventing you from that's that's rage you know that it's

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:43.600
bad to separate a little dependent creature from its caregiver you know that that's got to do with

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:54.560
attachment bonds and so on I think that these evolved endophenotypes is a word that's sometimes

01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:00.560
used for them that they are they are basic values that we have just because we're living things and

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:07.360
that they are then more elaborated values that we have just because we are mammals and I think

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:14.320
that these provide and you know it's famously said that you can't derive an orc from an is

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:20.640
but I think that from these is is we can derive some orcs like I've just done bad to separate bad

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:28.480
to bad to injure people or injure living things it's bad to it's bad to for sentient things rather

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:35.120
it's bad to to separate mammals from their caregivers it's it's bad to to to you know

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:41.920
unnecessarily frustrated and be sentient beings and so on I think that our much more elaborated

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:50.480
human value systems which of course have evolved also to to to manage much more artificial

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:58.080
environments for which we were not evolutionarily prepared like like like like you know

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:05.280
agricultural and permanent settlements and and everything that flowed from that

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:12.320
in a private property and all of that there's a lot more that's that the values that we've

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:18.240
built on top of those phenotypic values but I think those phenotypic values and biological

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.480
values are the starting point of all of our values all of our values they're not they're not the

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:32.560
values of the universe they are our the values of us living things who have skin in the game

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:39.040
I look I love that mark I mean look you didn't come across as pompous or arrogant in any way

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.960
and neither does you I'm relieved I loved reading it I enjoyed it so much I mean

01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.480
there's something Raymond Tellis once said I like this term he says he's ontologically agnostic

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.800
but I mean epistemologically we trust science the most is what what you're basically trying to say

01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.720
that's right that's right no Mark thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:08.560
myself thank you more words from your side well thank you very much and apologies again as you

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:15.600
can see I've lost my this is uh this is how unpredictable and uncertain the world is yeah

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:22.000
but I'm very glad to be speaking to you as a fellow South African and I'm glad that we are both

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:30.080
here these are the problems that belong to me and I'm very happy to be grappling with them

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.720
yeah and proud to know that that that that you're a South African your podcast is just great

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.840
thanks Stephen for inviting me
