1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Mark, tell me, why is it that there is something it is like to be me?

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
Why is it that there is something it is like to be you?

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,440
How is this possible?

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
Well, there are two questions there.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,600
The one is why there is something it is like to be me.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
Or to be you, and the other is how is that possible?

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,560
The why question, I believe, has everything to do with the fact that the fundamental,

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,880
and I say fact, and I'll have to substantiate that later, but it has everything to do with the fact

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,960
that the fundamental form of consciousness is feeling, in other words, affect.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:07,040
And affect arises from a monitoring of our homeostatic imperatives.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,720
We living things have to remain within certain viable bounds, and simpler creatures have reflexive

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,320
mechanisms which maintain them within those bounds, but obviously reflexes have a limited

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,000
generalizability. There are many situations that living things find themselves in which are

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,880
unpredicted by their evolutionary past, and so they can't navigate uncertain or novel

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:52,240
situations, and so most of them expire in those situations, but a lucky few survive,

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,320
because they just happen by chance to do the right thing, and then they have progeny,

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,120
and so that contributes to the evolution of those reflexes.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,800
There's therefore an enormous advantage, an enormous adaptive advantage for creatures to be

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,440
able to experience how they're doing. Is this going well or is this going badly?

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,040
When acting voluntarily, in other words, not reflexively, not automatically, they now can,

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,320
by trial and error, try different things out, and if it's going well, then they feel it.

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,720
This feels like a relief, and if things are going badly, the opposite applies,

23
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,120
and so they avoid what feels bad, and they approach what feels good, and in this way,

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,320
as I said a moment ago, they have the enormous advantage of being able to navigate

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:06,480
unknown, unpredicted, novel, uncertain situations, and then to learn from the experience during life

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,160
rather than for it to require generations of phylogenetic learning, in other words,

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,240
learning by natural selection, or rather adaptation by natural selection.

28
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,120
So, I believe I, with others, it's not my own idea. This is a building on the work,

29
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,400
first of all, of Jagdpanksepp, and secondly of Antonio de Marzio, and others. We believe

30
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,760
that that affects or an extent or feeling is an extended form of homeostasis.

31
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:52,720
There, you can see in what I've just said, there's an intrinsic value system. The value system of

32
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,000
all living things, the value system which simply underwrites the whole of evolutionary biology,

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is that it is good to survive and bad not to. So, good feelings predict your likely survival,

34
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,440
and bad feelings predict your likely demise. So, that's the valence, as we call it,

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,360
the valence of affect, the unpleasant pleasure dimension. It is intrinsically valenced,

36
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,160
doing well and doing badly. In order to make choices, and remember that's what I'm speaking

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,440
about, the animal having now the capacity to make choices. In other words, to not behave compulsively

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,680
according to reflex. That capacity has to be rooted in a value system, because how else do

39
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,560
you make a choice? Something has to be better than something else. So, there has to be some

40
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,120
value system which determines what's good and what's bad, and that's what I've just

41
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:04,160
explicated. Now, on top of that, we have multiple needs. We complex creatures have multiple needs,

42
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,840
but actually, you don't need to be that complex a creature to have multiple needs,

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,680
like for example, to have energy balance needs, and thermoregulation needs,

44
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:26,240
and hydration needs, and oxygenation needs. There you have four, and each of these has to

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,160
be met in their own right. So, you can't reduce them to a common denominator. You can't say,

46
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:44,720
I have 8 out of 10 need for sleep, and a 2 out of 10 need for nutrition. Therefore, I have a 10

47
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,400
out of 20 total need, so all I need to do is sleep, and I'll reduce the number, and never eat.

48
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,080
You have to do them both. So, why I'm emphasizing that is that this is something in addition to

49
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,880
valence. We also have categories of need. So, valence is a continuous variable.

50
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,880
You can say from minus 50 to plus 50, that's the range of badness to goodness,

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,880
but the categorical variables that represent our different needs are by definition because

52
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,760
they're categorical variables. They are qualitatively distinguished from each other.

53
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,160
So, this is why feelings have both a goodness and a badness, and a particular quality, so that

54
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,720
sleepiness feels different from hunger, and from thirst, and from respiratory distress, and so on.

55
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,320
So, when you said why is there something that is like to be me or to be you,

56
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,360
I believe in the most basic form of consciousness, that's why. It enables us to know how we're doing,

57
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,480
to evaluate how we're doing, and it is necessarily qualified. In other words,

58
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:18,400
qualia arise from the fact that we have multiple such needs. Then there's the second step, which is

59
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,000
if I can, you know, obviously the simple creatures that first evolved, when I say simple, I don't want

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,560
to be derogatory, they're not that simple as I've been saying, but the first creatures that evolved

61
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,080
feeling, they weren't verbal, so they wouldn't have been able to say what I'm now going to say,

62
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,320
but it's as if their feelings say, I feel like this, you know, it tells you how you're doing,

63
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:52,720
and then secondarily, it's a matter of I feel like this about that, and so feeling gets extended onto

64
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,960
perception and cognition, so because you have to develop policies about what you're going to do,

65
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,880
and so affect is the fundamental form of consciousness, which then gets extended onto

66
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:14,400
cognitive and perceptual consciousness, which gives rise to the forms that dominate our

67
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:23,280
conscious experience, and because our capacity to plan and think about what we're going to do is so

68
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,840
highly developed. The second part of your question, you know, about how does this happen, well I've

69
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,280
partly described the mechanisms of how it happens, but if you're asking about the hard problem,

70
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,880
in other words, you know, how does physical, physiological processes of the kind that I've

71
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,440
just described, how do they turn into, how do they somehow transform into subjective experiences,

72
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
that's another story, so you'll have to tell me if you want me to go into that.

73
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,120
I think, look, okay, there's so much to touch on, I mean, first of all, I just want the listeners,

74
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
or for the viewers, we're both in South Africa, this is quite cool because it's the first time

75
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm actually chatting to someone in the same time zone, we're both in Cape Town, and just for

76
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,320
everyone who's wondering why the screens are so dark on your side, it's because in South Africa,

77
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,720
we have what's called low chatting, our country just does not give us electricity every now and then,

78
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,320
so Mark's unfortunately on the one side of it right now, just for some context for the viewers,

79
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,520
but okay Mark, let's go to the hard problem, I mean, I've read The Hidden Spring, I mean,

80
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I've read The Neuropsychology of Dreams, your writing is very fascinating, I like the way you're

81
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,240
sort of blending neuropsychology, neuropsychoanalysis into neurobiology and trying to link these

82
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,640
fields together, so you're definitely working at that interface between mind and body, so let's

83
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,960
discuss the hard problem, what are your thoughts on this hard problem of consciousness, is there a

84
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,000
problem, I mean this podcast is called Mind, Body, Problem, Solution, because the aim is to find a

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,320
solution to this problem, do you think we're able to find it using what your theory sort of claims?

86
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Well, I don't claim to have solved the hard problem, but I do claim to have given us a

87
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:23,200
hint as to what direction we need to go in in order to be able to do so, so let me unpack

88
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,120
that story, I could do it in two ways, let me preface it with the first way and then I'll come

89
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,640
to the second way which I'll tell you in more detail, I think that the hard problem arose

90
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:47,280
because we focused on visual perception as our model example of consciousness, in fact I might

91
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,480
go further and say we focused on human visual perception as our model example of consciousness

92
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:04,880
and of course conscious vision has everything to do with cortex, so I might sort of you have to

93
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:13,680
start somewhere, so let's start with Francis Crick's famous book from 1994, it was called

94
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:25,040
The Astonishing Hypothesis and the subtitle was The Scientific Search for the Soul and there he

95
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,840
explicated a methodological program as to how we might go about sort of saving

96
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,040
the problem of consciousness from philosophy, rescuing it and bringing it into international

97
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,720
science and he proposed this concept of the neural correlate of consciousness, he said all we need to

98
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,840
do, consciousness is nothing special, it's just another biological function, all we need to do

99
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,000
is find the anatomical and physiological substrate of this function, in other words we need to identify

100
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,040
its neural correlate, we need to then once we've isolated that correlate we can start seeing okay

101
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,440
well how does this thing work because this must somehow explain why there's something it's like

102
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:26,640
to be you and me, it's a sort of reasonable commonsensical reductionist strategy but the

103
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:36,720
unfortunate choice as I just said is that he focused on human vision and I say it's unfortunate but

104
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,120
it's not difficult to understand why, I mean human consciousness is dominated by visual perception

105
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:53,840
and also more cortex is given over to visual perception than any other form and we understand

106
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,920
it rather well so it seemed like a reasonable place to start, why I think it was an unfortunate

107
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,480
place to start is first of all you shouldn't start with human beings the most complex form of

108
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:22,400
consciousness and you know cortex is many, this is more fundamental point, the function of visual

109
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,400
perception does not require consciousness, you can have visual perception without consciousness

110
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:42,400
so when the very next year after Crick's book was published came David Chalmers's famous paper

111
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,560
in the Journal of Consciousness Studies where he said well you know why doesn't all this information

112
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,760
processing go on in the dark and etc, I don't need to tell you what he said but I think it was a

113
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,360
reasonable question from Chalmers precisely because visual information processing can go on in the

114
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,400
dark so it is mysterious why do we why does it have to feel like anything at all, we know that

115
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,520
not only the superior curriculae can see unconsciously but you know the visual cortex can

116
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:26,080
see unconsciously and it can discriminate things like pretty elaborate things like color

117
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,920
you know you can you can discriminate color unconsciously so why does it have to be something

118
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:40,080
it is like to experience red versus blue if you can discriminate them without experience

119
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:49,680
now that I do not believe applies to feelings you can't have a feeling without feeling it

120
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,600
and I've just explained to you why we feel our feelings it is it is a it is a necessarily

121
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,600
subjective monitoring of my own state with existential consequences for me

122
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,760
and it has to have this goodness and badness has to have value and it has to have a categorical

123
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,320
qualitative differences so you know had we started there had we started with affects

124
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,560
which are not generated cortically and that's another big story they are generated they are

125
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,280
generated in the in the midbrain for the most part but certainly they are generated subcortically

126
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:40,560
in general had we started with those much more ancient much simpler structures

127
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,760
and I think that the hard problem would never really have arisen I think it's you know to say

128
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:56,080
why must you feel pain you know why must you feel hunger this is mysterious why don't you have

129
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,240
why don't you unconsciously navigate uncertainty and make choices of existential consequences

130
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,360
within qualitatively distinctive variables and it's just you know just is when you describe

131
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,920
that function you're just describing a feeling and feelings as I said feelings have to feel like

132
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,880
something unlike visual perception which does not have to so that's the the first I said I'm

133
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,120
going to tell the story in two parts that's the that's the the first part but let me now move

134
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,560
from neuroscience to to a more sort of philosophical perspective on this thing

135
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:42,640
and I said the question the hard problem put in its most basic form you know is as so put it you

136
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,640
know how how does the brain get over the hump from electrochemistry to feeling and how do electrochemical

137
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,920
processes turn into feelings literally turn into them you know what kind of weird metaphysical

138
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,960
transduction occurs there and and and here I think the problem is that the the the physiological

139
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:13,520
processes do not turn into experiences I think this is remember I'm saying this is a philosophical

140
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,480
perspective yes I think it's a matter of observational perspective on point of view so

141
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:32,800
um no if you if you look at the processes going on in my brain when I am feeling let us say

142
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,280
excitedly motivated you will see activation of mesocortical mesolambic dopamine circuitry

143
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,720
and you literally will see it if you for example put me in a positron emission scanner you will see

144
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,160
that circuitry lighting up and you can you can use all sorts of methods to you know drill down

145
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,600
into what exactly is going on physiologically there but that's looking at me from the outside

146
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,800
I mean you are now looking at me in the dark from the outside and you're seeing a body

147
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,000
and you can then you know you can start scanning this body and you can see in in more granular

148
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,800
detail what's going on within it but the the crucial issue is you're taking an external

149
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:26,160
observational perspective on me I on the other hand have another observational perspective on me

150
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,280
that is being me I am me so I have another perspective which is the subjective mark songs

151
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,600
as a subject as opposed to mark songs as an object so I can look at myself in the mirror

152
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,200
and I recognize oh yeah that guy's me it's mark songs but I could also when I first wake up in

153
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,160
the morning before I've even opened my eyes I can have this dawning subjective experience of being

154
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,520
me and that's can only be described as my mind then I stagger over to the bathroom look at myself

155
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,160
in the mirror and that's my body but both of them are me so you know they're not two of them

156
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,520
there's only one of them there's only one mark songs it's just that we're observing

157
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,840
him from two different perspectives so so to say how does how does my subjective experience of being

158
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,080
me produce the physical or I should rather put it the other way around how does the physiological

159
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,160
embodied version of me produce the subjective experience of me is like asking you know how

160
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,920
does something objective produce something subjective objectivity doesn't do subjectivity

161
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:48,240
they're two different perspectives um now the if we are one and the same thing you know then

162
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,480
it's like actually let me use another analogy lightning and thunder you know with you with

163
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,560
your ears you hear a clap of thunder with your eyes you see a flash of lightning

164
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,760
that they're two different things you know the they're utterly different perceptions

165
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,960
but but they're not they're not actually two different things they're two different manifest

166
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,320
depends what perceptual perspective you take on is it an auditory perspective or is it a visual

167
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,480
perspective we don't ask it would be unreasonable to ask how does lightning turn into thunder

168
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,960
you know we realize these are two different ways of of of perceiving the same underlying process

169
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,680
and then we ask what is that underlying process and then we start going into physics

170
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,320
and we start speaking about you know georelectrical potential differences in the atmosphere

171
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,480
and you know and that's the ultimate description of what's going on the ultimate description

172
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,360
is of the causal mechanisms that we infer from the observational the observable data

173
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,320
and that's how we come up with the basic theory a basic and a fundamental science of lightning

174
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,440
and thunder um you know which is the theory of electricity um and and I think that that's what

175
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,440
we need um in in neuroscience or neuropsychology if we're going to bridge the divide between the

176
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,440
psychological and the neurological between the subjective and the objective perspectives

177
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,960
on the being of a creature then we need to find a more fundamental language which explains

178
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,200
both both sets of phenomena we don't we don't want to ask how does the one set of phenomena

179
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,280
cause the other set of phenomena because they don't so what I'm saying in essence is that

180
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,160
the hard problem is made a lot harder than it has to be uh if we if we conceptualize it

181
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,800
that way if we ask the question how do how does the brain get over the pump from electrochemistry

182
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,560
to feeling it's it's it's a question that can't be answered because it's wrongly framed um

183
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,920
but if we ask you know what is it that produces both the electrochemistry and what explains

184
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,800
the behavior of the electrochemistry and the behavior of the feeling then we then we have a

185
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:30,400
mechanistic theory and and I I think that um the the prospects of finding such a mechanistic theory

186
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,400
are greatly increased by shifting our focus away from these very complicated visual perceptual

187
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,400
processes which as I've already said uh these cortical processes are way down the evolutionary

188
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,840
line uh they're much later developments they're a secondary application um of what feeling is for

189
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,320
and what feeling does and focus instead on the primary form of feeling in the brain stem which

190
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,040
is as I've also already said an extended form of homeostasis then we say okay so we have a

191
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,200
fairly good clue as to what the mechanism is that we're looking for uh it's it's homeostasis with

192
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:21,520
some version of homeostasis and I I think from that starting point uh obviously there's a lot

193
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,480
more that could be said about okay so then how do we do it how how does uh homeostasis mechanistically

194
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,680
how does it explain the behavior of the predictive brain and how does it explain

195
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,920
the experience of being an of an intentional being with with with with calls and and aims

196
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,440
and purposes and so on I think that from that starting point it can be done um and my my own

197
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,280
efforts in this area have been have been along those lines trying to trying to begin to um

198
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:11,280
sketch what what what what this what this uh this monist uh um mechanistic uh um causal

199
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:20,320
explanatory process might be whereby uh we we have the the particular physiology of consciousness

200
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,920
and the particular phenomenology of it I'm glad you you just mentioned monist and asked because I

201
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,160
was thinking I mean we spoke about some of the history of philosophy we we spoke about David

202
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,640
Chalmers and his 1995 paper I mean do you think Descartes-René Descartes when he started this this

203
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
question of this mind-body problem when he started with this dualistic approach do you think that

204
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,480
also had a big impact on the way we perceived this problem in the first place very much so

205
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,600
and and David Chalmers makes little uh secret of his admiration for Descartes

206
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:04,080
I I think yeah I mean I I I wholly concur with the title of Demasio's famous book Descartes' Error

207
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:12,560
it was a horrendous error so so the the philosophy that I find myself much more sympathetic with

208
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,840
is is is that of of Spinoza uh that that I think is a great advance over Descartes

209
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,160
um I'm actually going to chat to Demasio about in a couple days so I'm very

210
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,000
looking I'm looking forward to that but Mark seem to be my best wishes I'll definitely like him very

211
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,040
much yeah so I'm looking forward to discussing Descartes' Error in quite a bit of detail well

212
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,760
when you're looking at this brain stem you're looking at this midbrain you're talking about

213
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,640
ancient consciousness I know sometimes because the main goal of this podcast is for me to provide

214
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,040
you someone who has a an excellent new thought process on this problem to explain their view

215
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,880
express themselves openly and to also address any objections people might have or to their theory

216
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,640
but when when you talk about the ancient brain you feel that's giving people a sort of a misconception

217
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,560
on what you mean by ancient consciousness because I feel like I've I've read blogs I've read a

218
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,520
couple things where people think you're taking it too far I've talked to some scientists about it

219
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,720
some some philosophers and they think you're taking it too low but yet you're explaining

220
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,560
exactly why the cortical versions of this are not the same do you think that they're mistaken

221
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:37,200
consciousness with intelligence I do I do very much so think that uh although um I don't deny

222
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:45,600
uh that very simple creatures like a bacterium has an intelligence it's obviously in it's nothing

223
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,960
like our intelligence and it's it's a it's a perfectly understandable state of affairs

224
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,240
that we start with human consciousness well we are human for one thing for another thing the

225
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,640
problem of other minds dictates that the only form of consciousness we can ever observe directly

226
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,480
is our own so you know it's it's it's not an unreasonable place to start it's not it's not

227
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,680
hard to understand why we began there but it's quite a different thing to say that therefore

228
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,840
human consciousness is the definitional form you know that anything which doesn't conform

229
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,400
to our type of consciousness isn't really consciousness um you you started this podcast

230
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:44,560
by asking me the question why is there something it is like to be me that is uh of course charmer's

231
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:52,800
definition building upon tom nagel's definition from 1974 um it's notoriously difficult to get

232
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,160
a neuroscientist or for that matter anyone to agree on a definition of consciousness

233
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,240
but I think if there's one definition that has more or less uh united us it is that it is something

234
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,000
it is likeness you know it's it is parliad that's what we mean by consciousness and so there's nothing

235
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,360
there's nothing complicated about that it doesn't it doesn't have anything more in common

236
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:32,240
with Descartes thinking uh cogito ergo sum than it does uh in common with the the the the raw

237
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:40,240
feel of pain you know there is something it is like to feel pain so when you say I'm going too far

238
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,840
philosophically speaking all I'm saying is I want to stop I want to I want to define consciousness

239
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,640
as as something it is like to be in that there is something it is like to be in that state

240
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,120
and that's not a controversial definition of consciousness and then I'm saying well there

241
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,960
is something it is like to be in pre-verbal non-verbal uh states of raw ethic like pain

242
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,840
I find it very hard to to imagine how anyone could argue against that you know there is

243
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,080
something it is like to be to be hungry there's something it is like to be thirsty this there's

244
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,120
something it is like to be in pain there's something it is like to experience separation

245
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,720
distress with which all mammals experience and display um there's something it is like to feel

246
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:42,560
fear and you know and you don't need to be able to reflect upon the source of your pain it's a very

247
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,840
very great advantage to be able to but you don't have to have any theory of pain or any

248
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,720
explanation of pain or any knowledge of pain as mechanisms etc or even just know anything about

249
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,880
what caused me to feel this all you just need to know is I feel it that's that is that is I think

250
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:12,640
a very defendable position that that's what we mean fundamentally by a conscious state

251
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,400
um you know I I grant of course that these higher forms of consciousness add all kinds of

252
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,600
bells and whistles and uh I'm very grateful to be the proud possessor of all of those bells

253
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,080
and whistles and I don't want to forego them you know so therefore I'm well aware that they

254
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,160
add a hell of a lot more but I don't think it's the right place to start if you're wanting to

255
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:46,640
understand the basic mechanism whereby something it is likeness appeared on this planet you know

256
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,120
how it how and why it evolved that that creatures started to quote Tom Nagel he said

257
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,480
that something like I'm paraphrasing but he said an organism is only conscious if there is

258
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,520
something it is like to be the organism something it is like for the organism you know that's

259
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:13,200
that's that's a compelling definition for me of what consciousness is and and and it makes

260
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,920
mean in terms of everything else we do in biology you know we take an evolutionary perspective we

261
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,440
we try and understand you know what this thing how this thing evolved why this thing evolved what

262
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,080
does it add what does it do that's why once it once it evolves it gets it gets conserved because

263
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:39,440
it continues to perform that function and that function bestows such enormous additional

264
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,800
survival potential that that it just hangs around now you've got to look at the arguments

265
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,240
so I've just given you in principle arguments about why I think that's a

266
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,680
fine place to start it's in fact to me the obvious place to start although I can understand

267
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,320
why we started in another place I think that it was a mistake in retrospect and now we can

268
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,320
correct that mistake and start in a better place but it's not just a matter of principles

269
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,240
you know it's a matter it's also an empirical matter when you start looking scientifically

270
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:31,120
at what is the minimal architecture for for consciousness you you know you

271
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,720
and you know you you you can start with human beings even you know if you if you produce

272
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,720
not deliberately so let me rather say if it so happens that you suffer a lesion

273
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:58,080
in the reticular activating system that lesion can be as small as two millimeters cubed in other

274
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,280
words the size of a match head if it's in the peri-brachial complex the right part of the

275
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:12,960
peri-brachial complex that will produce a coma in in any and in every human being you the the

276
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,440
fish's meta fish's analysis of all of the scans of stroke trying to identify what is the small

277
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,880
what is the common denominator what area is always lesion in patients in coma it's the

278
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,800
it's it's a it's a small two cubic two cubic millimeter area of the peri-brachial complex

279
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:42,160
so that wipes out something it is likeness reliably you know I mean you can at my prediction

280
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,880
is lesion that area the animal will go into a coma bingo it always happens the prediction

281
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:57,920
is confirmed each and every time now by contrast what about the cerebral cortex the cerebral cortex

282
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:06,080
in fact since the 1880s where has been removed in experimental animals with gay abandon and

283
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,040
even in the 1880s it was already observed that goats for example did it in dogs the dogs didn't

284
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,720
go into a coma they just they became what goats described as idiotish in other words they became

285
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,600
stupid they they lost their they lost their knowledge their understanding of the world

286
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,480
but they still behaved you know purposeively they they they behave and I'm telling you about

287
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:43,120
goats but since then for decades you know a decortication has been performed on on innumerable

288
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,760
mammal species and the opposite if it's done neonately you know the the the observation is

289
00:34:49,760 --> 00:35:00,400
always the same that they they play they show fear they get enraged in situationally appropriate

290
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:12,000
ways they copulate with each other they rear little little pups to maturity I mean not perfectly

291
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,920
but they do they play they hang from bars they swing around you know they they in fact yark

292
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:27,360
pangsit used to he performed a little sort of an experiment it's not really an experiment but

293
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,000
each of his new cohort of graduate students he would show them two groups of rats in two

294
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,800
different cages the one group had been decorticated and the other group had had a sham decortication

295
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
in other words they had the little bandage on their heads but but they they hadn't had the

296
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,520
operation and he asked them which of these two groups has no cortex and and every year he had

297
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,560
the same result you know that the students identified the animals that were were were intact

298
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,480
as being the decorticate ones and he said why and they said because the other ones are more lively

299
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,680
in other words in reality the decorticate rodents are more lively they're more emotionally expressive

300
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,120
that's because they don't have the cortical modulation of the but now we're talking about

301
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:25,520
rodents and and dogs and what more what about human beings if the cortex was the seat of consciousness

302
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,880
then there's a easy prediction which is that you know just we don't do neonatal decortication

303
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,000
in human beings but sadly they are neonates who are born with no cortex and this is a condition

304
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,480
known as hydrogen and cephalin and the prediction would be if the cortex was the seat of consciousness

305
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,080
that these kids should be in a coma they got no cortex and at the very least

306
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,400
they should be in a in a persistent vegetative state but that's not what you observe they are

307
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,720
not vegetative you know the vegetative state is also called non-responsive wakefulness non-responsive

308
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,600
wakefulness these kids are utterly responsive they and just as I described for the for the

309
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,480
animal studies they are responsive they are emotionally responsive in situationally

310
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,400
appropriate ways in other words you tickle the child she laughs you frustrate the child she

311
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,400
arches her back and complains you give the child a fright and she startles and and they show

312
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,840
behavioral initiative they they approach things that they like and they avoid things that they

313
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,200
don't like you know anybody who has anybody who has studied these children seriously

314
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,440
you know they they come to this conclusion and people philosophers you know who are all

315
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,200
skeptical about this I really invite them to just interact with these kids you know it's it's just

316
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,080
it's it's it's very very difficult to sustain the argument so so I was saying it's it's very

317
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,120
hard to sustain the argument that these kids are not conscious if you actually interact with them

318
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
but you know it is ultimately because of the problem of other minds it's ultimately

319
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:28,560
a matter of of inference and what my colleagues say I mean when I say colleagues here I'm not

320
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,200
only referring to philosophers there are many neuroscientists who who are very skeptical about

321
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:45,200
the claim the claim by I hasten to add not only me you know a good many of us who actually have

322
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,880
interacted with these kids find it very hard to believe that they're not conscious they are

323
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,240
feeling creatures who behave in every way like feeling creatures the the argument that is made

324
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:04,800
against this is we cannot know for sure that they are not just reflexes yes well remember

325
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,840
what I said about reflexes at the beginning of our discussion you know in reflexes there's an

326
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:17,040
entirely predictable response there's no variation there's no trial and error there's no intentionality

327
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,240
you know this is not what you see in these kids it's also not what you see in the deco ticket

328
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,680
animals so it's it's you know anyone who knows anything about how the reflexes of the nervous

329
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,400
system work know that what you see here ain't reflexes or instincts you know they are not

330
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,480
they are not reducible I mean they are dominated by instincts that's true these kids are you know

331
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,840
they are not like you and me but they show they show goal directed intentional

332
00:39:50,400 --> 00:40:00,000
purpose of and voluntary behavior and if you read the the descriptions by the pediatric neurologists

333
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,360
who studied these kids and the neuroscientists who studied these kids you see you know the

334
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:14,960
detailed evidence for that but you can't be sure say my colleagues so let me just hasten to add

335
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,040
you can't be sure that your pet dog is conscious you can't be sure that your pet cat is conscious

336
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,280
you can't be sure that anyone other than you yourself are conscious and then the argument

337
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:35,440
is given well reportability gets us out of that problem you know it's true that our dogs and cats

338
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,960
can't report their conscious state so there's room for skepticism there you know but

339
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,680
Tevin Naidu and Mark Solms can say there's something it is like to be me let me tell you

340
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,200
what I'm experiencing right now I'm experiencing x y and z I don't know why that's considered such

341
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:59,680
wonderful evidence you know because a robot can do that a robot can report its states

342
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,440
you know you can write a very simple program just say you know whenever you're in this that

343
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,360
or the other mode say I'm experiencing it but how do you know it really is experiencing

344
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:16,320
so I don't think reportability is I mean by the way on the reportability thing we're saying not

345
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,880
only that our dogs and cats aren't conscious we're saying that our preverbal kids aren't conscious

346
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:29,040
humans you know exactly so we need better we need we need better ways of deciding the question

347
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,040
when you go on the internet and you're trying to access something and it wants to know that you're

348
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,320
not a robot it doesn't say please tell me please declare you're not a robot you know it gives you

349
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,640
an ambiguous situation a problem and you have to navigate some uncertainty there and solve the

350
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,640
problem you know why why why is that the case what if declaring your states you know was was

351
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,160
such a wonderful method for determining that does seem to be the case sorry did you want to add to

352
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,680
that before well sadly I have a lot to add to it so let me rather let you get a word in

353
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,120
eduism then I'll carry on no you can continue I'm enjoying listening so that's why so what I do

354
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,440
what I say to my colleagues is okay well let's take you know you guys don't claim that the

355
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,480
whole of cortex is the seat of consciousness the the the general view is you know that there's

356
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,760
all this information processing going on there which is then accessed by some sort of overarching

357
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,280
global workspace or or something of the kind and where is this thing located well the standard

358
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:50,960
argument is prefrontal cortex the the other well known or widely held position which is I think

359
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,680
probably a better one is that it's insular cortex I why say better because insular cortex

360
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,200
has to do with feelings which I've already told you is the basic in my view form of consciousness

361
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:12,400
but if the prefrontal cortex were and many people say this I mean my dear colleague and friend Joe

362
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,400
the dude says that that all of this stuff you know he's an expert on sub cortical

363
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:27,920
affective circuitry specifically fear circuitry and and specifically the amygdala and he says

364
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,560
all of that stuff going on the amygdala is unconscious until it is until it is read out

365
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,240
by the cortex literally he uses the word label you know in other words until you use until

366
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,760
you can have this concept I am feeling fear you're not feeling fear so so what happens

367
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,240
if you remove again we don't do it experimentally but it happens in nature that they are patients

368
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,680
with no prefrontal cortex in fact I'll tell you it's not unusual to have patients with large

369
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,840
prefrontal cortical lesions on Joe the dude's view they should be less affective they should be

370
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,480
less emotional consciousness but there's more I mean since since Phineas gauge we've learned

371
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:22,560
frontal patients have too much emotion but I have a patient case W who has no prefrontal cortex

372
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,200
whatsoever and he not only is he like all such patients or frontal patients you know he's a

373
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:38,080
hyper emotional he's very overwhelmed by his feelings not only that but you know he he answers

374
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:44,800
questions that I put to him about what is it like to be you I asked him to imagine a scene in his mind

375
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,360
which had to do with I said imagine you have two dogs and one chicken can you picture them he says

376
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,200
yes I said now tell me can you count their legs and tell me what the total number of legs are

377
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,800
and the answer of course is 10 two dogs and one chicken so to my great disappointment because I was

378
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,680
trying to prove is there's somebody home you know he's there with mental imagery and he can

379
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,560
and he can experience it to my great disappointment he said eight the answer was eight I said eight

380
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:24,240
he said yes the dogs ate the chicken so you know no prefrontal cortex there's a sentient being there

381
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:33,040
and Domazio reported a case patient B who had absolutely no insular cortex and the same thing

382
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,640
Domazio interviewed him about you know and the patient keeps on referring to me and I and I yes

383
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,200
of course I have a mind and yes I'm experiencing this and and Domazio's patient also had heightened

384
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,520
affective feelings not a reduction in affect which is what but Craig's theory but Craig is the guy who

385
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,520
said you know the insular is the is the is the seat of the fundamental form of consciousness

386
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,240
feeling well Domazio showed that with no insular cortex you still have feeling I showed with no

387
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,760
prefrontal cortex you still have feeling and you have sentient being reportable conscious states

388
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,920
so then my colleagues say well it's due to the remaining cortex so you see I can't win because

389
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,760
they say the case with no cortex they can't declare their states so therefore we don't know

390
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,480
so I say careful let's take this with no prefrontal cortex they say well maybe it's posterior cortex

391
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,120
take one with no posterior cortex well maybe it's anterior cortex so that's now I'm near the end of

392
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:42,720
my argument which is that so let's look at other methods other than lesion methods so if if the

393
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,280
feelings are actually generated in the subcortical structures I mean literally in in other words

394
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,560
they're not being read out by cortex because everybody knows of course these affective mechanisms

395
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,960
are subcortical but the idea is they're not conscious until they read out by cortex so

396
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:12,080
if that were the case then if you if you take for example positron emission tomographic images

397
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,040
of human beings who are in intense affective states which they can report so they say I am

398
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,480
feeling really sad you know I am feeling absolutely joyous I am feeling trepidatiously

399
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,880
fearful or I am feeling really angry each of those four states and I'm not just saying I am

400
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,480
feeling I mean people who who really are in the grip of intense affects if you scan them

401
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:46,080
with pet imaging what is the prediction if it's if it's the if it's the brain stem

402
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:53,040
and the and this limbic circuitry arising from it that is responsible for those effects

403
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,040
then that's where you should see the highest rate of metabolic activity that's

404
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,720
that's what we that that seems to be an acceptable method for everything else in neuroscience so

405
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,880
you know so yeah we're saying well if the if the greatest if the if the hot spots are in the brain

406
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,400
stem then that's where the state is being generated and that's exactly what you find

407
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:25,760
if you if you image people in intense affective states you see intense arousal of brain upper

408
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:33,360
brain stem structures and the circuits the olympic circuitry but not cortex you know now

409
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,400
what about another method so in other words the prediction is confirmed yes now what about another

410
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:48,240
method deep brain stimulation the the prediction is if the if the affects are generated in the

411
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,760
brain stem you know then if you generate if you stimulate those structures that you are saying

412
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,200
are generating the affects in other words reticular activating system the prediction is

413
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:06,400
you will stimulate you will generate artificially an intense affect and and conversely you won't

414
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,520
if you stimulate cortex and that's what happens you know you stimulate cortex you get just about

415
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,520
no affects and when you do it's they really thought they're not affects they kind of like

416
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,840
you know i'm remembering this time that i was a bit down you know but you stimulate this when i

417
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,800
speak about a bit down stimulate substantia nigra you produce within five seconds depression

418
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,440
clinical depression like suicidal depression you know and and you switch off the stimulator

419
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,680
90 seconds later the person is out of the depression and i'm talking about reticular

420
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,640
activating system but it's not only reticular activating system it's periaqueductal gray

421
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:54,800
periaqueductal gray which is which is in the mid-brain there's a greater variety of affects

422
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,920
generated by stimulating the periaqueductal gray than any other brain structure and the

423
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,240
greater intensity of affect and so that's a third method so the lesion method you know

424
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,280
you add it to the functional imaging method you add it to the to the deep brain stimulation

425
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:21,840
method then there's also pharmacological probes you know if you it's no accident that the major

426
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:29,520
psychiatric drugs the the the psychopharmacological agents that form the mainstay of of clinical

427
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,520
practice these days they are like like antidepressants SSRIs what are they doing they are

428
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,320
increasing serotonin where is serotonin sourced it's it's it's sourced in the reticular activating

429
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:52,160
system in the rife nuclei where is where is dopamine you know antipsychotics block dopamine

430
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,720
where's that sourced apart from the substantia nigra which i mentioned earlier the type that's

431
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,680
important for psychosis is sourced in the ventral tegmental area which is part of the

432
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:08,400
reticular active aging system noradrenaline is sourced in the locus cirrhulius complex you know

433
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:15,840
you you modulate noradrenaline or you you you block noradrenaline to block anxiety so if these

434
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:24,320
nuclei you know are are the targets or at least the the the the the source cells of the neurons

435
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,640
that the cell bodies of the neurons that are targeted by all of these psychopharmacological

436
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,080
agents but they they're all in the reticular activating system this tells us something you know

437
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,920
so so i'm saying i'm sorry i'm speaking so much devon let me just come back to my to my main

438
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,920
argument which is that it's not when people say moxons is going too far to say well you know

439
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,480
these brainstem structures and simple effects are the model example of consciousness i told you

440
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,160
in principle why i think effects are the right model example and then i said and empirically

441
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,640
you know the you look at all of the evidence all of the evidence speaks to speaks for the

442
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:13,600
conclusion that actually effects are generated there where in the part of the brain that we've

443
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:22,720
known since 1949 is the is the basic prerequisite for all other forms of consciousness the only

444
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,560
problem is in when magoon and maruzzi discovered that and nobody disputes it that it is prerequisite

445
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,920
you can't have a conscious cortex unless it's activated by the reticular activating system

446
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,360
yes but when they discovered that they said yes but the reticular activating system produces

447
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,720
around produces what did they call it the level of consciousness yes a quantitative sort of like

448
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,120
volume of consciousness but it hasn't got any phenomenal content and that's what i've just

449
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,280
shown you isn't true you know it has phenomenal content the content i grant you is not cognitive

450
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,880
but it is effective there's a there's something it is like to be in those states that i've just

451
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,920
described therefore they are they are qualitative states they're not just quantitative states

452
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,760
and they have content the content is you know the the the feeling of pain versus the feeling of

453
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,640
hunger versus the feeling of sleepiness those that's that's the content that's what those states

454
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,280
are about so if if the upper brain stem was was only about some quantitative dimension

455
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,200
the level of consciousness it would only be of interest to an anesthetist yes but

456
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:43,280
it's the characteristics of tinkering with those with those circuits so yes so there you have it

457
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,920
in essence the youth i mean we've used this clinical differentiation between contents

458
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,400
of consciousness versus a level of consciousness but you're clearly showing that in essence they're

459
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,440
both very much linked i mean they're they're one in the same in a sense with whether you're

460
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,160
whether your level of consciousness is slightly lower in terms of less the gcs scale doesn't

461
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,160
necessarily mean that the person doesn't have effective qualitative experiences

462
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,760
exactly so i find it's a very it's a totally artificial distinction there is no

463
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,800
such thing as i mean how can you how can you have blank consciousness you know it's what is such a

464
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,320
what is a blank consciousness so you know you can't be conscious without being conscious of

465
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,800
something i mean we've known that since Brent Arno you know it's uh so i think that that's

466
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:44,320
distinction drawn by Maguna and Maruti uh all those decades ago was because they were so

467
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:51,120
completely flabbergasted by the finding which remember they weren't in any way expecting

468
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,960
that if you disconnect the cat cortex from the cat reticular activating system there is no more

469
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:05,520
conscious cat you know the the the the the the the the cortical consciousness cannot

470
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:14,880
just just disappears without without reticular arousal and so it was a way because everybody

471
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,640
knew that the cortex was the seat of consciousness they had to explain this somehow and so they

472
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:29,280
came up with this totally artificial distinction between um this this waking state which is

473
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:36,080
contentless um and you know and then the phenomenal qualities and and contents of

474
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,680
that the cortex had i mean but that's what i like about your book as well is that you you do do that

475
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,680
you show different methods of how you can prove this and predict what your theory claims that well

476
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,080
because ideally that's what we want in the scientific theory of of anything you want so

477
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,520
you want different ways of proving the same thing which is what you've basically shown in many ways

478
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,280
what i find very fascinating mark is that others neuroscientists like let's say for example michael

479
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,760
graziano he also pays a lot of attention to the tectum optic tectum which which we call the superior

480
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,360
coliculus but then natural completely different conclusions they regarding i mean he uses this

481
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:23,040
as the attention schema theory where we're building models of attention but we're not really um aware

482
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,600
in the sense that we have qualia we rather introspectively conclude that we have this

483
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,440
so i still find it quite fascinating that some people are using similar brain regions and

484
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,160
brain structures and drawing different conclusions what are your thoughts on that yeah but but but

485
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,920
let me clarify there um i am not uh i don't i don't disagree with that the the the the optic

486
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:58,880
tectum or or or superior coliculi they they are they are receiving information from the sensory

487
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,240
end organs sensory motor end organs but that doesn't mean that that information is conscious

488
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,360
i mean the famous example is blindsight with with the cortically blind cases

489
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,600
who nevertheless can navigate an obstacle course they are completely unaware that they're seeing

490
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,800
anything and yet they can avoid things that are in their way and the the the the most widely accepted

491
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:36,400
explanation for that is it's because the the the optic tectum is is is processing the information

492
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,960
unconsciously i'm fine with that it's unconscious and and and it also receives auditory information

493
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:51,840
and somatosensory information and so on um and uh the so these kids for example the the the the

494
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:58,880
hydranin cephalic kids uh i the the reason they're able to respond to their environments is because

495
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:08,080
they're receiving information about the environment from their sensory epithelium and but it is

496
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:16,320
unconscious then they it evokes a feeling in them uh all they know all they experience on

497
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,960
the evidence available to me it leads me to the conclusion that they i i don't think i can claim

498
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,240
that they experience anything more than just a feeling they don't have to know what the feeling

499
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,920
is about where it came from what made me feel this what is the thing out there in the world

500
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,920
it it it's not necessary so i'm saying because remember the the the superior

501
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,920
curriculae well well the the the whole of the tectum the superior and inferior curriculae the

502
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:55,840
whole of the tectum uh is is absolutely adjacent to the periaqueductal gray so all of the well

503
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:06,640
not smell but all of the other senses of projecting unconscious visual auditory somatosensory

504
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:16,000
information to the to the tectum uh and that in turn uh is is coupled with uh all of the

505
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,520
homeostatic mechanisms that we've mentioned at the beginning of our discussion all of the

506
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,160
homeostatic mechanisms the affect mechanisms including the emotions because they are bodily

507
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:35,840
affects and their emotional affects they all send their residual error signals to the periaqueductal

508
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,720
gray immediately adjacent to the tectum so so it's it's something like it's something like

509
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:50,480
you know where things where things stand now in the outside world which is not consciously

510
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:59,120
registered uh and where things stand now uh from the from the endogenous perspective of the organism

511
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,720
and and then uh the feeling is about those things but the feeling is all that the that

512
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:13,600
that the creature experiences you then need higher uh structures and the thalamocortical

513
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:20,480
structures make it possible for that feeling to be applied to a stabilized grip because the

514
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,280
tectum is just like a sort of salience map it's an attentional I agree with that description of it

515
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:33,920
but the cortex has the stabilized detailed mappings uh of it's not only that they detailed

516
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,360
mappings of the outside world filtered through a lifetime of experience of it because cortex is

517
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:46,080
memories memory space but it's also that it can be held in mind in working memories so you can

518
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,600
actually you know okay I feel like this about that so what am I going to do about it you know

519
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:58,320
that's that's what the cortical consciousness adds and and and and perhaps even more important than

520
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:06,320
that is that you can then manipulate those representations virtually in other words you

521
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:13,440
can you don't only have to feel your way through the world here and now by trial and error bearing

522
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:22,080
in mind that trial and error involves errors which are which are costly so so thinking where you have

523
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,520
virtual representations of if I were to do that what would happen and if I were to do the other

524
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:33,840
thing what would happen then and feeling you feel your way through these virtuals and all of this

525
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:41,280
is what cortex adds um and uh I keep on saying I'm very grateful to have that and I recognize that

526
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:48,400
that is a way more complex form of consciousness than the elementary form but for all the reasons

527
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,080
I've already said I think that the elementary form nevertheless is the right place to start

528
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:00,480
and the elementary form nevertheless qualifies as consciousness defined as there being something

529
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,520
it is like to have it what what I really like is that at some point I mean when you're talking

530
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,080
about homeostasis you're talking about how we're trying to figure this out and quantify a lot of

531
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:16,240
these qualitative experiences you that your work then somehow links with a lot of Karl Frister's work

532
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,960
and I mean Karl Frister is definitely one of the like most I mean he's the most cited neuroscientist

533
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,080
on the planet I think um and your work seems to coincide quite well do you want to touch on that

534
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,920
because I find that very intriguing the way you guys have linked up I read the paper that you guys

535
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,040
did together as well and I even used a part of my dissertation that you were very generous to

536
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:44,240
help me with uh but yeah let's touch on that a bit so I said earlier that uh I'm a dual aspect

537
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:52,400
monist in other words I think we have two different ways of observing uh the the the mental instrument

538
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,720
um you can look at it from the outside as as an organ uh you can look at it from the inside

539
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:08,000
as as a as a phenomenal state of mind but these two things are reducible to one causal mechanism

540
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:18,240
and that is something you infer from the data of of of observation and and I said that if you

541
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,360
if you accept that the elementary form of consciousness is feeling and that feeling

542
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,160
is an extended form of homeostasis then you have a rather simple mechanism you know you have a you

543
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,920
have a good place a tractable place to start because homeostasis is not difficult to understand

544
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:48,000
and so Karl Friston published a paper in 2013 in one of the journals of the royal society it's

545
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:56,320
called royal society interface and the paper was titled life as we know it and in which is a

546
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:07,600
wonderful title and and in that paper he basically explicated uh in in in ordinary you know physical

547
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:17,200
uh terms how by which I mean by which I mean you know physical mechanics how how does how

548
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:26,960
does homeostasis work um and so I said to him on upon reading that paper you know the the the

549
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:35,200
mechanism of of homeostasis which you so beautifully uh you know reduced to equations in in uh in that

550
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,760
paper if if consciousness is an extended form of homeostasis and by the way all those brains

551
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,840
then nuclear are not all of them but I mean the the fundamental homeostasis of the of the human

552
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:56,320
body are are are you know sort of like hypothalamus and midbrain and I said it should be possible to

553
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:02,960
extend then these these mechanistic accounts that you provide of homeostasis count of feeling

554
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,120
so that's what the paper that I wrote with him was about um so that's background uh to move a

555
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:15,920
little bit further forward so as everyone knows so I'm not going to go into this chapter inverse

556
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:24,240
Friston has has the flag that he's tied to his mast is the free energy principle

557
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:34,000
which is which is basically a statement of the the that self-organizing systems

558
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,680
systems which persist which continue to exist they have to do something to continue to exist

559
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,920
that this is this is what distinguishes I'm not saying all self-organizing systems are living

560
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:53,920
systems but what what but all living systems are self-organizing systems and what distinguishes

561
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,080
living systems from non-living ones is that they oppose the second law of thermodynamics in other

562
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:07,040
words they don't just dissipate they have they have they have preferred states and they work to stay

563
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:14,240
in those states and that's how they stay alive you know in the end the second law wins we don't

564
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:21,760
stay alive forever but you know the whole the essential feature of living systems is that they

565
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:28,240
are acting on their environments in such a way as to increase their chances of carrying on

566
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:35,280
existing as systems so the free energy principle is just a formalist a formal understanding of

567
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:42,640
the mechanisms whereby that work how self-organizing systems a resist entropy and by the way when I

568
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,440
said not all self-organizing systems are living systems that's a good thing because living systems

569
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,240
evolve from non-living systems you know so the fact that we can have a physics that explains

570
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:03,440
the this basic tycov system which then became the living system is a necessary thing you know we

571
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:10,080
have to be able to explain life in terms of things that were around before life came into existence

572
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:16,000
and by the way the same applies to consciousness we must be able to be conscious life evolved

573
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,080
long before consciousness evolved so you know there must be something it must have it must

574
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:28,320
have been constructed out of ingredients that were already there and I'm saying self-organizing

575
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:34,160
systems provide us with those ingredients so the free energy principle explains that how

576
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,680
self-organizing it formalizes the mechanisms whereby self-organizing systems in order to

577
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:45,120
continue to exist they have to minimize their free energy which is basically the same thing as to say

578
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,360
they have to have a model of the world because how else can you act in that world to to to

579
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,920
maximize your chances of surviving so it's a predictive model it's a model that if I were to

580
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,680
do that in the world this would be the sensory consequences that's how I maintain homeostasis

581
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,640
say if my sensory state is I'm moving out of my homeostatic bounds I'm getting too hot

582
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:15,440
I'm getting too thirsty then I must do that I must get out of the kitchen or I must drink some

583
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,760
water you know that will bring me back into my viable bounds so that's the basic and and the

584
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:27,280
free energy principle says to the extent that what you predicted will happen in consequence of your

585
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:34,240
actions to the extent that it does not happen that's called surprise all average surprise all

586
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,440
basically is free energy in other words you must be using your energy you must bind your energy into

587
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:47,040
actions which lead to the outcomes that you require in order to survive free energy in other

588
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,720
words energy that is not being efficiently used must therefore be minimized in other words the

589
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,240
gap between you what you what you expect to flow from your actions and what actually flows from

590
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,920
your actions that gap must be minimized so that's the whole of Friston's work basically just boils

591
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,560
down to that I mean I don't want to diminish it it's absolutely genius you know but that principle

592
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:18,000
explains homeostasis and it explains the goal directed behavior is the allostatic

593
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,880
imperative you know in order to maintain within my homeostatic remain within my homeostatic

594
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,320
bounds I have to do things in the outside world and I have to have a good understanding of how the

595
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:36,720
outside world works in order for me to know what things to do and while I'm busy learning that

596
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,720
I make lots of mistakes and I slowly improve my predictive model in order to minimize those

597
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:49,520
mistakes that's what the whole of cognition is for and what is cognition therefore doing it is it is

598
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:58,080
serving the the the the free energy principle in other words it's minimizing homeostatic errors it

599
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,080
means that is in other words it is it is reversing negative effects and turning them into positive

600
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:10,560
effects that's so affect which is the demand for mental work is a demand for predictive work

601
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,960
and the predictive work is what our cognition is all about so I've given you a very broad brush

602
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,880
stroke sketch there but that's what we worked out together in that in that first paper that we wrote

603
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:32,320
together which I then expanded into my book it's showing that you know I said I don't believe that

604
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,040
we've solved the hard problem but I believe we've given a good clue as to which direction we should

605
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:45,440
be going in that is a monistic account it's a it's a it's a tractable quantifiable statistical

606
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:52,000
mechanical account of the the the machinery of the mind and brain which is an information

607
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,840
processing machinery in the service of minimizing free energy in order to maintain the organisms

608
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,640
within their viable bounds so that they can survive that's it so some more I mean like

609
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:12,480
you're taking a physicalist monist account of this what are your thoughts and then other theories

610
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,200
of consciousness in terms of philosophical theories let's take panpsychism for example

611
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:24,800
or idealism what are your thoughts on those types of theories I think panpsychism is a little easier

612
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:36,160
to deal with than idealism so let's start with the problem of other minds which is the big problem

613
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:42,080
when it comes to consciousness science it really is the because conscious states just

614
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:52,000
are subjective states you can only ever know your own so we start there this this this might be

615
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,640
considered a really simplistic argument against panpsychism but it's the one that I start with

616
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:02,880
I can't know whether computers are conscious and tables are conscious and walls are conscious and

617
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:10,720
rocks are conscious you know I do know I'm conscious so now am I conscious of everything

618
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:17,040
that's going on inside of me no I'm only conscious of things that are going inside of my brain

619
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,320
my brain the brain states are only the conscious of other bodily states to the extent that those

620
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:31,360
other bodily organs are represented in the brain so so the brain and this this is not just a

621
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:38,160
commonsensical argument it's an empirical demonstrable fact you never lose consciousness

622
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:43,280
by removing any part of the body other than removing the brain if you lose consciousness by

623
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:48,960
removing the heart it's because the heart is no longer perfusing the brain you know etc so it's

624
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:54,880
like clearly the case that consciousness is in the brain and so you know all of the other bodily

625
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:02,240
processes are not conscious I empirically I can tell you that in my own case you know there's the

626
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,200
only way I get to know about and there's a hell of a lot of processes which never become conscious

627
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:15,440
like blood pressure regulation for example you know it's going on all the time thank god for that

628
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,960
but you know there's no conscious why is there no consciousness involved in that by the way

629
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,000
it's because it's entirely predictable you can't leave that to reflexes you know there's

630
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,080
there's there's no novel situations there that you have to feel your way through

631
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:37,760
so panpsychism if you take if you take as your starting point well you know the only thing I can

632
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:44,400
know empirically is what I am conscious of well I know even in my own case there's a hell of a

633
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:53,040
lot going on within the outer surface of this thing called Mark's arms that Mark's arms is not

634
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:58,080
conscious of so you could start then saying well of course it is possible that your muscles are

635
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,120
conscious of themselves and they're not reporting it to you and then you know then you should start

636
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:09,760
getting into into Never Never Land because yeah that's possible I mean anything's possible

637
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,160
it's possible you know that you know that that pigs can fly but I've never seen one you know and

638
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:24,000
so you know that's my argument against panpsychism now I'll take that's a very simplistic argument

639
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,280
because it's and I start with that one because it's an empirical one it's the only empirical one

640
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,560
because you have to start in your own case even within the brain Tevin there's a hell of a lot

641
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:40,400
of brain activity brain structures which the activity of which we never become conscious of

642
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:47,680
you know so so consciousness seems to be something quite special limited to very particular kinds of

643
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:55,360
structures and so you know then I that's another argument another way of tackling the problem

644
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:01,680
of panpsychism is you say well let's look at the mechanism what these parts of the brain

645
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:07,280
that we know are generating conscious states like these homeostatic brain stem mechanisms

646
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:14,640
let's look at what you know what they're doing there's a very particular kind of functionality

647
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,520
there a very specific mechanism which is not you know you don't find it in everything there are

648
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:28,240
many things which exist which are not displaying active inference in other words they're not

649
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:35,360
trying to model their environments in order to in order to persist and you know if that is the

650
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,840
mechanism of the one and only knowable form of consciousness which is ours you know we we know

651
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:48,480
that the the brain stem mechanisms that generate our consciousness they seem to be doing this kind

652
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,240
of thing we can then look to every other creature that has similar mechanisms which by the way is

653
01:15:54,240 --> 01:16:01,200
all vertebrates and we can make testable predictions we can say I predict if I stimulate dorsal

654
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:09,280
periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish you know it it won't like it it will avoid the stimulus if I

655
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:15,520
stimulate the the ventral periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish it will like it and it will approach

656
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:21,600
the stimulus and the prediction is confirmed so you know that's that's that's and that happens

657
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:27,600
every time in every creature that has the same architecture as us that we know generates

658
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:33,280
affective basic feeling states in us all the evidence suggests that they're doing the same

659
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,880
thing in these other creatures and also that they can make choices you know the the behavior of the

660
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,480
animals is consistent with our understanding and then there are other creatures which don't have the

661
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:52,720
same architecture like cephalopods and insects and so on there I'm less sure that they're conscious

662
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,200
you know I'm not saying they're not I'm just less sure and I I use the criterion of well

663
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:05,280
can they make choices can they feel their way through a novel situation and survive it and

664
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:12,240
they can so you know well possibly they're conscious too but there are many creatures

665
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,760
simple simpler creatures like bacteria whose behavior is completely predictable there's you see

666
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:26,480
no new ideas coming from a bacterium you know the only way that they that they advance is is

667
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:34,240
through over generations through through natural selection you there's there's no there's no new

668
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:42,880
problem solving you know so I'm saying that even in living things Tevin starting with myself there

669
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:50,480
lots of my own bodily processes that I know from my own case are not conscious and then I know which

670
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:57,120
parts are generative of consciousness I know what those do roughly speaking I know what their

671
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:08,800
functionality is when I test in other animals the prediction arising from the the the inference

672
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:16,160
that those structures and that mechanism is what gives rise to two feelings the predictions are

673
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:24,560
always confirmed where those are not present in living creatures that those structures and those

674
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:31,360
functions the prediction again is always confirmed that they don't show the functionality that that

675
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:39,280
seems to underpin consciousness in us then you know that's so so compelling but then you know to go

676
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:46,560
from that to non-living things I mean to claim that non-living things are conscious it's you just

677
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,200
outside of the not only the bounds of testability you're outside of the bounds of reasonableness

678
01:18:53,200 --> 01:19:00,720
just like why would you say that and you know starting from the observables that's where that's

679
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:06,320
the conclusion you just have to arrive at if you start from first principles and you say well

680
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:13,760
it's possible that there's something it is like to be anything then well yeah it's possible

681
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:20,800
but anything's possible I don't see any reason why one would hold that view

682
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:27,200
unless one starts from the assumption that consciousness is a fundamental property of the

683
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:34,400
universe which I have to say is not not not different from the idea of God yeah that at the

684
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,800
time of the Big Bang there was a consciousness maybe but that's outside of science you know to

685
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,600
those kinds of claims that if you think about it that's something that people like Julia Tononi

686
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:52,320
and Christoph Koch have done fundamentally taking consciousness as phi they can't get as far as

687
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:59,840
fundamental and doing a lot of but I think they did it in a different way so so like let's take

688
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:09,680
Tononi's case as you've just said the the the idea that consciousness can be can be can be

689
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:19,360
objectified as as a quantity of of integrated information processing if you hold that theory

690
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:27,200
then it leads you down some some rabbit holes that you then have to go down you know because if you

691
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:34,000
say well okay the amount of integration in the information processing is what determines the

692
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,440
degree of consciousness then you have to say well there's no there's no you know as long as there's

693
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:47,120
any amount of information processing there must be some degree of consciousness and conversely

694
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:54,000
you have to say anything that has the requisite you know number must be conscious therefore

695
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:03,040
any highly integrated information processing system like the internet you know my theory

696
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:11,200
with me if I'm Tononi my theory requires me to say yep the internet's conscious yes so

697
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,880
fundamentally information at this point which is how a lot of people are seeing it

698
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:25,520
then in essence everything has a level of fire yes everything has that you know what's what's

699
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:33,120
what's a curious little historical fact is that charmers you know I'll tell you something

700
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,400
else which is another curious fact many people who bang on about the hard problem of consciousness

701
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:45,680
have never read charmers' paper you know if you actually read charmers' paper there's this thing

702
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,560
that I'm going to tell you now there's another thing which I'll tell you as an aside at the end

703
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,440
of the paper charmers says the hard problem is hard but there's no reason to believe that it will

704
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:03,280
forever remain insoluble and he then you know so he's saying it is soluble and and and he even goes

705
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:09,760
so far as to then present a possible solution and this is the thing I was going to say

706
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:19,920
his possible solution is that all information has a subjective aspect and that is consciousness

707
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:26,000
and it has an objective aspect which is this mechanistic thing that we see you know it depends

708
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,720
what kind of substrate you're using but like our computers there they are they're processing

709
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:37,280
information but the being of the computer says charmers you know because it's an information

710
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:43,040
processing device that there is some small amount of consciousness associated with it because the

711
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,440
internal aspect of information is consciousness therefore because information processing has

712
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,640
been going on since forever consciousness has been around since forever and it's a fundamental

713
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:00,720
property of the universe so I don't want to lose sight of the aside I've made there please note

714
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:07,120
charmers says the hard problem can be solved he said it himself in 1995 so all these people who

715
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:13,520
revere this problem has been completely insoluble that it's a metaphysical problem which can never

716
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:19,680
be solved by physical science that's not what charmers said but he then proposes his own theory

717
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:24,720
which is a panpsychist theory which is when it's something approaching a panpsychist theory he

718
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:33,840
doesn't say everything is conscious he says all information is conscious which is a which is a

719
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:40,240
reasonable place to start because what we know about the brain and the mind what they have in

720
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:45,760
common is that they're processing information you know and not everything in the universe is

721
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:51,280
processing information so you know that's why it's approaches or heads in the direction of

722
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:58,640
but now here's the rub for me if you read so information in Shannon's sense

723
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,800
which is the sense in which charmers uses the word he actually says so in that paper

724
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:15,040
so Shannon's paper which brought information into the concept of information into into physics into

725
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:23,280
the idea that there's a quantifiable thing called information and that it has causal property

726
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:33,040
does stuff you know in the physical world that for that realization and conceptualization of it

727
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:39,360
we have to thank Claude Shannon and you read his paper which was published in if I remember

728
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:46,640
correctly 1948 it's called the title says it all it says a mathematical theory of communication

729
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:53,040
it's not a theory of information it's a theory of communication because why information has to

730
01:24:53,040 --> 01:25:00,560
have a source and a receiver it's information doesn't just exist information something is only

731
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:08,160
informative to a receiver of that information so information and I'm speaking pure Shannon here

732
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:16,880
information is an answer to a question you know it's is is the coin toss heads or tails you know

733
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:25,200
is it heads yes or no that's one or zero you know that is the binary digit that is the bit that is

734
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:32,160
the quantum how we quantify information so how many questions I have to ask determines how much

735
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:40,400
information I receive from from my interaction with with my environment so this information

736
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:50,560
exchange is a question asking and answering exercise and the crucial point is that the information is

737
01:25:50,560 --> 01:26:00,240
subjective it's received by me who asked the question the the the system doesn't and a system

738
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:06,720
doesn't contain an objective amount of information it depends on what question you're asking of the

739
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:16,960
system so you know so the the very same I mean if for example there's a bag of of balls and we

740
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,960
you and I both know that the yellow red and blue ones in there and we know that they're 30 balls

741
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:30,240
I know that 10 of them are red you don't know that that that bag contains more information

742
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:36,320
for you than it does for me you know so it depends on it depends on how so information is a measure

743
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:45,440
of of uncertainty the more the more unpredictable is the outcome of an event the more information

744
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:51,920
that carries for the observer of the event and you and I might have more or less prior knowledge

745
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,720
so that will be more or less predictable or unpredictable to us so so the why this is also

746
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:05,120
important is that when you speak about information whether you're charmers or you to know me you

747
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:10,880
have to ask yourself the question of well who is the recipient of this information and so you're

748
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,720
back to the question of well where's the subject with like in the internet where's the subject

749
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:24,480
or the conscious subject of all of this information processing it's integrated you know for what it's

750
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:31,280
so it's just like a very weird way of thinking about I think to say that information in and of

751
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:38,880
itself you know is is or the integration of that information in some objective arms length sense

752
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:45,440
you know is is the mechanism of consciousness I think misses the point so so my way of thinking

753
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,720
about it which I tried in a very brief and rough and ready way a few minutes ago when I

754
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:58,880
spoke about Carl Friston and my work on this problem our starting point was well an infam

755
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:06,480
a self-organizing system which has to predict the behavior of the world has to ask questions of the

756
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:13,600
world you know is if I were to do this what would happen kind if I were to do this what would

757
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:21,520
happen to my free energy is basically the question that every every biological self-organizing system

758
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:29,520
has to constantly ask so the information processing that gives rise to feeling in my view is that kind

759
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:36,240
of information it's not all information it's infam it's it's it's it's it's it's it's the

760
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:43,280
answering of questions by systems that give a damn about that they need to ask questions and they

761
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:50,640
give a damn about the answers that is I think the kind of system that is the information processing

762
01:28:50,640 --> 01:29:00,080
within which can can can can can feasibly or plausibly rather be be conceptualized as a as a

763
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:08,640
sentient system I must like for example mark on when I came into this podcast so when I first

764
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,160
started thinking about consciousness I'm very much on a similar page as you I think I think we're both

765
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:19,520
very monist physicalist we're trying to reduce it trying to figure out a nice biological approach

766
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:25,680
to it but I must say someone who came very close to really changing that my mind on that a little bit

767
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:33,200
was Donald Hoffman I don't know if you're familiar with his work yes I'm not in detail but yes I know

768
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:39,040
the basic ideas yeah so it's pretty fascinating to see that a lot of physicists nowadays are

769
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:45,760
starting to show that space time itself is not a concept that we can actually understand or

770
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:52,480
really even perceive in any real way and and therefore well now when he takes it further

771
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:58,320
by obviously making the his own conclusion that conscious agents must be fundamental

772
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,680
so that's a separate story but what is a bit strange is the fact that physicists are not

773
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:09,520
showing us that the reality that we're trying to reduce is not a reality that is possibly

774
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,640
reducible because we see we have absolutely no access to this reality what do you think about that

775
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:27,120
well um so if you if you you or any of our viewers read my book in in in the penultimate

776
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:36,240
chapter it's titled back to the cortex and there I speak about so the most of the book is about

777
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:41,680
effort it's about you know this fundamental form of consciousness and how it is generated and

778
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:46,640
what that what the implication oh sorry it's not the penultimate chapter it's the third last chapter

779
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:52,640
the second last chapter is on charmers and the hard problem the last chapter is on artificial

780
01:30:52,640 --> 01:31:00,160
consciousness the third last chapter is on this this this this question of of cognitive and

781
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:06,080
perceptual consciousness you know the the type of consciousness that that we have for for the most

782
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:13,520
part focused on and there I make the argument which is again not not a a novel argument it's

783
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:19,040
it's very similar to Hoffman's although I don't cite him because actually I'm embarrassed to admit

784
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:25,600
I didn't yet know his work at the time that I was writing that book but I was aware of other

785
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:33,280
people in the predictive processing tradition you know like like Andy Clark and and and and

786
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:39,680
Jacob Huey uh speaking about you know perception as controlled hallucination

787
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:47,760
and that you know the the reality and and Dan Dennett uh you know the this whole thing of the

788
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:54,640
the use illusion and so on and I find yeah and Neil Seth I mean that whole group of him

789
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:01,280
and Neil Seth is in that same tradition and Neil Seth extends it from the extra receptive

790
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:08,160
domain to the inter receptive domain in very interesting ways um actually if we have time

791
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:15,520
I will come back to that because I think that the that that that affect is not the same as

792
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:22,320
interception you know I I have a little a little quibble about that but I don't think it's important

793
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:28,640
for our present purposes so what I'm saying is that in that tradition with although Hoffman

794
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:33,760
doesn't come up from a predictive processing background I think it's it's it's it's entirely

795
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:43,760
compatible you know the idea that the reality that we are that we are acting in is a representation

796
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:50,560
of the of of something in my language beyond the mark of blankets all I can know is my blanket

797
01:32:50,560 --> 01:33:01,600
states and that that is a that is a statistical generative model you know of of of the of reality

798
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:07,840
minutes you could even say can't it's a cantium view you know I have no problem with that whatsoever

799
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:16,160
so but you know I don't think it's a and is anything spooky about that and and I don't think

800
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:24,960
that it requires us I mean all you need to say is the retina the retinal ronson cones

801
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:33,360
light waves impinge on the retina and the those cells transduced those light waves into nerve

802
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:41,920
impulses so what we um you know you never actually are you're not that you're not receiving light

803
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:48,400
waves you are representing them as spike trains you know that that's enough for me it can see

804
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:53,280
there's nothing spooky there you know and those spike trains all they are are ones and zeros so

805
01:33:53,280 --> 01:34:01,520
from that I then have to infer the the the the causes of these of these sensations in other

806
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:07,840
words of these signals and I and I model it you know I'm perfectly fine with that

807
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:16,880
so I but but you know I don't see why that leads to all kinds of spooky conclusions that's

808
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:23,360
that's there are few steps beyond that that I don't think follow when I spoke to Donald when I

809
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,000
asked him about it because I mean a lot of us in biology in neuroscience we know that we don't

810
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,680
see reality every radical sort of truth we sort of represent something but his physics and his

811
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:38,880
work with a couple other mathematicians show that spacetime is fundamentally completely different

812
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:44,800
so we're not even seeing a mild representation or like something similar to reality or close

813
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:50,480
it's completely different but he does eventually say that however his conclusion that consciousness

814
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:55,760
must be fundamental is something he's willing to accept might be wrong he's just trying to figure

815
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,880
out a different solution so he actually doesn't take it to that point where he he claims that

816
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:06,480
consciousness is fundamental he's just trying to find some relative because reality is the problem

817
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,000
in essence we don't we know a lot about mind but we know almost nothing about matter pretty much

818
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:21,200
yeah I wouldn't but by the way as you can see my lights came on so so hallelujah the the load

819
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:27,840
shedding has ended for I hope my doesn't see what happens yes let's hope there's not a reciprocal

820
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:35,680
interaction between where you are and where I am but look there's there's much that I could say

821
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:47,840
about about quantum physics and that the seriously strange nature of reality and how

822
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:54,560
utterly different it is from the from the high level average states that we are able to represent

823
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:02,240
and so on you know that and those things all interest me very much I I will just say about

824
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:10,800
that that the the the approach that Carl Friston and I take which is the free energy principle

825
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:17,680
approach it's called variational free energy this is this is you know there's there's

826
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:23,200
thermodynamic free energy and there's chemical free energy and then there's informational free

827
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:32,400
energy and and some people no less than chains for example thinks the informational free energy is

828
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:42,080
is the fundamental explanation of the thing the all of those are probabilistic it's a probabilistic

829
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:47,920
theory the variational free energy has to do with statistical mechanics it has to do with

830
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:54,400
probabilities when I was speaking earlier about you know your uncertainty and the palpating of

831
01:36:54,400 --> 01:37:00,240
your uncertainty and all of that we're talking about probabilities and so I think that there's a

832
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:07,600
very deep link is that there's a I think that the the whole free energy principle inherits from

833
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:16,880
the traditions that that have replaced Newtonian physics so there's there's that in all of that

834
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:23,280
interests me very much but I in the time remaining to us I would rather because I'm aware we have

835
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:29,840
limited time remaining I would rather start with this observation which is which is more concrete

836
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:41,120
you know I'm a clinician I work with neurological and neurosurgical patients every day and so I

837
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:48,320
witness you know what happens if a piece of your brain is missing and I've been around for a sufficient

838
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:54,800
number of years to have seen many many many patients with the same piece of their brain missing

839
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:01,280
and the curious or the interesting fact is that they all misperceive reality in the same way you

840
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:09,600
know that that's for example an excellent example is right parietal low patients who

841
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,920
they paralyzed on the left side and they believe they're not and it's patently obvious that they

842
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:23,840
are you know but they say no I'm not and so you know you see one and another and another and

843
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,560
eventually you realize hang you know if you haven't got a right parietal low you just there's a piece

844
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,760
of reality that you just don't get and never can get why because you've got a piece of your

845
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:40,400
brain missing that you need in order to be able to get that so you can from that observation

846
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:47,680
you can you can extrapolate that well all of us have a piece of our brains missing in the sense

847
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:53,520
that you know we we only have this what if we were to all have an additional lobe or an additional

848
01:38:53,520 --> 01:39:00,080
hemisphere how much more would we be able to to register and compute and comprehend you know

849
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:07,920
than we currently do so so all I'm saying there is that I again on the basis of my own empirical

850
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:16,320
clinical experience you know I'm totally ready to believe that we have a horribly limited

851
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:27,600
conception and perception of reality I'm totally sympathetic with that however you know we are

852
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:33,040
where we are so you can either say okay I'm going to become a mystic you know because I don't do

853
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,120
anything I'm just going to believe everything or you know it's all you all you say well you know

854
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:48,720
given given the limited nature of my instrument you know I must do the best I can to to to expand

855
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:57,360
its bounds to test my hypotheses and you know be ready to find that my predictions were wrong

856
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:04,560
and I must update my predictive model and so on I didn't see what else we can do I so so so although

857
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:12,800
I am totally aware of the limits of the of the human brain it's just obvious from what I've just

858
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:20,960
said and of the limits of science because it's a method it's a it's a method ultimately you have

859
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:26,320
to have we were talking about idealism and never got back to it but you know ultimately you have

860
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:33,360
to have faith and I use that word advisedly that there is some reality beyond what I'm perceiving

861
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:41,120
that I'm probing and that you know I that I that the the the inferences that I draw

862
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:49,280
and the models that I build each time are less bad you know that that I that they they they

863
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:58,480
of course they're not reality of course they are a pathetic you know scrap of what we are

864
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:05,360
capable of grasping of the nature of the universe really but it's but we're making progress each

865
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:13,280
of us in our own lives and as a species over generations we have less bad models less less

866
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:20,400
bad understandings and but it is all based on faith you know that that this method is a reasonable

867
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:27,840
way of of proceeding um it is a matter you know you rarely can say well because it's so limited

868
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:34,720
because it's so so um unknowable reality in itself and all of that I'm just going to give up

869
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:40,400
that that's another approach that but I would rather take the scientific approach I just think

870
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:46,080
we need to have humility as scientists and recognize how how little we know but the very

871
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:56,960
physics that Hoffman um um sites as evidence for how little we know is the product of that method

872
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:04,080
you know that it has led us to know that reality is weird and it is very different from from how

873
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:09,920
we perceive it but but you know Hoffman couldn't have couldn't have come to that view if it wasn't

874
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,360
for the application of the scientific method to arrive at that physics in the first place when

875
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,360
Hoffman when Hoffman so apparently he did the calculations and he and he asked like what are

876
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:24,880
the probabilities of that our perception of reality would give us an accurate representation

877
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:30,800
of reality based on natural selection and fitness and actually evolving and surviving

878
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,280
and when you when you when you notice that the probability came to zero apparently had to take

879
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:40,400
a seat because he's very much a scientist and he loves the scientific method natural selection

880
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:45,440
all of it so you're here to take a seat because it like messed him up with his fundamental

881
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:51,200
perception of reality because he was very much materialistic thinker in terms of consciousness

882
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:57,840
and so it's on that note if what are you you spoke about faith there Mark I mean part of

883
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,800
this podcast also is for the people questioning these big topics often are trying to also find

884
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,920
meaning and purpose while not understanding what's really going on what are what are your

885
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:15,520
religious or spiritual beliefs and first of all I want to come back one step in our conversation

886
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:23,840
to this materialist the idea of materialist and mind versus matter and so on you know I to me

887
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:30,240
mind and matter are the same as what I was saying earlier when I said that there's a there's a

888
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:38,320
dual aspect to our monistic essence matter for me is an aspect in other words I don't think

889
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:44,000
matter is a fundamental property I think matter is a way of representing things and and that's

890
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,760
entirely consistent also with the the the the recent physics that we were talking about earlier

891
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:59,760
matter is not a fundamental property of the universe and the the the the so I'm not a

892
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:08,960
materialist this segues into your question now you know I I'm not a materialist I'm a dual aspect

893
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:16,400
monist who says that the material and the ideal that these are two different ways of knowing

894
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,840
of perceiving something which is ultimately unknowable and that's what you and I have just

895
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,040
been talking about the limits of science the humility that scientists have to have in the face

896
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:37,360
you know of the of the of the massive uncertainties in the universe so so my spiritual position

897
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:45,600
arises from that in other words it's one of humility I'm sorry maybe you've got the impression of me

898
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:55,360
as a kind of a pompous or noisy guy I don't know it might be hard for you to to equate

899
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:03,360
my my personality with humility but it really it is as a scientist and as as a spiritual being

900
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:11,120
my not only is it my belief that I even find solace in it Tevin I find solace in

901
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:17,600
what I don't know think I what I know I don't know you know these things are way beyond my can

902
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,720
questions like what happens after I die they're not empirical questions I can't

903
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:30,000
any prediction I come up with I can't test it until I'm dead you know so so and I accept that

904
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:37,600
and I say again I take I take comfort in it is there a god you know is there an afterlife

905
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:45,520
what does it all mean you know I genuinely don't know and and and so it's a kind of an

906
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:53,120
agnostic position but it is not a materialist and not an atheist position yes but but within that

907
01:45:54,080 --> 01:46:00,640
within those parameters and I'm sorry I'm sort of repeating myself I then have to say okay

908
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:07,760
given those limitations what is to be done and I say well you've got to do the best you can with

909
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:16,000
what you've got and so you know so the best I've been able to come up with is science you know I've

910
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,720
read okay which of these things you know which of these things gives me the greatest confidence that

911
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:28,240
well yeah I might find answers or at least I might find less ignorance that's that's the

912
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:36,640
approach that that that I take and fully fully aware of the limits of the you know the limits of

913
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:42,160
the conclusions that I can come to now within that frame of reference and this is probably

914
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:47,120
be the last thing that we'll talk about I in other words using a scientific

915
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:55,520
methodology a scientific epistemology to to try to address these questions

916
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:04,960
I I think that our values you know I was talking much earlier in our conversation about

917
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:10,560
the fundamental value system of living things is that it's good to survive and bad not to

918
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:22,800
that that built upon those fundamental values or other also phenotypic values you know like

919
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:30,240
it's like it's it's bad to be in danger that's fear you know it's it's it's irritating and

920
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:37,520
frustrating to have an impeding things preventing you from that's that's rage you know that it's

921
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:43,600
bad to separate a little dependent creature from its caregiver you know that that's got to do with

922
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:54,560
attachment bonds and so on I think that these evolved endophenotypes is a word that's sometimes

923
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:00,560
used for them that they are they are basic values that we have just because we're living things and

924
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:07,360
that they are then more elaborated values that we have just because we are mammals and I think

925
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:14,320
that these provide and you know it's famously said that you can't derive an orc from an is

926
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:20,640
but I think that from these is is we can derive some orcs like I've just done bad to separate bad

927
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:28,480
to bad to injure people or injure living things it's bad to it's bad to for sentient things rather

928
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:35,120
it's bad to to separate mammals from their caregivers it's it's bad to to to you know

929
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:41,920
unnecessarily frustrated and be sentient beings and so on I think that our much more elaborated

930
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:50,480
human value systems which of course have evolved also to to to manage much more artificial

931
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:58,080
environments for which we were not evolutionarily prepared like like like like you know

932
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:05,280
agricultural and permanent settlements and and everything that flowed from that

933
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:12,320
in a private property and all of that there's a lot more that's that the values that we've

934
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:18,240
built on top of those phenotypic values but I think those phenotypic values and biological

935
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:24,480
values are the starting point of all of our values all of our values they're not they're not the

936
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:32,560
values of the universe they are our the values of us living things who have skin in the game

937
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:39,040
I look I love that mark I mean look you didn't come across as pompous or arrogant in any way

938
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,960
and neither does you I'm relieved I loved reading it I enjoyed it so much I mean

939
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:48,480
there's something Raymond Tellis once said I like this term he says he's ontologically agnostic

940
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:54,800
but I mean epistemologically we trust science the most is what what you're basically trying to say

941
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,720
that's right that's right no Mark thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed

942
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:08,560
myself thank you more words from your side well thank you very much and apologies again as you

943
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:15,600
can see I've lost my this is uh this is how unpredictable and uncertain the world is yeah

944
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:22,000
but I'm very glad to be speaking to you as a fellow South African and I'm glad that we are both

945
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:30,080
here these are the problems that belong to me and I'm very happy to be grappling with them

946
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:36,720
yeah and proud to know that that that that you're a South African your podcast is just great

947
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:39,840
thanks Stephen for inviting me
