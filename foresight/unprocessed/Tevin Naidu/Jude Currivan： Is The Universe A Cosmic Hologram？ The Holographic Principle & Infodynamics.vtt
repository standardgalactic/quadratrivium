00:00.000 --> 00:16.640
Hello. Hi, Jude. How are you? I'm fine, Terv. How are you doing? I'm great. I'm so excited

00:16.640 --> 00:20.240
for this interview. I mean, I've been absorbing so much of your information over the past

00:20.240 --> 00:25.760
couple of this past few days. And as last week, it's been, it's been amazing. Our husband

00:25.760 --> 00:32.240
on your side? Yeah, no, it's, it's great here. I mean, during the summer, I'm sort of getting

00:32.240 --> 00:38.400
to a point now with the end of this month, it's been so full on that I'm really looking forward

00:38.400 --> 00:43.280
to taking an in-breath, hopefully for a couple of months, which means I, there's a lot I'm feeling

00:43.280 --> 00:49.440
coming in. So I really want to be open and have the space to really, you know, appreciate that and

00:50.240 --> 00:55.280
try and sort of have a sense of what it is all about. I mean, I can imagine your work is, is

00:55.280 --> 01:00.320
absolutely fascinating. There's so many different topics we could discuss today. I can only imagine

01:00.320 --> 01:05.360
the inundated emails you're probably receiving from so many people who are keen to hear about your

01:05.360 --> 01:12.160
work. Bless you. Well, it's, well, it's very busy in a really good way, because I do feel

01:12.160 --> 01:18.720
that we're so much flowing that, you know, now is the time. And people, you know, are really

01:20.720 --> 01:28.080
needing to have some hope that's authentic, to have some sense of an underpinning and a framing

01:28.080 --> 01:35.680
to a sort of a healed worldview, you know, not a fragmented perspective based on the old paradigm,

01:35.680 --> 01:42.800
but the, but the evidence-based authenticity of something that can really, you know, empower us

01:42.800 --> 01:47.360
to come together, you know, because that's the time, isn't it? And I know for sure. I mean, I'm

01:47.360 --> 01:52.560
great. I'm grateful that you've started already, because I mean, I love to just get started. And

01:52.560 --> 01:58.800
at this point, I think the question I want to ask you, you talk about this cosmic hologramdude

01:58.800 --> 02:03.760
and governed by information. I think let's explore this idea. I mean, it's been around for many years.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.480
It's been around for decades, millennia in fact. But only now do we see a growing body of evidence

02:10.480 --> 02:14.800
that supports this idea. And I think it would be amazing for the listeners and viewers to

02:15.520 --> 02:21.360
listen to this evidence and for you to express yourself in a nice open platform where the listeners

02:21.360 --> 02:25.840
and viewers can appreciate it. And just by the way, the audience are generally very technical

02:25.840 --> 02:30.320
for this podcast. So go into as much detail as you want. Don't shy away from the physics.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.040
Yeah, just I'm curious, this cosmic hologram and everything about it. I'm looking forward to this.

02:38.080 --> 02:43.760
Okay, well, there's probably a couple of convergent points to be making here. But let's

02:43.760 --> 02:48.720
let's talk about the holographic principle to start with, because that really, as you say,

02:48.720 --> 02:55.600
it's been around for a while now. And the sort of very early intimations of it really date back

02:55.680 --> 03:02.560
to David Bohm. So we're talking about, you know, for if not five decades, as a sense of what this

03:02.560 --> 03:09.200
might mean. But of course, the big move forward came when researchers were looking into the

03:09.200 --> 03:16.480
thermodynamics of black holes, and people like Gerrata Hooft and Leonard Suskin and Jacob Beckenstein

03:16.480 --> 03:24.800
and others. And the question really was what happens to the information that's actually,

03:24.880 --> 03:30.640
you know, making up a massive star, when at the end of its life, its nuclear fuel runs out,

03:31.280 --> 03:36.000
and it collapses. And of course, the collapse is so gravitationally powerful that it actually

03:36.000 --> 03:41.360
collapses within an event horizon. And therefore not even light can escape. I know there's a

03:41.360 --> 03:46.880
nuance with that with the with Stephen Stephen Hawkins work. But essentially, you know, you're

03:46.880 --> 03:52.720
not even like an escape. And so at the event horizon, you suddenly get this blackness

03:53.520 --> 03:58.720
that we term a black hole. And of course, was the star collapses, a spherical star

03:58.720 --> 04:05.040
collapses as a spherical black hole. So the idea was, well, the is infant, first of all,

04:05.040 --> 04:11.360
is the information lost? Because if it was lost, that would blow quantum physics out the water,

04:11.360 --> 04:16.800
literally. So there's a huge debate about firewalling and what's happening all of that. But as time has

04:16.880 --> 04:22.800
moved on, that has more and more evidence has suggested that actually no, the evidence, the

04:22.800 --> 04:29.040
information is actually held at the event horizon. But then the big question was, well,

04:30.080 --> 04:34.960
what is that information? And when calculations were done that related it to the thermodynamics

04:35.760 --> 04:42.320
of the of the black hole, it was realized that the it was that the information was proportional,

04:42.320 --> 04:48.880
not to the spherical volume of the black hole, but the surface area of the event horizon. And

04:48.880 --> 04:56.960
then a few light bulbs went off. Because that is very, you know, you know, reflective of what

04:56.960 --> 05:03.360
happens when on on Earth, we create technologically create a hologram, you know, take a beam of light,

05:03.360 --> 05:09.840
we split it into part of the beam is is focused on an object, it's bounced off the object and it

05:09.840 --> 05:16.640
collects information in that reflected light from the object. It then combines with the initial

05:16.640 --> 05:21.920
beam to form a two dimensional pattern of information that actually looks like an oil

05:21.920 --> 05:27.600
slick. If you actually look at one at that point in its process, it looks like an oil slick. But

05:27.600 --> 05:36.400
it's basically a wonderful ability of our universe to be able to transform information into waveforms

05:36.400 --> 05:42.080
and waveforms into information through Fourier transforms. And this is absolutely critical,

05:42.080 --> 05:49.680
not just to our human made technological holograms, but also how the holographic principle works at

05:49.680 --> 05:54.080
the universal level, which we can come on to. But so essentially, there was a realization,

05:54.080 --> 05:59.760
you've got this two dimensional informational pattern. And when you throw another beam of light

05:59.760 --> 06:05.040
through it, it projects what we call a hologram. And the point of the hologram that it projects is

06:05.120 --> 06:12.160
that the whole is in every pixelation. So if we have a high definition, pixelation, then we,

06:12.800 --> 06:18.560
you know, all the wholeness, if it's an apple, for example, you get minuscule apples throughout

06:18.560 --> 06:24.640
the whole hologram. But taking this now to our universe, it was realized that from black holes,

06:24.640 --> 06:29.760
we could extend this, what became known as the holographic principle to the whole universe.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.640
And we could go back into the evidence for this, because there is compelling evidence now at,

06:34.640 --> 06:39.280
you know, all scales of existence and many different fields of research. But the sense

06:39.280 --> 06:45.520
is that the appearance of our universe, the energy matter and space time appearance of our

06:45.520 --> 06:53.600
universe is not its more fundamental nature. But the appearance arises from this deeper realm

06:53.600 --> 07:01.760
of causation as meaningful in formation. And I always hyphenize in formation to sort of really

07:01.760 --> 07:08.720
emphasize its meaningful nature. But that meaningful information is actually accumulated

07:08.720 --> 07:14.800
on the boundary of what we call space time, and then holographically manifested as the

07:14.800 --> 07:21.840
appearance of our universe. So if we go back 13.8 billion years to the very first moment

07:21.840 --> 07:29.200
of space time, not in a big bang, we know it wasn't big. I mean, that was Fred Hall being very

07:29.200 --> 07:34.240
facetious. But you know that the implication of a bang, it wasn't, it was incredibly fine

07:34.240 --> 07:42.160
tuned and ordered, it began in its lowest informational state. So as time has flowed forward

07:42.160 --> 07:47.680
ever since because of that entropic flow began its lowest informational state.

07:48.880 --> 07:54.480
As time has flowed forward and spaces expanded, that holographic principle

07:54.480 --> 08:00.560
allied to other laws of physics that we can come on to has meant that our universe has been able to

08:00.560 --> 08:07.440
undertake this evolutionary arc from simplicity to ever greater levels of complexity, experience,

08:08.080 --> 08:14.640
evolutionary potential, individuation, self awareness at those levels. Yeah, that's the

08:14.640 --> 08:20.480
story of our universe, because that first moment, not of a big bang, but the first moment of a big

08:20.560 --> 08:27.520
breath, an ongoing big breath. And the reason that space has to expand is because that is where

08:28.080 --> 08:34.960
the accumulation of the emergent evolutionary information is held. So space didn't expand.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.280
There could not be more and more and more and more information able to be expressed in its

08:41.280 --> 08:48.480
evolutionary arc. And of course, what happens is the pixelation of the holographic boundary of our

08:48.480 --> 08:56.800
universe as Jacob Beckenstein understood is pixelated at Planck scale. So in that sense,

08:56.800 --> 09:05.280
our universe is the reality of our universe comes into form at the Planck scale, which is a basic

09:05.280 --> 09:11.840
measures of space and time and energy matter as a result and temperature. And so it all hangs

09:11.840 --> 09:17.840
together. But that pixelation scale, that Planck scale pixelation at a spatial level

09:18.640 --> 09:24.560
is as small as to a nucleus of a hydrogen atom as a hydrogen nuclei, nucleus is to the whole

09:24.560 --> 09:32.320
universe is 10 to the minus 35 meters, it's trillions of trillions of times more minute than

09:32.320 --> 09:39.440
our best high definition of human holograms. And the point is that so that is the way that is

09:39.680 --> 09:44.080
what we call the boundary of what we call space, the holographic boundary

09:44.080 --> 09:50.400
is able to encode more and more cosmic and universal information. But the point is also

09:50.400 --> 09:58.640
that the flow of time itself at every Planck scale temporal pixelation, which is 10 to the minus

09:58.640 --> 10:06.800
44 seconds, get your head around that, you know, it's like every that every Planck scale time is

10:06.880 --> 10:15.600
like adding another, you know, another movement of the whole universe's emergence. Of course,

10:15.600 --> 10:20.480
it is so minute that it's rather like us watching a television screen, you know,

10:20.480 --> 10:25.280
the pixelation is small to us. So we see the whole image, we don't see the pixels. Well,

10:25.280 --> 10:30.640
this is the pixelation of the universe, our universe's reality. So that's a start anyway.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.560
I mean, it's a brilliant start. And I love the way you articulate this because it makes it a lot

10:34.560 --> 10:38.640
easier for people to understand when you're talking about the fact that it's obviously

10:39.440 --> 10:43.360
expanding in the terms of the way while in the way that we used to express it. But now you're

10:43.360 --> 10:48.080
talking about it as information rather than matter in the same way we usually discuss it.

10:48.080 --> 10:54.240
People that I've seen a lot of people sort of mistake that for new content arising, whereas

10:54.240 --> 10:58.400
we know that, well, according to the laws of thermodynamics, matter is neither created nor

10:58.400 --> 11:05.920
destroyed. So you talk about entropy rather than entropy. And I do, I do. And as a child,

11:05.920 --> 11:12.640
this is really sad. When I was about seven or eight years old, I was always asking why are the,

11:12.640 --> 11:17.600
at the time it was mainly two laws of thermodynamics. Yeah. But there's a third law,

11:17.600 --> 11:22.720
which is relating to a closed system where the temperature of a closed system is inversely

11:22.800 --> 11:29.360
proportional to its entropy. So my question for a long time was why are the two laws of

11:30.000 --> 11:36.480
thermodynamics? Because, you know, I'm a great follower of one of my great heroes, Albert Einstein,

11:36.480 --> 11:42.560
and to paraphrase Einstein, you know, the universe as simple as it can be, but no simpler. And I add

11:43.120 --> 11:50.320
to fulfill its evolutionary purpose. And that add-on is really key. Because what I realized

11:50.320 --> 11:55.600
when I was writing the Cosmic Hologram, and also more laterally, the story of Gaia,

11:56.400 --> 12:02.800
is we can actually restate those three laws of thermodynamics to what I call three laws of

12:02.800 --> 12:10.720
info dynamics. So the first law, if we go back to the initial, you know, the initial

12:10.720 --> 12:17.680
first of thermodynamics, began, of course, essentially with Boltzmann, saying, as you say,

12:17.680 --> 12:26.240
the energy of a closed system cannot be destroyed or created. It can change through time,

12:26.240 --> 12:34.240
but it cannot be created or destroyed. So if we take the science going further than Boltzmann,

12:36.320 --> 12:41.680
and bless him, I mean, Boltzmann was doing his work before even atoms had been validated. So

12:41.680 --> 12:47.280
he was amazing, again, pioneer and great giant, for which I feel we should all be very, very

12:47.280 --> 12:54.080
grateful. But taking that on, we now know that energy and matter are equivalent equals MC squared.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.800
So that says that the energy matter of a closed system cannot be created or destroyed,

12:59.360 --> 13:05.200
just changed through time. We also, for our laws of physics to work at all, and this is

13:05.200 --> 13:10.480
something that really still some folks struggle with, but all the evidence is really showing us

13:10.480 --> 13:17.200
that our entire universe is a, is a content, I call containered system, because closed system

13:17.200 --> 13:24.080
has a very specific topological perspective, and it can be confusing. So as a containered system

13:24.080 --> 13:31.440
with this sort of holographic perspective, yeah, it means that the energy matter of our universe

13:32.160 --> 13:37.280
from its first moment to its last, and there is also now more and more evidence that it's a finite

13:37.360 --> 13:44.400
life cycle can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change. Now that essentially is the first

13:44.400 --> 13:52.240
law of thermodynamics applied to our universe. But when we also appreciate that in 2012 and since

13:52.240 --> 13:58.880
there have been experiments that have shown that information is every bit as real as any

13:58.880 --> 14:06.240
thermodynamic measurements, so work, heat, etc. So we also now know that we can start to expand that

14:06.240 --> 14:14.400
first law of thermodynamics to a first law of infodynamics, where information expressed as

14:14.400 --> 14:21.680
quantized energy matter can neither be destroyed or created, but just changed through the cycle of

14:21.680 --> 14:27.680
our universe. Now that's fine. Because that in its essence, which is quantum physics, you know,

14:27.680 --> 14:31.840
because of course, energy matter is the domain of quantum physics in description terms.

14:32.800 --> 14:42.720
That's all great, but it has no notion of space or time. So it's the seed, it's the framing for

14:42.720 --> 14:49.760
how our universe can exist. But this then, the second law begins to answer my seven-year-old's

14:49.760 --> 14:54.320
question, why do you need more than one law of thermodynamics? Because the second law,

14:55.040 --> 14:59.360
which you say quite rightly, is about originally the notion of entropy.

15:00.640 --> 15:05.520
So the idea is that the entropy of a closed, I'm going to say containered now just for

15:05.520 --> 15:13.040
consistency, a containered system in, you know, it has to increase over time. And there's been a

15:13.040 --> 15:18.800
lot of misunderstanding about this, because a lot of folks think of entropy as order to disorder.

15:19.360 --> 15:24.640
But what Boltzmann was really talking about was the micro, the energetic microstates of such a

15:24.640 --> 15:31.760
system. And when you think about it, I sometimes use an analogy of a pack of cards, if you take a

15:31.760 --> 15:38.560
pack of cards out of its sort of box, they're very ordered. Yeah, you throw them up in the air and

15:38.560 --> 15:43.680
they land all over the place and you come together and they're not in that initial order. But rather

15:43.680 --> 15:48.640
than order to disorder, you're just increasing the number of states through time. So every time

15:48.640 --> 15:54.960
you throw them up and they land, more and more states are formed. So it's this it's this progress

15:54.960 --> 16:05.440
through time of increasing micro energetic states. But of course, we now also know that we can see

16:05.440 --> 16:12.160
information. And again, we can go into a lot more detail of the evidence for this, as also being

16:12.160 --> 16:19.280
expressed, not just as energy matter in its quantized, its quantized form, but in a complementary

16:19.280 --> 16:26.720
way of space time, that's where the holographic perspective comes in. So that second law then

16:26.720 --> 16:33.760
when applied to our universe can be restated and in informational terms, that first of all,

16:33.760 --> 16:39.360
the entropy, because I'm now talking about information, whereas entropy is about energetic

16:39.440 --> 16:46.640
microstakes, I move from entropy to entropy. It just makes it easier. But the but the equation

16:47.360 --> 16:54.080
that describes the informational content of a container system, and the entropy, the energetic

16:54.080 --> 17:01.280
microstates of a container system is the same equation is originally defined by Boltzmann.

17:01.920 --> 17:08.400
So we're onto something here. And so now if we look at the second law of info dynamics,

17:09.040 --> 17:12.880
it says that the and of course, let me go back to the first law for a second, because I want to

17:12.880 --> 17:19.440
bring in space and time here, because this is vital. So the second law of thermodynamics says

17:19.440 --> 17:26.160
that the entropy of a container system can only increase through time. Okay, and we're talking

17:26.160 --> 17:32.720
about container system here. So now we move into 20th century physics, and we now know the equivalence

17:32.720 --> 17:40.240
of space and time. So relative space and relative time, lovely that they are, have to be conjoined

17:40.240 --> 17:46.000
as invariant space time, if we're going to have a universe that hangs together. Yeah.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.400
And we can actually talk about the universe that hangs together and the laws of physics and all

17:50.400 --> 17:58.000
the rest of it. So we can then expand that first second law of thermodynamics from the entropy

17:58.640 --> 18:05.200
of a container system only increasing through space time to the entropy of a container system

18:05.200 --> 18:13.040
as its information content only increasing in our universe's case through space and time.

18:13.040 --> 18:20.160
So literary space expands and time moves forward, the information content gets bigger and bigger

18:20.160 --> 18:27.520
and bigger. And that's the entropy. Okay. Third law is this is cool. I love this because this

18:27.520 --> 18:33.440
really came to me quite late on. Because I was thinking gosh, why is there a third law? Where

18:33.440 --> 18:39.760
does temperature come into this? But the third law of thermodynamics, as I mentioned, says that the

18:39.760 --> 18:48.400
temperature of a container system and its entropy now entropy are inversely proportionate. So we

18:48.400 --> 18:54.640
now know that our universe began in its highest temperature form at the Planck temperature,

18:54.640 --> 19:02.880
10 to the 32 degrees Kelvin, and its lowest entropy. So as time exploded and space has

19:02.880 --> 19:11.600
expanded, the temperature has dropped. That drop in temperature is allied inversely to the increase

19:11.600 --> 19:17.600
in informational content entropy. It is so simple to have. I mean, it all hangs together in this

19:17.600 --> 19:27.600
glorious way. And then the final cherry on top of it is essentially that I talk about meaningful

19:27.600 --> 19:37.280
information. Yeah. So the wholeness of our universe as meaningfully informed and holographically

19:37.280 --> 19:44.320
manifested, it's framing can be can be done. It can be brought together with these three

19:44.320 --> 19:52.320
laws of infodynamic. The first law is the most simple statement of quantum physics. The second

19:52.320 --> 19:59.440
is simplest form of relativity physics. But together they combine within these three laws

20:00.160 --> 20:07.680
of infodynamics, which with a hyphen, are three laws that bring together our universe that

20:07.680 --> 20:15.760
meaningfully exists and purposefully evolves. I think it's incredible because this is what

20:15.760 --> 20:20.080
we've been searching for for such a long time. People have been looking for a unifying theory

20:20.080 --> 20:24.720
of this universe. I mean, it's been the goal when you think about Stephen Hawken and I know you guys

20:24.720 --> 20:29.120
when you were the youngest participant and you won the award, I can't remember exactly where,

20:29.120 --> 20:34.240
but you obviously met Stephen Hawken at that time many years ago. How old were you 19 at the time?

20:34.240 --> 20:41.120
I was 19. And my my mental was Dennis Sharma, who was Stephen's doctoral supervisor when they're

20:41.120 --> 20:45.920
at Cambridge. And then Dennis came over to Oxford. I was doing my physics at Oxford.

20:45.920 --> 20:51.840
And Dennis, bless him, he just took me under his wing. And after Stephen and Roger Penrose,

20:51.840 --> 20:57.680
who got the Nobel a couple of years ago, came together to present to the postgraduate

20:58.960 --> 21:03.760
department. And Dennis invited me along, even though I was an undergraduate, I was the youngest

21:03.760 --> 21:08.160
person in the room. I think I was the only woman in the room. And then afterwards, Dennis said,

21:08.160 --> 21:11.680
why? Because it was all black holes. They were like, woof, this is coming forward.

21:12.320 --> 21:19.120
And Dennis said, why don't you enter this essay competition? And I said, sure. And he said,

21:19.120 --> 21:25.520
why don't you write about black holes? I went, sure. So I did. And I won the prize.

21:26.560 --> 21:32.800
Was it 25 quid? It was 25 quid. In those days, this was the early 70s. That was beer money for a

21:32.880 --> 21:38.080
term. The reason why I bring that up is, I mean, of course, we think of Stephen Orkin,

21:38.080 --> 21:42.960
we think of theories of everything. I mean, there's unification of quantum mechanics and

21:42.960 --> 21:47.200
spacetime general relativity. How do we combine these concepts? But also, when you think of

21:47.200 --> 21:52.240
Stephen Orkin, you think of black holes, event horizons. I know it's coming forward. It's coming

21:52.240 --> 21:56.720
full circle. It's quite extraordinary. And I want to go into that. I mean, unless you want to address

21:56.720 --> 22:00.000
the evidence first, how would you like to approach it? Would you like to go into black holes now?

22:00.000 --> 22:05.280
First, talk about the holographic principle and how we've gathered more evidence over time

22:05.280 --> 22:08.080
and certain experiments that have helped to solidify this.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.800
Yeah, I'd be happy to. And I think the other thing that's really key in all of this

22:13.520 --> 22:18.640
is that our universe exists and evolves in this way, meaningfully exists, purposefully evolves

22:20.160 --> 22:27.200
in manifested holographically and meaningful information. But the other key aspect of it is

22:27.280 --> 22:35.040
our universe does so as a non-locally unified entity. And this, of course, if we can take a

22:35.040 --> 22:40.720
couple of minutes just to nail this one down, I think, this is something that came out right in

22:40.720 --> 22:45.680
the early days of quantum physics. And many of the quantum physicists were, of course,

22:45.680 --> 22:51.680
scientists mystics, you know, and some of them went to India and started really appreciating

22:52.240 --> 22:58.240
that the Vedic tradition of ancient India, the Rishis, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads,

22:58.240 --> 23:05.600
were basically telling the same story that they were realising. And what became clear

23:05.600 --> 23:13.360
is that for quantum physics, quantum mechanics to work at all, essentially our universe had to be

23:13.360 --> 23:18.800
non-locally unified in its entirety. And of course, you know, Bell came out with his, you know,

23:18.800 --> 23:23.600
sometimes called a theory, sometimes called an inequality. But nonetheless, it was a test bed

23:23.600 --> 23:30.080
for this. And at the time, it was a theoretical perspective. And it was only many, many decades

23:30.080 --> 23:34.800
afterwards, you know, we're talking 70s, 80s onwards, that researchers were able to start

23:34.800 --> 23:40.320
to experimentally test this at greater than quantum scales, because it was clear it was happening at

23:40.320 --> 23:48.000
a quantum scale, but was it able to be expanded to a universal level? So you had researchers

23:48.000 --> 23:54.560
coming along and progressively increasing the scale well beyond any quantum levels to show

23:54.560 --> 24:03.280
entanglement. And in 2017, then 2018, a group of, I think, it might have been four or five

24:03.280 --> 24:10.080
universities, one of which I think the lead was MIT. And what they were able to do was

24:10.080 --> 24:15.760
non-locally entangle photons of light in their laboratory, with starlight from 600 light years

24:15.760 --> 24:21.840
away, but also triggered by light from a quasar, a very active galactic center,

24:21.840 --> 24:28.800
two quasars actually, one I think was 7.8 billion, the other was 12.2 billion light years away.

24:29.440 --> 24:36.480
And that was a triggering that actually created a level of entanglement that exceeded the inequality

24:37.040 --> 24:44.720
test, you know, the thresholds of Bell. But beyond that, in late last year, the Nobel Prize for

24:44.720 --> 24:51.040
Physics were given to three researchers who've been working on this for decades. Anton Zellinga,

24:51.040 --> 24:58.240
who was also part of that MIT collaboration, Alan Aspect and John Clouser. And the Nobel Prize is

24:58.240 --> 25:03.760
only given for settled physics. I often say Einstein didn't get it for relativity, because it was seen

25:03.760 --> 25:09.920
as being quite contentious. He got it for the photoelectric effect. So the fact that we have now

25:10.000 --> 25:13.520
the Nobel, we've got this experimentation at cosmological scales.

25:14.800 --> 25:20.880
You know, we have all of the theoretical framing now to support this and the evidence across many

25:20.880 --> 25:28.240
fields of research that also play into this. You know, it's an amazing and exciting time,

25:28.240 --> 25:34.560
not just for scientists, because as we'll go on, I'm sure, to explore, this is important, this is

25:34.560 --> 25:38.560
vital for everyone. A lot of implications. There's so many practical implications.

25:39.920 --> 25:44.080
Exactly. I mean, when you think about it, as you said, Nobel Prizes are only given to settled

25:44.080 --> 25:49.120
science. And I mean, he got it for the photoelectric effect. He didn't get it for what he's best known

25:49.120 --> 25:53.520
for. And that's pretty incredible, because at the time, of course, I mean, he called it spooky

25:53.520 --> 25:57.680
action at a distance. And we know that he wasn't comfortable with this concept. I mean,

25:58.320 --> 26:02.640
he would have been now because I'm convinced he would have been now because, of course,

26:02.640 --> 26:09.520
you know, he was he and the quantum physicists were working decades before the neutron

26:09.520 --> 26:15.440
was discovered. I mean, let alone the hologram, let alone the cosmological understanding we have,

26:15.440 --> 26:22.320
let alone, you know, the sort of leaps and bounds we've had to understand

26:22.880 --> 26:28.800
the significance, the fundamental significance of information and meaningful information,

26:28.800 --> 26:33.920
which means, of course, the slippery slope. Yes, please, of consciousness. You know,

26:33.920 --> 26:38.560
we have to bring this front and center. Of course, what he did feel very uncomfortable about,

26:38.560 --> 26:44.240
as did Planck and others, is that whereas quantum physics and what they're all come

26:44.880 --> 26:49.360
really gave us the clues that mind and consciousness aren't something we have,

26:49.360 --> 26:54.080
they're literally what we in the whole world are, that was literally pushed to the side.

26:54.720 --> 27:03.360
And so it's taken almost another century and an inability with the old framing to reconcile

27:03.360 --> 27:08.800
quantum physics and relativity physics, because they're at the appearance level of our universe

27:08.800 --> 27:14.240
of energy matter space time, we've needed to understand this deeper level of causation,

27:14.240 --> 27:20.640
which is meaningfully informationally driven, and then being able to show how information

27:20.640 --> 27:26.480
expresses itself in these complementary ways, as the appearance of energy matter quantized energy

27:26.480 --> 27:34.240
matter and entropic space time brought in the holographic principle, you know, I think he'd

27:34.240 --> 27:39.200
be jumping up and down and going, yeah, because he was one of the folks who was saying, you know,

27:39.200 --> 27:42.800
mind and consciousness are what we are, what the whole world is.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.960
I mean, so Jude, I mean, for the listeners and the viewers, I mean,

27:46.960 --> 27:54.720
I was introduced to work by Don Hoffman, and he told me it would be a very fascinating

27:54.720 --> 27:58.880
conversation, and I clearly already is. But I remember when Don and I were talking about it,

27:58.880 --> 28:02.960
he was telling me about your work, and I find it very intriguing, because I mean, Don has such

28:02.960 --> 28:08.400
amazing work being done. They're currently doing the new test to experiment whether physics arises

28:08.400 --> 28:13.440
from consciousness, and I think they just released it yesterday, I think it was, yeah, 26th of June.

28:13.440 --> 28:20.000
So when you talk about consciousness, from an idealism perspective, because this is fundamentally

28:20.000 --> 28:25.520
what the view entails from a philosophical perspective, it's an idealist view of consciousness.

28:25.520 --> 28:32.160
Consciousness is what we are, and everything that there is technically in a sense. How do you work

28:32.160 --> 28:36.720
around this concept of consciousness? How do you define it? How do you explain it to people?

28:36.720 --> 28:40.960
Because obviously, this podcast is called Mind Body Problem, I mean, Mind Body Solution for a reason.

28:42.000 --> 28:49.440
Absolutely. Well, you know, the very terminology, what's consciousness, you know, you'll get

28:49.440 --> 28:56.880
five answers from four people. And I have a very broad church of consciousness. And, you know,

28:56.880 --> 29:02.960
a friend of mine, Professor Max Velmans, differentiates mind and consciousness and

29:02.960 --> 29:08.480
talks about consciousness as a level of awareness. Whereas mind is fundamental, you know, we can

29:08.480 --> 29:14.560
talk about mind as being cosmic mind as Einstein would have called it, the ground of all being,

29:14.560 --> 29:24.160
you know, and so in that regard, our universe is mindful. And, you know, the way I'm working with

29:24.160 --> 29:29.040
this, and my next book will dive deeper into the, you know, the ground of all being and the rest of

29:29.040 --> 29:34.720
it. But both for the cosmic hologram and for the story of Gaia, I really wanted to show how

29:35.440 --> 29:43.520
what I would also refer to as cosmic mind, an eternal and infinite mind, has thoughts,

29:43.600 --> 29:48.160
a thought, thoughts, that, you know, we turn our universe, which is very much,

29:49.360 --> 29:55.520
you know, pervading universal wisdom teachings. And in my own explorations, you know, as a

29:55.520 --> 30:02.960
noetic experiencer all my life is very much the way I've experienced realities. But by

30:03.680 --> 30:08.880
being able to articulate it is as cosmic consciousness, cosmic mind,

30:09.520 --> 30:19.120
expressing itself as the appearance of our universe through the articulation and digitized

30:19.840 --> 30:25.120
meaningful information. You know, I mean, we're almost predisposed to this now because our

30:25.120 --> 30:32.400
communications technologies, you know, take the image of me, gather all the information,

30:32.400 --> 30:38.720
the meaningful information about me, translate it into digitized ones and zeros,

30:39.600 --> 30:47.760
squirt it down a cable of a satellite to your computer, you know, recombine it as an image,

30:48.320 --> 30:54.080
does the same vice versa. You know, this goes back to the incredible attributes of Fourier

30:54.080 --> 31:01.440
transforms, the way our universe can, you know, make this beautiful play of information,

31:02.000 --> 31:08.960
waveforms, it all hangs together. But it hangs together with the evidence showing that it has

31:08.960 --> 31:15.120
innate meaning. This is the key, I think is this is not random data, just as our conversation. Well,

31:15.120 --> 31:21.520
I don't know, some people may say it's random data, but hopefully our conversation is meaningful.

31:21.520 --> 31:28.960
But of course, the meaningful nature of our universe is not dependent in any way on human

31:28.960 --> 31:38.080
sentience. It's a universe that is itself living in that sense, mindful, informational,

31:38.080 --> 31:44.480
where everything in it from, you know, atoms and molecules to planets and plants and people

31:44.480 --> 31:51.360
have a part of that meaning and essential purpose. So it's a broad church,

31:52.560 --> 31:58.800
but it's it's it's innately the same fundamental stuff, the nature of reality.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.200
Jude, how what are your thoughts on Don's work?

32:02.720 --> 32:09.200
I well, when I first got it, it was so lovely because Don and I met at the Science and Nonduality

32:10.160 --> 32:17.040
Conference in in California before the pandemic, and had lunch together and really enjoyed being

32:17.040 --> 32:22.160
together and have had a number of conversations since and I love his work. He's coming I'm coming

32:22.160 --> 32:29.440
from this primarily as a cosmologist, and as an evolutionary biologist and a systems person,

32:29.440 --> 32:36.720
and you could argue a philosopher, but many, many different hats. And because I'm so curious,

32:36.720 --> 32:42.880
I like to join the dots and see where they lead. Don comes from it more from human consciousness

32:43.520 --> 32:50.720
and how our human consciousness relates to this wider consciousness. And his book is very provocative

32:50.720 --> 32:59.040
because of course, from the human consciousness perspective, our senses are not direct in direct

32:59.120 --> 33:05.280
touch points with universal consciousness. We moderate, we mitigate.

33:06.560 --> 33:12.480
Yeah, our sense of self through a number of ways of forming meaning. But when we met,

33:12.480 --> 33:19.920
I realized that he wasn't in any way, decrying or not acknowledging universal

33:20.800 --> 33:27.360
reality. He was only really exploring the ways in which we relate to that larger

33:29.040 --> 33:34.000
understanding of reality. So, you know, as microcosmic co creators, as I call us,

33:34.800 --> 33:43.920
of our universal living intelligence, he and I are very close. So, you know, I mean, we agree

33:43.920 --> 33:48.400
very much. What I really love as well is he's working with a number of quantum physicists

33:49.840 --> 33:57.920
in a sort of more specified way of how this works. But what I would say is the work that I've done

33:57.920 --> 34:02.800
offers us the underpinning and framing through these three laws of infodynamics.

34:03.600 --> 34:10.320
And I'm happy to sort of say to Don and the other guys, I'm really excited about what you're going

34:10.320 --> 34:15.120
to come forward in this, because it's going to come, I just feel it's all convergent. It's all

34:15.120 --> 34:19.200
the same direction of travel. I'm glad you brought up quite a quantum physicist, because I mean,

34:19.200 --> 34:24.640
another theory of consciousness that circulates is that of penrose. When you think of Stuart

34:24.640 --> 34:29.520
Hammerhoff and penrose, they talk about quantum consciousness and the microcubules of cells.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.520
Your thoughts on that? Well, I'll write about this a little bit in,

34:34.080 --> 34:40.720
well, I'll write about quantum biology in the story of Gaia, because whereas the cosmic hologram

34:40.720 --> 34:46.160
was bringing the evidence and this underpinning and framing of these laws of infodynamics and the

34:46.160 --> 34:53.120
cosmology and all the rest of it, that was back in 2017 in last year with the story of Gaia.

34:53.120 --> 34:59.600
I wanted to tell the evolutionary story, not just of our planetary home, but our entire universe,

34:59.600 --> 35:07.120
because the story of our universe, as my friend Brian Schwimm and I both talk about, is a story of

35:07.120 --> 35:13.840
us. The hydrogen in our bodies is as old as the universe. We're not just stardust, even though we

35:14.400 --> 35:21.600
are. We go back way back. We're all 13.8 billion years old. We're all 13.8 billion years old.

35:21.600 --> 35:28.400
So in that sense, the evolutionary story is extraordinary. And what you see throughout

35:28.400 --> 35:34.480
it and really came to me ever more strongly as I wrote the book or the book wrote me, I feel,

35:35.840 --> 35:42.960
is a sense of evolutionary purpose. Because what you have all the way through is this almost

35:42.960 --> 35:49.120
preparatory processes that things were in place that could then be assembled when the

35:49.120 --> 35:55.840
conditions were right. If we go back before that our planetary home came into being about

35:55.840 --> 36:04.000
five billion years ago, around five and a half billion years ago, the harbingers and the nutrients

36:04.000 --> 36:12.240
that would create our sun and our planetary system, were all there gestating in interstellar

36:12.240 --> 36:21.680
clouds of gas and dust, including complex molecules. And we start to get the sense of that quantized

36:21.680 --> 36:28.960
nature of potential playing out there. Well, even within those complex molecules, we were starting

36:28.960 --> 36:38.800
to get enzymes coming into being. And enzymes are vital to the speed in which proteins come

36:38.800 --> 36:46.640
together and build biological organisms. Because the enzyme speed, those processes are

36:46.640 --> 36:52.240
dramatically without in themselves changing. And the view very much is that that involves

36:52.240 --> 37:01.520
quantum tunneling. And so when Stuart and Roger have been bringing these ideas of microtubules

37:01.520 --> 37:07.200
forward, I don't think it's the most fundamental aspect of how this is playing out. But I think

37:07.200 --> 37:14.960
it's an important contribution to the conversation. And other people such as Jim and Khalili has also

37:14.960 --> 37:22.800
written on quantum biology. There is a view that some of them have expressed that photosynthesis

37:22.800 --> 37:28.640
is quantized in nature. I personally haven't seen the evidence that's convinced me of that.

37:28.640 --> 37:35.120
I think there are other processes that are at play that don't actually need that aspect.

37:35.120 --> 37:40.240
But there are others where, as I say, in zomatic action and others, there are other ways in which

37:40.240 --> 37:50.000
the DNA, double helix is formed and molecules such as posna molecules, and the way that that works,

37:51.280 --> 37:56.320
that can really hold memory for a very long time, likely because of quantum resonance.

37:57.200 --> 38:02.400
So I write about all of this in the story of Guy because it's very important. And it's very much

38:02.400 --> 38:10.880
an emergent field of study. I'll definitely be putting links to your books below and to the

38:10.880 --> 38:17.280
website, of course. I remember while reading, I was thinking to myself, there were two specific

38:17.280 --> 38:20.560
experiments I wanted to ask you about while reading. It came to my mind immediately and I

38:20.560 --> 38:25.680
thought of the observer effect and the double slit experiment. And I wanted to just know

38:25.680 --> 38:29.280
your general thoughts on that. So I have one more question. But I think before I get to the second

38:29.360 --> 38:33.600
one, just what are your general views on that? Because when I interviewed Don, I remember talking

38:33.600 --> 38:39.200
about when we talk about consciousness being fundamental and the entirety of our reality.

38:40.400 --> 38:45.200
And I labelled at the podcast a new experiment to test whether consciousness,

38:45.200 --> 38:49.520
whether physics arises from consciousness, and someone commented saying,

38:50.080 --> 38:55.280
have you ever heard of the observer effect as a joke? So I think with you, let's address that,

38:55.280 --> 39:04.880
how that supports this. I really want to, though, expand this perception that the universe is the

39:04.880 --> 39:10.000
universe, whether we're here or not. Yes. Yes, I think that's really important because so much

39:10.880 --> 39:16.880
perspectives about consciousness is human centred. And I'm not suggesting that's problematic. I'm

39:16.880 --> 39:22.880
saying it's both and. Yes. And the way that we as microcosms of our universe as macrocosmic

39:23.840 --> 39:30.880
consciousness, sentience, livingness, mind, you know, because I think we can get caught up in

39:30.880 --> 39:35.360
the languaging a little bit. And I want to sort of get a more so generic sense of this.

39:37.760 --> 39:45.040
But yes, so going back to remind me, I think I'm losing the thread here. So with when we serve

39:45.760 --> 39:52.880
observer effect, yeah, okay. The point is, we're embedded within a conscious universe.

39:52.880 --> 39:59.360
There cannot not be an observer effect, because we're both observer and observed,

39:59.360 --> 40:04.800
we are naturally embodied, we're inseparable. We are literally inseparable. But I think the

40:04.800 --> 40:11.680
important point there is that the unity and unified nature of non locally unified nature

40:11.760 --> 40:17.360
of our universe has two aspects. First of all, it means that although our universe exists and

40:17.360 --> 40:26.320
evolves as a non locally unified entity, within space time, light is the cosmic speed cop signals

40:26.320 --> 40:32.240
cannot go fast on the speed of light within space time, which means that we can have this journey

40:32.240 --> 40:38.880
of 13.8 billion years, we can have a flow of time, we can have a causality. And this is important

40:38.880 --> 40:44.720
when we start to explore super normal phenomena. Because although this both and

40:45.600 --> 40:51.680
enable super, you know, naturalize a super normal phenomena naturalizes our intuitive

40:51.680 --> 40:58.000
insights naturalize the synchronicities. It's a both and so there is this causality playing

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
through. So, you know, I was in a panel with Dean Raiden and the ions folks a couple of days ago.

41:04.560 --> 41:12.160
And Don was being given a prize there, which is wonderful for his work. But essentially,

41:12.160 --> 41:18.720
because it's it's it's a both and we are both observer and observed, we are inseparable,

41:18.720 --> 41:27.440
but that unity is differentiated. It's unity and diversity, it's unit in radical diversity.

41:28.160 --> 41:34.880
So yes, we're always we're informational beings within an informational universe,

41:35.520 --> 41:44.000
whether we know it or not, we're in continuous dialogue, multi log. Yes, with all around us,

41:44.000 --> 41:49.920
where we are, you know, we talk a whole world view of act local feel global think cosmic,

41:49.920 --> 41:55.440
because we are all and we are uniquely our universe is breathing through us.

41:56.400 --> 42:02.000
Each of us uniquely. So let's apply this this law of infodynamics, let's apply

42:02.000 --> 42:07.280
infodynamics to different systems so people can get a better understanding of this. So let's

42:07.280 --> 42:12.560
think of it from maybe let's take into account a biological scale or something like DNA, and apply

42:12.560 --> 42:17.120
to something like human civilization, take it to economics, and maybe continue from there,

42:17.120 --> 42:22.080
just maybe start off from a from an atomic scale, perhaps, and then let's work our way up.

42:22.080 --> 42:27.280
Okay, let's do that, because what we're finding is that the informational patterns,

42:27.280 --> 42:35.120
the relational dynamic informational patterns, many of whom we call fractals, not all the

42:35.120 --> 42:40.240
relationships are a fractal per se, we have other relationships that we can come to,

42:40.240 --> 42:46.960
for example, power laws, but we find the fractal relationships which are essentially geometric.

42:47.920 --> 42:54.800
When Beckenstein was doing the the holographic work on information, and the pixelation at the

42:54.800 --> 43:01.280
boundary of what we call space time, that plank scale pixelation on that two dimensional

43:02.080 --> 43:08.320
boundary of space time is triangular. Okay, because then it can tile without a break.

43:09.040 --> 43:16.800
It's the ideal geometry that doesn't overlap. So within each plank scale. Yes, pixelation

43:17.360 --> 43:22.240
there is essentially one bit of information, and it's at such a minute level that when we scale

43:22.240 --> 43:30.160
it up to atoms or quarks or neutrinos or and beyond, it has a lot of information already

43:30.160 --> 43:38.640
at that accumulated scale. But what we find is that, for example, when an element is going

43:38.640 --> 43:44.880
through a phase transition, for example, between an insulator and a metal, it's electrons cluster

43:44.880 --> 43:50.000
fractally. Yeah, so from that scale, we start into because of course, the plank scale is much

43:50.000 --> 43:56.320
tiny, that pixelation scale is much tiny. So we're out of atomic scale. We also find fractals

43:56.320 --> 44:02.000
running through from that scale upwards. So for example, on a planetary scale, clouds are fractal,

44:02.960 --> 44:09.360
in that sense, weather patterns are fractally based, river systems are fractal. But the key

44:09.360 --> 44:15.040
thing here, and let me just go up to cosmic scale, and then I want to come back, because there's a

44:15.040 --> 44:21.040
key point here, we find that at a planetary and a planetary scale, but also when we look at a solar

44:21.040 --> 44:30.560
system scale, the solar wind is fractal. Some of the ways in which the resonances of planetary orbits

44:30.560 --> 44:36.480
and planetary the planetary system as a whole have fractal relationships. We go into the galaxy,

44:36.480 --> 44:40.240
we see fractal patterns here, we go to cluster galaxies, we see fractal patterns.

44:40.800 --> 44:49.200
And in 2017, Afshadi and Skanderis and a group of folks looked at the cosmic microwave background,

44:49.760 --> 44:54.640
which is, as you know, is the relic radiation left over from what's often called the recombination

44:54.640 --> 45:02.240
era, around 380,000 years after the beginning of the big breath, where space had expanded enough

45:02.240 --> 45:06.640
and temperature cooled down enough to become transparent, because before that,

45:06.640 --> 45:13.120
space was transparent to acoustic signaling, but not to light. When that happened, again,

45:13.120 --> 45:19.920
there was like a phase transition, where space became transparent, and therefore there was a

45:19.920 --> 45:26.320
relic radiation that filled the whole of space at that time. And because the temperature that was

45:26.880 --> 45:31.760
that was in play at that time, we think that it would have had an orange glow,

45:31.760 --> 45:37.040
which I quite like the idea of really. Anyway, that filled the whole of space. As space has

45:37.040 --> 45:44.080
continued to expand ever since, that those wavelengths have sort of lengthened to microwave

45:45.040 --> 45:49.360
microwaves now. And so we call it the cosmic microwave background, and it fills the whole of

45:49.360 --> 45:57.840
space. In 2017, an analysis from the W map, the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe map,

45:59.360 --> 46:04.800
was able to show fractal patterns in the minute temperature differences throughout the whole

46:04.800 --> 46:10.000
of the cosmic microwave background. So we have fractals all the way up and all the way back.

46:10.000 --> 46:16.880
But going back to us, we find that the same fractal patterns that underpin, for example,

46:16.960 --> 46:22.960
complex systems such as ecosystems, is the same fractal patterns that underpin the nodes

46:22.960 --> 46:30.240
and the networking points of the internet. Yeah, we find, for example, moving beyond fractals.

46:30.240 --> 46:34.880
So let's look at power laws. Let's look at the incidence, for example, of earthquakes.

46:35.760 --> 46:41.600
We know that when we plot the incidence of earthquakes against the destructive power

46:41.600 --> 46:46.960
on a logarithmic scale, the Richter scale, that they form a straight line. So in other

46:46.960 --> 46:52.000
words, there's no such thing as an average earthquake. If you apply all the earthquakes big

46:52.000 --> 46:59.120
to small on that, you know, that frequency, and then logarithmic destruction, they form a straight

46:59.120 --> 47:06.160
line. It's called a power law, which says there's only one relationship for all of them, that an

47:06.160 --> 47:13.600
earthquake that is twice as powerful logarithmically is four times less frequent. That's it. So there's

47:13.600 --> 47:19.680
no such thing as an average, no Gaussian curve there. But at the end of the Second World War,

47:19.680 --> 47:26.320
a researcher called Lewis Richardson, and then subsequently to that, a researcher at Miami

47:26.320 --> 47:32.160
University, a gentleman whose surname is Johnson, but whose first name eludes me,

47:32.560 --> 47:39.600
looked at human conflicts at all scales and measured them in terms of their frequency against

47:39.600 --> 47:45.280
their destructive power in terms of human fatalities, and found the same relationship.

47:46.320 --> 47:51.920
Slightly different pitch, but nonetheless the same relationship as for earthquakes.

47:51.920 --> 47:56.240
Because what we're realizing, going back to what we're saying throughout this,

47:56.320 --> 48:02.800
is the appearance of our universe emerges from deeper levels of meaningfully information, and

48:02.800 --> 48:10.640
that applies to our human behaviors, our human consciousness, as well as universal consciousness

48:10.640 --> 48:17.680
and planetary sentience, that brings forward these same relationships at all scales. But the

48:17.680 --> 48:26.080
key here is if we have the collective awareness to make choices of conflict, then we can evolve

48:26.080 --> 48:31.760
our collective awareness to make choices of peace. And this is, I think, one of the most

48:31.760 --> 48:39.360
fundamental conversations of our time, because this is what this new understanding and this,

48:39.360 --> 48:46.640
you know, this unitive narrative that can, you know, there's an underpin and framed by the evidence,

48:46.640 --> 48:50.960
but also can underpin and frame our choices and their behaviors.

48:51.840 --> 48:57.600
Exactly. And that's why, I mean, when I labeled this podcast, I said that this podcast

48:57.600 --> 49:02.320
explores the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, but morality is a big part of it,

49:02.320 --> 49:07.760
because whatever belief you have regarding the nature of reality or consciousness will determine

49:07.760 --> 49:14.400
how you perceive your ethics, your morals, your values. And with your view, I see such a deep,

49:14.960 --> 49:20.160
caring, healing nature towards it all. And I am definitely going to touch on these

49:20.160 --> 49:24.240
practical implications. But before we do, I just want to definitely make sure that we

49:24.240 --> 49:28.640
touch on as much of this, the science behind what you're talking about, because it's so amazing,

49:28.640 --> 49:34.240
it's so intriguing. One thing I did want to touch on before that was, I mean, there was the big breath,

49:34.240 --> 49:40.080
it all started, slow outbreath, you often talk about Vedic traditions and the Brahman and how

49:40.080 --> 49:44.000
they started this concept. What happens as we go along all the way to the end?

49:44.160 --> 49:50.000
Well, the evidence we've got now is suggesting that it's a continued outbreath.

49:51.760 --> 49:57.040
For a long time, there was, is it going to be, is it going to do that? Or is it going to bounce

49:57.040 --> 50:03.840
back? Or what's going to happen? And we find that the acceleration, very surprisingly for a lot of

50:03.840 --> 50:12.720
people, that the expansion of our universe began to accelerate again, about five billion years ago.

50:12.720 --> 50:17.840
So it started with an acceleration, the first time, you know, the first epoch of the big breath,

50:17.840 --> 50:22.960
it then slowed down because the balance of gravity and dark energy and all the rest of it,

50:23.680 --> 50:30.160
one out, one in. But then a space that expanded to the point of about five billion years ago,

50:30.160 --> 50:34.640
the acceleration began again. And it looks as though that there's nothing to, there's no

50:36.320 --> 50:42.000
way in which that that is likely to stop. And when I bring the third law of infodynamics

50:42.000 --> 50:48.240
into the piece, of course, the temperature continues to drop, as the information continues

50:48.240 --> 50:54.240
to increase, you can see that there's a sort of a cycle here. Because the temperature of our

50:54.240 --> 50:59.680
universe, I said, began at the Planck scale at the first moment of the big breath, 10 to the 32 k,

50:59.680 --> 51:07.120
it's now down at just over 2.7 k. So we're looking to see that this, this life cycle,

51:07.920 --> 51:14.480
rather like a bubble, yeah, comes to a completion at some point. The other thing is there was some

51:14.480 --> 51:20.160
really good work done by I think Dennis Sabral, a few years ago that I referenced in the Cosmic

51:20.160 --> 51:26.080
Hologram, showing that the sort of the, the, the, the, the epochs of stellar formation,

51:26.640 --> 51:32.960
and a big, big acceleration about nine billion years ago, then another, but progressively less

51:32.960 --> 51:39.120
and less fewer and fewer, because the hydrogen to create new stars is being used up. So the view

51:39.120 --> 51:46.000
is that probably something like 98% of all stars that could form have already formed. Many of them

51:46.000 --> 51:50.960
have come to the end of their lives. And again, you know, as I write in the story of Guy, there's

51:50.960 --> 51:58.560
this incredible evolutionary arc, you know, of massive stars at the beginning that formed black

51:58.560 --> 52:05.040
holes and supermassive black holes and galaxies. And then, you know, it's just a beautiful, beautiful

52:05.920 --> 52:12.240
journey, journey forward. So my perspective, again, with the evidence, you know, I'll follow,

52:12.240 --> 52:17.680
I hopefully follow the evidence wherever it leads, but this is where it seems to be leading us,

52:17.680 --> 52:24.800
that our universe is finite in form. It's a, it's a great thought form, but a finite thought form,

52:24.880 --> 52:30.720
in that sense, in the mind of the cosmos. And we're probably closer to the end

52:31.360 --> 52:37.680
than we are to the beginning in that regard. And I mean, it does work. So a lot of people seem to,

52:37.680 --> 52:41.920
well, from what I've gathered, seem to think that you're not, you're talking about something

52:41.920 --> 52:45.360
completely different, but you're not, you're actually taking the current work we have, and

52:45.360 --> 52:49.920
you're framing it in a different perspective. And I think that's important to note is that it's not

52:50.000 --> 52:55.200
that you're making new claims in a sense. You're more just changing it and adjusting it in a way

52:55.200 --> 53:01.840
that completely shifts mindsets altogether. How do you feel this has impacted the scientific

53:01.840 --> 53:11.200
community? Because you know how scientists can be. I'm pretty sure you've been, because anytime

53:11.200 --> 53:15.280
someone talks about anything that goes outside of the status quo in science, you complete,

53:15.280 --> 53:20.160
you're labeled as so many different things that how has it been on your receiving end?

53:21.440 --> 53:29.200
It's been extraordinary, actually. It's been rather wonderful because in a way, because as you

53:29.200 --> 53:34.080
say, I'm actually working with the evidence and I'm working with the evidence of tens of thousands

53:34.080 --> 53:41.520
of researchers. I guess what I can bring is an ability to see patterns and an ability to join

53:41.520 --> 53:48.080
up the dots, because so many scientists are working in this incredibly depth of work, but

53:48.080 --> 53:52.720
they're not seeing what so-and-so is doing or so-and-so is doing in a different field of study.

53:53.360 --> 54:00.560
And what I can do because of my breadth of interests is I can see the bigger picture

54:00.560 --> 54:07.920
of what it's all coming with and the direction of travel. And also as a cosmologist,

54:08.880 --> 54:14.080
we're getting folks like Professor Brian Cox, who wrote a book with Jeff Forshaw last autumn,

54:14.720 --> 54:21.600
last fall, basically on black holes, but coming at the end of that book to say more and more it's

54:21.600 --> 54:26.480
looking that the appearance of our universe is not its deeper reality. I don't know what that means,

54:26.480 --> 54:33.680
he says. But that's the point that cosmologists are coming to, because that is where the evidence

54:33.680 --> 54:40.080
is leading us. Now, you're right, I think, you know, I'm also a student of the history of science.

54:40.800 --> 54:46.640
And I can see how certainly over the last, certainly until the 20th century, there was a

54:46.640 --> 54:53.200
perspective very much of this separation of science and spirituality. And I can absolutely,

54:53.200 --> 54:58.960
you know, I've studied all the reasons for this and get it. But we're coming full circle or full

54:59.040 --> 55:04.720
spiral now, because the leading edge discoveries, and they really are only in the last few years,

55:04.720 --> 55:11.600
the holographic principle, the understanding of information, you know, my, my redefinition of

55:11.600 --> 55:18.320
the laws of thermodynamics to infodynamics, it's simple. Anybody could have come up with that.

55:19.200 --> 55:24.480
The reason I did it is because I saw it with new eyes, as you say, and I wasn't caught with the old

55:25.200 --> 55:31.760
perspective. And so in that sense, and that's what Marcel Proust of course said,

55:31.760 --> 55:37.040
the journey of discovery is not discovering new lands, it's seeing with new eyes. And so I think

55:37.040 --> 55:44.960
it almost is a situation where once somebody is willing to see with new eyes, it all fits into

55:44.960 --> 55:51.040
place. And it's not in any way dishonoring everything that's come before. We've needed to

55:51.040 --> 55:57.840
take every step it seems to me. So I'm not into blame and shame on any way. But we do have a paradigm

55:58.800 --> 56:04.480
that's actually not even 20th century science. It's 19th century science of a mechanical,

56:04.480 --> 56:10.080
mechanistic, materialistic, separatist universe. And that has been turned on its head. And when

56:10.080 --> 56:18.480
we bring consciousness in, it's not, it's, it's, how can I put it, it's for all faiths and non,

56:18.480 --> 56:26.400
it's human. It's who are we, it's remembering who are we, and not sort of making any labels

56:26.400 --> 56:31.360
or anything else. But this is where the evidence is inviting us to remember.

56:32.640 --> 56:36.240
Jude, before I go on to the next portion, where I'm going to talk about the practical

56:36.240 --> 56:41.920
implications as well as the Eastern philosophical aspects of how you came to your views at some

56:41.920 --> 56:46.640
point. The last thing I want to ask you is, is there anything you want to clarify in terms of

56:46.640 --> 56:52.080
the way you approach infodynamics, cosmic hologram, all of this, anything that you feel has always been

56:52.080 --> 56:57.520
misunderstood, that you've been itching to kind of just get out there and let people know this is

56:57.520 --> 57:05.200
actually what I meant? Not misunderstood. But I feel that there's still a misperception of people

57:05.200 --> 57:11.760
who work with entropy. And seeing it as this order to disorder I was mentioning earlier,

57:11.760 --> 57:16.880
rather than as initially an increase in energetic microstates and now an increase in

57:16.880 --> 57:23.680
informational content and now an information, an increase in meaningful informational content

57:24.400 --> 57:31.440
is this perspective that came through with people like David Bowman, Prigga Joan, and others,

57:32.400 --> 57:39.760
realizing that in what's called a dissipative system, such as our planet and a person, that

57:39.760 --> 57:46.720
there seems to be a sort of a switch around of entropy. So entropy, it's not order to disorder,

57:46.720 --> 57:54.320
it's somehow disorders become order. And so what I've been able to share and more and more people

57:54.320 --> 57:59.920
are now getting it, is it's the old concept or the misperceived concept of entropy as order to

57:59.920 --> 58:06.320
disorder, rather than from increased energetic states and now information. Because then what you

58:06.320 --> 58:12.960
realize in dissipative systems, let's talk about our planetary home, a dissipative system,

58:13.680 --> 58:23.440
actually, energy comes in, energy flows through, what's not needed to support the homeostasis of

58:23.440 --> 58:32.560
that system is then dissipated. If you think of that as information coming in expresses energy,

58:33.520 --> 58:42.000
information therefore used as a coherence to, you know, to support the coherence of that system

58:42.720 --> 58:49.520
and what is not utilized gets dissipated. So again, that then correlates with this perception,

58:50.560 --> 58:57.600
both of, both of the meaningful information, not just as underpinning, but the very stuff

58:58.480 --> 59:05.040
of that system, that that throughput enables its coherence through its lifetime, whether it's a

59:05.040 --> 59:11.600
human lifetime or a planetary lifetime. But also it shows that then going back to that third law,

59:12.320 --> 59:17.760
that temperature difference is a measure of the entropic potential.

59:17.840 --> 59:26.480
Yeah. So that so that in a planetary, you know, if we have a planet where that

59:26.480 --> 59:32.080
dissipative process stops, the temperature difference between that planet and ambient space will

59:33.440 --> 59:38.000
will will reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce. Yeah. When we come to the end of our life cycle,

59:39.280 --> 59:45.600
our temperature when we die, when our physical bodies die, our temperature then correlates with

59:45.600 --> 59:53.200
our ambience. So the ability by maintaining a temperature difference in a dissipative system

59:54.240 --> 01:00:01.440
is a measure of its continuing entropic potential. I see. Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.400
That's the that's the one thing that I think people have quite a lot of because, you know,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.960
terms like neg entropy and syntropy and all sorts of stuff's come in, they're not needed.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.360
When you understand it in these terms, you can appreciate rather like the epicycles

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:22.560
of medieval astronomy, pre Copernican astronomy, you don't need it. And what you get is a much

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.880
simpler understanding when you're seeing it with new eyes. So you know, the Copernican,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.680
putting soul in the middle of our solar system, suddenly you don't need epicycles and all that

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.640
complications. And you don't need the complications of neg entropy and syntropy, which of themselves,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:48.800
you know, violate this universal continuing increase in entropy.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.880
I think I think it's very apparent. I mean, if you if you have a hammer, you look for nails

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.760
and science, I mean, it's very objective. So you're constantly looking from an objective

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.120
standpoint. I mean, it's very difficult to get a step out of that. And I know I'm the same in

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.080
that regard, because when I started this podcast, my views and consciousness were very fixed and

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:14.080
firm. And the more it's gone on, the more it's continuously changed and non stop. I mean,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.640
at this point, I question reality all the time. But it's something I've always done.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.400
But I mean, that fixed belief is no longer there. It's something that's open to

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.480
exploring these new ideas. I don't think that the child in me would have explored concepts

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:37.520
like this with so much just openness. I love it. I love it. I mean, I love it.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.440
Yeah, me too. I mean, it's all it's all a work in progress. It's all a work in progress. I mean,

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.840
for me, what's exciting is having had my first direct experience of, of, you know,

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.520
multi dimensional realities, you know, no ethic experiences from the edge of fall.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:01.200
I've, I've also it's both and I've also really, really, really valued, you know, science as a

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:08.400
process, as long as this Francis Bacon, who is the father of the empirical method, you know,

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.560
follow the evidence wherever it leads. And I do feel he's been given a quite a bad rap,

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.040
which I would disagree with. Because as a friend of mine, another friend of mine,

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.320
Peter Dawkins, who's a wonderful Baconian scholar, you really has guided, you know,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.080
like you, you've been my guidance with this is that, you know, 400 years ago,

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:36.720
when Bacon in 1623, when they published Day Augmentum Sientarium, which was the beginning

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.040
of the empirical method, you know, Bacon's philosophical, deeply philosophical perspectives,

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:50.560
it seems to me, were that it wasn't going to peripheralize the divine as he would have called

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:57.760
it, but to reveal the divine through its empiricism. Because of course, he was living in a time of

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:05.520
Queen Elizabeth II, and then James, the first of England, Sixth of Scotland, where superstition,

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.120
you know, ruled the, ruled the waves in that sense, and the church's authority. So it's almost

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:18.240
come this full journey now, where leading edge science is, is revealing that universality and

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.080
those wisdom teachings and the wholeness and the divinity within everything. Exactly. And I think

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.440
just to put it all together, because now, as we reached the end, well, the end of this podcast,

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.200
at least for now, maybe we'll do around too. But let's talk about, I mean, unity and non-locality

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.640
is the basis of all of this. And at some point, it all comes together for us to understand and

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.440
realize that everything is interconnected. There is no separation. This is the sort of

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.400
separating things needs to slowly dissipate. And this does have practical implications.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.080
I think as we get into that, let's start from your East, the Eastern philosophy that's inspired

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.000
this and taken because we've spoken a lot about Western science at this point. And I'm curious

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.960
for you to apply the Eastern philosophy into how we should approach the practical and ethical

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.480
implications moving forward with this theory. Yeah, absolutely. Well, first of all, as you

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:19.520
said, I mean, you know, our worldview is our mindset, our narrative, our underpinning narrative

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.680
is the way we see the world and therefore the choices we make. And we've had a Western secular

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.720
worldview of, as I say, based on 19th century science. And all the structures that came from

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.040
that, because in the 19th century, with that mechanistic, separatist, materialistic perspective,

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.520
you know, our structures became hierarchical. You know, whether it's our education, whether it's

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:52.800
our organizations, our governance or whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever. And now that's

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.160
completely been turned on its head and converging much more with universal wisdom teachings and

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:05.120
very much those of the Eastern traditions and the indigenous traditions. And so, you know,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:11.360
for example, the Chinese, Yi Qing talks about in the beginning is the one not was is the one

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:17.200
becomes to the two becomes three and from the three 10,000 things are born, you know, the yin yang

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:24.320
symbol. And we haven't even touched on the feminine masculine and all of that. But that's so important.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:32.320
But you know, the yin yang symbol has, you know, the yang with the yin coming out and the yin with

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.960
the yang coming out. But the wave in that symbol is often not mentioned. But the wave is that

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:45.360
creativity of what this all means. And yeah, I talk a lot about trinities, philosophically

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.800
trinities, you know, the masculine, the feminine and the child. And in that resolution, and that's

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.920
again seen through many, many traditions. We talk about the Vedic tradition, as we have before,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:05.440
Indra's net. You know, the tradition talks of Indra's net as a analogy of the reality where every

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:13.920
reality made up of beautiful gems of many, many different colors and all different facets and

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:21.440
each facet reflecting others and linked by golden threads. Well, that is a millennial old description

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.520
in my perspective of the cosmic holograms. In South Africa, we, because I'm Indian of Hindu

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.240
origin and descent. And but I was born and raised in South Africa. And the South African culture,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.360
there's this word, it's called Ubuntu. I love that word. I love that. I am because you are.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.920
And that's exactly what she's saying. Yeah, it's exactly that. And Ubuntu is so beautifully

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.000
inviting in. Because the other thing is that I love about Ubuntu, many things I love about Ubuntu.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.480
But I talk about, you know, often we're now describing unity and diversity. But for a number

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:05.520
of years now, I've said, let's take that a step further, beyond even unity in inclusion to unity

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:13.840
in belonging. Because this is showing us that we all belong. And that is the very heart of Ubuntu.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.000
Ubuntu is so fundamental because you don't have to be invited into that relationship.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.040
You are inherently fundamentally part of that relationship. And this is what we're discovering.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:35.920
And so altogether, I mean, this unification, this, tell me about the overall goal for us as a society.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.360
How would you like this infodynamics and everything you've spoken about today to be applied somehow

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:49.920
into it all? Well, again, these things, have you ever heard of somebody called Mr. Magoo?

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.560
He's very much in America. Yeah. And he always backs into things and then looks around and goes,

01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:04.640
oh, that's the story of my life, I think. So a couple of years ago, with all of this and writing

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.200
the Cosmic Hologram at the time, and then the story of Gary, sorry, writing the story of Gary

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:15.200
at the time Cosmic Hologram would come out. I came together with a number of change makers

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.760
and folks who'd been involved with the United Nations for decades, and involved with the

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.200
Sustainable Development Goals and what's called Agenda 2030. And we're getting more and more

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:33.200
frustrated because this realization that they were coming not necessarily from the people who were

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.680
trying to negotiate them, but certainly the way they were articulated and then

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:46.800
led out very much from this siloed perspective, 17 goals and lots of measurements, but the goals

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:55.120
themselves and the realization from these 150 or so change makers that they could never be

01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.640
implemented with that sort of mindset. I mean, Einstein said, you can't solve a problem from

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:08.160
the same mindset that created it. Well, we have a problem because of an illusion of separation,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:15.360
a dis-ease of separation, we cannot solve it from that same mindset. So all that I'm sharing and all

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:23.200
the evidence is pointing to is overturning that perspective and bringing in this realization

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:30.800
and understanding of wholeness. So what these folks were really wanting to say is how can,

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.320
because they were coming from this perspective, how can we bring this perspective of wholeness

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:44.640
into the SDGs and Agenda 2030? And one of the things that came forward was the need for a narrative

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.560
that could share this, because we're a narrative species, we're storytelling species, you know,

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:57.440
we sat round from the very beginning sharing stories and sharing perspectives, who we are

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.320
and what are we? Who are we in the world? Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:10.640
And in that sense, making meaning of our existence. So we now have the evidence

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.000
that is converging, the scientific evidence that's converging with universal wisdom teachings

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:24.480
to offer us a unitive narrative, to underpin and frame us to be able to come together and serve

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.760
potentiality for transformational change. So I got involved with this group of folks and I put my

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:37.120
hand up and volunteered. That's my mum. My mum always said, volunteer, volunteer. You may not

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.040
know what you're volunteering for, but volunteer. So I did and I was one of the co-authors of a

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:50.400
unitive narrative, that these folks took on board and adopted and the evolutionary leader

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.960
circle of whom I remember also adopted and others. But what that's now doing that came forward

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.640
just over a year ago, what that's done in the meantime, is that late last year, the United

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:12.480
Nations for the first time in its 70 year history, adopted a group of NGOs and organizations founded

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:19.600
on the unitive narrative, this unitive narrative. And so this unitive cluster now has a voice, has

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.920
voices in all of the things that United Nations are doing. But that's just one thing, because the

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:32.640
other thing it's now underpinning is bringing together folks who are really wanting to transform

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:40.560
economics and finance system from a unitive perspective. Folks who will look at regenerative

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:48.640
economics, doughnut economics, living systems economics, but all of it underpinned and framed

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:57.760
by unitive narrative that then deepens it still further into unitive principles that serves

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.640
the health, the whole being of our planetary home and our people.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:10.400
Unitive education. How do we share this story with folks of all ages and in so many different ways?

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:19.440
And how do we share this in ways through arts and culture? Because this is what this is about.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.640
This is the many, many stories that can arise and be shared from this underpinning of a unitive

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:33.120
narrative. So that's what I'm doing pretty much most of my time now and sharing this

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:41.920
understanding, but it's vital that it moves beyond understanding. It has to be experienced

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.840
to be embodied. Well, I hope this podcast helps to get that message out, Jude. I know you're

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.360
time-sensitive and we've sort of reached the end of this conversation, but I just want to say thank

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.160
you so much. And to quote, I mean, your work and obviously Ubuntu, I am a Cosmic Co-creator because

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.560
you are a Cosmic Co-creator and thank you so much for being part of this creation with me and part

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:12.240
of this experience. Bless you, Tev. And it's folks like you. I mean, I've done so many podcasts now

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:20.400
and I'm in awe of each and every one of you as hosts because your passion, your clarity, your

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:28.000
service is so, so important because the folks you will reach in their own way will share this

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.720
in their own way. We don't know where this ripples, but we know it does because as you say,

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:41.120
Ubuntu, we are inseparable. We are each unique and we are inseparable. You know,

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.920
this offers us authentic hope. This, I hope, empowers us and inspires us. And this for me seems

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.120
that this is the invitation of the universe and our planetary home guy. You know, they're saying,

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:59.120
come on, items to this adventure. This has to be one of the most inspirational. Well,

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.400
I'm feeling well-inspired. One of the most inspirational talks I've had so far.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.600
I'm liking it so far because there may be others who are even more inspirational to come.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.480
Yeah, I've enjoyed it tremendously. Thank you so much, Jude. I wish you all the best and yeah,

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:19.920
I'm looking forward to chatting to you again sometime. I'd love that, Tev. Anytime. I'd love

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.680
that so much. Take care, Jude. And yeah, we'll keep you in touch. I'm looking forward to this

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:35.680
hearing. Cheers. Thanks.
