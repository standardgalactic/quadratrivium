0	17200	How are you doing? It's been such a, it's been a long time. It's, it's been a while.
17200	21440	Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm continuing to improve. It's, you know, this,
22000	30240	I, the long COVID really did a number on me. So I'm still, still recovering. It's been years,
30240	38160	but I'm still recovering. But a couple of doctors contacted me from Australia and said that they,
38160	41920	they thought from my symptoms, they heard me on a podcast and they said they thought from my symptoms
41920	46880	that the heart wasn't the primary thing that had been attacked, but it was my gut that the,
46960	55200	the, the viruses of bacterophage and that it destroyed the, the bacteria that produce GABA
55200	61280	and serotonin and other calming kinds of things and, and promoted bacteria that produce amines
61280	69120	that sort of overdrive the heart and lead to the failure that I had. And so that's, so they put me
69120	74560	on this really strict diet, vegetables and, and no, basically almost no guys, almost like a total
74560	78960	no carb kind of diet. Has that, have you seen an impact?
80320	86000	Yeah, it's completely changed my gut. And I actually, it's making a huge difference. So,
86640	91680	so this is, I mean, the virus attacks you wherever I guess you're weak. And it got me on the gut
91680	97440	in the heart. I'm glad you're doing better though. It's, it's always great to know someone's doing
97440	102320	better. And I mean, we need you out there to continue doing such great work. Well, thank you.
102320	106480	And then we need you to continue to do this great podcast. And, and of course, the medical work that
106480	112720	you do. Thanks so much, Don. I mean, we've covered so much. We've chatted twice already. And both,
112720	118320	both times we went through various different aspects of all your work. And the first podcast,
118320	123360	we spoke about user interface theory of perception. We spoke about conscious realism.
124080	127680	We touched on conscious agents, but in the second one, we went very in depth,
127680	131760	conscious agents in the subatomic world. We went into that paper, we dissected people,
131760	137840	loved it by the way. Yeah, and it's been, it's, it's been quite a hit. For this podcast, I thought,
137840	142400	let me curate a bunch of questions from the audience so far from the first two. And we're
142400	148800	trying to each of them. But before we do that, I think since conscious agents of the subatomic
148800	152480	world, what's happened since, because I'm assuming you guys are having a lot of fun. And
153120	157760	it's always exciting to when someone jumps and gets outside the box to know what's,
157760	162720	what's really outside the box. That's right. So we have made a couple,
163840	171920	for me, very fun discoveries. So one has to do with the notion of observation.
173040	179040	What does it mean to observe? What will it mean in our theory to, for one system to observe
179040	186560	another? In, you know, classical physics, the observer is not much mentioned. And if they're
186560	190800	mentioned at all, they're assumed to be objective and don't really interfere at all with whatever
190800	196000	it is that they're, so they, they don't disturb whatever they're observing. In quantum mechanics,
197440	201280	there isn't a theory of the observer, but, but it's known that, you know, somehow the measurement
201280	206640	process is a destructive process. I mean, things are different when you measure than, you know,
206640	212800	when you don't. And so there's this feeling that, you know, the observer has to play a role, but
212800	218560	it's not formalized, right? The, the measurement is formalized, you know, it's some kind of,
220320	225440	there is a formalization there in terms of positive operator value measures and so POVMs
225440	230160	and so forth. But, but, you know, even someone like Chris Fuchs, who's saying, you know, that,
231200	237520	that quantum mechanics is really just a description for the agent, how it should update, update their
237520	243520	beliefs in, in, in light of experimental data and so forth. But when you ask him, so, so what is your
243520	246560	theory of the agent, he says, I don't know you a theory of the agent, I'm just telling you that
246560	249840	quantum mechanics is the manual that the agent should use. And I don't know what an agent is.
250400	253920	And I respect, I mean, you can't do everything. And he's doing quantum mechanics, and he's not
253920	258400	doing the agent, he's not doing the observer. But he does say that the agent's important.
259120	264000	So, so then in our theory, then, you know, the question comes front and center, because we're
264000	269360	talking about conscious agents all the way down. So we can't avoid. So when we talk about a measurement,
269920	276400	we have to actually have a theory of what does it mean for one system of conscious agents
277120	281920	to make a measurement on another system of conscious agents, right? What does that mean?
283360	292480	And we use, so I have to be a little technical to, to explain the idea, but I'll try to be as
292560	300320	un-technical as possible. But we use Markovian kernels. So a Markovian kernel basically says,
300320	305680	suppose you have a system that, that can see three colors, red, green, and blue. Now that's,
305680	311200	that's what it experiences. There's a kernel that we call the qualia kernel that describes
311840	316960	the sequence of color experiences that this observer might have. So maybe if I see red now,
316960	320800	the probability is that the next time I see a color, it'll be green, but maybe it's,
320800	327040	maybe it's half. And it's also a third that I'll see blue, but it's also, you know, whatever is
327040	331920	left over, probably that I'll see red. So I can say for, for each color I'm now experiencing,
331920	336640	what is the probability of the next color I might experience? And you can, so when you write down a
336640	342240	matrix, a table of all those probabilities, in mathematics, we call that a Markov kernel.
342880	349840	And it's actually a linear operator. And, and you can actually study the properties of a linear
349840	356160	operator. It can rotate vectors, it can exchange, you expand and contract vectors, it can do all
356160	362560	sorts of things. So, so that's the, one of the models we're using to represent observers and the
362560	369200	conscious experiences that what they have. What we discovered was, and this is a new
370000	375200	contribution to Markov chain theory, apparently, to the mathematics of it, is that,
375920	380560	well, first, first, what I'm about to say is not a new contribution, it's a standard notion,
380560	385680	but we're going to use it for the, for the new contribution. If you take one Markov chain,
386240	390400	like it has three colors, and you've got the Markov chain on it, but then you say, what if I,
390400	394480	you know, don't look at the red, I don't care when the red, I'm only going to look at the green and
394480	401440	blue. And I'm going to look at those two colors. What Markov chain gets induced on those two colors
401440	404800	from the bigger Markov chain and red, green and blue, right? There's some probability
404960	408320	of going from red, green, blue. But what happens if I only can see the green and the blue,
408320	412000	I'll get some chance, you know, if I'm, if I see green now that I'll see blue next,
412000	416560	for see green now, I'll see green next. So, so I can actually, you can intuitively, you can say,
416560	421200	well, yeah, you should be able to induce a Markov chain on the smaller number of states, right?
422560	427040	But it would somehow respect the bigger, the bigger Markov chain, right? So that's the idea
427040	433840	of a trace, it's called a trace chain. Well, what we proved, this is work with Chaitan Prakash,
435040	441280	so he and I worked on this together. And what we found is that the relationship of being a trace
441280	450720	chain to another Markov chain is a partial order. That means that we found a, this is an entire
450720	456960	logic on the space of all Markov chains, all Markov kernels. So this is a brand new logic.
457520	466560	One, one in one chain entails another, if it's a trace chain of the other. That's, that's,
466560	471440	so I can, the actual definition is simple. Once I've told, I can actually say the depth. So one
471440	479920	Markov chain P is less than or equal to Markov chain Q, if and only if P is a trace chain of Q.
480640	486160	And you can prove that that is actually a partial order. And it's a logic. So it's actually a logic
486160	491760	on the space of all Markov chains. It's not Boolean. It's more general than Boolean. It's more
491760	501360	general than quantum logics, ortho complimented lattices. This is more, it's more general than
501360	508320	that. It's locally Boolean. So every particular Markov kernel, if you look at all the ones that
508320	513360	are less than it, all the ones that, that are less than it, they form a Boolean logic. So this
513360	520960	is a locally Boolean logic of observation. And then we proved that this, if you take,
523120	528560	so by the way, then this is our notion of observation. If one observers
530720	536880	kernel or Markov chain is less than or equal to another, then it observes the bigger chain. So
536880	541920	that's, so that's how that's what, so notice our notion of observation is not this objective,
542480	547600	you're outside the system. No, no, you're immersed in it. You are part of the system.
547600	551920	You're an integral part of the system that you're observing. So, so at the top level,
551920	559040	that's the take home from this. Our theory of observation is the observer is no scientist
559040	564800	that's separate from everything and not involved in anything and completely separate and can't,
564800	570000	and can be ignored. No, no, no, no, you are intimately part of the system. And you must be
570000	575360	understood to get a real theory of observation in science. You have to understand what an agent is
575360	581120	and how it's embedded in the systems that it's observing. And this is, this gives a mathematical
581120	587120	logic for doing that. So it's really, we're pretty excited. But, but then each Markov chain,
591120	597040	if you have Markov chains that are like recurrent communicating class, so they're in some sense,
597120	601760	they're nice, they're nice Markov chains. I'll just use the word nice as a non technical term,
601760	606160	but I gave you the technical for those who want the technical recurrent communicating one current
606160	612240	communicating class. They have been a probability measure that tells you long term, what are the
612240	616000	probabilities of the different states that you'll see like, what was the probability of seeing red,
616000	620720	maybe long term, you see red a third of the time, blue two thirds of the time and green,
620720	625680	you don't see hardly at all. Maybe, maybe that's the long term problem. That's called the stationary
625680	633600	measure of the Markov chain. And so it turns out that when you have a big measure and then a trace,
634400	641440	sorry, a big chain in a trace chain, that the stationary measure of the trace chain is exactly
641440	648080	the restriction of those of the stationary measure of the bigger chain to that subset of states.
648080	652400	In other words, it's all compatible. So you have a big measure for the stationary measure of the
652400	657600	big guy, and maybe three of the states are what you trace on. Well, if you look at the big guy's
657600	662320	probability measure on those three states, that's exactly what you get on the little guy, just
662320	665920	renormalize so that it's a probability measure, you have to renormalize it so it's probability.
665920	673120	So all of these stationary measures are, they follow through this logic. And so it turns out,
673680	678400	this then means that there's this logic that we discovered on probability measures
678400	688080	that I published 30 years ago. And it's, I published it with Bruce Bennett, who's a,
688080	694080	he's now dead, but a brilliant mathematician, and Parish Murthy, who's a graduate student
694080	700640	of mathematics. So it's two mathematicians and a flunky me working on this. And what we published
700640	705440	it in the Journal of Math Psych, and what we, what we proved is that there was a logic on
705440	711520	probability measures where one probability measure implies another or entails another
711520	716800	probability measure, if and only if it's a normalized restriction. So I get the bigger
716800	721200	probability measure, I take a subset of its states, renormalize the probability on that,
721200	725360	and that's the probability of this guy down here. It turns out that's, so it's a simple idea. You
725360	729680	know, I'm just a normalized restriction of the bigger measure, but then that's the implication
730240	736880	that gives you a non Boolean logic. That's, there's no global compliment, just like in,
736880	741920	by the way, this trace logic, there's no global compliment. Okay. Locally, there is,
741920	749440	because you have a local Boolean logic, but globally not. So it turns out, this last thing
749440	754080	I'm about to say, we haven't proven it, but we're going to try to do that. There's a homomorphism
754080	758560	of the logics, that the trace logic is essentially homomorphic to the what we call the Lebesgue
758560	765760	logic, probability measures. So this gives us the trace logic gives us a formal theory of
765760	771840	observation. And the Lebesgue logic of probability measures gives us a formal mere theory of
773680	779280	probabilistic belief. And so putting them together with this homomorphism shows how
779280	785120	observations are formally related to probabilistic beliefs. Okay. So this is for us,
786080	794000	a major breakthrough in terms of the formalism. And we had to go after this because you mentioned
794000	800160	our paper on the subatomic world, you know, so conscious agents in the subatomic world. Well,
800160	808080	we have to say what we mean when we're talking about modeling observations of quarks and gluons
808080	814000	inside the proton. What do we mean? Well, so now we have this, we mean that we're going to be
814000	820960	positing some bigger Markov chain. And our observations will be some trace chains, right,
820960	829120	of that bigger chain. And the trace chain will have two ways that it's doing this observation. One is
830640	834720	the number of states that is tracing on, right? So that's going to be one parameter.
835920	841200	The more states you trace on, in some sense, the better spatial resolution you've got, right?
842080	849360	Right. So the, so if I have, you know, if my big chain has 1000 states, that would be a very big
849360	856800	chain, at least for my computer. And suppose I have a trace chain that's only 10 states versus
856800	861760	another one that's 100 states versus another one that's 500 substates of the big chain, right?
861760	867280	The one that 500 substates is in some sense a higher resolution observation than the one that
867280	874720	only has, you know, 50 states. The 50 state one is observing the big 1000 state one. It is observing
874720	880720	it, but not nearly with the resolution of the, you know, 500 state one. Almost like quantifying
880720	887040	that sort of objective. It gives you complete quantification. And for the physicists, this
887040	891520	would be our quantification of what they call Q squared, which is their technical thing for
891840	899040	spatial resolution. It's tied to the amount of energy that they use, when higher energy
899920	904640	leads to better spatial resolution. So what we're basically now doing is identifying
905280	910640	higher energies with greater spatial resolution in our trace chains, which is that itself is
910640	916560	a non-trivial statement. There's a lot that's said there, obviously, because it's very complex
916560	920720	and a lot of people find it very difficult. I've noticed a lot of people find your theory
920720	925120	so fascinating and want to jump on board so badly, but the math and the physics
925120	931920	become so complicated that they just can't do it. And the only way I can is when, is by first,
931920	936320	obviously chatting to you, watching, reading your content, but then chatting to friends or
936320	940560	physicists, trying to get their opinion on all of this and trying from their perspective to
940560	945360	understand what you're talking about. And the more I do, the easier it gets. It gets to sort of
945360	951440	understand it. But I still feel left in the dark knowing that you have access to more information
952000	957120	based on the base of knowledge you have within physics and mathematics. Have you felt that it's
957120	962080	a bit of a struggle to try and get this out there because of the complexity of this topic?
962080	967200	Do you feel people find that you're hiding behind these sort of fancy words? Because I've noticed
967200	973200	that a lot of people comment about that saying that, okay, once you mention decorated permutations
973280	978480	or permutations, or once you mention Mark of Blankets, you're just trying to sound smart.
978480	983120	But that's not the case. Because when I chat to my physicists, friends, they seem to know what
983120	989920	you're talking about a lot better than the layman. If someone thinks that, I mean, we have a paper
989920	994480	called Fusions of Consciousness. So you can just go look at the paper Fusions of Consciousness.
994480	1002480	And we don't just mention the word decorated permutation, we actually create a new mathematics
1002480	1007920	of decorated permutations for Mark of Chains. So it's not just handwaves. I only talk about it
1007920	1012880	because we're using it and we're using it to good purpose. I'll put a link to Fusions of Consciousness.
1012880	1017840	And I think that one came out in January, if I'm not... Yeah, in January, that's right.
1019120	1026560	So I'll just mention that. So I agree with what you're saying that it's difficult and I try to
1026560	1033280	talk about this stuff in a way that's generally accessible. But the problem is, of course, if
1033280	1038000	you do that, then people say, well, it's not serious. And if you do it seriously, then I
1038000	1042880	can't understand it. He's just throwing out these technical words. So it's a catch 22. But my attitude
1042880	1049840	is what I do get potential graduate students. And this is one reason why I do these podcasts.
1049840	1055040	And I'm interested in getting young people who are young enough that they can start to learn
1055040	1061600	the math and make contributions, get them excited and get them studying this stuff. I spent an hour
1061600	1066640	and a half with one student, potential student yesterday talking about and gave her a bunch of
1066640	1072960	math to read. And so that's what I'm doing it for, is to actually get graduate students working on
1072960	1079440	their PhDs in this field. That's my goal. I've noticed someone else who has this problem because
1080240	1085520	it's Carl Friston. When I chatted to Carl, and we spoke about his approach to the free energy
1085520	1091520	principle, he has exactly the same issue. He's often accused of hiding behind fancy talk, they
1091520	1098400	sort of say. So you really are stuck between a rock and a hard place. How do you dumb down
1098400	1104880	something that is so complex? Do you find that there's a specific way you think that's best to
1104880	1110320	approach this so far? Have you hacked the code yet? Well, for communicating it,
1113840	1121360	probably the best approach that I've seen so far to get people to take this idea seriously and to
1121360	1129840	not just dismiss it, is to point out the failure of physical hysteries. That seems, because I'm,
1130640	1135200	some of my say, look, the brain does it. Forget all this stuff about
1135200	1140160	consciousness. I mean, look at all the physical hysteria. It's clear we have all these neural
1140160	1146560	correlates of consciousness. We're almost there. We're getting these neural, we got lots of neural
1146560	1151520	correlates of consciousness. We have all these nice integrated information theory. We have
1151520	1157600	orchestrated collapse of quantum states of microtubules. We have attention to schema theory.
1160000	1166160	There's, I think I already mentioned integrated information. So there's just a bunch of these,
1166160	1173360	oh, global workspace theory is another big one. It's a global workspace theory. So why do we need
1173360	1178640	someone who's clearly off and moving land and talking to the same consciousness is fundamental
1178640	1184080	and so forth? And so for me, the thing that I think is the most grabbing thing to say is,
1184320	1190720	if you ask any of these theorists, opponents of these theories, okay, you're integrated
1190720	1196240	information theory. This is the theory about conscious experiences. Okay. So you're starting
1196240	1202320	with some substrate, maybe it's physical or some other substrate, and you have this causal
1202320	1206480	architecture that's got the right pattern of integrated information. And you're saying that
1206480	1212720	that will explain the qualia of specific conscious experiences called the color green,
1212720	1221360	color green, the taste of chocolate, the smell of garlic, the experience of auditory space versus
1221360	1228080	the experience of visual space or the experience of haptic space as conscious experiences. So
1229200	1235520	which, so clearly you've been at this for a couple of decades. So you must have a whole
1235520	1240080	bunch of conscious experiences that you can now say this is the pattern of integrated information
1240080	1248960	that must be the taste of chocolate. So give me what have you got? Zero. And you go to every
1248960	1254560	theory and you ask them, so what have you got? How many qualia have you given me the global
1254560	1259840	workspace architecture for or the orchestrated collapse of quantum states with neuronal microtubules
1259840	1267120	or integrated information, what they call the Q shape? How many do you have? Zero in every case.
1267840	1272880	So we have these theories that have been out there for decades, decades now that are batting
1272880	1281040	zero. And I'm saying they're batting zero for principled reasons. Spacetime, the physicists,
1281040	1286160	the high energy theoretical physicists are telling us, spacetime is not fundamental and
1286160	1293920	reductionism is false. These theories are failing because they're not listening to modern high
1293920	1299280	energy theoretical physicists that are telling us that that game is over. We're playing an old
1299280	1304240	game. It's like someone after Einstein trying to play the Newtonian game in understanding chemistry.
1304240	1310640	Yes. Good luck. You can't understand chemistry using Newton. You have to use quantum mechanics.
1310640	1313360	I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said Einstein, I should have said quantum theory.
1313360	1318080	Yes. So done before you move on from that. I've because one of the questions one of the
1318080	1322240	questions from the audience. So I gathered a bunch from YouTube, Twitter, etc.
1322960	1328240	Unfortunately, sometimes I forgot to actually write on the person's name. So I've just left
1328240	1332320	them all out together. So I'm just going to ask you them at random. But one of the questions was
1332960	1336640	directed at one of your statements, because you've said this before, you're talking about the taste
1336640	1342240	of chocolate, you're talking about the smell of garlic. This person says that whenever you mention
1342240	1350320	those specific states, they want to know why do you want such a direct portion of consciousness.
1350320	1355200	So let's say when you're asking for that qualitative qualia experience of the taste of
1355200	1361040	chocolate, why go after a specific state? Because everything in the mind is so blurry,
1361040	1365600	so mismatched, there's so much going on, there's so much, let's say heuristics involved.
1366720	1371840	Wouldn't that be a bad approach to trying to provide proof of a theory?
1373600	1379200	Well, all I'm doing is saying to the people who are offering these theories, like the integrated
1379200	1382960	information theory or global workspace, whatever, they're the ones that are saying,
1382960	1386800	we will start with neural activity or this Q shape, and we will give you
1387680	1392640	conscious experiences. We will give you these experiences. I'm saying, okay,
1392640	1398000	that's what you're promising to do. So I'm just asking you, since that's what you said you're
1398000	1405360	going to do, I'm just asking you how is it going? By the way, I asked Julia Tononi this back in
1405440	1410480	late 1990s, he came to UC Irvine to our Helmholtz Club meeting, and I asked him that,
1411520	1418400	and he didn't have any done, and I asked him a few years ago in Canada at a conference,
1418400	1426160	asked him again, and he admitted he needed to offer one, and he couldn't. And same thing with
1426800	1431520	Stuart Hammerhoff, I mean, I had him at a conference in front of 400 or 500 people,
1431520	1436160	I asked him, you know, so Stuart, how's it going? I mean, you're promising that we'll start with
1436160	1440320	these orchestrated collapses, and you'll give us specific conscious experiences. So which ones,
1440320	1444800	I mean, that's what you claim that you're doing. So how many conscious experiences have you nailed
1444800	1449600	down? And I had to push him for three or four minutes before he finally said, because he was
1449600	1454400	hemming and homing. And I said, no, no, no, Stuart, give me one. No, Stuart, give me one.
1454400	1461040	And he finally said, no, I can't give you one. So I'm just, now, if they want to say, you know,
1461040	1464880	we have these wonderful theories, integrative information theory, and they have nothing to do
1465600	1470800	with the taste of chocolate and the smell of garlic, fine, then I won't ask you the question.
1470800	1477360	But if they do say that, then hey, the science is science, where's the beef? So that's why I do it.
1477360	1481520	Don, I'm curious about your opinion. Was it about, it was about two months ago, I think,
1481520	1489440	about the IIT. Swaray, I mean, that was such a major issue within the philosophy community here,
1490320	1494080	and science community in general. What were your thoughts on that? Just for the context for
1494080	1499120	the listeners, it's the whole debacle way IIT was accused of being pseudoscience.
1500000	1506960	Right. That's right. And when I looked at the letter that was put out there and the references
1506960	1511360	that they gave, one of the things they referenced was Michael Graziano on a paper of his on
1512800	1518960	attentional schema theory, where it basically says theory of consciousness is either mechanical
1519040	1525520	or it's magical. And so the, the signers of that were basically signing on to look at theory of
1525520	1530400	consciousness is either mechanical and presumably neuro mechanical, but maybe AI kind of mechanical,
1530400	1538080	but, but most of them are thinking neuro mechanical, right? Or it's magical. And so what, what, so the
1538080	1547200	argument is that IIT is claiming some kind of substrate independence. There is a substrate,
1547200	1550880	so that it doesn't say that consciousness is fundamental. It says there is a substrate to
1550880	1555360	consciousness, but the substrate might not be physical. Of course, they're, they're thinking
1555360	1560640	it's physical, right? That's, I mean, ask them, so what is, so how many non physical substrates
1560640	1564800	are you, you know, have you concentrated everything? So what are you going to say,
1564800	1569680	ectoplasm? I don't know. So, so, but anyway, they're, they're, they're saying that there's a
1569680	1574320	substrate, but they're not committed to a neural, put it this way, there's not necessarily a neural
1574320	1579120	substrate. It could be some kind of computational architecture that's completely non neural. So,
1579120	1584240	so I don't think they're going non physical, but they could be going non neural. And
1587280	1593680	so that means that they're, they're dealing with something that is, it looks like a disembodied
1593680	1600160	mathematical causal structure, right? Although the IIT people would of course say it has to be
1601120	1609920	instantiated and something. So the substrate is, is, is important. But somehow they think that because
1609920	1618160	it's not, they're not tying, they're not starting with neurons. They're not starting with, with
1618160	1624000	neural circuitry or something like that and trying to show that that leads to consciousness. They're
1624000	1629600	starting with something more abstract and not necessarily mechanical. It's not like this fires
1629600	1634880	and that fires and we have this circuit and so forth. It's more abstract mathematical kind of
1634880	1640800	thing. So I'm just trying to explain the kind of get in the heads of the people that are,
1640800	1649360	they're worried about this. They're, and so they're, they're concerned about that. Now my,
1650560	1659280	my attitude is, I think that all of these theories have the problem that I just mentioned, which is
1659360	1666240	there's no beef. There's no, no success in the, in terms of specific conscious experiences. And,
1666240	1671840	and what's happened is all the physicalists, I think that they're starting to understand
1672960	1678880	that they're not, they have nothing in terms of concrete conscious experiences that they can explain
1679760	1687520	without hand waves. They're zero. They're forming a circular firing squad, right? They're, they're,
1687520	1692880	they're shooting at each other and, and everybody's vulnerable to the, the objection that I just gave.
1693600	1698480	The objection is you claim that you'll start with integrated information or I start with,
1698480	1703040	you know, higher order theory. Now, now we're doing the neural stuff, higher order theories or
1703040	1708320	first order theories or global workspace theory. And I'm going to give you specific conscious
1708320	1712880	experiences. Which one? Oh, I can't give you any right now. How long we've been doing this? Decades.
1712880	1718720	We've been doing this for decades and can't give me one. So, so at some point people get impatient
1718720	1726000	and go, you know, no, no, I should say I'm good friends. These are, these are my friends and
1726000	1732320	colleagues, right? So they're brilliant. Some of them are geniuses. All of them are brilliant. And
1732320	1738560	some of them are geniuses. Why are they not making progress? There is not because they're not smart.
1738560	1744560	They're brilliant. They're not making progress because we're not listening to what the high
1744560	1751120	energy theoretical physicists are telling us. Space time is doomed and reductionism is false.
1752000	1760160	We have to listen to our best current science. It was fine 30 years ago to assume that space
1760160	1763600	time is fundamental and reductionism is the way to go. In fact, it was the right
1764560	1769840	approach given our current science at the time. But it's no longer, it's no longer feasible. It's
1769840	1775440	ignoring, it's frankly just ignoring our best science. And that's not what we want to do.
1775440	1782160	So my prediction is as soon as these brilliant colleagues and friends of mine
1782960	1788880	really understand that we need a new framework and they switch, I think all of a sudden we'll make
1788880	1793440	some serious progress on this field. And we'll look back and realize that we're in sort of the
1793440	1799440	Flat Earth period of this field. And as long as you assume Flat Earth, you can't do a space program.
1800080	1805600	As soon as you let go of Flat Earth, then you start to have the tools that you need to actually
1805600	1811680	start doing a space program. You mentioned Michael Graziano. He was the first person I
1811680	1816960	interviewed on this podcast. And this feels like ages ago. But I remember him saying that
1816960	1822480	if you take attention schema theory and you plop it on top of global workspace theory,
1822480	1829760	he believes that together it actually would provide a very complete theory of consciousness.
1829760	1834640	But I can't help but think based on the fact that he's saying that based on the fact that
1834640	1840560	they used it's either mechanical or magical. Do you think it would be similar to compare
1840560	1846480	Michael's theory and global workspace if they continue to do as well as they do separately and
1846480	1852960	maybe even together to be the Newton's theory in physics or Newtonian physics of the brain?
1853600	1859680	And then while you guys are going on to sort of do the Einstein's theory of consciousness,
1859680	1862480	do you think you guys are going to approach consciousness in that sort of way?
1864240	1868800	Yeah. Now, I should be very, very clear that I think that the work that they're doing
1868800	1875280	on getting models of the neural correlates of consciousness is brilliant and useful and that
1875280	1881920	will survive. But it's not a theory of the generation of consciousness. It's a theory about
1881920	1890720	how we see consciousness correlated with parts of brain activity. So I'm all for that. Now,
1891360	1896320	my understanding about Graziano is at least in some of his writings, I've gotten the impression
1896320	1903840	that he thinks that the conscious experiences is in some sense an illusion. There aren't really
1903840	1910000	quality, but we have the illusion. He calls it a caricature. He actually intentionally avoids
1910000	1920000	the word illusion. Right. So if he doesn't want to use the word illusion, Keith Frankish does.
1920000	1927280	So Keith does use the word illusion. And if Michael wants to use caricature, that's fine.
1927360	1931920	But as a scientist, my feeling, I'll say first about the illusion approach.
1933360	1937680	And I've said this to, I mean, Keith is a great guy. I really enjoy talking with him. I feel
1937680	1945120	he's a friend and so forth. But I've pointed this out to him and he hasn't demurred that saying that
1945120	1950720	it's an illusion doesn't get him off the hook because we now need a scientific theory about what
1951920	1956320	specific pattern of brain activity must be the illusion of the taste of chocolate and could
1956320	1960880	not be the illusion of garlic. So you might think, oh, well, now that they said it's an illusion,
1960880	1963920	they don't have the problem, the problems bring up. No, no, no, no, no. They have,
1964880	1969760	we have to do science here. If you're saying it's an illusion, I want to have a precise scientific
1969760	1974800	theory about why that has to be that illusion and couldn't be, you know, this illusion.
1977280	1983360	They call it the illusion problem. That's right. And I would say the same thing,
1983520	1990240	you know, from Graziano, if it's a character, then why should this particular brain activity be
1990240	1995760	the caricature of the color green and not the caricature of the color red? I mean, I want to,
1995760	1999280	again, as a scientist, I don't want to hand wave and I don't want to say because I called it
1999280	2006480	caricature. I don't owe you a scientific theory. I mean, I'm not interested. I'm interested in
2006480	2014080	results. I want a theory where the existence of illusion or a caricature or the real qualia.
2014080	2018800	I want a theory that gives me the beef and says this pattern must be this caricature and it couldn't
2018800	2024320	be that caricature. Otherwise, I mean, I'm philosophy is fine. I have a joint appointment
2024320	2029680	in philosophy. I love philosophy, but I'm talking science here. And so I want a scientific theory.
2029680	2032800	So that's sort of my attitude about that whole thing.
2032800	2038160	Yeah. And I think what I was trying to get at was, it will still be very useful and it will
2038160	2043200	actually work in the sense that in the same way Newtonian physics works, because we still use
2043200	2049200	it, it's still very practical. It's just doesn't go away. So in that sense, it will still be very,
2049200	2058080	very good at its job. I agree. But also, you'll have some, with Newton, you have some misconceptions.
2058080	2062000	You have the idea that, well, I should be able to get the position and the momentum
2062000	2067360	at the same time to arbitrary accuracy when I'm looking at stuff. So you're led to believe
2067360	2075120	certain things. Well, that turned out to be false. And so the absolutely Newton is great
2075120	2079440	if you want to send a rocket to the moon, it'll work. And for a lot of everyday stuff.
2079440	2085920	But sometimes it leads you into conceptual errors, like position momentum. And something like
2087200	2090640	these physicalist theories, I think they will be very, very good for the neural correlates
2090640	2095600	of consciousness and so forth. But they're going to lead to some, they are leading to what I think
2095600	2101840	are fundamental errors. And I'll name one that I think is a crucial error. They want to make
2101840	2106720	a distinction between which circuits of the brain or which physical objects in general
2106720	2113600	are conscious, which ones are not. So they want to use IIT in hospitals to determine whether
2113600	2119920	someone's a vegetable or not. You know, should we pull the plug or not? So that's something that
2119920	2126400	you as a doctor are quite interested in, I'm sure. And so they're making the assumption
2127280	2133600	that some physical systems are associated with consciousness and others are not.
2134800	2142720	That's their assumption. Now, if it turns out that space time isn't fundamental,
2143280	2147520	and objects in space time are not fundamental. In other words, if we listen to what the high
2147520	2151840	energy theoretical physicists are telling us, and they're saying that there are structures
2151840	2156480	outside of space time, and they're finding them like amplituhedron and decorated permutations.
2160960	2165360	What is space time? It's not the fundamental reality anymore and objects in space time are not.
2166080	2170800	So now we have to understand what is that. And so what I'm proposing is that space time
2170800	2176720	and objects in space time are just a headset, just an interface. So think about it that way.
2176960	2183040	Here I'm using an interface to talk with you. And I see I'm using Zoom, we're talking about Zoom.
2183040	2187440	And I see a bunch of pixels on the screen. And I see pixels of Tevin's face.
2188800	2196080	And I see also pixels of a wall behind you. Now, I'm getting a lot of conscious input from the
2196080	2200720	pixels on your face. I mean, I can see your expression. I can see if you're interested or not.
2200720	2207200	The pixels on the wall, not much. Now, I could say, aha, so I want to have
2208160	2213600	the pixel correlates of consciousness. So these are the conscious pixels,
2214400	2218320	the ones on and those are the conscious pixels in Tevin's face. And the ones on the wall, those
2218320	2223840	are not conscious pixels. And so now I'm going to have my little mathematical model. These pixels
2223840	2228160	are conscious and those pixels are not because these have some complicated pattern of interaction
2228160	2235680	and those do not. Well, that's completely wrongheaded. Pixels are pixels, period. Some
2236560	2242400	they're not conscious or unconscious. They're they're a merely a headset, an interface.
2242400	2248960	Some pixels give me access to a conscious consciousness behind the Zoom. And others don't.
2249760	2255120	And so when you realize that that's so that is a fundamental difference here.
2256000	2259760	Right. If we use something like integrated information theory, which is saying certain
2259760	2267040	physical systems are conscious and others are not, I'm saying that claim is absolutely false.
2268400	2274880	And it's dangerous to assume it in hospital settings. So this is the academic.
2274880	2278800	Yes. So now this goes beyond this is very practical. This becomes very important
2278800	2283120	for us as a society. And that's actually the main when I started the podcast.
2284080	2290320	One of the one of the description layers was this podcast is function is to show just how
2290320	2295680	difficult intellectually and practically the mind, body problems, because the moment you
2295680	2300640	do finally figure out whatever theory of consciousness you want to develop and grow,
2300640	2305760	it has so many practical implications. And in this case, I mean, you're touching on a very,
2305760	2308640	very big one. I mean, debt that we're talking life and death of this.
2309600	2318240	Absolutely. And pulling the plug or not. And it's if the foundation is so wrong that it's
2318240	2322400	actually it's at the level of saying these pixels are conscious and these pixels are not is that
2322400	2328960	kind of error. Then we have to be very, very careful about it. So, so, so this is not just
2328960	2333840	academic anymore, saying that space time as a headset has real, real implications,
2333840	2340720	moral implications, and technological implications. And it also has implications for the whole debate
2340720	2346480	about can AI be conscious, right? This gives you the standard way that that's considered. And again,
2346480	2350720	it brings up all sorts of moral questions that people are worried about. But the way it's thought
2350720	2358800	about is we have a physical system that a priori is not conscious. Somehow, if we give it the right
2358880	2366320	kind of complexity, computational complexity, it will be conscious. Well, that's exactly the same
2366320	2371280	mistake as saying if I get the right kind of complexity in the zoom pixel activity,
2371280	2377360	it'll be consciousness. No, it's not. It's just so certain zoom pixels give me a portal into
2377360	2383280	Tevin's consciousness. And other zoom pixels on my screen don't give me any portals into Tevin's
2383280	2390400	consciousness. The pixels are not conscious or unconscious. It's about the headset and how it's
2390400	2397360	engaged to what's beyond space time was outside the space time and how it's effectively or not
2397360	2402640	effectively giving us access to what's beyond space time. The whole point of a headset is to
2402640	2408160	simplify things. And at some point, you're going to simplify things so, so much that you can't really
2408160	2416320	say much about it, right? When I look at you, my interface has given me a portal into your
2416320	2422160	consciousness that's good, not perfect. Even if you've lived with someone, you've been married to
2422160	2426720	someone for 30 years, you find out that there's things you don't know, right? So it's not a
2426720	2431280	perfect portal. But when I look at my cat, the portal is even worse. And when I look at an ant,
2431280	2437200	it's even worse, and a microbe, it's even worse. When I look at a rock, my headset is given up.
2437760	2441280	Because headsets are there to simplify things. At some point, it has to give up.
2442000	2448400	So it's not that the rock is, it's not that like the Tevin human body is conscious or not
2448400	2453440	conscious, and the rock is conscious. It's just that these are symbols that give us portals into
2454000	2458880	a preexisting consciousness or not. In the case of the rock, my idea is that we're interacting
2458880	2464080	with consciousness all the time. But when I see a rock, I'm not getting much insight into the
2464080	2467840	consciousness that I'm interacting with. It's not, so I'm not saying the rock is conscious,
2467840	2473520	it's not panpsychism. So I'm not, I'm not a panpsychist. Headset is a headset, consciousness is
2473520	2478800	consciousness. I'm not saying that, you know, the most panpsychists are thinking that that
2478800	2485040	space time is fundamental. Particles are fundamental. But behind the equations of physics and behind
2485040	2490160	the particles, what breathes fire into the equations and life into the particles is consciousness
2490160	2494960	inside space time. But we'll keep the same laws of physics and so forth, you know. So
2495680	2500400	consciousness is sort of almost along for the ride, but the laws of physics are really doing all the,
2500400	2506080	I'm having, I'm good friends with Philip Goff and we have good discussions on that. And Philip
2506080	2512480	has said to me that he's willing to let go of space time, but we'll see, you know, I'll push
2512480	2519520	to let go of that. And if he does, I think we'll be very, very close in our views. But so, you know,
2519520	2524160	I think that, well, I think I'll just stop there. I'm going to chat to Philip and I think
2524160	2527920	Jan of Feb, I can't remember when we scheduled it, but I'm going to ask him about this. I'm going
2527920	2533200	to see how close he's gotten to that sort of conversion. But I'm glad you're touching, as it
2533200	2537600	stands, Don, you're touching on some practical stuff at the moment. And this is what I sort of
2537600	2541760	premised a lot of these questions on, which is great, because I think that these practical
2541760	2546480	implications of understanding this headset or understanding this virtual reality, this matrix,
2546480	2551440	whatever people want to call it, it's pretty much the same thing. You are saying that this world
2551440	2556480	we're living in is a sort of simulation in that sense, it is a virtual reality. Some people love
2556480	2562160	you using the word matrix, just to be clear, it's not the same type of matrix as from the movie,
2562160	2568560	but nevertheless, the word matrix seems to be now synonymous with simulation. In this virtual
2568560	2575440	reality, you just go to this question that I have for you. How do mental health or mental
2575440	2582720	disabilities work within this sort of framework? Does your work now give you a sort of, I know
2582720	2588640	you have to now almost become a philosopher and sort of maybe even guesstimate certain aspects
2588640	2593200	of this, because it's very difficult to go outside this box already. And to go even further beyond
2593200	2599200	space time to now give me mental health theories is going to be even more difficult. But just out
2599200	2606640	of curiosity, what is it? Is it a bug in the actual virtual reality? What's going on here?
2612240	2617280	So the way I think about it is that there's space and time and what we see in space and time is
2617280	2623440	just a headset. And behind the headset is this realm of consciousness. So that's another part
2623440	2627440	of the ontology that we're proposing. I'm not saying I'm right, I'm just saying I'm trying to be
2627520	2632480	precise. And I've got to say something specific. So I'm saying that there's a vast social network
2632480	2638800	of conscious agents that in some sense, probably are ultimately, I'll realize that there's one
2638800	2643920	conscious agent and this network is just a nice analytic tool that I have to use as a scientist.
2643920	2649120	So I'll talk about there's one conscious agent, but I'm using this network, because that's what
2649120	2657440	I need to use to do mathematics. So that one conscious agent, what is it up to?
2659680	2666240	And why, right? I don't know. So I guess, but one possibility is
2668480	2671440	it's a theorem that no system can ever understand itself completely.
2674240	2677760	If I have a computer system and it wants to understand itself, it has to build a model of
2677760	2681520	itself. Well, as soon as it builds a model of itself, now it's more complicated. So now to
2681520	2685840	understand itself, the new self of the model is going to have to model itself with a model,
2685840	2695360	and you get in this infinite recursion. So maybe what the, maybe the one infinite consciousness,
2695920	2702640	which transcends any particular instantiation, like a spacetime instantiation or whatever,
2702640	2706320	you know, we have a three dimensions of space, one dimension of time, what about a 50 dimensions
2706320	2713120	of space in one dimension of time? I can see seven million colors. Why not 20 trillion colors?
2713680	2721680	And new, in other words, this is just one possible form instantiation that the consciousness can use
2721680	2729600	out of an infinite potential to look at itself. So what consciousness is up to is looking at itself
2730080	2740880	from different perspectives, and then losing itself in the perspective, identify. So I'm now
2740880	2745280	identified with the Hoffman body. I think I'm only, you know, I'm just that, and I'm nothing more,
2745280	2750000	and I'm afraid of death and the whole bit. And then slowly waking up and realizing, oh, no, no,
2752000	2759280	I now know myself because I know I'm not Hoffman. So all the stuff that I thought I was,
2759600	2763840	and I immersed myself, you know, both feet, I jumped in with both feet on this thing,
2765440	2774080	and spent 70 years, 80 years, 90 years, and then woke up. And now I know myself because I know,
2775040	2781280	I know myself better because I know I'm not that. So knowing yourself by a bunch of negations.
2782080	2790320	And so now, from that point of view, the one can know itself by being a paraplegic,
2791920	2802080	or having, you know, Alzheimer's, or you're having, you know, any kind of mental disease
2802080	2805600	you want, some kind of nervous breakdown. I just have nervous breakdowns all the time,
2805680	2812720	or whatever it might be. Or I also experienced myself as being, you know, the world's fastest
2812720	2819200	Olympic runner, and the world's Einstein, and then I'll wake up, but I'm not that either.
2820880	2828080	So in other words, essentially, even behind someone who looks completely debilitated
2828960	2834400	is this infinite consciousness, just looking at itself. So in that point of view,
2834400	2840320	everything deserves equal respect, right? So there's, there's a moral aspect to this, which
2840320	2847280	says when I see someone who has an IQ of 50, there's no difference between me and that.
2847280	2853040	When I look at my cat, is I am the same one consciousness that's also looking at me through
2853040	2857600	the cat. Those are just different avatars of the one consciousness from this point of view.
2858160	2864160	So what happens from this point of view is there is no grounds for
2870080	2877200	putting barriers between me and anybody else. This actually says I am that just looking at it
2877200	2883280	through a different interface. And this I think is the foundation for a genuine love,
2883280	2888000	that love is recognizing is not just loving the other as yourself, it's recognizing that
2888000	2892480	the other is yourself. It's you, the infinite consciousness looking at yourself through a
2892480	2898960	different avatar. You see this sort of play out in a lot of ancient cultures as well, where
2899760	2904400	let's say someone goes out and hunts for food, they kill the animal and they sort of pray to it,
2905840	2911440	hug it, do a sort of sing songs around it, because they know they have to eat this being
2911440	2919200	that is sort of still part of them. And this is quite a recurring theme with religions,
2919200	2927600	with sort of spiritualists. And I've noticed a lot of idealist theories in general tend to lead
2927600	2933600	to this. That's right. I didn't intend to go there. Yeah, which is quite fascinating.
2936320	2939760	I mean, I was just sort of led by, you know, if I'm going to assume that consciousness is
2939840	2944720	fundamental, and I started this one step after another, and I sort of led kicking and screaming
2944720	2950640	to this, but now that I've gone there, it starts to make sense. It's so counterintuitive,
2952080	2958560	but that counterintuitiveness might just be the one jumped in with both feet, and it let
2958560	2962560	itself get completely lost in it. In other words, if you're really going to know that you're not
2962560	2967520	that, you have to believe that you are it for a while. You really let yourself believe it and
2967520	2972400	then wake up. And then you really, you took that very, very seriously. You really understood what
2972400	2979760	it meant to be a Tevin or a Don or, you know, Michael Graziano or whoever it might be. You
2979760	2985200	learned what it meant to be that, and you realized, I'm not that. I am this consciousness that transcends
2985200	2992080	that. It's like when Bernardo talks about this dissociated altars, I mean, off a universal
2992080	2996080	mind, Bernardo Castro, when he says, it's pretty much the same in that universal mind. And we're
2996080	3003040	just these avatars or dissociated altars of the same sort of entity. There is no separation here
3003040	3010560	at all. That's right. So I'm pretty much on the same page with Bernardo on most things. One little
3010560	3015920	wrinkle that we add though, and it may not be just a little wrinkle is that this trace logic that I
3015920	3024080	mentioned at the start is the first formal structure I found outside of space time about
3024080	3030080	the structure of the one. And it's a non-bullion logic. And there's no global complement.
3031440	3037840	So this is the first hint I've gotten of a structure. And I'm not saying that this is
3037840	3042880	the final word about the structure of one. Absolutely not. But it's the first baby step.
3043440	3049280	And the first baby step in terms of a mathematical model of, quote unquote, God of the one
3049840	3056720	is already blowing my mind because it's not clear what the word one even means. If this thing
3058400	3066480	is not a bullion logic, there is no like one top Markovian kernel. So I use the word one,
3066480	3071440	but right now when I use it, already my math is telling me, Don, you're gonna have to think
3071440	3078880	deeper that the word one doesn't, whatever kind of unity that is, is not a trivial unity. And it's
3078880	3085600	not a bullion logic by any means. So what do you mean by the one? So already the math,
3086480	3091280	I might be using the same words that the religious people are using have used for thousands of years.
3092000	3098240	But already the math is telling me this goes way, way deeper than I'd ever imagined. And
3099920	3104320	probably way deeper than the human mind because of the interface limitations we have.
3105280	3110320	Because that's another one of my questions at some point. I mean, how far do you think you're
3110320	3117680	going to get on knowing that we are limited, in essence, and we're never really, we never
3117680	3122080	really evolved the capability to perceive truth. I mean, we know the difference between proofs and
3122080	3127200	truths, the verticality. How close do you really think that this will take you?
3137120	3140800	So sorry, I was going to say that's always a tough question. I mean, when we know that
3140800	3146640	we're so limited, it's so difficult for us to really go beyond anything further and deeper.
3147600	3149200	Does that ever keep you up at night?
3150320	3156880	Well, I think about it quite a bit. I tried to do it during the day.
3160720	3164240	Here's one important aspect of it, though, and that is what is the nature of scientific theory
3164240	3170400	building? What are scientific theories? What do we mean by scientific theory? A theory in science
3171040	3176560	says, please grant me these assumptions. And if you grant me these assumptions and I can make
3176560	3179920	them mathematically precise, so I'll make these assumptions mathematically precise,
3179920	3184320	then I can derive and predict all these wonderful things.
3186800	3192880	And so that's, and if you do it right, the mathematical description of the theory will
3192880	3197840	tell you the scope of those assumptions, how much that they can really do, their power,
3197840	3202800	and it will also tell you the limits, like Einstein's special theory and general theory
3202800	3207600	of relativity. They tell you this great scope of the mathematics tells you it's incredible,
3207600	3211280	predicts black holes, and all of a sudden it's amazing that it works really well.
3211280	3217040	It also tells you when you combine it with Einstein's contribution to quantum theory,
3217040	3224320	E equals H nu, you combine that with that, it tells you that space time is doomed at 10 to the
3224320	3231280	minus 33 centimeters. So it tells you that Einstein's theory is beautiful theory, it tells you the
3231280	3238160	scope and the limits, 10 to the minus 33, that theory dies, 10 to the minus 43 seconds, it's over.
3238880	3243680	So now you might say, well, of course, that's true of any theory, but I can now give you a deeper
3243680	3248400	theory that explains those assumptions of the theory that you just saw give you a deeper
3248400	3252720	theory. Absolutely, you can always get a deeper theory, but your new deeper theory will have
3252720	3261280	its own assumptions. And this goes on ad infinitum. So my take on it is science is one of the best
3261280	3270080	tools we have. I'm doing science, I love science. And science, after billions and billions of years,
3270080	3276080	if we continue to do it for billions and billions of years, the fraction of knowledge that we would
3276080	3284880	have about reality is precisely measure zero, precisely measure zero. And yet, we have to do it.
3286320	3292000	We can never, with science, write a theory of everything. So when we talk about a theory of
3292000	3299600	everything, real scientists do it with a week and a nod. It's a theory of everything so far,
3300400	3309280	and so far is pretty trivial. So I think it's, in principle, the case that scientific theories
3310320	3315920	can never be a theory of everything. But what they can tell us their limits, that's what's
3315920	3320640	powerful about science, that the theories of science tell us their limits, like the theory of
3320640	3326560	evolution of natural selection actually entails that spacetime isn't fundamental. And Einstein's
3326560	3330800	theory of spacetime entails that spacetime isn't fundamental. These theories tell you
3331520	3336640	their limits, right? Because evolution of natural selection, the way Darwin was thinking about it,
3336640	3341600	is talking about organisms in space and time, competing for resources in space and time.
3342800	3348720	And when you look at evolutionary game theory, it tells you that the very categories of space
3348720	3353680	and time and objects are not the fundamental reality. Those are just headset categories.
3354400	3362880	So it tells you its limits. I think what our theories do, that's essential, is they do tell us
3362880	3372320	truths about the particular perspective that our headset gives us. So science can give us
3372320	3380480	truths about our headset. There's an infinite reality of consciousness that transcends any
3380480	3386800	scientific theory. But we can look at different perspectives on that, different possible headsets.
3386800	3391600	Right now, all of science has been looking at a particular spacetime headset, three dimensions
3391600	3397360	of space, one dimension of time, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, it's over with. It's a fairly cheap
3397360	3402560	headset. We thought it was the final reality. It just turned out to be a knockoff cheap headset.
3403680	3408000	But now we've learned the tools inside the headset. We studied the headset, we thought we
3408000	3412000	were studying the truth, it was just the headset. But now that we have the tools, we can step outside
3412000	3418160	the headset and imagine other headsets and imagine, and that's all my theory of consciousness is.
3418160	3424880	It's just a projecting model of consciousness. There's no longer taking spacetime as fundamentals,
3424880	3429360	taking consciousness as fundamental, but I'm recognizing I can never get a theory of the
3429360	3434000	ultimate consciousness. Let me start off with little networks of consciousness, because I can
3434000	3438640	model that, and that's just going to be a projection at best of the deeper reality.
3438640	3442560	So every question you ask, I mean, the answer is not trivial.
3446720	3453520	We, science can never get a theory of everything, but we can get good theories of projections of
3453520	3461360	reality. And then just to put a spiritual twist on it, but you are that reality. You are,
3462320	3468080	from this point of view. And in some sense, you can know at first hand, by just letting go of any
3468080	3474640	theory and letting go of and just being. So when you just sit in meditation, that is the closest
3474640	3483200	you're going to get to what transcends any scientific theory. It's incredible because
3485280	3489600	I've chatted to you many times and I know how you think and I can tell, well, I don't know exactly
3489600	3497040	how you think, but I know how science minded you are and how much it must perhaps annoy you when
3497760	3503040	you're clumped into categories of thinkers when you are actively doing science. Because I know that
3503920	3506960	there are many people I've spoken to on this channel who have the same problem. The moment
3506960	3512400	you step outside any sort of status quo, you're automatically grouped together as either some
3512400	3516720	sort of a hippie scientist or a spiritualist thinker. And they give you these labels that I
3516720	3523360	think are unwarranted and for the most part unfair. And someone who has a similar issue is
3523360	3527840	Thomas Campbell. Because when I spoke to him, your theories are very similar. And one of the
3527840	3532400	questions I wrote down here, and he radiates this because he's trying his best to not be
3532400	3538720	associated any form of religion sort of dogma because he does try and explain things outside
3538720	3544800	of the realm of what we say quote unquote is normal. The question I have here is, and this is not
3544800	3550960	from me, this is from one of the viewers. Where does Thomas Campbell's theory start and
3550960	3557680	Donald Hoffman's theory end? They're just trying to ask, what's the difference between these two
3557680	3562240	different types of virtual realities you guys are talking about? Because they're both very similar.
3562240	3565840	And yet they are very different. I think this person obviously just does not see the greater
3565840	3573200	detail in them. Right. So I did have a conversation with Tom and so I could actually
3573280	3577440	point out there is a podcast where Tom and I go into this in great detail. So I can
3577440	3582000	give you the link to it. Yeah, I'll give you the link to it. So I'll just give a short answer
3582000	3588800	because that's, I mean, Tom and I go at it for an hour or two. So it's very friendly, of course,
3588800	3596320	very friendly. But so he calls it my big toe because there's a big theory of everything.
3596880	3602480	And so I just given you my theory of everything, what that means. And so
3604240	3607440	at the very end of our conversation, I pushed him on it. I said, look,
3608400	3612000	there is no such thing as a theory of everything. Wouldn't you agree? And ultimately,
3612000	3616480	he agreed. There is no theory of everything. Initially, I thought that that might be a big
3616480	3621680	difference between us. But I really wanted to find out. I mean, do you really believe, Tom,
3621680	3628080	that you've got the final word on truth with your theory? Because I don't. If you do believe
3628080	3633520	that, then my theory is utterly different from yours because I think all I've got is a little
3633520	3639200	tiny baby step outside of our headset. And that's all I've got. And I'm never going to have a
3639200	3650560	theory of everything. So the difference I see between us just in terms of practical theory
3650560	3658640	building is he's using a lot of quantum theoretical ideas in his approach, right? A lot of it is
3658640	3664320	using, I mean, he's got advanced, I guess he didn't get his PhD, but he's done advanced research
3664320	3669600	and advanced study, a graduate study in physics. You know, I think he does. I think he's in New
3669600	3674480	York. Does he have a PhD? Yeah, in New York. Okay, so he does have a PhD in nuclear physics. Okay,
3674480	3681120	good. So he's a genuine PhD in physics. And I think that he's trying to use
3684160	3690720	quantum theory, sort of quantum ideas that are foundational in what he's trying to build.
3691760	3699680	And from my point of view, again, the high energy theoretical physicists in the last 20 years
3699760	3704720	are telling us that not only is space time doomed, quantum theory is doomed.
3705760	3710320	They're saying that quantum theory will arise joined at the hip with space time.
3715040	3719280	You might say, well, you know, there's all this weird stuff about quantum mechanics. There's no
3719280	3724080	cloning theorem. You can't clone quantum bits. There's superposition. There's entanglement.
3724080	3730000	This is all weird stuff. And this is surely showing us something deeper about, you know,
3730000	3736400	maybe a conscious reality beyond space time. And the answer appears that
3737840	3746400	from the work of Chris Fuchs on quantum Bayesianism and Robert Speckens, his toy model of quantum
3746400	3752640	physics, all those weirdnesses of quantum theory, no cloning theorem, superposition,
3752640	3757840	entanglement, all that stuff, is simply a symptom of incomplete information.
3758720	3764480	If you have incomplete information about the state of a system, those all follow as theorems.
3765200	3772400	Well, when I say that space time is a headset, that means incomplete information. Your headset
3772400	3778720	is there to chop down the information. That's the whole point of an interface is too complicated
3778720	3783360	out there. So let's dumb it down. Well, so quantum mechanics and all the weirdness of quantum
3783360	3790640	mechanics is merely a symptom of the fact that space time is doomed. So it's not going to give us,
3790640	3797200	so quantum theory by itself is not going to take us outside space time. Quantum theory has its
3797200	3802560	weirdnesses because it's tied to the limits of space time. So what's different between my approach
3802640	3809520	and Tom's is, and by the way, most people who are trying to use some kind of modern physics
3809520	3817040	to do some kind of exploration of consciousness, they're tied to many of our arts. Quantum is it,
3817040	3822640	right? And I'm saying, not if you believe the high energy theoretical physicists,
3823520	3829440	it's not it. It's going to arise from deeper structures. And by the way, it's not a hand wave.
3829440	3837200	So they found like the amplitude hydrant is, is the structure outside of space time. It's a real
3837200	3842720	structure is published, you can go read about it. Its volumes give you the scattering amplitudes
3843760	3848880	of real processes in space time, much easier than doing Feynman diagrams in space time.
3849440	3853280	Hundreds of pages of Feynman diagrams, two or three, turn into two or three terms,
3853280	3859120	you can do by hand. And there are no Hilbert spaces to be seen anywhere in the amplitude hydrant.
3859600	3863520	And therefore, there is no quantum theory. And in the physics like Neymar, Connie,
3863520	3867760	Hamed and these guys who are doing this are very, very clear. There is no quantum theory here.
3868720	3875120	This is beyond space time and quantum theory. Uniterity, which is one of the key things we
3875120	3879040	can talk about Uniterity. I mean, there are some who argue that Uniterity is not essential to
3879040	3888480	quantum theory, but most physicists say it is. Uniterity and locality are products of this
3888480	3892400	thing, but they're not built into the thing. They, they can give it to you in the projection,
3892400	3896800	but they are, they are outside of space time, and they're outside of quantum theory.
3897440	3904640	So, so it's, you can see that the difference, maybe at a, at some level, Tom and I are,
3905360	3909680	our concepts are similar, but the spirit in which we're doing things is very, very different.
3909680	3915840	I'm saying, I'm, I'm letting go of quantum theory entirely, I'm letting go of space time entirely.
3915840	3920560	And I feel like Tom is still saying, let me use the tools of quantum theory and the most
3920560	3925520	advanced physics we have of, of space time to get my model of consciousness. I'm saying,
3927040	3930400	we really have to jump outside of the headset altogether.
3930960	3936320	Yes. No, I agree with you because I found that question quite redundant in the sense that
3936320	3940560	there are clear differences in the way you guys approach it. I think where you guys do start to
3940560	3944000	sort of become similar is when it starts becoming a virtual reality and when,
3944560	3947920	and when you start talking about that. But then I have another question from someone,
3947920	3950240	and this question is directed at both of us, actually,
3951360	3956480	for critique for the two of us. It says, in our last conversation on conscious agents and
3956480	3965520	the subatomic world, Tev, you and Don, do not define information. And this, so the person's
3965520	3970480	basically, it's a very lengthy comment goes on to say that we didn't clearly define the term
3970480	3976400	information. And since your, the work eventually goes so much into a sort of a virtual reality,
3976400	3982400	a sort of matrix simulation, information becomes a key word here. Do we, should we clarify that for
3982400	3992000	this listener just to make sure they understand? Right. I used Shannon information. So people
3992000	3999280	who've studied information theory, if I have, it's all about probabilities and basically,
3999280	4005120	if something has probability P, then it's minus log P is so Shannon information. Now,
4005760	4011200	I've been, when I use entropy, I'm using the standard, you know, Shannon notion of entropy
4011200	4014960	from information theory. So, so this is, I'm just using standard and
4017840	4020480	standard information theoretic stuff. I've explored
4020800	4030240	solace entropy. So there's, there are generalizations of Shannon entropy and some arguments for this.
4030240	4036480	So I've been exploring them, but I haven't used them yet. And if I'm forced to, I may, there are
4036480	4042320	arguments for, for showing that, that the notion of entropy that's used in Shannon information
4042320	4048560	theory may not be as general as we need in certain cases. And there are more, and one is called solace
4048560	4055040	entropy, I think. So, so I am playing with that. But in my conversations with you, when I've said
4055040	4063440	entropy or, or, or information, it's Shannon. Okay, good. The next one is, if we're just avatars
4064480	4072160	within this virtual reality, what is the concept of procreation? What, what purpose does this
4072160	4077200	serve in the creation of other avatars? And does this even work inside of space time?
4079520	4089440	Right. So, what's, what's interesting is that from this point of view, our headset gives us
4089440	4094560	certain portals into the deep consciousness beyond. That's what the headset is for, too. So right now,
4095280	4103120	my Tevin icon in my headset is giving me a portal into Tevin's consciousness or that, that, that
4103120	4106800	projection of the one consciousness, the Tevin projection of the, of the one consciousness.
4107760	4114160	So we know that our headset does give us portals into consciousness. And the question is, what
4114160	4120880	technologies might there be that we could use to create new portals into consciousness? Right.
4120880	4126240	Well, we have one technology that we know, and that is having babies. That is, that's one technology
4126240	4135360	for opening up new portals into consciousness. So, so why would from, so there are a couple of
4135360	4141520	questions related to this. So why would the one consciousness use this procreation kind of approach
4141520	4150560	toward, toward, toward, you know, doing this? And I would say that it's, first I should say, I don't
4150560	4156720	know, but, but I'll give you some ideas. Right. Humility is, is, is required at every step of
4156720	4160320	this, right? I mean, until we have a scientific theory where we're making predictions, you know,
4161280	4167120	disclaimers, but at some point, I think we'll, we'll be able to reverse engineer the headset and
4167120	4172160	understand this notion of portal that I'm talking about quite precisely. We'll understand a little
4172160	4177840	bit more how procreation works in terms of booting up new, new, new portals. And we'll be able to
4177840	4182080	build artificial portals. We'll, we'll get the technology to build artificial portals to the
4182080	4185920	consciousness behind. We'll, we'll actually understand what kind of networking of conscious
4186000	4191520	agents is required to effectively bridge into our interface and toward, into our common headset.
4192320	4197360	So, but, but at the top level, why is the one doing this? It goes back to what we talked about
4197360	4202320	before, which is the one is trying to, to know itself and it can only know itself by knowing
4202320	4208960	what it's not. So to keep having experiences and having an opening this up to a sort of
4208960	4214800	multiplex of different experiences overall, which goes into the other question that I have here,
4214800	4221920	which is, did in this framework then, where dinosaurs and all sort of extinct species and
4221920	4227040	creatures fall into this sort of process, have these all been avatars as part of an experience
4227760	4233680	of the one? Exactly. They would be, and you might say, well, why did the, you know, the one do that
4233680	4239520	and then throw them away? And, you know, what a waste of time. And that gets the whole notion of
4239520	4248240	time itself is an artifact of our interface. So in our, so, so a lot of our intuitions are tied to
4250080	4257040	artifacts of our headset. So in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents, the dynamics
4258160	4265200	need not have increasing entropy. There need not be an arrow of time in the dynamics outside of
4265280	4272000	our headset. But it's a theorem that if you take this Markovian dynamics in which the entropy is
4272000	4277120	constant, it doesn't increase. And you make a projection by conditional probability. So you're
4277120	4282000	losing some information, you see the dynamics, you see a dynamical system, but it's lost some
4282000	4289680	information over the deeper dynamics. The projected dynamical system will have increasing entropy.
4289680	4296080	And so it will have an arrow of time as not as an insight into reality. It's not an insight.
4296080	4303680	It's entirely an artifact of the loss of information. And so, by the way,
4306880	4312960	time is the fundamental limited resource in evolution. If I don't get food in time, I die.
4312960	4318320	If I don't mate in time, I die. If I don't run away from that dinosaur in time, I'll be eaten.
4318720	4324240	So time is the fundamental limited resource. And what I'm saying is that time is an illusion.
4325680	4333840	It's an artifact of the headset. So on the one hand, I've published papers on
4333840	4340720	evolutionary game theory. I love the theory of evolution. It's an incredibly powerful theory.
4340720	4346400	Evolutionary game theory is beautiful. And inside the headset, there is no better theory
4346400	4350080	of biological organisms than evolution by natural selection. It's brilliant.
4352000	4360160	That's being said. The theory itself, all of it, is an artifact of the projection.
4360160	4367040	None of it is deeply true. It's only true in our headset. And for understanding dynamics in our
4367040	4370960	headset, there is no better scientific tool than evolution by natural selection. And I've used it.
4371680	4379040	But our mathematics tells us that the whole thing is an illusion. So I should maybe stop there.
4380160	4385120	There was a question some people asked me, which is I use evolution to show that we don't see
4385120	4389120	reality as it is. But then that means that evolution wasn't true. So how am I not shooting
4389120	4393680	myself on the foot? So if we have time at the end, we can go after why I'm not shooting myself on
4394640	4400880	the foot. So within this headset and having this headset on, can I take it off?
4404560	4416800	I think yes. I think in the meditation process, when you literally, and myself included,
4416800	4425520	are not great meditators, but I do hear about people that I trust,
4426320	4433840	that go to places where you let go of the headset for a while. You just literally let go of death,
4434880	4443760	the near death experiences that people report, the Raymond Moody, I guess, and the tunnel,
4443760	4449840	the light tunnel, and life review, and that common thing. I'm not saying that that's right,
4449840	4456960	but it's suggestive that, and it certainly fits in with the ontology of this conscious
4456960	4464720	agent dynamics that I'm working on, that in some sense, everything that I perceive is just a headset,
4464720	4472560	and death is just taking the headset off. That's all it is. I tried that. But if you're playing
4472560	4480080	a virtual reality game, and you believe, and you've got an avatar in the game, so it's a first-person
4481360	4485840	perspective. If you identify with that avatar, if you really believe that that avatar is you,
4485840	4489040	you're going to be nervous and scared and everything that happens to the avatar is going
4489040	4495840	to be. But if you don't identify with the avatar, you can enjoy the game. And if your avatar gets
4495840	4502560	shot up, who cares? You just take the headset off. And so I think that it is possible, maybe in
4502560	4507840	meditation, the Hoffman hasn't done it. So I'll just tell you upfront, I've not gone there.
4509040	4514000	I've meditated quite a bit. So maybe I'm just a spiritual flunking, who knows.
4515520	4517920	Science flunking and spiritual flunking.
4518800	4527120	But the people that I trust seem to have had those experiences. And in my own theory,
4527120	4530320	it says it's possible even though I myself haven't experienced it.
4530320	4536960	So let's say within those kernels from the physics, from your mathematical side,
4536960	4541840	let's say you leave the headset. Would you have to first go via each pathway in order to get
4541920	4548000	to sort of the one? Or would you see someone else between them? I'm not sure if you understand
4548000	4552480	what I'm trying to say. A really great question. And I've really wondered about that myself,
4552480	4559600	because there are some spiritual traditions which talk about, I mean, I was some Tutu warrior in
4559600	4565040	my previous life or something like that. And so I've wondered if there's any way that I could
4565040	4570480	make sense of that in my framework of conscious agents. Is there some kind of, if I take the
4570480	4576000	network idea seriously, are there parts of the network that I could say that are sort of closer
4576000	4582960	to this particular headset, the Hoffman headset? Maybe there are other headsets that are closer
4582960	4590640	to that headset. And it may be possible that they're, and even though ultimately time is an
4590640	4597520	illusion, it could be like, we might be able to explain that illusion in terms of projections
4597520	4604400	of these headsets and so forth. So I can't rule out the possibility that our theory will eventually
4605760	4614560	take these non-precise ideas and make them mathematically precise and maybe even interesting.
4614560	4621920	So I can't rule that out. That's very fascinating. That can be quite a rabbit hole to go down through.
4622480	4628960	Do you think that, well, another thing that could lead to sort of reincarnative experiences in
4628960	4633440	general? I mean, let's say you just sort of leave that headset and maybe just enter another one
4633440	4639360	altogether. I mean, it opens up the door to sort of all those spiritual claims that let's say
4639360	4645840	Hindus or Buddhists sort of have. It kind of provides a scientific grounding for these beliefs in a sense.
4646800	4653040	That's right. It's basically, what I was saying earlier is what you're saying is basically
4654880	4663680	the one looks through the headset of an amoeba and of a virus and of a bacterium and of a Hoffman
4663680	4670480	and a Tevin and every possible headset, a cat, they're all legitimate ways of the one looking at
4670480	4676480	itself and enjoying that view and then recognizing I'm not that. I'm more than that.
4677680	4681760	And Don, how would you differentiate between something that's an avatar and something that
4681760	4687120	isn't? So like a virus, for example, we're not a lot of doctors kind of in the world. People
4687120	4694240	can't even agree whether it's life, living or dead. At what point is an avatar an avatar in this
4694240	4699440	framework, would you say? What is the minimal amount needed to be an avatar?
4700640	4705040	That's a great question because it really exposes an important concept here. And that is,
4706320	4711440	in this framework, the distinction between living and non-living is not principal.
4714080	4717760	Just as the distinction between conscious and not conscious is not a principal distinction.
4718640	4722960	The distinction that we make between living and non-living is an artifact,
4723840	4726320	entirely an artifact of the limits of our interface.
4728320	4733840	Okay. It's not principal. So I'm always interacting with living consciousness.
4734560	4741360	I'm always interacting with it. And my headset is dumbing things down because I'm not,
4742000	4745040	that's what I'm doing. I'm looking at myself to a projection. So when I see a rock,
4746240	4751680	it's fair enough within my headset to say it's not alive. It's perfectly fine. For everyday
4751680	4754720	practical purpose, I'm not going to try to eat the rock and so forth. I'm not going to worry about
4754720	4760880	the rock chasing me. And so for practical purposes, I can say it's not alive. But the
4760880	4765440	distinction is not principled. I'm always interacting, when I interact with a rock,
4765440	4772400	I'm interacting through a headset interface icon, namely the rock. I'm interacting with consciousness.
4773680	4777920	I'm not saying the rock is conscious. So there's not panpsychism of that kind. The rock is not
4777920	4782480	conscious. The rock, like the zoom pixels, right? The zoom pixels are just zoom pixels. They're
4782480	4788160	not conscious or unconscious. They're just zoom pixels. The rock is just a rock. What am I interacting
4788160	4799280	with a living consciousness? Always. So now my interface can give me more or less information
4799280	4806400	about someone else's interface with other humans. Yes. I know firsthand what a human interface is
4806400	4813200	like. So I have some idea of what it's like to be you. And then you as a doctor, if you're
4813200	4817920	dealing with patients with psychological problems, you have some insight. Whereas if you're dealing
4817920	4823520	with a mouse, you might not trust your insights from the human experience in terms of understanding
4823520	4827200	the psychology of a mouse, right? You just don't have the insight into their headset
4827200	4833120	that you have into the human headset. Well, so when I see something that I call a virus,
4833200	4843280	I have some hint in my interface of something that's like alive. But my interface is giving me
4843280	4850960	almost no information about another interface. So interfaces have information about other
4850960	4858400	interfaces that are more or less complete. And so with the rock, my knowledge of interfaces
4858400	4863680	is basically gone to zero. Okay, yes. So that's just beyond that interfaces
4865280	4871680	access at that point. That's exactly right. That's also mine. But by the way, things that
4871680	4875200	look really stupid to us, like I see some worm crawling around, it looks like it was really
4875200	4881920	stupid. Hey, for all I know, what I'm interacting with there, if I could actually if I could get
4881920	4887280	inside and understand what it was experiencing, what it might, it might, I might just want to
4887360	4892000	fall down on my knees and worship it because it's so much smarter than me and brilliant than me.
4893280	4900080	Again, what I can see about others is just due to the limitations of my own headset.
4900080	4904800	And there what they are in themselves and what they're experiencing could possibly
4904800	4911360	blow me away by if I ever. So you can see this this this point of view leads to all sorts of
4911360	4918720	radical that took me decades to even understand what what it could mean because I'm so used
4918720	4926160	to thinking inside the headset. And it's very, very mind bending. It's, it's almost like sort of
4926160	4933440	taking the blooper at some point. And like leaving reality altogether, because there's
4933440	4939040	someone as people to people who firmly love science so ingrained within it. And if someone
4939040	4943040	just has to pop in right now and just shadow and watch us, I mean, they'll think we're completely
4943040	4950640	out of it. It's completely out there. And all we'll be on all you can think is that you just
4950640	4957920	haven't taken the blue pill yet. That's right. But what's led me down this this blue pill path
4958480	4963200	is the mathematics and the science. I've been lead kicking and screaming the whole way.
4963920	4970000	I mean, but and so I understand when when anybody has an objection, I completely understand I had
4970000	4975040	that objection. And the only reason I'm saying what I'm saying is that I had to go with the science.
4976720	4981920	It's just plain the fact that our best science tells us this space time isn't fundamental.
4981920	4986800	And when you wrap your head around that space time and objects in space time are not fundamental.
4987680	4992080	That's what our best science when you that is the start of the rabbit hole and that's not
4992080	4997600	an LSD induced rabbit hole. That is a scientific based rabbit hole. And I've been chasing the
4997600	5001920	mathematics and going wherever. And that's what you have to do as a scientist, you have to be
5001920	5009040	intrepid and be willing to let go of Flat Earth, be willing to let go of Newton, be willing to
5009040	5013040	let go of Einstein, we'd be willing to let go of quantum mechanics and be willing to let go of
5013040	5020480	space time. You've got to be willing to let go of all of it and go into it. Yeah. At what point
5020480	5025520	you mentioned that the the one, I mean, you spoke about this earlier. And I think we should
5025520	5029040	have at some point get round back to that and just touch on it more because it seems like quite
5029760	5034320	some fun work that's happening at this very moment. But you mentioned that at that point,
5034320	5040720	you and Bernardo just diverge a little. What at which point exactly does it happen? Why is it
5040720	5047840	that your version of the one in this trace chain is something that would make you two guys clash
5047840	5050720	in your views? Well,
5053120	5057680	I'm not sure that we would clash too much, but I'll say where we might have some
5058720	5063520	differences. And again, you know, Bernardo's brilliant and a good friend. And if there's
5063520	5067760	something where we differ philosophically, I defer to him because he's a real philosopher,
5067760	5076880	I'm not so right. But Bernardo has recently been saying that there is a way of interpreting
5076960	5082000	integrated information theory that would be compatible with analytic idealism.
5089760	5094720	And I'll look forward to having a conversation with Bernardo about this because, you know,
5095280	5100560	he's brilliant. And so I'll probably stand corrected with what I'm about to say. But it
5100560	5103200	seems to me that that integrated information theory
5105840	5109680	does assume that there's a substrate and they're very explicit. I mean, one of their
5110160	5116320	in the four their IIT 4.0 paper. I mean, I looked and substrate is mentioned dozens and dozens of
5116320	5121200	times and not just, you know, it's not a minor thing. Substrate is is front and center.
5123040	5127920	Now, if I gave you a theory of space time, and I said, but there's a substrate
5128880	5135680	to say space time, then then I would assume from that that you're saying that space time
5135680	5142080	isn't fundamental because there's a substrate to it. Right. So if I if space time is fundamental,
5142080	5145360	then I'll just talk about space time. I don't need to talk about anything deeper than that,
5145360	5148960	no substrate to it. So if I'm talking about a theory of consciousness,
5149920	5153600	and I want to say consciousness is fundamental, well, then I don't need to really be talking
5153600	5159760	about any substrates. I mean, consciousness is the final substrate in that theory. So so this
5159760	5164640	is what I would like to talk with Bernardo about. And I'm sure I'm sure he'll have some something
5164640	5170640	that will, you know, make me think deep. But so I'm so so with all, you know, he's a good friend
5170640	5174240	and he's brilliant. So I'll be interested to do it. But my attitude right now is
5175200	5184160	a theory of consciousness that's scientific and in the spirit of analytic idealism
5185360	5188800	doesn't need any substrate for the consciousness. You just posit
5190480	5196880	the nature of that consciousness and know you don't posit any substrate. And you don't need to posit
5197600	5204400	some combinatorial properties of that substrate, like integrated information,
5205600	5212080	causal properties of that substrate that quantify how much consciousness there is.
5213280	5219920	Consciousness is consciousness. You don't quantify this. You can quantify how much
5219920	5224000	access you might have to the consciousness through a particular headset. But consciousness
5224000	5230960	itself is just consciousness. It is fundamental. And so so to so in IIT, there's always this thing
5230960	5236160	we talked about earlier that these circuits, there is no consciousness in them and these
5236160	5240080	brain circuits and these circuits, maybe they do have consciousness. The whole thing
5241360	5246880	of assigning consciousness to substrates, neural substrates in this case, is wrong headed.
5247440	5253840	It is just completely wrong. So so that's where again, I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot when
5253840	5258240	I talk with Bernardo about this. I really just learned about his views in the last couple,
5258240	5262400	three, last month or so on this. So that's why I've had a chance to really talk with him.
5263760	5266720	It also called me by storm because I'm scheduled to chat to him, I think,
5267360	5275520	in a month's time. And we spoke about a few months ago. And when we spoke, I had no idea that he
5275520	5282240	would, that I also had no clue that he would go down there either. It was quite strange to me as
5282240	5287040	well. And I'm curious and I'm keen to ask him as well. Yeah, I'm going to ask, I'll ask him as
5287040	5291440	well. And I'm sure he'll have something really good to say. And I'll try to push back on this.
5291440	5296240	You don't need a substrate and see what it says. I'll try the same. And I'll also let him, if I
5296240	5303120	speak to him first, I'll let him know without causing any sort of debate. But Bernardo loves
5303120	5308800	to debate, by the way, he prefers when when someone actively debates in a respectful manner, though.
5309280	5314800	As long as it's respectful, he loves, he loves the debate. He enjoys it. He actually told me
5314800	5319680	the last time, please actually be more, more stern and strict with the questions.
5320800	5326640	But well, I like sharp discussion in the sense that it's intellectually on point and deep.
5327680	5332000	Having it be personal, I don't, I'm not interested in having it be personal at all.
5332000	5335680	Me neither. I told him that I'm just trying to just be nice and relaxed for the podcast.
5336400	5338560	I just try and make it a nice calm environment.
5340240	5346000	But I'm Bernardo, I'll just say that he's brilliant mathematically. And I've asked him to
5346000	5350320	join us and work on the mathematical side of this. And I want to do that. I would love to get
5350320	5353760	Bernardo because he's got the mathematical chops to actually work with us on the third
5353760	5358640	conscious agents and show analytical idealism through the through the math of conscious agents.
5358640	5363920	But I mean, yeah, I mean, to get a PhD in engineering and philosophy, you must,
5364480	5368960	know your stuff. There must be something going on there that you're able to kind of bring these
5368960	5373200	two fields together and give you and give people quite a unique perspective, at least
5374400	5380400	on reality. Yeah, I think he's very busy with the essential foundation. So I see them doing
5380400	5385920	quite a lot of work lately. So probably just like you, probably a lot of on your plates
5386560	5392400	done in this virtual reality, in this reality, is there anything you want to call it, by the way?
5393360	5397600	Do you prefer calling it the virtual reality? What do you prefer calling it?
5398240	5404800	I think headset is the easiest for most people. So it's just a headset. I say that because
5404800	5410800	it's everybody can sort of relate to that. Okay, within this headset, how does this headset account
5410800	5416240	for, I mean, we know time now based on this is an illusion. But then how do we count for the
5416240	5422720	beginning, let's say, let's say the big bang within this headset. How is that conceptualized
5422720	5428800	within this framework? Well, so the time itself of the big bang is an illusion.
5429440	5433360	So what we have is a Markov dynamics in which the entropy is not increasing.
5435760	5441760	Then we say, so we have this big Markov chain, there is no time. But now let's look at it from
5441760	5446880	a perspective. Let's do a trace chain. So I talked about, we started off talking about,
5446880	5450320	so let's take a big chain. Let's do a trace chain. Well, we've lost information.
5450960	5457680	Well, so now we're going to induce an arrow of time. And it's going to look,
5458480	5461200	depending on which trace chain you use, it might look like the big bang, and then
5462080	5468480	lifeless evolution of galaxies and stars and so forth, and then life and then consciousness
5468800	5474720	might look like that. But that's the entire story is an artifact of the projection and
5474720	5482000	is not a deep insight. It's fascinating because me trying to ask you what happened
5482000	5488160	before the big bang is kind of like me asking you what happened before the one.
5490640	5494160	Is that something you're even thinking about at any point?
5494960	5501520	Well, absolutely. And by the way, I should say that what I was, the answer I just gave about
5501520	5508480	the projection and big bang just being an artifact, I actually want to actually do that.
5508480	5513600	I want to actually write down a big Markovian kernel in which the entropy is not increasing.
5514480	5520000	Choose a projection and then show, wow, when I look at it through this projection,
5520000	5525520	look at that. I do get this weird thing seem to be evolving and growing. In other words,
5525520	5532400	this is not a hand wave. I am proposing computational model. There is a Markov dynamics
5532960	5538320	beyond space time in which the entropy is not increasing. Take any projection of it
5539040	5542880	where by conditional probability, you know, like trace chains or something like that,
5543760	5550640	the entropy will be increasing. Study those. Study all the different ways that that can happen.
5550640	5554320	Our universe with the big bang will just be one of the possible kinds of ways in the universe.
5554320	5560320	So in other words, we can study cosmology from this point of view. We understand, you know,
5560320	5566720	right now, if you take space time as fundamental, then the notion of the big bang and the singularity
5567040	5574560	is an unsolvable problem. What do you do with it? But if you realize, no, no, that's just a
5574560	5580240	headset projection of a deeper thing in which there is no singularity. I've erased the singularity.
5580240	5585520	That's what this mathematics is. I've erased the singularity and showed you, you get the singularity
5585520	5590640	because of a projection, not because of the deeper, the truth of the deeper reality. So this is not,
5590640	5595040	so I don't want people to think. It might have sounded like it was just a hand wave. No, I'm
5595040	5602720	offering a technical computational program. Exactly. I mean, that's, I mean, that's the
5603360	5610560	biggest difference between a lot of other idealist theorists is that you're using computational,
5610560	5615360	I mean, you're using mathematics and physics, you know, in a very precise manner to try and
5615360	5619280	show people what you're talking about. I mean, conscious agents in the subatomic world,
5619360	5625200	you came with that very strategic knowing that this is the core layer of reality,
5625200	5628800	according to us and the way we perceive it. And that's why you guys want to touch that
5628800	5633120	base reality. And you said you don't want to go straight for the neuron because that
5634080	5637200	that is a bit, it's a lot harder. There's a lot, there's probably a lot more
5637200	5641360	that's going to have to go into that. Do you have a sort of a hierarchy of what you
5641360	5646720	think you want to go after from the subatomic world? I mean, we just mentioned going into
5646720	5651440	cosmology at some point, anything in particular that you're kind of taking these maths into at
5651440	5662880	some point, or spearheading into the future? Yes, right now, what I'm working on is a specific
5663600	5669440	technical problem, which is we've mapped a Markov dynamics into decorated permutations.
5670400	5678240	Physicists have mapped decorated permutations of positive gross monions into scattering amplitudes.
5678240	5685200	So I want to tie that whole thing together. So what I'm working on right now is interfacing
5685200	5689840	our decorated permutations with the decorated permutations and the gross monions of the
5689840	5696400	physicists. I've got to get that map absolutely precise. So and I've been working on that and I
5697040	5703120	gave two proposals to my colleagues in the last three weeks, and they're both wrong,
5703120	5707600	but they're both a piece of the puzzle. But I put them out, I thought, no, no, it's wrong.
5709680	5713920	So I'm realizing I have to dig deeper. I'm going to have to really study these positive
5713920	5719360	gross monions more deeply and write down a more serious. So that's what I'm working on right
5719360	5727520	now is because I then want to be able to, once we have that, then we can do our computational
5731360	5737440	experiment about quarks and gluons. We have to show how we can go all the way from the dynamics
5737440	5742240	of conscious agents through the decorated permutations to scattering amplitudes and properties
5742240	5748480	of particles. So that's why I'm focused on this technical issue right now. Markov decorated
5748480	5755920	permutations mapping to gross monion decorated permutations. Clean technical problem. And I'm
5755920	5759920	working on it. And I'm not a mathematician, so I'm having to learn about positive gross monions,
5759920	5765280	and I'm just learning as I go. But but I'm motivated. So that's what I'm going after now.
5765280	5771840	But then my guess is I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and I would love to be going after the brain,
5771840	5776560	but the brain is, I don't know, 10 to the 50th or 10 to the 60th quarks and gluons,
5776560	5780000	whatever. Maybe I should start with two or three quarks and gluons,
5781360	5787840	you know, and work there and then and then work up to, you know, protons and protons,
5787840	5793680	electrons or so, do the nucleus and atom and then maybe some simple molecules.
5795600	5801840	Then maybe by the time we get to molecules, maybe we'll know enough to actually know, for example,
5801920	5807840	about neurotransmitters. What does a neurotransmitter mean in terms of the
5807840	5813120	dynamics of conscious agents? But ultimately, we'll have to get then to, you know,
5814160	5818240	axons and neurons and synapses and
5820480	5826480	and you can see we have a we have to reverse. So the problem is we have to reverse engineer
5826480	5833760	a headset. So neuroscience is far harder than we thought. We thought that we look inside
5833760	5838560	through microscopes and we see billions of neurons and trillions of synapses.
5839840	5843760	And that's really complicated. And we think that that's the truth. No, no, no, that's a thin
5843760	5850640	veneer on the complex, the true complexity is far, far greater. Let me give you just a taste
5850640	5859440	of the complexity. If I have a conscious agent that has just 10 color experiences,
5863680	5866880	I'll say 50 color experiences, 50 color experiences.
5869280	5873680	You can actually, you can perceive six million or seven million different color,
5873680	5877520	you can discriminate six or seven million. So this is trivial. 50 colors is nothing
5877520	5883840	compared to what you can do. In our theory of conscious agents, the set of
5885360	5891280	possible Markov chains for consciousness is dealing with just 50 colors is the Markov polytope
5891280	5896160	on 50 states. Okay, so it's called a Markov polytope in 50 states. And this is a polytope,
5896160	5901440	it's a geometric object that we have to study to understand all the dynamics of consciousness.
5901440	5904480	And it has little vertices on it, like a diamond, it's got little points on it, right?
5905440	5911760	It's got facets and edges and points. You know how many points this, with only 50 colors,
5912640	5920000	you know how many points this geometric object has? It has 10,000 times more points than the
5920000	5927440	number of particles in the known visible universe. That's incredible. That's only for 50. So I'm
5927440	5933440	going to need a bigger computer to simulate this stuff. So consciousness, so we thought that the
5933520	5940880	brain was complicated. It's trivial compared to when we when we let go of the head to see the
5940880	5946560	headset was there to really dumb things down. And it succeeded. It really dumb things down. We
5946560	5953600	thought we were seeing truth that in all of its glory. We got the really dumb down cheap version.
5953600	5956960	As soon as we start little steps outside of our little space time headset,
5957920	5963440	holy smoke, the thing just blows wide open. Consciousness is unbelievably complicated.
5963440	5968640	And I'm going to need a new desktop computer. And I think the worst part about it is that
5969520	5974400	even as you go on, because I mean, the irony is that you'll probably need quantum computers to
5974400	5982160	try and help you prove that you can go beyond quantum, which is funny. But I think that makes
5982160	5986400	it even worse is that you have people like Mike Levin, who are even showing you that you don't
5986400	5991840	have to even go to a neuron to show people what intelligence or a possible mind even is in that
5991840	5998400	sense. I mean, he's blurring the lines completely with his work. His bioelectric fields are truly
5998400	6005280	stunning. It's amazing. His work is so brilliant. I've enjoyed talking with him. I have a couple
6005280	6010480	podcasts with Mike. And now you you're lifting this position where these bioelectric networks
6010480	6016960	also have to sort of some at some point be explained now. Absolutely. And he's leaving
6016960	6023520	you with much harder tasks, I would say. That one sounds like a little very fun task to understand
6023520	6030320	the bioelectric fields and how they would arise as an interface projection of dynamics of conscious
6030320	6037040	agent networks, right? So, so absolutely, this is, it's going to be fun to reverse engineer
6037040	6040960	our heads, our space time headset and why electric fields will be part of it, neurons will be part
6040960	6051520	of it, DNA, all all of that. So, all in some sense, science is just now taking off the headset. In
6051520	6058880	some sense, we're just now beginning the real task of science. Right now, we just polished the tools
6058880	6063040	on our little headset. We thought we were seeing the truth. No, we were just sharpening our tools.
6063040	6066560	Now it's time to take the headset off and really get to work on what's beyond.
6066640	6072880	It's pretty exciting. Yeah, it's almost like a post realism. It's a, there's going to be some
6072880	6078000	term for it. Post realism, there's going to be something where people are now moving beyond
6078000	6082880	this headset, if they're going to try and figure out reality in this way. Something, sorry.
6082880	6088080	Or maybe it'll be pro realism in the sense that we thought that the headset is not the real thing.
6088080	6092640	That's just a that's just a headset. Now we're getting into the realism. But but but even but see,
6093360	6100080	but our discussion on the limits of scientific theories means that even though I'm saying we're
6100080	6105520	going outside the headset and science is really just beginning, still, scientific theories will
6105520	6110560	never be a theory of everything. Humility is going to be required at every step because yeah,
6110560	6114480	we're stepping outside the headset. But effectively, we've just moved to a bigger
6116400	6121680	projection of the one. All we can never deal with are bigger and bigger projections of the one.
6122640	6128000	And no matter how big our projections are, they will be literally measure zero of the one.
6129200	6133120	So it is required. I'm glad you brought I'm glad you brought it back to that because I wanted
6133120	6136560	to ask you, I mean, you started off by talking about the stress chain, figuring out the one and
6137440	6144880	this new information. If you can just try and sort of conceptualize this, what you think this is
6144880	6151440	the one, what what type of is there any way for you to wrap your head around this? Do you think you
6151440	6161440	can? In a way, I think we all can in the in the following sense, if it's true that you are the one
6162640	6170640	experience itself through a headset. And the reason that you don't feel that is because
6171920	6177120	you're in with both feet on the headset, you really believe that you are the avatar in the headset.
6177120	6181840	And that's part of the whole game. I mean, the part of the whole game is to completely for the
6181840	6188320	one to completely lose itself in the headset and to slowly wake up. If I don't really believe it
6188320	6192800	for a while, it's not going to be real for me to say I'm not that because I never really took
6192800	6200160	it seriously. So I need to take it seriously and then let go. So I think it is possible
6200560	6209360	even while we're still having these avatars in the headset through meditation to let go.
6210640	6218480	But to the mind, so this is now where it starts to sort of go with what spiritual traditions
6218480	6225360	some have said, and that is that the truth can't be understood by the mind. So no words are
6225440	6231520	adequate. No scientific theory is adequate. But you have another access to that realm.
6231520	6238560	That's not a conceptual access. It's direct. You are that infinite intelligence. That's what you are.
6239280	6249920	And any concept that you have of yourself is only a projection necessarily. So the only way
6250000	6257520	to answer your question is to, of course, I do my science, but to answer your question,
6257520	6262800	to really go deep, I have to let go of all of my concepts, including all of my scientific theories
6263680	6273920	completely. No thoughts at all. So literally a space of no thoughts, no conceptions,
6274480	6281760	and just aware of aware, awareness of awareness. And then I think that's where you then
6281760	6287600	begin to know yourself, not as you know an external object, but you know yourself directly.
6288160	6293520	And my guess is that that goes infinitely deep. In other words, if you do that for five minutes,
6295360	6302640	you experienced that for five minutes, you've not scratched the surface yet. Try it for 500 years,
6302640	6310560	you've not scratched the surface yet. That's how deep you go. So that, so somehow the deep answer
6310560	6316160	to your question is on the one hand, we know the one by looking at this projection and doing all of
6316160	6322400	our science. And we know the one by doing that really, really carefully and then saying, I transcend
6322400	6329120	it. I'm not that I'm that is a lower limit on my capabilities. And I that's not that's not the
6329120	6336320	limit of who I am. Then we could go beyond that by letting go of all thoughts and just being the
6336320	6342960	awareness of awareness. And that goes infinitely deep. And so you can know it directly. But the
6342960	6349440	mind will say, because there's no concepts for the mind to deal with. So the intellectual mind
6349440	6357600	will say that's there's nothing there. But frankly, my own experience is that if I want new ideas
6358240	6363520	to do my science, I need to go into the space where I let go of all concepts, I need to actually tap
6363520	6369120	into that infinite intelligence and just be in absolute interior science. That's where all the
6369120	6375040	good ideas come from. Then you bring them back in. So so the mind really isn't I mean, it has this
6375040	6380560	all little limited intelligence and you can do you can do mathematical computations and so forth.
6380560	6387760	But if you want deep insights, you got to let go of the mind. Yeah, so we so we are one infinite
6387760	6394000	intelligence. Yes. Well, when sorry, then I'm not sure if I haven't really picked up on you
6394000	6397120	saying this much. But when did you start calling it the one?
6397520	6407760	I was into Federico Fajin. So Federico is a good friend and
6410880	6416640	really, he's a wonderful man. And he helped support this research for and he talked about
6416640	6422160	the one he didn't give a mathematical model of the one. And of course, you can't. But he talked
6422160	6428800	about the one and and I you know, at first, I didn't use the term, but then I realized that
6431040	6435280	my mathematics was pointing me toward the idea that there was going to be not just a network
6435280	6439680	of separate consciousnesses, but I was going to have to recognize that, you know, they can combine
6439680	6447120	and ultimately, there's there's some notion of one. And so I decided that that was sort of the
6447120	6455200	least tendentious word that I could use. And but I don't think right now that I have a mathematical
6455200	6459520	model of the one, I have a mathematical model of projection of the one in terms of conscious
6459520	6467280	agent networks. So so that's why I started using the term the one and maybe the last few years
6467280	6472240	after they are sort of filtered in when I started thinking more and more about the deeper
6472880	6480480	structure of this network of conscious agents. So do you think the there is so the ultimate purpose
6480480	6488240	at this point, then is the one the one sort of experiencing while having multiple experiences
6488240	6495680	via us, the avatars in this infinite sort of some essence beyond space time.
6496480	6502640	That's right. Enjoying those experiences and then learning what it is by by learning that
6502640	6507840	no matter how exotic and impressive those experiences are, they're trivial compared to
6507840	6514720	what the one is. Yeah. And then do you think done with that in mind, if you take certain
6515280	6519920	other theories that are physicalist like the malt walnut, they go a bit beyond that when they
6519920	6528000	think about a multiverse, what would a multiverse in this context to be the others? And maybe there's
6528000	6534400	one in this universe, and then there are others, you know, sort of other universes. Do you think?
6534400	6541360	Well, good. So there is, of course, a technical meaning of multiverse, you know,
6542000	6549280	that some physicists have, and also many worlds, there's different kind of technical thing there.
6549360	6557760	But one, just at a top level, one could say the idea that I have a multiple headsets could be
6557760	6565280	sort of like multiple universes, multiple multiverse kind of thing, possibly. But
6567040	6571360	when you get real technical about it, I mean, like Max Tagmark has, you know, his level four
6571360	6578880	multiverse, which he, so it's different now from what I just said, right? Because I was saying we
6578880	6583120	could think informally about all these multiverses being just different headsets, and there's an
6583120	6588720	infinite variety of them. So that's top level connection to your idea. But getting down more
6588720	6593520	to brass tacks, like what real physicists are using multiverse for, like one concrete example
6593520	6599040	is Max Tagmark at MIT, his level four multiverse, he's saying that mathematics is fundamental
6599040	6605440	reality. Okay, so the fundamental nature of reality is entirely mathematical. And there's
6605440	6610240	an infinite variety of possible mathematics. And so there's an infinite variety of mathematical
6610240	6620640	universes. And so he, and I agree that there's mathematics is endless. It's infinite. But I
6620640	6626880	don't think that mathematics, you know, of course, I think Tagmark is brilliant. And, you know,
6627600	6634480	in this realm, I would probably be set straight by him. But anyway, here's my idea as it is,
6635360	6642640	that when it comes to the nature of reality consciousness, what is the relation between
6642640	6648880	mathematics and consciousness? My feeling is that mathematics isn't the whole thing.
6650400	6654800	That the consciousness, the living, put it this way, the living organism of consciousness
6655440	6659520	has mathematics is like the bones. But the bones are just the bones, they're not the whole
6659520	6664880	living organism. And they're, they're essential. Mathematics, I think is essential, but it's not
6664880	6674400	the whole of the living organism of consciousness. So that's sort of my feeling about how my views
6674400	6682400	fit with like multiverse kinds of it. It's fascinating to me how it's becoming so poetic
6682400	6687200	over time. I mean, the more you're obviously talking about this so much more lately, and you're
6687200	6692000	trying to get people to understand it, and it's, it's starting to slowly develop its own sort of
6692000	6700560	moral practical significance as you have to hold on it and apply it. Did you ever foresee yourself
6700560	6708800	becoming someone who will sound so spiritual, almost guru like in your life? No, I mean,
6708880	6714480	it's, it's sort of, I've been pushed kicking and screaming. I can tell it was kind of thing by,
6714480	6720320	by the mathematics. And, but on the other hand, you know, at some point, it's time to quit kicking
6720320	6726320	and screaming and just say, Hey, this is what the next step in, I mean, physics is telling us
6726320	6733280	the space time is over. And quantum theory is not fundamental. So get over it, move on. And so
6733280	6739600	physicalism is dead. Okay, get over it. You know, it's time to get over it. And now on the other
6739600	6745280	hand, you might say, am I jumping in full, you know, with both feet to spiritual traditions and
6745280	6751360	just buying what they say? Absolutely not. I'm having respectful conversations. So I listen
6751360	6758560	respectfully and carefully. And I treat what I hear from spiritual traditions the way I treat
6759440	6764240	what I hear from scientists, scientists, I listen respectfully with a big grain of salt
6765280	6772000	in science and in spirituality, that there is nonsense in both realms, and there is deep wisdom
6772000	6778320	in both realms. And it's up to us to take what looks good, turn it into so spiritual traditions,
6778320	6784560	I think have a lot of insights. And there's clearly not nonsense. I mean, they're famous for
6784560	6789520	wars that kill each other for for thousands of years. So so they have deep insights, and there's
6789520	6797040	deep dysfunction. And the issue is to understand which is which, and to, and maybe for example,
6797040	6801200	and maybe that many of the spiritual traditions traditions themselves are very deeply
6803040	6806880	onto something. But the practitioners don't understand, and they're the ones that are doing
6806880	6810880	the killing, right? It's not that it's not the philosophy or it's not the insights that the
6810880	6816320	gurus have had, it's the misuse of them by the followers that that's the problem. So we have
6816320	6822560	to be very, very careful. And don't dismiss the philosophy based because some some followers
6822560	6829760	start doing some nasty things. So so there's pitfalls everywhere. So so as a scientist, what I
6829760	6838960	want to do is to listen respectfully to the ideas, then look for mathematically precise statements
6839040	6844960	of the ideas, ones that look interesting, right? And then turn them into testable theories.
6846960	6854640	Ultimately, spiritual traditions tell us that their words are just pointers, right? Like the
6854640	6860160	Tao De Ching, the very first sentence in the Tao De Ching says, the Tao that can be spoken
6860800	6867200	is not the true Tao. Once you understand that, then you can go ahead and read the rest of it
6867200	6872400	because now you understand that everything that's said is not the truth. It's not to be taken
6872400	6879920	dogmatically. It's to be taken as a pointer for you to explore for yourself. So it's not about,
6879920	6885360	so you better say it exactly this way, or you go to hell. No, no, no, no, no, these are all pointers.
6885360	6891840	Take them in the spirit of pointers, you you have to explore for yourself. So so the spiritual
6891840	6898960	traditions have said that. But wouldn't it be nice to have pointers that tell you their own limits,
6898960	6906720	right? And that's what science gives you. Space time. It's mathematically precise. And you know
6906720	6911760	what? It falls apart at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. We can tell you where that pointer
6912800	6917680	falls apart. This is the antidote to dogmatism. So what I would love to see
6918480	6925120	is that the precision that we've gotten in science is brought over to spirituality so that we now
6925120	6931040	can have pointers in the spiritual traditions that are that are that are evolving. It's nothing
6931040	6935680	to boast about that I'm using the same pointers that they used 3000 years ago. I wouldn't brag
6935680	6941600	about that. I would say that's a problem. I mean, we would like to have this thing evolving and get
6941840	6948640	better pointers and pointers that in themselves tell you the limit, the scope of the pointer,
6948640	6953280	how it's going to be useful to you and the limit of the pointer so that we then fight over the
6953280	6958320	pointers and kill each other over the pointers. You don't believe my pointer. Well, you go to
6958320	6964720	hell or that kind of thing. I mean, this is this has been such a fascinating conversation because
6964720	6968960	I mean, it's different from the first two in the first one, we went into a lot of detail
6969040	6974160	all the theories second one, we went into a paper directly. As I said, I tried to make this one as
6974160	6982800	practical or almost a moral philosophy aspect of all of us. And I mean, you even you're brave enough
6982800	6986720	at this point clearly from all the work you've done to even mention the word the L word. I mean,
6986720	6991040	the love word in science people, you know how some scientists get when you say that.
6993440	6997840	Just talk to me about this bigger picture meaning and how people can take all this
6997840	7001040	information because now we've got two podcast episodes they can look at. They've got all the
7001040	7006240	others you mentioned as well. You speaking to Tom, you speaking to Bernardo, everything else.
7007120	7012720	How can they bring all of this information together and and fulfill this purpose of the one
7012720	7017680	or make it a more let's say a better process for all of us together?
7019440	7025200	Right. Well, I think that one way to think about what's happening with humanity is
7026080	7034400	part of humanity for thousands of years has said, this is just a headset, the spiritual part.
7034400	7038560	They said, you know, the space of time is not fundamental consciousness is fundamental,
7038560	7044320	but but but they've said that with only the tools of natural language.
7046000	7052000	They've not had mathematics. There's another group of people who have been saying, no, no,
7052160	7055760	the headsets, everything there is the physicalists, right? This is this is it.
7056320	7061600	And we're and but they develop these mathematical tools and careful experiments and
7062560	7068160	they gave us the technology. So we have one group, but then within the group that's developed
7068160	7074720	all this technology and and all the mathematical stuff. And all of a sudden, their own theories
7074720	7080480	came back just in the last couple of decades and slapped them in the face and said, wake up,
7080560	7084480	space time is just a headset. And it's a cheap headset. It falls apart at 10 to the
7084480	7091440	minus three centimeters. So so so now scientists, very few right now, but but some,
7091440	7096320	you know, I think more as we really understand the slap in the face that space time is doomed.
7096880	7099360	A lot of scientists are going to be waking up going, well, we need to.
7100720	7105360	Okay, we have to go outside of space time. It's this big group of people that are already out
7105360	7108880	there. They're saying, well, welcome, late comers. We've been here for a long time.
7110800	7115120	They've done a lot of exploring there, but they don't have the tools
7116320	7120800	that science has. So there are two groups that have half of the puzzle.
7122640	7126560	This one group has a big part of the puzzle. They've been doing meditation and they have
7126560	7132320	informal descriptions. This group is just coming late to the party, but they have incredible tools
7133280	7138480	and precision and experiments. Let's get the two together. And let's
7140160	7147760	spirituality and science are just two aspects of human exploration. It's all human exploration
7147760	7152480	and understanding who we are. They're not separate. We've assumed that they're separate.
7152480	7157040	There's been this division, especially since Galileo, you know, his house imprisonment
7157040	7164560	by the Catholic church, right? There has been this huge division. It's time for us to grow up
7165520	7170960	and bring the two halves together. It's going to be painful. Any marriage like this is going to
7170960	7178800	be painful because there's dogmas. I think the spiritual gurus don't have dogmas,
7178800	7185040	but the followers do. Many followers of spiritual traditions get tied up in the
7185040	7189120	pointer saying, that pointer is the truth. This pointer is the truth. No, no, it's just
7189120	7193120	the pointer to the moon is not the moon. The Buddhists will say it's just a pointer. It's not
7193120	7200720	the moon. But the many followers just don't get it. And that's just human nature. So it'll be
7201440	7205280	painful on both sides because scientists are going to have to let go of physicalism.
7206000	7213120	And for most scientists to let go of physicalism is to not be a scientist. But science is not
7213120	7219040	a particular theory, namely space time. It's not a theory. Science is a
7221840	7228960	method of careful experiments and careful theory building and testing and a cycle
7228960	7234160	of experiment and theory. That's what science is. Physicalism is one theory that was helpful
7234160	7239680	for several centuries and has outlived its usefulness. It's time to let go of that. And you
7239680	7245280	don't let go of science by letting go of physicalism. In fact, if you don't let go of physicalism,
7246160	7250960	then you do let go of science because you refuse to go where the science is telling
7250960	7259120	you to go. You've got to go beyond space time. So it's painful because something that we've
7259120	7265920	both sides have deeply believed will turn out to be deeply false. And other things
7266000	7271760	will turn out to be true. And we'll have to pick what are the true things or I wouldn't say true.
7271760	7278160	The next useful steps, ultimately the truth is just you without any concepts. That's just the
7278160	7284960	only truth I can talk to as you without any concepts about it. But in our efforts as human
7284960	7290960	beings to put together pointers on the spiritual side and on the science side, the two can work
7291840	7296720	together. And so that's to integrate what we've been talking about. I would say that that's the
7296720	7307360	top level picture. Let's have respectful but not credulous. So not stupid, but respectful
7307360	7312720	conversation and to find what are the good insights from both sides and what are the stupid
7312720	7318960	things from both sides and bring the good insights together and have a scientific spirituality
7319040	7325120	that's rigorous and human. Yeah, now I completely agree. I've always thought that as well. I mean
7325120	7330480	East meets West almost in Yang and Yang. You have to sort of bring these concepts together
7330480	7333840	because there's so much different types of knowledge and bodies of knowledge that
7334560	7341360	even the general Western sciences did not understand a lot of Eastern science or Asian
7341360	7345920	philosophy, African philosophy. There's a lot to it that a lot of them just have never had
7346000	7354400	access to and don't get, but found things to say. I agree with you. I agree. And I think that
7354400	7361680	in the dialogue, the informal natural language descriptions of these traditions
7362240	7369120	can be translated into mathematics. And at that point, then we can start to get the real power
7369200	7376640	of the ideas. I like to use the example of Einstein when he's developed the theory of
7376640	7381200	general relativity. The big idea came like in 1907 where he realized that if I was
7381200	7387120	in an elevator standing on a weighing scale and the cord of the elevator was cut and this went
7387120	7390800	into free-fraw, all of a sudden I would weigh nothing on the scale. I would weigh nothing.
7390800	7395520	That was his big insight that led to general relativity, but it took him years and he was
7395520	7400400	Einstein, so he was brilliant. It took him years to turn that into mathematics. But when he turned
7400400	7408320	it into mathematics, a year later or a few months later, Schwartzschild, some German soldier,
7408320	7414000	actually, but brilliant, solved his equations and proved that there were black holes. Well,
7414000	7419040	Einstein had no idea that his equations would lead to black holes. He didn't like it. He didn't
7419040	7428720	believe in black holes. So what happens is your theories become smarter than the person who wrote
7428720	7435040	them down. You become a student of your own theory, even if you're an Einstein. You're not smart enough
7435040	7440640	to know everything that your theory is going to teach you. So that's what's going to happen with
7440640	7446880	spirituality does not have that yet. They don't have the benefit of taking the ideas, making them
7446880	7454640	so precise that you can become students of those ideas where even the teacher who wrote them down
7455760	7460960	doesn't know all the implications and has to become humble before their own mathematics
7460960	7469360	and let it teach them. When spirituality gets to that point, sign me up. I'm really interested.
7469840	7476720	Well, sign me up too, Don. I'm also keen to go on that journey as well. It's been another
7476720	7482000	pleasure for me. It's been such an amazing journey. Chatting to you is always so much fun
7482000	7487120	and I still can't wait for us to have many more along the way. Anything on your mind? Anything
7487120	7495440	else you want to say? One thing I'd like to say, and that is one question that people always bring
7495520	7503200	up is you use the theory of evolution to show that we don't see the truth. We don't see
7503200	7506640	reality as it is, but then that means that evolution isn't true and so you shot yourself
7506640	7517040	in the foot. So I should address that just briefly. The idea is this. This is the way
7517040	7524240	science progresses. This is nothing special about me. This is the way you put down a scientific
7524240	7531600	theory and you make it mathematically precise. When you do that, then the mathematics tells you
7532240	7538880	what the theory can do, but it also tells you where the theory ends. Einstein's theory ends at 10 to
7538880	7546560	the minus 33 centimeters. Well, I'm not doing anything weird or special. This is just the way
7546560	7551760	science works. You take the mathematics of the theory and you ask the mathematics what's the
7551760	7556000	limit of this theory and the mathematics comes back and says, here's the limit, 10 to the minus
7556000	7562000	33 centimeters. Well, in the case of evolution, it also says the same thing. The limit is the very
7562000	7567680	assumption of space time and objects in space, organisms in space time competing for resources
7567680	7577200	in space time. That ain't true. In Einstein's case, the mathematics comes back and says,
7577200	7583200	space time, that ain't it. It's not fundamental. In fact, it falls apart at 10 to the minus 33.
7583200	7589200	You're going to need to find a structure outside of space time. Evolution is saying the same thing.
7589200	7593600	So we're not shooting ourselves in the foot. You have to understand this is the way
7594960	7602000	science progresses. The mathematics doesn't prove that the assumptions are right. The
7602000	7610640	mathematics tells you the limits of the assumptions. So it's not a minor point.
7610640	7616640	So it's how science progresses. It's almost like going back to the old way of thinking like
7616640	7623280	falsification in a sense. It's kind of you're looking for that sort of that cap, that end point,
7623920	7629680	where it does end. Well, and in fact, if you think about it, that's what scientists should
7629680	7634080	be looking for all the time is like, we know that this is not the theory of everything, right?
7634080	7640080	We know it. If I can write it down, it's not the theory of everything. So do I want to be
7642560	7649600	an idiot? Or do I want to be the explorer? So let me be the explorer. Where's the limit? So let's
7649600	7653600	find as soon as possible what the limits of this theory are and then go to the next one and then
7653600	7660720	explore its limits. That's fun. It's boring to just get stuck in the same paradigm the whole time.
7661520	7665680	And I would say one short thing too. And this question always comes up.
7665680	7667840	Alright, take your time done. I've got time. Don't worry.
7669680	7675200	Okay. I won't perseverate though. Just one last thing. A lot of people will say,
7676000	7687360	look, you're saying that the moon is just an object in my headset, and it doesn't exist
7687360	7693360	when no one looks. And you create it when you look. Give me a break. Everybody goes,
7693920	7702800	give me a break. So suppose I take, I don't know, an apple and I stick it in the ground
7703680	7709360	and leave it there for five weeks. And then you come and dig it up. You're going to find a rotten
7709360	7715760	apple. Well, doesn't that prove that the apple was there the whole time? And it existed even
7715760	7723200	when you weren't looking, right? And rot was going on when you weren't looking. And so this whole
7723200	7730800	nonsense. Well, and all I can say is if you, questions like that one, and there are many,
7731040	7739520	many, I get dozens of questions all the time. Right. In all those questions, the way to answer
7739520	7744880	it for yourself is to just put it into virtual reality. So imagine you're playing a virtual
7744880	7750320	reality game, a multiplayer virtual reality game, and try to put your question into that realm.
7750320	7758240	And then you'll see how it works. So for example, I'm playing multiplayer tennis.
7758960	7766160	And I hit the tennis ball to my partner over on the other side. And I say, you know,
7766160	7772720	the tennis ball only exists when I look. It's just pixels in my headset. And the other guy says,
7772720	7779440	oh, no, no, no. The tennis ball is real. So, and he takes, so both guys are in virtual reality.
7779440	7782640	He takes the tennis ball and he drops it and looks away. I can't see it. But Don,
7782640	7786080	can you see the tennis ball? And I say, yeah, I can see it. So that proves it really exists.
7786720	7792320	No, I just doesn't prove that I turned my head and I'm rendering it because I'm looking at it.
7793600	7798720	So it doesn't exist. Well, well, then he says, well, but when I hit the tennis ball to you,
7798720	7803600	you hit the same tennis ball back to me. So it proves that there's just one. No, no,
7803600	7806640	I have a tennis ball that I'm experiencing in my headset. You have a tennis ball that you're
7806640	7812640	experiencing your headset. So all the questions that people have before you, before you write me
7813360	7818400	an email about it. First, try it out yourself. See if you can solve the problem yourself by
7818400	7825520	putting it into virtual reality, a multiplayer game, and see if you, here's the key, here's the
7825520	7829680	key idea. There is something that exists independent of what you see in your headset.
7830960	7834320	There is something in that analogy, it's some supercomputer that's coordinating the game.
7834880	7838720	But there's no tennis ball in that supercomputer. There's nothing green or fuzzy
7838800	7843600	or round in that. So there is something that exists independent of you, but it's utterly
7844240	7850000	unlike anything that you see or experience, utterly unlike that. That's the only thing you
7850000	7855680	have to wrap. Once you wrap your head around that idea and use the VR and supercomputer analogy,
7856480	7861440	you'll be able to solve your own puzzles and then you'll see how fun this approach is. But until
7861440	7866800	then, I see people, they can't really start to explore because they just see these obvious
7866800	7873520	contradictions that they think make the whole thing a non-starter. So just put it into virtual
7873520	7878240	reality and then you can start to really explore the space. Another way to sort of see that,
7878960	7884320	well, another way I had a question on, and I forgot to ask you about that, was also when
7885120	7890800	as two perceivers are sort of seeing something, the fact that they're able to render the sort
7890800	7896160	of same thing within your theory is actually because, in essence, this is still coming from
7896160	7903520	one sort of the one. So it's not like they wouldn't have access to the same information at some
7903520	7909680	point. It's kind of like you do have this shared access to information within the reality.
7909680	7914560	That's absolutely right. It's like the supercomputer and the VR analogy is the shared access.
7916480	7922400	The one little proviso I would give is that we actually don't know that others are perceiving
7922400	7930560	the world like us. There's something called synesthesia. You know better than I do, where
7930560	7938800	people have experiences that, like Carol Steen, everything that she hears, every bit of music
7938800	7945600	that she hears, she sees a geometric object with a specific shape and a specific texture to the
7945600	7950400	surfaces and colors and so forth. And I've actually met her and talked with her in person about this.
7950400	7956800	So I mean, she's living in a world that I wouldn't have imagined was possible. She hears music
7956800	7963120	and every time she hears the same piece of music, she sees the same object doing a complicated movement
7964000	7970880	with a beautiful surface on it and so forth. Well, and there was a guy named Michael something
7970880	7978480	rather who everything he tasted with his mouth, he felt with his hands. So meant for like a tall,
7978560	7985920	cold, cool column of glass. Yeah, you get some patients who can, when they read, they can smell it
7985920	7993280	or hear sounds. It's incredible, some of the synesthesia patients. That's right. So you're
7993280	7999760	right that because we share this, the one, we can have some expectation of understanding what the
7999760	8005440	other world, what the other person's world is like. But I just want to put out this proviso that
8005440	8010320	don't think that you know everything. It may be that their world is very, very different than you
8010320	8017600	would ever. We have good experimental reasons to believe that our visual sensory worlds vary
8017600	8023280	from person to person and sometimes dramatically. I was going to say, because in that case,
8023280	8032720	someone who's schizophrenic or has fully blown psychosis has almost left that headset in a different
8032720	8039200	way. How would you sort of explore that within this? Like a fully blown psychosis where the
8039200	8045600	person is completely out of touch. There is no link at all to what you and I are experiencing
8045600	8053440	within our headsets. How is that sort of explored within this analogy? Of course, now I'm a complete
8053440	8059440	amateur. I'm not a psychiatrist or anything like that. So everyone knows this is a philosophy slash
8059440	8066560	podcast. That's not really a mental health podcast directly. Exactly. Right. So then I'll
8066560	8071120	speculate given that. So I'm not a professional psychiatrist. But it seems to me that
8074400	8081120	going back to the idea of the one and the one plunging in with both feet and losing itself.
8082640	8086400	But giving itself, we didn't talk about this, but I think the one gives itself little
8087360	8093600	nudges to wake up. And that's the suffering that happens when I get identified with myself and
8093600	8098960	I'm trying to be important. And my ego is trying to clash with other people. I'm trying to show
8098960	8103680	I'm smarter than you or better than you or faster than you or have more money or better cars.
8103680	8114160	All that competition that we do is painful. It causes suffering. The very act of me being
8114240	8119360	in any way hostile to anybody else causes me suffering. And to be competitive in any way
8119360	8125760	like that is causes me suffering. And that suffering is the wake up call to the truth,
8125760	8133200	which is that person that I'm competing against or that I'm angry with is me. That is me under a
8133200	8142000	different avatar. Now, but and I'm gently I've got the suffering as a gentle way of and sometimes
8142000	8148960	not so gentle as later on of getting me to wake up and and and to but that's part of the whole
8148960	8154800	thing of waking up to who I am. And so the psychoses I think are cases where the suffering has
8154800	8160080	gotten in many cases that sometimes it's you can say this person had a tumor and that's why I mean
8160080	8164640	really we look in there and there's a tumor, right? So that the tumor is sort of the headset
8164640	8167360	version of saying that there's something wrong in the network of conscious agents,
8167360	8171920	something went, you know, something with haywire and that the headset construction.
8172480	8176400	But in this other approach I'm thinking about is that the
8180400	8187920	the extreme psychological pain that you get with extreme psychiatric patients is really the one
8189280	8195600	using suffering of an extreme kind to wake itself up to wake that particular itself in
8195600	8205360	that avatar to wake up and to recognize that there's nothing to worry about, right? If you're in
8205360	8209680	the virtual reality game and you believe you're the avatar, if someone's shooting up the avatar,
8209680	8214720	it's scary as hell. But if you're if you go into the game, you know, my avatar is just an avatar,
8214720	8219200	you know, they can shoot up all it's a completely different game. There's no reason to be upset.
8219840	8225040	So, so that is that kind of it's waking up to Oh, this is just a VR game.
8226640	8229920	And the psychosis patient in the one I'm talking about is the one who hasn't
8230560	8234880	who's who needs to wake up but is still so identified with the avatar that they're in
8234880	8241440	they're in a world of pain and a world of fear and a world. So that's again, amateur hour from
8241440	8247200	Hoffman. I'm not a psychiatrist. Yeah, just kind of don't worry. I always put at the bottom of my
8247200	8254960	video is a disclaimer to let people know that this is more of a an educational podcast rather than a
8254960	8259280	and something you apply to your life. This is not us trying to be gurus everyone. So just
8261920	8266000	and as a doctor myself, I'm not this is not me coming out trying to give people advice either.
8266000	8271680	This is my intellectual pursuit of trying to understand these questions that I love so much.
8271680	8276880	So everyone knows that's just our disclaimer for the moment. Don, would you
8276880	8281360	have professional advice? Yes, this is not professional advice at all. Don, do you get
8281360	8288080	worried or concerned about the fact? Maybe even I don't know, do you even like it? But maybe that you
8288720	8294960	maybe Bernardo or you guys within this idealist. It's almost like a new wave of idealism that's
8294960	8300000	taking place right now. It's quite fascinating to see as well from from my perspective, doing this
8300000	8306080	podcast and taking part in these conversations. Do you ever get concerned that you guys are slowly
8306080	8313440	growing a cult or maybe that there's the people are going to take some of this and and take it way
8313440	8319280	beyond you guys like to to a point where they form their own sort of dogma type groups. Do you
8319280	8322960	does that ever concern you in any way? Well,
8325520	8332400	that's a very question I know, but I guess it does in the sense that my efforts are to make it
8333040	8340720	a mathematical science, which still doesn't preclude a cultish kind of approach, but it
8340720	8348480	really helps to avoid it when when when you don't just have words that you're pushing around.
8349360	8355040	But you have a mathematical theory that can slap you in the face when when you misinterpret it,
8355920	8361040	right? And when it actually says no to you, like when Einstein thinks that there are no black
8361040	8365360	holes and the theory comes back and slaps them and says, no, there are black holes, live with it.
8365920	8373200	So so that's so that's what I want is is a mathematically precise idealism. I call it
8373200	8378480	conscious realism because of some philosophical baggage that ideals and brings. But so I call
8378480	8385760	it conscious realism, but it's a version of idealism. I want to mathematically precise.
8385760	8390720	My goal is to get this thing launched with enough mathematical rigor and enough
8392720	8398000	momentum that it will take off and be a real science, a real mathematical idealist science.
8398000	8404800	I see idealism in the past has had something of an anti science
8405440	8414240	flair to it. I mean, Berkeley, in some sense, brought up his idealism as a reply to the
8415040	8420880	physicalism that he perceived of Newton's science. And yeah, and Berkeley had God
8420880	8427840	as part of as his main sort of core to the to the thesis. That's right. And it was sort of a
8428400	8438480	it came out of an opposition to the Newtonian science. And in many idealist theories, in fact,
8439600	8445760	I'm not really sure if I know of any like idealists who have said, let's go make this a
8445760	8451360	mathematical scientific theory. I mean, this is this is not. Yeah, there are there are some
8451360	8456880	quantum physicists who are early on who interpreted quantum mechanics in idealist ways.
8457920	8463040	Von Neumann and others give idealist interpretations. But that's not what I'm
8463040	8467440	talking about. Someone's saying, let's take idealist ideas and make a mathematically
8467440	8472720	precise scientific theory out of idealism. And you know, Kant, of course, did a lot of
8473840	8477120	deep philosophical ideas about idealism, but that's different from making
8477840	8486400	mathematically precise theories. And so there's been this anti science flavor to a lot of idealist
8486400	8493200	thinking. And and this is, it's, I think, not necessary. And in fact, it's, it's, it's not
8493200	8498640	helpful. I think that idealism is the next step. And we need to make it mathematically precise and
8498640	8506160	show that physicalism emerges as a as a headset, as a projection of a much, much deeper theory. So
8506160	8510640	by the way, we don't throw away our physicalist theories, we show them as special cases of
8510720	8517440	deeper theories. And we use our physicalist theories as tests for, you know, we're making new
8518720	8523280	theories beyond space time. How do we test them? We test them in space time. We test them like
8523280	8527680	with scattering experiments, where we know the physics of the scattering. So so we don't throw
8527680	8533200	away our old theories. We are grateful for quantum field theory and general relative, we're grateful
8533200	8538240	for evolution by natural selection. These are wonderful theories. They are going to tell us
8538240	8543440	when we make mistakes with our theories outside of space time, they will come back and slap us
8543440	8546960	in the face, because we have to protect them back into their domain. And they say, well, now
8546960	8554000	you're in our domain. And I say, no, or I say, maybe, maybe you can continue in that direction,
8554000	8560960	you're not wrong yet. So so so that's the so ultimately, I think idealism
8560960	8569120	needs to be and I'm trying to work toward that end to make it a mathematically precise
8569120	8572640	science. And then I won't have to worry about the cold thing that we talked about earlier.
8573680	8578000	The reason why I asked that is because you see it when you look at the comments and the way people
8578000	8585360	talk about your work, Bernardo, etc. I mean, the way some people are really, really in love with
8585360	8591360	it, you know, they it it is their anti anxiety cure. They listen to you guys to kind of get
8591360	8598240	the to get themselves out of tough situations. They they use this as a spiritual escape. And
8598240	8602960	I've seen comments and I like them I always tell them like, it's great. It's great that you guys
8602960	8608160	have such an impact. But at that point, you do come with a lot of power. And I recently read a
8608160	8615120	paper by someone it, I can't remember who it was by, but it was about Bernardo Kastrop's idealism
8615600	8620800	and and and I can't remember who wrote it, but it very it spoke about this. It was it was against
8620800	8626960	it, of course, but trying to dissect the fact that it's almost cult like it. It's kind of like a
8628800	8634160	group of thinkers coming together forming this new wave. It's almost like the new age atheism
8634160	8640160	movement that happened with Dawkins, Dennett back in the day, but accepting it in a shift towards
8640160	8647760	a positive sort of like love universal mind is one very, very cult like and I'm not accusing you
8647760	8651600	of this, but I'm just saying you can actually see it in the comment sections, you can tell people
8651600	8657040	do really love your work and there's a big there's a big need for it and want for it clearly.
8658320	8661680	Well, I would I would say for those who who love it.
8662560	8670800	The best thing that you can do is if you have the talents is to study the mathematics of it and
8670800	8676800	contribute to the mathematics and push it forward. Or if you don't yourself have that talent and
8676800	8689040	few of us do find a friend who does get them. The way to really to really help this is to
8690000	8695280	move the science forward. As we move the science forward, if it continues to give us
8695280	8700480	psychological comfort, fantastic. If it prods us in ways that we're not comfortable with,
8700480	8707280	so be it. We have to go wherever truth leads us or at least the projection of truth that we can
8707280	8715600	see leads us. So that's what I would suggest is is I absolutely will say my thoughts on this
8716480	8723920	are baby steps and everything that I've said your baby steps. It's in just a few years,
8723920	8728880	hopefully, even within my lifetime, everything I'm saying will be seen in this trivial compared
8728880	8734240	to what we've discovered. Let's move the science forward beyond my trivial ideas right now. Let's
8734240	8741200	get this thing into a real substantial science. And I mean, it would be crazy. I mean, the more
8741280	8748800	you guys find out, the more you see you, you could almost be seen as as the link between us and the
8748800	8758320	one. You're going to take us closer to us all together. It's just the one talking to itself.
8758320	8765280	Yeah, pretty much you're taking us closer to us. That's right. It's beautiful all together and
8765280	8771520	done. Thanks so much, man. It's always a pleasure. So much fun. Anything you want to say? Anything
8771520	8777280	else that you think that you really just want to put up? I squeezed in all the all the extras I wanted
8777280	8782080	to at this point. But next time, I'll probably have some more things that you know, I got emails
8782080	8786000	where people have questions. So next time, absolutely. I would say that I would love to
8786000	8790320	talk with you again. I'm eager and every time I'm going to try to do something different. And
8790320	8793600	obviously next time, if there's any new papers, if there's anything else you want to chat about
8793600	8798800	specifically, we go back in, do another dissection. It's always fun done. It's such a fascinating
8798800	8803760	journey for me personally. Watching from the outside, watching your work, it's always a
8803760	8808160	pleasure. And I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thank you. And Tevin, I just love the way that
8808160	8812720	you guide the conversation. It's beyond expert. Well done.
