{"text": " Mark, tell me, why is it that there is something it is like to be me? Why is it that there is something it is like to be you? How is this possible? Well, there are two questions there. The one is why there is something it is like to be me. Or to be you, and the other is how is that possible? The why question, I believe, has everything to do with the fact that the fundamental, and I say fact, and I'll have to substantiate that later, but it has everything to do with the fact that the fundamental form of consciousness is feeling, in other words, affect. And affect arises from a monitoring of our homeostatic imperatives. We living things have to remain within certain viable bounds, and simpler creatures have reflexive mechanisms which maintain them within those bounds, but obviously reflexes have a limited generalizability. There are many situations that living things find themselves in which are unpredicted by their evolutionary past, and so they can't navigate uncertain or novel situations, and so most of them expire in those situations, but a lucky few survive, because they just happen by chance to do the right thing, and then they have progeny, and so that contributes to the evolution of those reflexes. There's therefore an enormous advantage, an enormous adaptive advantage for creatures to be able to experience how they're doing. Is this going well or is this going badly? When acting voluntarily, in other words, not reflexively, not automatically, they now can, by trial and error, try different things out, and if it's going well, then they feel it. This feels like a relief, and if things are going badly, the opposite applies, and so they avoid what feels bad, and they approach what feels good, and in this way, as I said a moment ago, they have the enormous advantage of being able to navigate unknown, unpredicted, novel, uncertain situations, and then to learn from the experience during life rather than for it to require generations of phylogenetic learning, in other words, learning by natural selection, or rather adaptation by natural selection. So, I believe I, with others, it's not my own idea. This is a building on the work, first of all, of Jagdpanksepp, and secondly of Antonio de Marzio, and others. We believe that that affects or an extent or feeling is an extended form of homeostasis. There, you can see in what I've just said, there's an intrinsic value system. The value system of all living things, the value system which simply underwrites the whole of evolutionary biology, is that it is good to survive and bad not to. So, good feelings predict your likely survival, and bad feelings predict your likely demise. So, that's the valence, as we call it, the valence of affect, the unpleasant pleasure dimension. It is intrinsically valenced, doing well and doing badly. In order to make choices, and remember that's what I'm speaking about, the animal having now the capacity to make choices. In other words, to not behave compulsively according to reflex. That capacity has to be rooted in a value system, because how else do you make a choice? Something has to be better than something else. So, there has to be some value system which determines what's good and what's bad, and that's what I've just explicated. Now, on top of that, we have multiple needs. We complex creatures have multiple needs, but actually, you don't need to be that complex a creature to have multiple needs, like for example, to have energy balance needs, and thermoregulation needs, and hydration needs, and oxygenation needs. There you have four, and each of these has to be met in their own right. So, you can't reduce them to a common denominator. You can't say, I have 8 out of 10 need for sleep, and a 2 out of 10 need for nutrition. Therefore, I have a 10 out of 20 total need, so all I need to do is sleep, and I'll reduce the number, and never eat. You have to do them both. So, why I'm emphasizing that is that this is something in addition to valence. We also have categories of need. So, valence is a continuous variable. You can say from minus 50 to plus 50, that's the range of badness to goodness, but the categorical variables that represent our different needs are by definition because they're categorical variables. They are qualitatively distinguished from each other. So, this is why feelings have both a goodness and a badness, and a particular quality, so that sleepiness feels different from hunger, and from thirst, and from respiratory distress, and so on. So, when you said why is there something that is like to be me or to be you, I believe in the most basic form of consciousness, that's why. It enables us to know how we're doing, to evaluate how we're doing, and it is necessarily qualified. In other words, qualia arise from the fact that we have multiple such needs. Then there's the second step, which is if I can, you know, obviously the simple creatures that first evolved, when I say simple, I don't want to be derogatory, they're not that simple as I've been saying, but the first creatures that evolved feeling, they weren't verbal, so they wouldn't have been able to say what I'm now going to say, but it's as if their feelings say, I feel like this, you know, it tells you how you're doing, and then secondarily, it's a matter of I feel like this about that, and so feeling gets extended onto perception and cognition, so because you have to develop policies about what you're going to do, and so affect is the fundamental form of consciousness, which then gets extended onto cognitive and perceptual consciousness, which gives rise to the forms that dominate our conscious experience, and because our capacity to plan and think about what we're going to do is so highly developed. The second part of your question, you know, about how does this happen, well I've partly described the mechanisms of how it happens, but if you're asking about the hard problem, in other words, you know, how does physical, physiological processes of the kind that I've just described, how do they turn into, how do they somehow transform into subjective experiences, that's another story, so you'll have to tell me if you want me to go into that. I think, look, okay, there's so much to touch on, I mean, first of all, I just want the listeners, or for the viewers, we're both in South Africa, this is quite cool because it's the first time I'm actually chatting to someone in the same time zone, we're both in Cape Town, and just for everyone who's wondering why the screens are so dark on your side, it's because in South Africa, we have what's called low chatting, our country just does not give us electricity every now and then, so Mark's unfortunately on the one side of it right now, just for some context for the viewers, but okay Mark, let's go to the hard problem, I mean, I've read The Hidden Spring, I mean, I've read The Neuropsychology of Dreams, your writing is very fascinating, I like the way you're sort of blending neuropsychology, neuropsychoanalysis into neurobiology and trying to link these fields together, so you're definitely working at that interface between mind and body, so let's discuss the hard problem, what are your thoughts on this hard problem of consciousness, is there a problem, I mean this podcast is called Mind, Body, Problem, Solution, because the aim is to find a solution to this problem, do you think we're able to find it using what your theory sort of claims? Well, I don't claim to have solved the hard problem, but I do claim to have given us a hint as to what direction we need to go in in order to be able to do so, so let me unpack that story, I could do it in two ways, let me preface it with the first way and then I'll come to the second way which I'll tell you in more detail, I think that the hard problem arose because we focused on visual perception as our model example of consciousness, in fact I might go further and say we focused on human visual perception as our model example of consciousness and of course conscious vision has everything to do with cortex, so I might sort of you have to start somewhere, so let's start with Francis Crick's famous book from 1994, it was called The Astonishing Hypothesis and the subtitle was The Scientific Search for the Soul and there he explicated a methodological program as to how we might go about sort of saving the problem of consciousness from philosophy, rescuing it and bringing it into international science and he proposed this concept of the neural correlate of consciousness, he said all we need to do, consciousness is nothing special, it's just another biological function, all we need to do is find the anatomical and physiological substrate of this function, in other words we need to identify its neural correlate, we need to then once we've isolated that correlate we can start seeing okay well how does this thing work because this must somehow explain why there's something it's like to be you and me, it's a sort of reasonable commonsensical reductionist strategy but the unfortunate choice as I just said is that he focused on human vision and I say it's unfortunate but it's not difficult to understand why, I mean human consciousness is dominated by visual perception and also more cortex is given over to visual perception than any other form and we understand it rather well so it seemed like a reasonable place to start, why I think it was an unfortunate place to start is first of all you shouldn't start with human beings the most complex form of consciousness and you know cortex is many, this is more fundamental point, the function of visual perception does not require consciousness, you can have visual perception without consciousness so when the very next year after Crick's book was published came David Chalmers's famous paper in the Journal of Consciousness Studies where he said well you know why doesn't all this information processing go on in the dark and etc, I don't need to tell you what he said but I think it was a reasonable question from Chalmers precisely because visual information processing can go on in the dark so it is mysterious why do we why does it have to feel like anything at all, we know that not only the superior curriculae can see unconsciously but you know the visual cortex can see unconsciously and it can discriminate things like pretty elaborate things like color you know you can you can discriminate color unconsciously so why does it have to be something it is like to experience red versus blue if you can discriminate them without experience now that I do not believe applies to feelings you can't have a feeling without feeling it and I've just explained to you why we feel our feelings it is it is a it is a necessarily subjective monitoring of my own state with existential consequences for me and it has to have this goodness and badness has to have value and it has to have a categorical qualitative differences so you know had we started there had we started with affects which are not generated cortically and that's another big story they are generated they are generated in the in the midbrain for the most part but certainly they are generated subcortically in general had we started with those much more ancient much simpler structures and I think that the hard problem would never really have arisen I think it's you know to say why must you feel pain you know why must you feel hunger this is mysterious why don't you have why don't you unconsciously navigate uncertainty and make choices of existential consequences within qualitatively distinctive variables and it's just you know just is when you describe that function you're just describing a feeling and feelings as I said feelings have to feel like something unlike visual perception which does not have to so that's the the first I said I'm going to tell the story in two parts that's the that's the the first part but let me now move from neuroscience to to a more sort of philosophical perspective on this thing and I said the question the hard problem put in its most basic form you know is as so put it you know how how does the brain get over the hump from electrochemistry to feeling and how do electrochemical processes turn into feelings literally turn into them you know what kind of weird metaphysical transduction occurs there and and and here I think the problem is that the the the physiological processes do not turn into experiences I think this is remember I'm saying this is a philosophical perspective yes I think it's a matter of observational perspective on point of view so um no if you if you look at the processes going on in my brain when I am feeling let us say excitedly motivated you will see activation of mesocortical mesolambic dopamine circuitry and you literally will see it if you for example put me in a positron emission scanner you will see that circuitry lighting up and you can you can use all sorts of methods to you know drill down into what exactly is going on physiologically there but that's looking at me from the outside I mean you are now looking at me in the dark from the outside and you're seeing a body and you can then you know you can start scanning this body and you can see in in more granular detail what's going on within it but the the crucial issue is you're taking an external observational perspective on me I on the other hand have another observational perspective on me that is being me I am me so I have another perspective which is the subjective mark songs as a subject as opposed to mark songs as an object so I can look at myself in the mirror and I recognize oh yeah that guy's me it's mark songs but I could also when I first wake up in the morning before I've even opened my eyes I can have this dawning subjective experience of being me and that's can only be described as my mind then I stagger over to the bathroom look at myself in the mirror and that's my body but both of them are me so you know they're not two of them there's only one of them there's only one mark songs it's just that we're observing him from two different perspectives so so to say how does how does my subjective experience of being me produce the physical or I should rather put it the other way around how does the physiological embodied version of me produce the subjective experience of me is like asking you know how does something objective produce something subjective objectivity doesn't do subjectivity they're two different perspectives um now the if we are one and the same thing you know then it's like actually let me use another analogy lightning and thunder you know with you with your ears you hear a clap of thunder with your eyes you see a flash of lightning that they're two different things you know the they're utterly different perceptions but but they're not they're not actually two different things they're two different manifest depends what perceptual perspective you take on is it an auditory perspective or is it a visual perspective we don't ask it would be unreasonable to ask how does lightning turn into thunder you know we realize these are two different ways of of of perceiving the same underlying process and then we ask what is that underlying process and then we start going into physics and we start speaking about you know georelectrical potential differences in the atmosphere and you know and that's the ultimate description of what's going on the ultimate description is of the causal mechanisms that we infer from the observational the observable data and that's how we come up with the basic theory a basic and a fundamental science of lightning and thunder um you know which is the theory of electricity um and and I think that that's what we need um in in neuroscience or neuropsychology if we're going to bridge the divide between the psychological and the neurological between the subjective and the objective perspectives on the being of a creature then we need to find a more fundamental language which explains both both sets of phenomena we don't we don't want to ask how does the one set of phenomena cause the other set of phenomena because they don't so what I'm saying in essence is that the hard problem is made a lot harder than it has to be uh if we if we conceptualize it that way if we ask the question how do how does the brain get over the pump from electrochemistry to feeling it's it's it's a question that can't be answered because it's wrongly framed um but if we ask you know what is it that produces both the electrochemistry and what explains the behavior of the electrochemistry and the behavior of the feeling then we then we have a mechanistic theory and and I I think that um the the prospects of finding such a mechanistic theory are greatly increased by shifting our focus away from these very complicated visual perceptual processes which as I've already said uh these cortical processes are way down the evolutionary line uh they're much later developments they're a secondary application um of what feeling is for and what feeling does and focus instead on the primary form of feeling in the brain stem which is as I've also already said an extended form of homeostasis then we say okay so we have a fairly good clue as to what the mechanism is that we're looking for uh it's it's homeostasis with some version of homeostasis and I I think from that starting point uh obviously there's a lot more that could be said about okay so then how do we do it how how does uh homeostasis mechanistically how does it explain the behavior of the predictive brain and how does it explain the experience of being an of an intentional being with with with with calls and and aims and purposes and so on I think that from that starting point it can be done um and my my own efforts in this area have been have been along those lines trying to trying to begin to um sketch what what what what this what this uh this monist uh um mechanistic uh um causal explanatory process might be whereby uh we we have the the particular physiology of consciousness and the particular phenomenology of it I'm glad you you just mentioned monist and asked because I was thinking I mean we spoke about some of the history of philosophy we we spoke about David Chalmers and his 1995 paper I mean do you think Descartes-Ren\u00e9 Descartes when he started this this question of this mind-body problem when he started with this dualistic approach do you think that also had a big impact on the way we perceived this problem in the first place very much so and and David Chalmers makes little uh secret of his admiration for Descartes I I think yeah I mean I I I wholly concur with the title of Demasio's famous book Descartes' Error it was a horrendous error so so the the philosophy that I find myself much more sympathetic with is is is that of of Spinoza uh that that I think is a great advance over Descartes um I'm actually going to chat to Demasio about in a couple days so I'm very looking I'm looking forward to that but Mark seem to be my best wishes I'll definitely like him very much yeah so I'm looking forward to discussing Descartes' Error in quite a bit of detail well when you're looking at this brain stem you're looking at this midbrain you're talking about ancient consciousness I know sometimes because the main goal of this podcast is for me to provide you someone who has a an excellent new thought process on this problem to explain their view express themselves openly and to also address any objections people might have or to their theory but when when you talk about the ancient brain you feel that's giving people a sort of a misconception on what you mean by ancient consciousness because I feel like I've I've read blogs I've read a couple things where people think you're taking it too far I've talked to some scientists about it some some philosophers and they think you're taking it too low but yet you're explaining exactly why the cortical versions of this are not the same do you think that they're mistaken consciousness with intelligence I do I do very much so think that uh although um I don't deny uh that very simple creatures like a bacterium has an intelligence it's obviously in it's nothing like our intelligence and it's it's a it's a perfectly understandable state of affairs that we start with human consciousness well we are human for one thing for another thing the problem of other minds dictates that the only form of consciousness we can ever observe directly is our own so you know it's it's it's not an unreasonable place to start it's not it's not hard to understand why we began there but it's quite a different thing to say that therefore human consciousness is the definitional form you know that anything which doesn't conform to our type of consciousness isn't really consciousness um you you started this podcast by asking me the question why is there something it is like to be me that is uh of course charmer's definition building upon tom nagel's definition from 1974 um it's notoriously difficult to get a neuroscientist or for that matter anyone to agree on a definition of consciousness but I think if there's one definition that has more or less uh united us it is that it is something it is likeness you know it's it is parliad that's what we mean by consciousness and so there's nothing there's nothing complicated about that it doesn't it doesn't have anything more in common with Descartes thinking uh cogito ergo sum than it does uh in common with the the the the raw feel of pain you know there is something it is like to feel pain so when you say I'm going too far philosophically speaking all I'm saying is I want to stop I want to I want to define consciousness as as something it is like to be in that there is something it is like to be in that state and that's not a controversial definition of consciousness and then I'm saying well there is something it is like to be in pre-verbal non-verbal uh states of raw ethic like pain I find it very hard to to imagine how anyone could argue against that you know there is something it is like to be to be hungry there's something it is like to be thirsty this there's something it is like to be in pain there's something it is like to experience separation distress with which all mammals experience and display um there's something it is like to feel fear and you know and you don't need to be able to reflect upon the source of your pain it's a very very great advantage to be able to but you don't have to have any theory of pain or any explanation of pain or any knowledge of pain as mechanisms etc or even just know anything about what caused me to feel this all you just need to know is I feel it that's that is that is I think a very defendable position that that's what we mean fundamentally by a conscious state um you know I I grant of course that these higher forms of consciousness add all kinds of bells and whistles and uh I'm very grateful to be the proud possessor of all of those bells and whistles and I don't want to forego them you know so therefore I'm well aware that they add a hell of a lot more but I don't think it's the right place to start if you're wanting to understand the basic mechanism whereby something it is likeness appeared on this planet you know how it how and why it evolved that that creatures started to quote Tom Nagel he said that something like I'm paraphrasing but he said an organism is only conscious if there is something it is like to be the organism something it is like for the organism you know that's that's that's a compelling definition for me of what consciousness is and and and it makes mean in terms of everything else we do in biology you know we take an evolutionary perspective we we try and understand you know what this thing how this thing evolved why this thing evolved what does it add what does it do that's why once it once it evolves it gets it gets conserved because it continues to perform that function and that function bestows such enormous additional survival potential that that it just hangs around now you've got to look at the arguments so I've just given you in principle arguments about why I think that's a fine place to start it's in fact to me the obvious place to start although I can understand why we started in another place I think that it was a mistake in retrospect and now we can correct that mistake and start in a better place but it's not just a matter of principles you know it's a matter it's also an empirical matter when you start looking scientifically at what is the minimal architecture for for consciousness you you know you and you know you you you can start with human beings even you know if you if you produce not deliberately so let me rather say if it so happens that you suffer a lesion in the reticular activating system that lesion can be as small as two millimeters cubed in other words the size of a match head if it's in the peri-brachial complex the right part of the peri-brachial complex that will produce a coma in in any and in every human being you the the fish's meta fish's analysis of all of the scans of stroke trying to identify what is the small what is the common denominator what area is always lesion in patients in coma it's the it's it's a it's a small two cubic two cubic millimeter area of the peri-brachial complex so that wipes out something it is likeness reliably you know I mean you can at my prediction is lesion that area the animal will go into a coma bingo it always happens the prediction is confirmed each and every time now by contrast what about the cerebral cortex the cerebral cortex in fact since the 1880s where has been removed in experimental animals with gay abandon and even in the 1880s it was already observed that goats for example did it in dogs the dogs didn't go into a coma they just they became what goats described as idiotish in other words they became stupid they they lost their they lost their knowledge their understanding of the world but they still behaved you know purposeively they they they behave and I'm telling you about goats but since then for decades you know a decortication has been performed on on innumerable mammal species and the opposite if it's done neonately you know the the the observation is always the same that they they play they show fear they get enraged in situationally appropriate ways they copulate with each other they rear little little pups to maturity I mean not perfectly but they do they play they hang from bars they swing around you know they they in fact yark pangsit used to he performed a little sort of an experiment it's not really an experiment but each of his new cohort of graduate students he would show them two groups of rats in two different cages the one group had been decorticated and the other group had had a sham decortication in other words they had the little bandage on their heads but but they they hadn't had the operation and he asked them which of these two groups has no cortex and and every year he had the same result you know that the students identified the animals that were were were intact as being the decorticate ones and he said why and they said because the other ones are more lively in other words in reality the decorticate rodents are more lively they're more emotionally expressive that's because they don't have the cortical modulation of the but now we're talking about rodents and and dogs and what more what about human beings if the cortex was the seat of consciousness then there's a easy prediction which is that you know just we don't do neonatal decortication in human beings but sadly they are neonates who are born with no cortex and this is a condition known as hydrogen and cephalin and the prediction would be if the cortex was the seat of consciousness that these kids should be in a coma they got no cortex and at the very least they should be in a in a persistent vegetative state but that's not what you observe they are not vegetative you know the vegetative state is also called non-responsive wakefulness non-responsive wakefulness these kids are utterly responsive they and just as I described for the for the animal studies they are responsive they are emotionally responsive in situationally appropriate ways in other words you tickle the child she laughs you frustrate the child she arches her back and complains you give the child a fright and she startles and and they show behavioral initiative they they approach things that they like and they avoid things that they don't like you know anybody who has anybody who has studied these children seriously you know they they come to this conclusion and people philosophers you know who are all skeptical about this I really invite them to just interact with these kids you know it's it's just it's it's it's very very difficult to sustain the argument so so I was saying it's it's very hard to sustain the argument that these kids are not conscious if you actually interact with them but you know it is ultimately because of the problem of other minds it's ultimately a matter of of inference and what my colleagues say I mean when I say colleagues here I'm not only referring to philosophers there are many neuroscientists who who are very skeptical about the claim the claim by I hasten to add not only me you know a good many of us who actually have interacted with these kids find it very hard to believe that they're not conscious they are feeling creatures who behave in every way like feeling creatures the the argument that is made against this is we cannot know for sure that they are not just reflexes yes well remember what I said about reflexes at the beginning of our discussion you know in reflexes there's an entirely predictable response there's no variation there's no trial and error there's no intentionality you know this is not what you see in these kids it's also not what you see in the deco ticket animals so it's it's you know anyone who knows anything about how the reflexes of the nervous system work know that what you see here ain't reflexes or instincts you know they are not they are not reducible I mean they are dominated by instincts that's true these kids are you know they are not like you and me but they show they show goal directed intentional purpose of and voluntary behavior and if you read the the descriptions by the pediatric neurologists who studied these kids and the neuroscientists who studied these kids you see you know the detailed evidence for that but you can't be sure say my colleagues so let me just hasten to add you can't be sure that your pet dog is conscious you can't be sure that your pet cat is conscious you can't be sure that anyone other than you yourself are conscious and then the argument is given well reportability gets us out of that problem you know it's true that our dogs and cats can't report their conscious state so there's room for skepticism there you know but Tevin Naidu and Mark Solms can say there's something it is like to be me let me tell you what I'm experiencing right now I'm experiencing x y and z I don't know why that's considered such wonderful evidence you know because a robot can do that a robot can report its states you know you can write a very simple program just say you know whenever you're in this that or the other mode say I'm experiencing it but how do you know it really is experiencing so I don't think reportability is I mean by the way on the reportability thing we're saying not only that our dogs and cats aren't conscious we're saying that our preverbal kids aren't conscious humans you know exactly so we need better we need we need better ways of deciding the question when you go on the internet and you're trying to access something and it wants to know that you're not a robot it doesn't say please tell me please declare you're not a robot you know it gives you an ambiguous situation a problem and you have to navigate some uncertainty there and solve the problem you know why why why is that the case what if declaring your states you know was was such a wonderful method for determining that does seem to be the case sorry did you want to add to that before well sadly I have a lot to add to it so let me rather let you get a word in eduism then I'll carry on no you can continue I'm enjoying listening so that's why so what I do what I say to my colleagues is okay well let's take you know you guys don't claim that the whole of cortex is the seat of consciousness the the the general view is you know that there's all this information processing going on there which is then accessed by some sort of overarching global workspace or or something of the kind and where is this thing located well the standard argument is prefrontal cortex the the other well known or widely held position which is I think probably a better one is that it's insular cortex I why say better because insular cortex has to do with feelings which I've already told you is the basic in my view form of consciousness but if the prefrontal cortex were and many people say this I mean my dear colleague and friend Joe the dude says that that all of this stuff you know he's an expert on sub cortical affective circuitry specifically fear circuitry and and specifically the amygdala and he says all of that stuff going on the amygdala is unconscious until it is until it is read out by the cortex literally he uses the word label you know in other words until you use until you can have this concept I am feeling fear you're not feeling fear so so what happens if you remove again we don't do it experimentally but it happens in nature that they are patients with no prefrontal cortex in fact I'll tell you it's not unusual to have patients with large prefrontal cortical lesions on Joe the dude's view they should be less affective they should be less emotional consciousness but there's more I mean since since Phineas gauge we've learned frontal patients have too much emotion but I have a patient case W who has no prefrontal cortex whatsoever and he not only is he like all such patients or frontal patients you know he's a hyper emotional he's very overwhelmed by his feelings not only that but you know he he answers questions that I put to him about what is it like to be you I asked him to imagine a scene in his mind which had to do with I said imagine you have two dogs and one chicken can you picture them he says yes I said now tell me can you count their legs and tell me what the total number of legs are and the answer of course is 10 two dogs and one chicken so to my great disappointment because I was trying to prove is there's somebody home you know he's there with mental imagery and he can and he can experience it to my great disappointment he said eight the answer was eight I said eight he said yes the dogs ate the chicken so you know no prefrontal cortex there's a sentient being there and Domazio reported a case patient B who had absolutely no insular cortex and the same thing Domazio interviewed him about you know and the patient keeps on referring to me and I and I yes of course I have a mind and yes I'm experiencing this and and Domazio's patient also had heightened affective feelings not a reduction in affect which is what but Craig's theory but Craig is the guy who said you know the insular is the is the is the seat of the fundamental form of consciousness feeling well Domazio showed that with no insular cortex you still have feeling I showed with no prefrontal cortex you still have feeling and you have sentient being reportable conscious states so then my colleagues say well it's due to the remaining cortex so you see I can't win because they say the case with no cortex they can't declare their states so therefore we don't know so I say careful let's take this with no prefrontal cortex they say well maybe it's posterior cortex take one with no posterior cortex well maybe it's anterior cortex so that's now I'm near the end of my argument which is that so let's look at other methods other than lesion methods so if if the feelings are actually generated in the subcortical structures I mean literally in in other words they're not being read out by cortex because everybody knows of course these affective mechanisms are subcortical but the idea is they're not conscious until they read out by cortex so if that were the case then if you if you take for example positron emission tomographic images of human beings who are in intense affective states which they can report so they say I am feeling really sad you know I am feeling absolutely joyous I am feeling trepidatiously fearful or I am feeling really angry each of those four states and I'm not just saying I am feeling I mean people who who really are in the grip of intense affects if you scan them with pet imaging what is the prediction if it's if it's the if it's the brain stem and the and this limbic circuitry arising from it that is responsible for those effects then that's where you should see the highest rate of metabolic activity that's that's what we that that seems to be an acceptable method for everything else in neuroscience so you know so yeah we're saying well if the if the greatest if the if the hot spots are in the brain stem then that's where the state is being generated and that's exactly what you find if you if you image people in intense affective states you see intense arousal of brain upper brain stem structures and the circuits the olympic circuitry but not cortex you know now what about another method so in other words the prediction is confirmed yes now what about another method deep brain stimulation the the prediction is if the if the affects are generated in the brain stem you know then if you generate if you stimulate those structures that you are saying are generating the affects in other words reticular activating system the prediction is you will stimulate you will generate artificially an intense affect and and conversely you won't if you stimulate cortex and that's what happens you know you stimulate cortex you get just about no affects and when you do it's they really thought they're not affects they kind of like you know i'm remembering this time that i was a bit down you know but you stimulate this when i speak about a bit down stimulate substantia nigra you produce within five seconds depression clinical depression like suicidal depression you know and and you switch off the stimulator 90 seconds later the person is out of the depression and i'm talking about reticular activating system but it's not only reticular activating system it's periaqueductal gray periaqueductal gray which is which is in the mid-brain there's a greater variety of affects generated by stimulating the periaqueductal gray than any other brain structure and the greater intensity of affect and so that's a third method so the lesion method you know you add it to the functional imaging method you add it to the to the deep brain stimulation method then there's also pharmacological probes you know if you it's no accident that the major psychiatric drugs the the the psychopharmacological agents that form the mainstay of of clinical practice these days they are like like antidepressants SSRIs what are they doing they are increasing serotonin where is serotonin sourced it's it's it's sourced in the reticular activating system in the rife nuclei where is where is dopamine you know antipsychotics block dopamine where's that sourced apart from the substantia nigra which i mentioned earlier the type that's important for psychosis is sourced in the ventral tegmental area which is part of the reticular active aging system noradrenaline is sourced in the locus cirrhulius complex you know you you modulate noradrenaline or you you you block noradrenaline to block anxiety so if these nuclei you know are are the targets or at least the the the the the source cells of the neurons that the cell bodies of the neurons that are targeted by all of these psychopharmacological agents but they they're all in the reticular activating system this tells us something you know so so i'm saying i'm sorry i'm speaking so much devon let me just come back to my to my main argument which is that it's not when people say moxons is going too far to say well you know these brainstem structures and simple effects are the model example of consciousness i told you in principle why i think effects are the right model example and then i said and empirically you know the you look at all of the evidence all of the evidence speaks to speaks for the conclusion that actually effects are generated there where in the part of the brain that we've known since 1949 is the is the basic prerequisite for all other forms of consciousness the only problem is in when magoon and maruzzi discovered that and nobody disputes it that it is prerequisite you can't have a conscious cortex unless it's activated by the reticular activating system yes but when they discovered that they said yes but the reticular activating system produces around produces what did they call it the level of consciousness yes a quantitative sort of like volume of consciousness but it hasn't got any phenomenal content and that's what i've just shown you isn't true you know it has phenomenal content the content i grant you is not cognitive but it is effective there's a there's something it is like to be in those states that i've just described therefore they are they are qualitative states they're not just quantitative states and they have content the content is you know the the the feeling of pain versus the feeling of hunger versus the feeling of sleepiness those that's that's the content that's what those states are about so if if the upper brain stem was was only about some quantitative dimension the level of consciousness it would only be of interest to an anesthetist yes but it's the characteristics of tinkering with those with those circuits so yes so there you have it in essence the youth i mean we've used this clinical differentiation between contents of consciousness versus a level of consciousness but you're clearly showing that in essence they're both very much linked i mean they're they're one in the same in a sense with whether you're whether your level of consciousness is slightly lower in terms of less the gcs scale doesn't necessarily mean that the person doesn't have effective qualitative experiences exactly so i find it's a very it's a totally artificial distinction there is no such thing as i mean how can you how can you have blank consciousness you know it's what is such a what is a blank consciousness so you know you can't be conscious without being conscious of something i mean we've known that since Brent Arno you know it's uh so i think that that's distinction drawn by Maguna and Maruti uh all those decades ago was because they were so completely flabbergasted by the finding which remember they weren't in any way expecting that if you disconnect the cat cortex from the cat reticular activating system there is no more conscious cat you know the the the the the the the the cortical consciousness cannot just just disappears without without reticular arousal and so it was a way because everybody knew that the cortex was the seat of consciousness they had to explain this somehow and so they came up with this totally artificial distinction between um this this waking state which is contentless um and you know and then the phenomenal qualities and and contents of that the cortex had i mean but that's what i like about your book as well is that you you do do that you show different methods of how you can prove this and predict what your theory claims that well because ideally that's what we want in the scientific theory of of anything you want so you want different ways of proving the same thing which is what you've basically shown in many ways what i find very fascinating mark is that others neuroscientists like let's say for example michael graziano he also pays a lot of attention to the tectum optic tectum which which we call the superior coliculus but then natural completely different conclusions they regarding i mean he uses this as the attention schema theory where we're building models of attention but we're not really um aware in the sense that we have qualia we rather introspectively conclude that we have this so i still find it quite fascinating that some people are using similar brain regions and brain structures and drawing different conclusions what are your thoughts on that yeah but but but let me clarify there um i am not uh i don't i don't disagree with that the the the the optic tectum or or or superior coliculi they they are they are receiving information from the sensory end organs sensory motor end organs but that doesn't mean that that information is conscious i mean the famous example is blindsight with with the cortically blind cases who nevertheless can navigate an obstacle course they are completely unaware that they're seeing anything and yet they can avoid things that are in their way and the the the the most widely accepted explanation for that is it's because the the the optic tectum is is is processing the information unconsciously i'm fine with that it's unconscious and and and it also receives auditory information and somatosensory information and so on um and uh the so these kids for example the the the the hydranin cephalic kids uh i the the reason they're able to respond to their environments is because they're receiving information about the environment from their sensory epithelium and but it is unconscious then they it evokes a feeling in them uh all they know all they experience on the evidence available to me it leads me to the conclusion that they i i don't think i can claim that they experience anything more than just a feeling they don't have to know what the feeling is about where it came from what made me feel this what is the thing out there in the world it it it's not necessary so i'm saying because remember the the the superior curriculae well well the the the whole of the tectum the superior and inferior curriculae the whole of the tectum uh is is absolutely adjacent to the periaqueductal gray so all of the well not smell but all of the other senses of projecting unconscious visual auditory somatosensory information to the to the tectum uh and that in turn uh is is coupled with uh all of the homeostatic mechanisms that we've mentioned at the beginning of our discussion all of the homeostatic mechanisms the affect mechanisms including the emotions because they are bodily affects and their emotional affects they all send their residual error signals to the periaqueductal gray immediately adjacent to the tectum so so it's it's something like it's something like you know where things where things stand now in the outside world which is not consciously registered uh and where things stand now uh from the from the endogenous perspective of the organism and and then uh the feeling is about those things but the feeling is all that the that that the creature experiences you then need higher uh structures and the thalamocortical structures make it possible for that feeling to be applied to a stabilized grip because the tectum is just like a sort of salience map it's an attentional I agree with that description of it but the cortex has the stabilized detailed mappings uh of it's not only that they detailed mappings of the outside world filtered through a lifetime of experience of it because cortex is memories memory space but it's also that it can be held in mind in working memories so you can actually you know okay I feel like this about that so what am I going to do about it you know that's that's what the cortical consciousness adds and and and and perhaps even more important than that is that you can then manipulate those representations virtually in other words you can you don't only have to feel your way through the world here and now by trial and error bearing in mind that trial and error involves errors which are which are costly so so thinking where you have virtual representations of if I were to do that what would happen and if I were to do the other thing what would happen then and feeling you feel your way through these virtuals and all of this is what cortex adds um and uh I keep on saying I'm very grateful to have that and I recognize that that is a way more complex form of consciousness than the elementary form but for all the reasons I've already said I think that the elementary form nevertheless is the right place to start and the elementary form nevertheless qualifies as consciousness defined as there being something it is like to have it what what I really like is that at some point I mean when you're talking about homeostasis you're talking about how we're trying to figure this out and quantify a lot of these qualitative experiences you that your work then somehow links with a lot of Karl Frister's work and I mean Karl Frister is definitely one of the like most I mean he's the most cited neuroscientist on the planet I think um and your work seems to coincide quite well do you want to touch on that because I find that very intriguing the way you guys have linked up I read the paper that you guys did together as well and I even used a part of my dissertation that you were very generous to help me with uh but yeah let's touch on that a bit so I said earlier that uh I'm a dual aspect monist in other words I think we have two different ways of observing uh the the the mental instrument um you can look at it from the outside as as an organ uh you can look at it from the inside as as a as a phenomenal state of mind but these two things are reducible to one causal mechanism and that is something you infer from the data of of of observation and and I said that if you if you accept that the elementary form of consciousness is feeling and that feeling is an extended form of homeostasis then you have a rather simple mechanism you know you have a you have a good place a tractable place to start because homeostasis is not difficult to understand and so Karl Friston published a paper in 2013 in one of the journals of the royal society it's called royal society interface and the paper was titled life as we know it and in which is a wonderful title and and in that paper he basically explicated uh in in in ordinary you know physical uh terms how by which I mean by which I mean you know physical mechanics how how does how does homeostasis work um and so I said to him on upon reading that paper you know the the the mechanism of of homeostasis which you so beautifully uh you know reduced to equations in in uh in that paper if if consciousness is an extended form of homeostasis and by the way all those brains then nuclear are not all of them but I mean the the fundamental homeostasis of the of the human body are are are you know sort of like hypothalamus and midbrain and I said it should be possible to extend then these these mechanistic accounts that you provide of homeostasis count of feeling so that's what the paper that I wrote with him was about um so that's background uh to move a little bit further forward so as everyone knows so I'm not going to go into this chapter inverse Friston has has the flag that he's tied to his mast is the free energy principle which is which is basically a statement of the the that self-organizing systems systems which persist which continue to exist they have to do something to continue to exist that this is this is what distinguishes I'm not saying all self-organizing systems are living systems but what what but all living systems are self-organizing systems and what distinguishes living systems from non-living ones is that they oppose the second law of thermodynamics in other words they don't just dissipate they have they have they have preferred states and they work to stay in those states and that's how they stay alive you know in the end the second law wins we don't stay alive forever but you know the whole the essential feature of living systems is that they are acting on their environments in such a way as to increase their chances of carrying on existing as systems so the free energy principle is just a formalist a formal understanding of the mechanisms whereby that work how self-organizing systems a resist entropy and by the way when I said not all self-organizing systems are living systems that's a good thing because living systems evolve from non-living systems you know so the fact that we can have a physics that explains the this basic tycov system which then became the living system is a necessary thing you know we have to be able to explain life in terms of things that were around before life came into existence and by the way the same applies to consciousness we must be able to be conscious life evolved long before consciousness evolved so you know there must be something it must have it must have been constructed out of ingredients that were already there and I'm saying self-organizing systems provide us with those ingredients so the free energy principle explains that how self-organizing it formalizes the mechanisms whereby self-organizing systems in order to continue to exist they have to minimize their free energy which is basically the same thing as to say they have to have a model of the world because how else can you act in that world to to to maximize your chances of surviving so it's a predictive model it's a model that if I were to do that in the world this would be the sensory consequences that's how I maintain homeostasis say if my sensory state is I'm moving out of my homeostatic bounds I'm getting too hot I'm getting too thirsty then I must do that I must get out of the kitchen or I must drink some water you know that will bring me back into my viable bounds so that's the basic and and the free energy principle says to the extent that what you predicted will happen in consequence of your actions to the extent that it does not happen that's called surprise all average surprise all basically is free energy in other words you must be using your energy you must bind your energy into actions which lead to the outcomes that you require in order to survive free energy in other words energy that is not being efficiently used must therefore be minimized in other words the gap between you what you what you expect to flow from your actions and what actually flows from your actions that gap must be minimized so that's the whole of Friston's work basically just boils down to that I mean I don't want to diminish it it's absolutely genius you know but that principle explains homeostasis and it explains the goal directed behavior is the allostatic imperative you know in order to maintain within my homeostatic remain within my homeostatic bounds I have to do things in the outside world and I have to have a good understanding of how the outside world works in order for me to know what things to do and while I'm busy learning that I make lots of mistakes and I slowly improve my predictive model in order to minimize those mistakes that's what the whole of cognition is for and what is cognition therefore doing it is it is serving the the the the free energy principle in other words it's minimizing homeostatic errors it means that is in other words it is it is reversing negative effects and turning them into positive effects that's so affect which is the demand for mental work is a demand for predictive work and the predictive work is what our cognition is all about so I've given you a very broad brush stroke sketch there but that's what we worked out together in that in that first paper that we wrote together which I then expanded into my book it's showing that you know I said I don't believe that we've solved the hard problem but I believe we've given a good clue as to which direction we should be going in that is a monistic account it's a it's a it's a tractable quantifiable statistical mechanical account of the the the machinery of the mind and brain which is an information processing machinery in the service of minimizing free energy in order to maintain the organisms within their viable bounds so that they can survive that's it so some more I mean like you're taking a physicalist monist account of this what are your thoughts and then other theories of consciousness in terms of philosophical theories let's take panpsychism for example or idealism what are your thoughts on those types of theories I think panpsychism is a little easier to deal with than idealism so let's start with the problem of other minds which is the big problem when it comes to consciousness science it really is the because conscious states just are subjective states you can only ever know your own so we start there this this this might be considered a really simplistic argument against panpsychism but it's the one that I start with I can't know whether computers are conscious and tables are conscious and walls are conscious and rocks are conscious you know I do know I'm conscious so now am I conscious of everything that's going on inside of me no I'm only conscious of things that are going inside of my brain my brain the brain states are only the conscious of other bodily states to the extent that those other bodily organs are represented in the brain so so the brain and this this is not just a commonsensical argument it's an empirical demonstrable fact you never lose consciousness by removing any part of the body other than removing the brain if you lose consciousness by removing the heart it's because the heart is no longer perfusing the brain you know etc so it's like clearly the case that consciousness is in the brain and so you know all of the other bodily processes are not conscious I empirically I can tell you that in my own case you know there's the only way I get to know about and there's a hell of a lot of processes which never become conscious like blood pressure regulation for example you know it's going on all the time thank god for that but you know there's no conscious why is there no consciousness involved in that by the way it's because it's entirely predictable you can't leave that to reflexes you know there's there's there's no novel situations there that you have to feel your way through so panpsychism if you take if you take as your starting point well you know the only thing I can know empirically is what I am conscious of well I know even in my own case there's a hell of a lot going on within the outer surface of this thing called Mark's arms that Mark's arms is not conscious of so you could start then saying well of course it is possible that your muscles are conscious of themselves and they're not reporting it to you and then you know then you should start getting into into Never Never Land because yeah that's possible I mean anything's possible it's possible you know that you know that that pigs can fly but I've never seen one you know and so you know that's my argument against panpsychism now I'll take that's a very simplistic argument because it's and I start with that one because it's an empirical one it's the only empirical one because you have to start in your own case even within the brain Tevin there's a hell of a lot of brain activity brain structures which the activity of which we never become conscious of you know so so consciousness seems to be something quite special limited to very particular kinds of structures and so you know then I that's another argument another way of tackling the problem of panpsychism is you say well let's look at the mechanism what these parts of the brain that we know are generating conscious states like these homeostatic brain stem mechanisms let's look at what you know what they're doing there's a very particular kind of functionality there a very specific mechanism which is not you know you don't find it in everything there are many things which exist which are not displaying active inference in other words they're not trying to model their environments in order to in order to persist and you know if that is the mechanism of the one and only knowable form of consciousness which is ours you know we we know that the the brain stem mechanisms that generate our consciousness they seem to be doing this kind of thing we can then look to every other creature that has similar mechanisms which by the way is all vertebrates and we can make testable predictions we can say I predict if I stimulate dorsal periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish you know it it won't like it it will avoid the stimulus if I stimulate the the ventral periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish it will like it and it will approach the stimulus and the prediction is confirmed so you know that's that's that's and that happens every time in every creature that has the same architecture as us that we know generates affective basic feeling states in us all the evidence suggests that they're doing the same thing in these other creatures and also that they can make choices you know the the behavior of the animals is consistent with our understanding and then there are other creatures which don't have the same architecture like cephalopods and insects and so on there I'm less sure that they're conscious you know I'm not saying they're not I'm just less sure and I I use the criterion of well can they make choices can they feel their way through a novel situation and survive it and they can so you know well possibly they're conscious too but there are many creatures simple simpler creatures like bacteria whose behavior is completely predictable there's you see no new ideas coming from a bacterium you know the only way that they that they advance is is through over generations through through natural selection you there's there's no there's no new problem solving you know so I'm saying that even in living things Tevin starting with myself there lots of my own bodily processes that I know from my own case are not conscious and then I know which parts are generative of consciousness I know what those do roughly speaking I know what their functionality is when I test in other animals the prediction arising from the the the inference that those structures and that mechanism is what gives rise to two feelings the predictions are always confirmed where those are not present in living creatures that those structures and those functions the prediction again is always confirmed that they don't show the functionality that that seems to underpin consciousness in us then you know that's so so compelling but then you know to go from that to non-living things I mean to claim that non-living things are conscious it's you just outside of the not only the bounds of testability you're outside of the bounds of reasonableness just like why would you say that and you know starting from the observables that's where that's the conclusion you just have to arrive at if you start from first principles and you say well it's possible that there's something it is like to be anything then well yeah it's possible but anything's possible I don't see any reason why one would hold that view unless one starts from the assumption that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe which I have to say is not not not different from the idea of God yeah that at the time of the Big Bang there was a consciousness maybe but that's outside of science you know to those kinds of claims that if you think about it that's something that people like Julia Tononi and Christoph Koch have done fundamentally taking consciousness as phi they can't get as far as fundamental and doing a lot of but I think they did it in a different way so so like let's take Tononi's case as you've just said the the the idea that consciousness can be can be can be objectified as as a quantity of of integrated information processing if you hold that theory then it leads you down some some rabbit holes that you then have to go down you know because if you say well okay the amount of integration in the information processing is what determines the degree of consciousness then you have to say well there's no there's no you know as long as there's any amount of information processing there must be some degree of consciousness and conversely you have to say anything that has the requisite you know number must be conscious therefore any highly integrated information processing system like the internet you know my theory with me if I'm Tononi my theory requires me to say yep the internet's conscious yes so fundamentally information at this point which is how a lot of people are seeing it then in essence everything has a level of fire yes everything has that you know what's what's what's a curious little historical fact is that charmers you know I'll tell you something else which is another curious fact many people who bang on about the hard problem of consciousness have never read charmers' paper you know if you actually read charmers' paper there's this thing that I'm going to tell you now there's another thing which I'll tell you as an aside at the end of the paper charmers says the hard problem is hard but there's no reason to believe that it will forever remain insoluble and he then you know so he's saying it is soluble and and and he even goes so far as to then present a possible solution and this is the thing I was going to say his possible solution is that all information has a subjective aspect and that is consciousness and it has an objective aspect which is this mechanistic thing that we see you know it depends what kind of substrate you're using but like our computers there they are they're processing information but the being of the computer says charmers you know because it's an information processing device that there is some small amount of consciousness associated with it because the internal aspect of information is consciousness therefore because information processing has been going on since forever consciousness has been around since forever and it's a fundamental property of the universe so I don't want to lose sight of the aside I've made there please note charmers says the hard problem can be solved he said it himself in 1995 so all these people who revere this problem has been completely insoluble that it's a metaphysical problem which can never be solved by physical science that's not what charmers said but he then proposes his own theory which is a panpsychist theory which is when it's something approaching a panpsychist theory he doesn't say everything is conscious he says all information is conscious which is a which is a reasonable place to start because what we know about the brain and the mind what they have in common is that they're processing information you know and not everything in the universe is processing information so you know that's why it's approaches or heads in the direction of but now here's the rub for me if you read so information in Shannon's sense which is the sense in which charmers uses the word he actually says so in that paper so Shannon's paper which brought information into the concept of information into into physics into the idea that there's a quantifiable thing called information and that it has causal property does stuff you know in the physical world that for that realization and conceptualization of it we have to thank Claude Shannon and you read his paper which was published in if I remember correctly 1948 it's called the title says it all it says a mathematical theory of communication it's not a theory of information it's a theory of communication because why information has to have a source and a receiver it's information doesn't just exist information something is only informative to a receiver of that information so information and I'm speaking pure Shannon here information is an answer to a question you know it's is is the coin toss heads or tails you know is it heads yes or no that's one or zero you know that is the binary digit that is the bit that is the quantum how we quantify information so how many questions I have to ask determines how much information I receive from from my interaction with with my environment so this information exchange is a question asking and answering exercise and the crucial point is that the information is subjective it's received by me who asked the question the the the system doesn't and a system doesn't contain an objective amount of information it depends on what question you're asking of the system so you know so the the very same I mean if for example there's a bag of of balls and we you and I both know that the yellow red and blue ones in there and we know that they're 30 balls I know that 10 of them are red you don't know that that that bag contains more information for you than it does for me you know so it depends on it depends on how so information is a measure of of uncertainty the more the more unpredictable is the outcome of an event the more information that carries for the observer of the event and you and I might have more or less prior knowledge so that will be more or less predictable or unpredictable to us so so the why this is also important is that when you speak about information whether you're charmers or you to know me you have to ask yourself the question of well who is the recipient of this information and so you're back to the question of well where's the subject with like in the internet where's the subject or the conscious subject of all of this information processing it's integrated you know for what it's so it's just like a very weird way of thinking about I think to say that information in and of itself you know is is or the integration of that information in some objective arms length sense you know is is the mechanism of consciousness I think misses the point so so my way of thinking about it which I tried in a very brief and rough and ready way a few minutes ago when I spoke about Carl Friston and my work on this problem our starting point was well an infam a self-organizing system which has to predict the behavior of the world has to ask questions of the world you know is if I were to do this what would happen kind if I were to do this what would happen to my free energy is basically the question that every every biological self-organizing system has to constantly ask so the information processing that gives rise to feeling in my view is that kind of information it's not all information it's infam it's it's it's it's it's it's it's the answering of questions by systems that give a damn about that they need to ask questions and they give a damn about the answers that is I think the kind of system that is the information processing within which can can can can can feasibly or plausibly rather be be conceptualized as a as a sentient system I must like for example mark on when I came into this podcast so when I first started thinking about consciousness I'm very much on a similar page as you I think I think we're both very monist physicalist we're trying to reduce it trying to figure out a nice biological approach to it but I must say someone who came very close to really changing that my mind on that a little bit was Donald Hoffman I don't know if you're familiar with his work yes I'm not in detail but yes I know the basic ideas yeah so it's pretty fascinating to see that a lot of physicists nowadays are starting to show that space time itself is not a concept that we can actually understand or really even perceive in any real way and and therefore well now when he takes it further by obviously making the his own conclusion that conscious agents must be fundamental so that's a separate story but what is a bit strange is the fact that physicists are not showing us that the reality that we're trying to reduce is not a reality that is possibly reducible because we see we have absolutely no access to this reality what do you think about that well um so if you if you you or any of our viewers read my book in in in the penultimate chapter it's titled back to the cortex and there I speak about so the most of the book is about effort it's about you know this fundamental form of consciousness and how it is generated and what that what the implication oh sorry it's not the penultimate chapter it's the third last chapter the second last chapter is on charmers and the hard problem the last chapter is on artificial consciousness the third last chapter is on this this this this question of of cognitive and perceptual consciousness you know the the type of consciousness that that we have for for the most part focused on and there I make the argument which is again not not a a novel argument it's it's very similar to Hoffman's although I don't cite him because actually I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't yet know his work at the time that I was writing that book but I was aware of other people in the predictive processing tradition you know like like Andy Clark and and and and Jacob Huey uh speaking about you know perception as controlled hallucination and that you know the the reality and and Dan Dennett uh you know the this whole thing of the the use illusion and so on and I find yeah and Neil Seth I mean that whole group of him and Neil Seth is in that same tradition and Neil Seth extends it from the extra receptive domain to the inter receptive domain in very interesting ways um actually if we have time I will come back to that because I think that the that that that affect is not the same as interception you know I I have a little a little quibble about that but I don't think it's important for our present purposes so what I'm saying is that in that tradition with although Hoffman doesn't come up from a predictive processing background I think it's it's it's it's entirely compatible you know the idea that the reality that we are that we are acting in is a representation of the of of something in my language beyond the mark of blankets all I can know is my blanket states and that that is a that is a statistical generative model you know of of of the of reality minutes you could even say can't it's a cantium view you know I have no problem with that whatsoever so but you know I don't think it's a and is anything spooky about that and and I don't think that it requires us I mean all you need to say is the retina the retinal ronson cones light waves impinge on the retina and the those cells transduced those light waves into nerve impulses so what we um you know you never actually are you're not that you're not receiving light waves you are representing them as spike trains you know that that's enough for me it can see there's nothing spooky there you know and those spike trains all they are are ones and zeros so from that I then have to infer the the the the causes of these of these sensations in other words of these signals and I and I model it you know I'm perfectly fine with that so I but but you know I don't see why that leads to all kinds of spooky conclusions that's that's there are few steps beyond that that I don't think follow when I spoke to Donald when I asked him about it because I mean a lot of us in biology in neuroscience we know that we don't see reality every radical sort of truth we sort of represent something but his physics and his work with a couple other mathematicians show that spacetime is fundamentally completely different so we're not even seeing a mild representation or like something similar to reality or close it's completely different but he does eventually say that however his conclusion that consciousness must be fundamental is something he's willing to accept might be wrong he's just trying to figure out a different solution so he actually doesn't take it to that point where he he claims that consciousness is fundamental he's just trying to find some relative because reality is the problem in essence we don't we know a lot about mind but we know almost nothing about matter pretty much yeah I wouldn't but by the way as you can see my lights came on so so hallelujah the the load shedding has ended for I hope my doesn't see what happens yes let's hope there's not a reciprocal interaction between where you are and where I am but look there's there's much that I could say about about quantum physics and that the seriously strange nature of reality and how utterly different it is from the from the high level average states that we are able to represent and so on you know that and those things all interest me very much I I will just say about that that the the the approach that Carl Friston and I take which is the free energy principle approach it's called variational free energy this is this is you know there's there's thermodynamic free energy and there's chemical free energy and then there's informational free energy and and some people no less than chains for example thinks the informational free energy is is the fundamental explanation of the thing the all of those are probabilistic it's a probabilistic theory the variational free energy has to do with statistical mechanics it has to do with probabilities when I was speaking earlier about you know your uncertainty and the palpating of your uncertainty and all of that we're talking about probabilities and so I think that there's a very deep link is that there's a I think that the the whole free energy principle inherits from the traditions that that have replaced Newtonian physics so there's there's that in all of that interests me very much but I in the time remaining to us I would rather because I'm aware we have limited time remaining I would rather start with this observation which is which is more concrete you know I'm a clinician I work with neurological and neurosurgical patients every day and so I witness you know what happens if a piece of your brain is missing and I've been around for a sufficient number of years to have seen many many many patients with the same piece of their brain missing and the curious or the interesting fact is that they all misperceive reality in the same way you know that that's for example an excellent example is right parietal low patients who they paralyzed on the left side and they believe they're not and it's patently obvious that they are you know but they say no I'm not and so you know you see one and another and another and eventually you realize hang you know if you haven't got a right parietal low you just there's a piece of reality that you just don't get and never can get why because you've got a piece of your brain missing that you need in order to be able to get that so you can from that observation you can you can extrapolate that well all of us have a piece of our brains missing in the sense that you know we we only have this what if we were to all have an additional lobe or an additional hemisphere how much more would we be able to to register and compute and comprehend you know than we currently do so so all I'm saying there is that I again on the basis of my own empirical clinical experience you know I'm totally ready to believe that we have a horribly limited conception and perception of reality I'm totally sympathetic with that however you know we are where we are so you can either say okay I'm going to become a mystic you know because I don't do anything I'm just going to believe everything or you know it's all you all you say well you know given given the limited nature of my instrument you know I must do the best I can to to to expand its bounds to test my hypotheses and you know be ready to find that my predictions were wrong and I must update my predictive model and so on I didn't see what else we can do I so so so although I am totally aware of the limits of the of the human brain it's just obvious from what I've just said and of the limits of science because it's a method it's a it's a method ultimately you have to have we were talking about idealism and never got back to it but you know ultimately you have to have faith and I use that word advisedly that there is some reality beyond what I'm perceiving that I'm probing and that you know I that I that the the the inferences that I draw and the models that I build each time are less bad you know that that I that they they they of course they're not reality of course they are a pathetic you know scrap of what we are capable of grasping of the nature of the universe really but it's but we're making progress each of us in our own lives and as a species over generations we have less bad models less less bad understandings and but it is all based on faith you know that that this method is a reasonable way of of proceeding um it is a matter you know you rarely can say well because it's so limited because it's so so um unknowable reality in itself and all of that I'm just going to give up that that's another approach that but I would rather take the scientific approach I just think we need to have humility as scientists and recognize how how little we know but the very physics that Hoffman um um sites as evidence for how little we know is the product of that method you know that it has led us to know that reality is weird and it is very different from from how we perceive it but but you know Hoffman couldn't have couldn't have come to that view if it wasn't for the application of the scientific method to arrive at that physics in the first place when Hoffman when Hoffman so apparently he did the calculations and he and he asked like what are the probabilities of that our perception of reality would give us an accurate representation of reality based on natural selection and fitness and actually evolving and surviving and when you when you when you notice that the probability came to zero apparently had to take a seat because he's very much a scientist and he loves the scientific method natural selection all of it so you're here to take a seat because it like messed him up with his fundamental perception of reality because he was very much materialistic thinker in terms of consciousness and so it's on that note if what are you you spoke about faith there Mark I mean part of this podcast also is for the people questioning these big topics often are trying to also find meaning and purpose while not understanding what's really going on what are what are your religious or spiritual beliefs and first of all I want to come back one step in our conversation to this materialist the idea of materialist and mind versus matter and so on you know I to me mind and matter are the same as what I was saying earlier when I said that there's a there's a dual aspect to our monistic essence matter for me is an aspect in other words I don't think matter is a fundamental property I think matter is a way of representing things and and that's entirely consistent also with the the the the recent physics that we were talking about earlier matter is not a fundamental property of the universe and the the the the so I'm not a materialist this segues into your question now you know I I'm not a materialist I'm a dual aspect monist who says that the material and the ideal that these are two different ways of knowing of perceiving something which is ultimately unknowable and that's what you and I have just been talking about the limits of science the humility that scientists have to have in the face you know of the of the of the massive uncertainties in the universe so so my spiritual position arises from that in other words it's one of humility I'm sorry maybe you've got the impression of me as a kind of a pompous or noisy guy I don't know it might be hard for you to to equate my my personality with humility but it really it is as a scientist and as as a spiritual being my not only is it my belief that I even find solace in it Tevin I find solace in what I don't know think I what I know I don't know you know these things are way beyond my can questions like what happens after I die they're not empirical questions I can't any prediction I come up with I can't test it until I'm dead you know so so and I accept that and I say again I take I take comfort in it is there a god you know is there an afterlife what does it all mean you know I genuinely don't know and and and so it's a kind of an agnostic position but it is not a materialist and not an atheist position yes but but within that within those parameters and I'm sorry I'm sort of repeating myself I then have to say okay given those limitations what is to be done and I say well you've got to do the best you can with what you've got and so you know so the best I've been able to come up with is science you know I've read okay which of these things you know which of these things gives me the greatest confidence that well yeah I might find answers or at least I might find less ignorance that's that's the approach that that that I take and fully fully aware of the limits of the you know the limits of the conclusions that I can come to now within that frame of reference and this is probably be the last thing that we'll talk about I in other words using a scientific methodology a scientific epistemology to to try to address these questions I I think that our values you know I was talking much earlier in our conversation about the fundamental value system of living things is that it's good to survive and bad not to that that built upon those fundamental values or other also phenotypic values you know like it's like it's it's bad to be in danger that's fear you know it's it's it's irritating and frustrating to have an impeding things preventing you from that's that's rage you know that it's bad to separate a little dependent creature from its caregiver you know that that's got to do with attachment bonds and so on I think that these evolved endophenotypes is a word that's sometimes used for them that they are they are basic values that we have just because we're living things and that they are then more elaborated values that we have just because we are mammals and I think that these provide and you know it's famously said that you can't derive an orc from an is but I think that from these is is we can derive some orcs like I've just done bad to separate bad to bad to injure people or injure living things it's bad to it's bad to for sentient things rather it's bad to to separate mammals from their caregivers it's it's bad to to to you know unnecessarily frustrated and be sentient beings and so on I think that our much more elaborated human value systems which of course have evolved also to to to manage much more artificial environments for which we were not evolutionarily prepared like like like like you know agricultural and permanent settlements and and everything that flowed from that in a private property and all of that there's a lot more that's that the values that we've built on top of those phenotypic values but I think those phenotypic values and biological values are the starting point of all of our values all of our values they're not they're not the values of the universe they are our the values of us living things who have skin in the game I look I love that mark I mean look you didn't come across as pompous or arrogant in any way and neither does you I'm relieved I loved reading it I enjoyed it so much I mean there's something Raymond Tellis once said I like this term he says he's ontologically agnostic but I mean epistemologically we trust science the most is what what you're basically trying to say that's right that's right no Mark thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed myself thank you more words from your side well thank you very much and apologies again as you can see I've lost my this is uh this is how unpredictable and uncertain the world is yeah but I'm very glad to be speaking to you as a fellow South African and I'm glad that we are both here these are the problems that belong to me and I'm very happy to be grappling with them yeah and proud to know that that that that you're a South African your podcast is just great thanks
