0	15440	Mark, tell me, why is it that there is something it is like to be me?
15440	18480	Why is it that there is something it is like to be you?
18480	19440	How is this possible?
22080	24160	Well, there are two questions there.
24160	29600	The one is why there is something it is like to be me.
30160	34320	Or to be you, and the other is how is that possible?
35920	44560	The why question, I believe, has everything to do with the fact that the fundamental,
44560	50880	and I say fact, and I'll have to substantiate that later, but it has everything to do with the fact
50880	56960	that the fundamental form of consciousness is feeling, in other words, affect.
57840	67040	And affect arises from a monitoring of our homeostatic imperatives.
68240	76720	We living things have to remain within certain viable bounds, and simpler creatures have reflexive
77760	84320	mechanisms which maintain them within those bounds, but obviously reflexes have a limited
85280	92000	generalizability. There are many situations that living things find themselves in which are
92000	100880	unpredicted by their evolutionary past, and so they can't navigate uncertain or novel
101760	112240	situations, and so most of them expire in those situations, but a lucky few survive,
112240	118320	because they just happen by chance to do the right thing, and then they have progeny,
118320	123120	and so that contributes to the evolution of those reflexes.
124880	132800	There's therefore an enormous advantage, an enormous adaptive advantage for creatures to be
132800	139440	able to experience how they're doing. Is this going well or is this going badly?
142480	149040	When acting voluntarily, in other words, not reflexively, not automatically, they now can,
149040	156320	by trial and error, try different things out, and if it's going well, then they feel it.
157280	164720	This feels like a relief, and if things are going badly, the opposite applies,
164720	171120	and so they avoid what feels bad, and they approach what feels good, and in this way,
171120	176320	as I said a moment ago, they have the enormous advantage of being able to navigate
176640	186480	unknown, unpredicted, novel, uncertain situations, and then to learn from the experience during life
186480	194160	rather than for it to require generations of phylogenetic learning, in other words,
195360	200240	learning by natural selection, or rather adaptation by natural selection.
200960	209120	So, I believe I, with others, it's not my own idea. This is a building on the work,
209120	216400	first of all, of Jagdpanksepp, and secondly of Antonio de Marzio, and others. We believe
216400	221760	that that affects or an extent or feeling is an extended form of homeostasis.
222560	232720	There, you can see in what I've just said, there's an intrinsic value system. The value system of
233520	240000	all living things, the value system which simply underwrites the whole of evolutionary biology,
240000	250000	is that it is good to survive and bad not to. So, good feelings predict your likely survival,
250640	257440	and bad feelings predict your likely demise. So, that's the valence, as we call it,
257440	265360	the valence of affect, the unpleasant pleasure dimension. It is intrinsically valenced,
266480	272160	doing well and doing badly. In order to make choices, and remember that's what I'm speaking
272160	279440	about, the animal having now the capacity to make choices. In other words, to not behave compulsively
279520	285680	according to reflex. That capacity has to be rooted in a value system, because how else do
285680	290560	you make a choice? Something has to be better than something else. So, there has to be some
290560	295120	value system which determines what's good and what's bad, and that's what I've just
295120	304160	explicated. Now, on top of that, we have multiple needs. We complex creatures have multiple needs,
304160	307840	but actually, you don't need to be that complex a creature to have multiple needs,
308800	315680	like for example, to have energy balance needs, and thermoregulation needs,
316400	326240	and hydration needs, and oxygenation needs. There you have four, and each of these has to
326240	334160	be met in their own right. So, you can't reduce them to a common denominator. You can't say,
334160	344720	I have 8 out of 10 need for sleep, and a 2 out of 10 need for nutrition. Therefore, I have a 10
344720	350400	out of 20 total need, so all I need to do is sleep, and I'll reduce the number, and never eat.
351280	358080	You have to do them both. So, why I'm emphasizing that is that this is something in addition to
358080	364880	valence. We also have categories of need. So, valence is a continuous variable.
366880	372880	You can say from minus 50 to plus 50, that's the range of badness to goodness,
374000	382880	but the categorical variables that represent our different needs are by definition because
382960	387760	they're categorical variables. They are qualitatively distinguished from each other.
390640	398160	So, this is why feelings have both a goodness and a badness, and a particular quality, so that
398160	404720	sleepiness feels different from hunger, and from thirst, and from respiratory distress, and so on.
405120	412320	So, when you said why is there something that is like to be me or to be you,
413280	421360	I believe in the most basic form of consciousness, that's why. It enables us to know how we're doing,
421360	428480	to evaluate how we're doing, and it is necessarily qualified. In other words,
428480	438400	qualia arise from the fact that we have multiple such needs. Then there's the second step, which is
438400	444000	if I can, you know, obviously the simple creatures that first evolved, when I say simple, I don't want
444000	450560	to be derogatory, they're not that simple as I've been saying, but the first creatures that evolved
450560	458080	feeling, they weren't verbal, so they wouldn't have been able to say what I'm now going to say,
458080	464320	but it's as if their feelings say, I feel like this, you know, it tells you how you're doing,
464320	472720	and then secondarily, it's a matter of I feel like this about that, and so feeling gets extended onto
472720	478960	perception and cognition, so because you have to develop policies about what you're going to do,
479760	486880	and so affect is the fundamental form of consciousness, which then gets extended onto
486880	494400	cognitive and perceptual consciousness, which gives rise to the forms that dominate our
495040	503280	conscious experience, and because our capacity to plan and think about what we're going to do is so
503280	509840	highly developed. The second part of your question, you know, about how does this happen, well I've
509840	517280	partly described the mechanisms of how it happens, but if you're asking about the hard problem,
517280	524880	in other words, you know, how does physical, physiological processes of the kind that I've
524880	533440	just described, how do they turn into, how do they somehow transform into subjective experiences,
533440	536720	that's another story, so you'll have to tell me if you want me to go into that.
537520	543120	I think, look, okay, there's so much to touch on, I mean, first of all, I just want the listeners,
543120	547200	or for the viewers, we're both in South Africa, this is quite cool because it's the first time
547200	552400	I'm actually chatting to someone in the same time zone, we're both in Cape Town, and just for
552400	556320	everyone who's wondering why the screens are so dark on your side, it's because in South Africa,
556320	562720	we have what's called low chatting, our country just does not give us electricity every now and then,
562720	568320	so Mark's unfortunately on the one side of it right now, just for some context for the viewers,
568320	573520	but okay Mark, let's go to the hard problem, I mean, I've read The Hidden Spring, I mean,
573520	577520	I've read The Neuropsychology of Dreams, your writing is very fascinating, I like the way you're
577520	584240	sort of blending neuropsychology, neuropsychoanalysis into neurobiology and trying to link these
584240	590640	fields together, so you're definitely working at that interface between mind and body, so let's
590640	594960	discuss the hard problem, what are your thoughts on this hard problem of consciousness, is there a
594960	600000	problem, I mean this podcast is called Mind, Body, Problem, Solution, because the aim is to find a
600000	606320	solution to this problem, do you think we're able to find it using what your theory sort of claims?
608720	615520	Well, I don't claim to have solved the hard problem, but I do claim to have given us a
615520	623200	hint as to what direction we need to go in in order to be able to do so, so let me unpack
623760	631120	that story, I could do it in two ways, let me preface it with the first way and then I'll come
631120	638640	to the second way which I'll tell you in more detail, I think that the hard problem arose
639280	647280	because we focused on visual perception as our model example of consciousness, in fact I might
647280	652480	go further and say we focused on human visual perception as our model example of consciousness
654320	664880	and of course conscious vision has everything to do with cortex, so I might sort of you have to
664880	673680	start somewhere, so let's start with Francis Crick's famous book from 1994, it was called
675360	685040	The Astonishing Hypothesis and the subtitle was The Scientific Search for the Soul and there he
685840	695840	explicated a methodological program as to how we might go about sort of saving
696720	703040	the problem of consciousness from philosophy, rescuing it and bringing it into international
703040	710720	science and he proposed this concept of the neural correlate of consciousness, he said all we need to
710720	717840	do, consciousness is nothing special, it's just another biological function, all we need to do
717840	724000	is find the anatomical and physiological substrate of this function, in other words we need to identify
724000	731040	its neural correlate, we need to then once we've isolated that correlate we can start seeing okay
731040	737440	well how does this thing work because this must somehow explain why there's something it's like
737440	746640	to be you and me, it's a sort of reasonable commonsensical reductionist strategy but the
746640	756720	unfortunate choice as I just said is that he focused on human vision and I say it's unfortunate but
756720	763120	it's not difficult to understand why, I mean human consciousness is dominated by visual perception
763520	773840	and also more cortex is given over to visual perception than any other form and we understand
773840	781920	it rather well so it seemed like a reasonable place to start, why I think it was an unfortunate
781920	788480	place to start is first of all you shouldn't start with human beings the most complex form of
788480	802400	consciousness and you know cortex is many, this is more fundamental point, the function of visual
802400	810400	perception does not require consciousness, you can have visual perception without consciousness
810640	822400	so when the very next year after Crick's book was published came David Chalmers's famous paper
822400	828560	in the Journal of Consciousness Studies where he said well you know why doesn't all this information
828560	835760	processing go on in the dark and etc, I don't need to tell you what he said but I think it was a
835760	841360	reasonable question from Chalmers precisely because visual information processing can go on in the
841360	850400	dark so it is mysterious why do we why does it have to feel like anything at all, we know that
850400	857520	not only the superior curriculae can see unconsciously but you know the visual cortex can
857520	866080	see unconsciously and it can discriminate things like pretty elaborate things like color
866080	871920	you know you can you can discriminate color unconsciously so why does it have to be something
871920	880080	it is like to experience red versus blue if you can discriminate them without experience
880480	889680	now that I do not believe applies to feelings you can't have a feeling without feeling it
890480	897600	and I've just explained to you why we feel our feelings it is it is a it is a necessarily
898320	905600	subjective monitoring of my own state with existential consequences for me
906400	913760	and it has to have this goodness and badness has to have value and it has to have a categorical
914400	920320	qualitative differences so you know had we started there had we started with affects
920320	926560	which are not generated cortically and that's another big story they are generated they are
926560	933280	generated in the in the midbrain for the most part but certainly they are generated subcortically
933280	940560	in general had we started with those much more ancient much simpler structures
941280	947760	and I think that the hard problem would never really have arisen I think it's you know to say
947760	956080	why must you feel pain you know why must you feel hunger this is mysterious why don't you have
956080	962240	why don't you unconsciously navigate uncertainty and make choices of existential consequences
962240	967360	within qualitatively distinctive variables and it's just you know just is when you describe
967360	973920	that function you're just describing a feeling and feelings as I said feelings have to feel like
973920	980880	something unlike visual perception which does not have to so that's the the first I said I'm
980880	987120	going to tell the story in two parts that's the that's the the first part but let me now move
987120	992560	from neuroscience to to a more sort of philosophical perspective on this thing
993520	1002640	and I said the question the hard problem put in its most basic form you know is as so put it you
1002640	1010640	know how how does the brain get over the hump from electrochemistry to feeling and how do electrochemical
1010640	1015920	processes turn into feelings literally turn into them you know what kind of weird metaphysical
1015920	1024960	transduction occurs there and and and here I think the problem is that the the the physiological
1024960	1033520	processes do not turn into experiences I think this is remember I'm saying this is a philosophical
1033520	1040480	perspective yes I think it's a matter of observational perspective on point of view so
1041200	1052800	um no if you if you look at the processes going on in my brain when I am feeling let us say
1053760	1061280	excitedly motivated you will see activation of mesocortical mesolambic dopamine circuitry
1061840	1068720	and you literally will see it if you for example put me in a positron emission scanner you will see
1069200	1076160	that circuitry lighting up and you can you can use all sorts of methods to you know drill down
1076160	1081600	into what exactly is going on physiologically there but that's looking at me from the outside
1081600	1086800	I mean you are now looking at me in the dark from the outside and you're seeing a body
1087840	1094000	and you can then you know you can start scanning this body and you can see in in more granular
1094000	1098800	detail what's going on within it but the the crucial issue is you're taking an external
1098800	1106160	observational perspective on me I on the other hand have another observational perspective on me
1106160	1113280	that is being me I am me so I have another perspective which is the subjective mark songs
1113280	1119600	as a subject as opposed to mark songs as an object so I can look at myself in the mirror
1119600	1125200	and I recognize oh yeah that guy's me it's mark songs but I could also when I first wake up in
1125200	1132160	the morning before I've even opened my eyes I can have this dawning subjective experience of being
1132160	1139520	me and that's can only be described as my mind then I stagger over to the bathroom look at myself
1139520	1146160	in the mirror and that's my body but both of them are me so you know they're not two of them
1146160	1151520	there's only one of them there's only one mark songs it's just that we're observing
1151520	1159840	him from two different perspectives so so to say how does how does my subjective experience of being
1159840	1166080	me produce the physical or I should rather put it the other way around how does the physiological
1167120	1174160	embodied version of me produce the subjective experience of me is like asking you know how
1174160	1179920	does something objective produce something subjective objectivity doesn't do subjectivity
1179920	1188240	they're two different perspectives um now the if we are one and the same thing you know then
1189360	1194480	it's like actually let me use another analogy lightning and thunder you know with you with
1194480	1200560	your ears you hear a clap of thunder with your eyes you see a flash of lightning
1200640	1207760	that they're two different things you know the they're utterly different perceptions
1208480	1212960	but but they're not they're not actually two different things they're two different manifest
1212960	1218320	depends what perceptual perspective you take on is it an auditory perspective or is it a visual
1218320	1224480	perspective we don't ask it would be unreasonable to ask how does lightning turn into thunder
1224560	1230960	you know we realize these are two different ways of of of perceiving the same underlying process
1231680	1237680	and then we ask what is that underlying process and then we start going into physics
1238400	1246320	and we start speaking about you know georelectrical potential differences in the atmosphere
1246320	1252480	and you know and that's the ultimate description of what's going on the ultimate description
1252480	1259360	is of the causal mechanisms that we infer from the observational the observable data
1259360	1266320	and that's how we come up with the basic theory a basic and a fundamental science of lightning
1266320	1273440	and thunder um you know which is the theory of electricity um and and I think that that's what
1273440	1281440	we need um in in neuroscience or neuropsychology if we're going to bridge the divide between the
1281440	1287440	psychological and the neurological between the subjective and the objective perspectives
1287440	1294960	on the being of a creature then we need to find a more fundamental language which explains
1294960	1301200	both both sets of phenomena we don't we don't want to ask how does the one set of phenomena
1301200	1307280	cause the other set of phenomena because they don't so what I'm saying in essence is that
1307280	1314160	the hard problem is made a lot harder than it has to be uh if we if we conceptualize it
1314160	1320800	that way if we ask the question how do how does the brain get over the pump from electrochemistry
1320800	1326560	to feeling it's it's it's a question that can't be answered because it's wrongly framed um
1327200	1333920	but if we ask you know what is it that produces both the electrochemistry and what explains
1333920	1340800	the behavior of the electrochemistry and the behavior of the feeling then we then we have a
1340800	1350400	mechanistic theory and and I I think that um the the prospects of finding such a mechanistic theory
1350400	1358400	are greatly increased by shifting our focus away from these very complicated visual perceptual
1358400	1364400	processes which as I've already said uh these cortical processes are way down the evolutionary
1364400	1371840	line uh they're much later developments they're a secondary application um of what feeling is for
1371840	1378320	and what feeling does and focus instead on the primary form of feeling in the brain stem which
1378320	1385040	is as I've also already said an extended form of homeostasis then we say okay so we have a
1385040	1391200	fairly good clue as to what the mechanism is that we're looking for uh it's it's homeostasis with
1391200	1401520	some version of homeostasis and I I think from that starting point uh obviously there's a lot
1401520	1408480	more that could be said about okay so then how do we do it how how does uh homeostasis mechanistically
1409040	1415680	how does it explain the behavior of the predictive brain and how does it explain
1416240	1423920	the experience of being an of an intentional being with with with with calls and and aims
1423920	1431440	and purposes and so on I think that from that starting point it can be done um and my my own
1431440	1439280	efforts in this area have been have been along those lines trying to trying to begin to um
1440000	1451280	sketch what what what what this what this uh this monist uh um mechanistic uh um causal
1451280	1460320	explanatory process might be whereby uh we we have the the particular physiology of consciousness
1460320	1465920	and the particular phenomenology of it I'm glad you you just mentioned monist and asked because I
1465920	1470160	was thinking I mean we spoke about some of the history of philosophy we we spoke about David
1470160	1476640	Chalmers and his 1995 paper I mean do you think Descartes-René Descartes when he started this this
1476640	1480720	question of this mind-body problem when he started with this dualistic approach do you think that
1480720	1486480	also had a big impact on the way we perceived this problem in the first place very much so
1487440	1493600	and and David Chalmers makes little uh secret of his admiration for Descartes
1495040	1504080	I I think yeah I mean I I I wholly concur with the title of Demasio's famous book Descartes' Error
1504640	1512560	it was a horrendous error so so the the philosophy that I find myself much more sympathetic with
1512560	1519840	is is is that of of Spinoza uh that that I think is a great advance over Descartes
1521840	1526160	um I'm actually going to chat to Demasio about in a couple days so I'm very
1526160	1532000	looking I'm looking forward to that but Mark seem to be my best wishes I'll definitely like him very
1532000	1537040	much yeah so I'm looking forward to discussing Descartes' Error in quite a bit of detail well
1537040	1541760	when you're looking at this brain stem you're looking at this midbrain you're talking about
1541840	1546640	ancient consciousness I know sometimes because the main goal of this podcast is for me to provide
1546640	1553040	you someone who has a an excellent new thought process on this problem to explain their view
1553040	1558880	express themselves openly and to also address any objections people might have or to their theory
1558880	1564640	but when when you talk about the ancient brain you feel that's giving people a sort of a misconception
1564640	1570560	on what you mean by ancient consciousness because I feel like I've I've read blogs I've read a
1570560	1575520	couple things where people think you're taking it too far I've talked to some scientists about it
1575520	1580720	some some philosophers and they think you're taking it too low but yet you're explaining
1580720	1586560	exactly why the cortical versions of this are not the same do you think that they're mistaken
1586560	1597200	consciousness with intelligence I do I do very much so think that uh although um I don't deny
1597920	1605600	uh that very simple creatures like a bacterium has an intelligence it's obviously in it's nothing
1605600	1614960	like our intelligence and it's it's a it's a perfectly understandable state of affairs
1614960	1622240	that we start with human consciousness well we are human for one thing for another thing the
1622240	1628640	problem of other minds dictates that the only form of consciousness we can ever observe directly
1628640	1634480	is our own so you know it's it's it's not an unreasonable place to start it's not it's not
1634480	1641680	hard to understand why we began there but it's quite a different thing to say that therefore
1641680	1647840	human consciousness is the definitional form you know that anything which doesn't conform
1647840	1656400	to our type of consciousness isn't really consciousness um you you started this podcast
1656400	1664560	by asking me the question why is there something it is like to be me that is uh of course charmer's
1664560	1672800	definition building upon tom nagel's definition from 1974 um it's notoriously difficult to get
1672960	1678160	a neuroscientist or for that matter anyone to agree on a definition of consciousness
1678160	1686240	but I think if there's one definition that has more or less uh united us it is that it is something
1686240	1692000	it is likeness you know it's it is parliad that's what we mean by consciousness and so there's nothing
1693360	1701360	there's nothing complicated about that it doesn't it doesn't have anything more in common
1701360	1712240	with Descartes thinking uh cogito ergo sum than it does uh in common with the the the the raw
1712240	1720240	feel of pain you know there is something it is like to feel pain so when you say I'm going too far
1722800	1729840	philosophically speaking all I'm saying is I want to stop I want to I want to define consciousness
1729840	1736640	as as something it is like to be in that there is something it is like to be in that state
1737360	1743120	and that's not a controversial definition of consciousness and then I'm saying well there
1743120	1750960	is something it is like to be in pre-verbal non-verbal uh states of raw ethic like pain
1750960	1757840	I find it very hard to to imagine how anyone could argue against that you know there is
1757840	1764080	something it is like to be to be hungry there's something it is like to be thirsty this there's
1764080	1769120	something it is like to be in pain there's something it is like to experience separation
1769120	1774720	distress with which all mammals experience and display um there's something it is like to feel
1774720	1782560	fear and you know and you don't need to be able to reflect upon the source of your pain it's a very
1783360	1789840	very great advantage to be able to but you don't have to have any theory of pain or any
1789840	1796720	explanation of pain or any knowledge of pain as mechanisms etc or even just know anything about
1796720	1802880	what caused me to feel this all you just need to know is I feel it that's that is that is I think
1802880	1812640	a very defendable position that that's what we mean fundamentally by a conscious state
1813200	1820400	um you know I I grant of course that these higher forms of consciousness add all kinds of
1820400	1827600	bells and whistles and uh I'm very grateful to be the proud possessor of all of those bells
1827600	1832080	and whistles and I don't want to forego them you know so therefore I'm well aware that they
1832080	1838160	add a hell of a lot more but I don't think it's the right place to start if you're wanting to
1838160	1846640	understand the basic mechanism whereby something it is likeness appeared on this planet you know
1846640	1853120	how it how and why it evolved that that creatures started to quote Tom Nagel he said
1854160	1860480	that something like I'm paraphrasing but he said an organism is only conscious if there is
1860480	1865520	something it is like to be the organism something it is like for the organism you know that's
1865520	1873200	that's that's a compelling definition for me of what consciousness is and and and it makes
1874080	1879920	mean in terms of everything else we do in biology you know we take an evolutionary perspective we
1879920	1885440	we try and understand you know what this thing how this thing evolved why this thing evolved what
1885440	1892080	does it add what does it do that's why once it once it evolves it gets it gets conserved because
1892080	1899440	it continues to perform that function and that function bestows such enormous additional
1900320	1908800	survival potential that that it just hangs around now you've got to look at the arguments
1910080	1914240	so I've just given you in principle arguments about why I think that's a
1914240	1921680	fine place to start it's in fact to me the obvious place to start although I can understand
1922640	1928320	why we started in another place I think that it was a mistake in retrospect and now we can
1928320	1934320	correct that mistake and start in a better place but it's not just a matter of principles
1934320	1942240	you know it's a matter it's also an empirical matter when you start looking scientifically
1942720	1951120	at what is the minimal architecture for for consciousness you you know you
1952480	1958720	and you know you you you can start with human beings even you know if you if you produce
1960000	1968720	not deliberately so let me rather say if it so happens that you suffer a lesion
1969680	1978080	in the reticular activating system that lesion can be as small as two millimeters cubed in other
1978080	1983280	words the size of a match head if it's in the peri-brachial complex the right part of the
1983280	1992960	peri-brachial complex that will produce a coma in in any and in every human being you the the
1992960	2001440	fish's meta fish's analysis of all of the scans of stroke trying to identify what is the small
2001440	2008880	what is the common denominator what area is always lesion in patients in coma it's the
2008880	2014800	it's it's a it's a small two cubic two cubic millimeter area of the peri-brachial complex
2014800	2022160	so that wipes out something it is likeness reliably you know I mean you can at my prediction
2022160	2028880	is lesion that area the animal will go into a coma bingo it always happens the prediction
2028880	2037920	is confirmed each and every time now by contrast what about the cerebral cortex the cerebral cortex
2037920	2046080	in fact since the 1880s where has been removed in experimental animals with gay abandon and
2046720	2053040	even in the 1880s it was already observed that goats for example did it in dogs the dogs didn't
2053040	2060720	go into a coma they just they became what goats described as idiotish in other words they became
2060720	2065600	stupid they they lost their they lost their knowledge their understanding of the world
2066800	2074480	but they still behaved you know purposeively they they they behave and I'm telling you about
2074480	2083120	goats but since then for decades you know a decortication has been performed on on innumerable
2083120	2089760	mammal species and the opposite if it's done neonately you know the the the observation is
2089760	2100400	always the same that they they play they show fear they get enraged in situationally appropriate
2101040	2112000	ways they copulate with each other they rear little little pups to maturity I mean not perfectly
2112000	2117920	but they do they play they hang from bars they swing around you know they they in fact yark
2117920	2127360	pangsit used to he performed a little sort of an experiment it's not really an experiment but
2127360	2134000	each of his new cohort of graduate students he would show them two groups of rats in two
2134000	2140800	different cages the one group had been decorticated and the other group had had a sham decortication
2140800	2144880	in other words they had the little bandage on their heads but but they they hadn't had the
2144880	2151520	operation and he asked them which of these two groups has no cortex and and every year he had
2151680	2158560	the same result you know that the students identified the animals that were were were intact
2158560	2164480	as being the decorticate ones and he said why and they said because the other ones are more lively
2164480	2171680	in other words in reality the decorticate rodents are more lively they're more emotionally expressive
2171680	2177120	that's because they don't have the cortical modulation of the but now we're talking about
2177600	2185520	rodents and and dogs and what more what about human beings if the cortex was the seat of consciousness
2185520	2192880	then there's a easy prediction which is that you know just we don't do neonatal decortication
2192880	2200000	in human beings but sadly they are neonates who are born with no cortex and this is a condition
2200000	2206480	known as hydrogen and cephalin and the prediction would be if the cortex was the seat of consciousness
2206480	2212080	that these kids should be in a coma they got no cortex and at the very least
2213040	2220400	they should be in a in a persistent vegetative state but that's not what you observe they are
2220400	2228720	not vegetative you know the vegetative state is also called non-responsive wakefulness non-responsive
2228720	2235600	wakefulness these kids are utterly responsive they and just as I described for the for the
2236000	2242480	animal studies they are responsive they are emotionally responsive in situationally
2242480	2248400	appropriate ways in other words you tickle the child she laughs you frustrate the child she
2248400	2254400	arches her back and complains you give the child a fright and she startles and and they show
2254400	2259840	behavioral initiative they they approach things that they like and they avoid things that they
2259840	2267200	don't like you know anybody who has anybody who has studied these children seriously
2268560	2275440	you know they they come to this conclusion and people philosophers you know who are all
2275440	2281200	skeptical about this I really invite them to just interact with these kids you know it's it's just
2281200	2288080	it's it's it's very very difficult to sustain the argument so so I was saying it's it's very
2288080	2293120	hard to sustain the argument that these kids are not conscious if you actually interact with them
2293760	2299040	but you know it is ultimately because of the problem of other minds it's ultimately
2299040	2308560	a matter of of inference and what my colleagues say I mean when I say colleagues here I'm not
2308560	2315200	only referring to philosophers there are many neuroscientists who who are very skeptical about
2315200	2325200	the claim the claim by I hasten to add not only me you know a good many of us who actually have
2325200	2330880	interacted with these kids find it very hard to believe that they're not conscious they are
2330880	2336240	feeling creatures who behave in every way like feeling creatures the the argument that is made
2336240	2344800	against this is we cannot know for sure that they are not just reflexes yes well remember
2344800	2349840	what I said about reflexes at the beginning of our discussion you know in reflexes there's an
2349840	2357040	entirely predictable response there's no variation there's no trial and error there's no intentionality
2357680	2362240	you know this is not what you see in these kids it's also not what you see in the deco ticket
2362240	2369680	animals so it's it's you know anyone who knows anything about how the reflexes of the nervous
2369680	2376400	system work know that what you see here ain't reflexes or instincts you know they are not
2376400	2382480	they are not reducible I mean they are dominated by instincts that's true these kids are you know
2382480	2389840	they are not like you and me but they show they show goal directed intentional
2390400	2400000	purpose of and voluntary behavior and if you read the the descriptions by the pediatric neurologists
2400000	2405360	who studied these kids and the neuroscientists who studied these kids you see you know the
2405360	2414960	detailed evidence for that but you can't be sure say my colleagues so let me just hasten to add
2414960	2421040	you can't be sure that your pet dog is conscious you can't be sure that your pet cat is conscious
2421760	2427280	you can't be sure that anyone other than you yourself are conscious and then the argument
2427280	2435440	is given well reportability gets us out of that problem you know it's true that our dogs and cats
2436160	2440960	can't report their conscious state so there's room for skepticism there you know but
2440960	2445680	Tevin Naidu and Mark Solms can say there's something it is like to be me let me tell you
2445680	2451200	what I'm experiencing right now I'm experiencing x y and z I don't know why that's considered such
2451200	2459680	wonderful evidence you know because a robot can do that a robot can report its states
2459680	2463440	you know you can write a very simple program just say you know whenever you're in this that
2463440	2469360	or the other mode say I'm experiencing it but how do you know it really is experiencing
2469360	2476320	so I don't think reportability is I mean by the way on the reportability thing we're saying not
2476320	2480880	only that our dogs and cats aren't conscious we're saying that our preverbal kids aren't conscious
2480880	2489040	humans you know exactly so we need better we need we need better ways of deciding the question
2490160	2495040	when you go on the internet and you're trying to access something and it wants to know that you're
2495040	2500320	not a robot it doesn't say please tell me please declare you're not a robot you know it gives you
2500320	2506640	an ambiguous situation a problem and you have to navigate some uncertainty there and solve the
2506640	2514640	problem you know why why why is that the case what if declaring your states you know was was
2514640	2522160	such a wonderful method for determining that does seem to be the case sorry did you want to add to
2523120	2527680	that before well sadly I have a lot to add to it so let me rather let you get a word in
2527680	2533120	eduism then I'll carry on no you can continue I'm enjoying listening so that's why so what I do
2533120	2539440	what I say to my colleagues is okay well let's take you know you guys don't claim that the
2539440	2546480	whole of cortex is the seat of consciousness the the the general view is you know that there's
2546960	2553760	all this information processing going on there which is then accessed by some sort of overarching
2554720	2561280	global workspace or or something of the kind and where is this thing located well the standard
2561280	2570960	argument is prefrontal cortex the the other well known or widely held position which is I think
2571680	2577680	probably a better one is that it's insular cortex I why say better because insular cortex
2577680	2583200	has to do with feelings which I've already told you is the basic in my view form of consciousness
2583920	2592400	but if the prefrontal cortex were and many people say this I mean my dear colleague and friend Joe
2592400	2598400	the dude says that that all of this stuff you know he's an expert on sub cortical
2599680	2607920	affective circuitry specifically fear circuitry and and specifically the amygdala and he says
2607920	2614560	all of that stuff going on the amygdala is unconscious until it is until it is read out
2614560	2620240	by the cortex literally he uses the word label you know in other words until you use until
2620240	2627760	you can have this concept I am feeling fear you're not feeling fear so so what happens
2627760	2634240	if you remove again we don't do it experimentally but it happens in nature that they are patients
2634240	2639680	with no prefrontal cortex in fact I'll tell you it's not unusual to have patients with large
2639680	2645840	prefrontal cortical lesions on Joe the dude's view they should be less affective they should be
2645840	2652480	less emotional consciousness but there's more I mean since since Phineas gauge we've learned
2652480	2662560	frontal patients have too much emotion but I have a patient case W who has no prefrontal cortex
2662560	2669200	whatsoever and he not only is he like all such patients or frontal patients you know he's a
2669200	2678080	hyper emotional he's very overwhelmed by his feelings not only that but you know he he answers
2678080	2684800	questions that I put to him about what is it like to be you I asked him to imagine a scene in his mind
2684800	2691360	which had to do with I said imagine you have two dogs and one chicken can you picture them he says
2691360	2697200	yes I said now tell me can you count their legs and tell me what the total number of legs are
2697200	2702800	and the answer of course is 10 two dogs and one chicken so to my great disappointment because I was
2702800	2707680	trying to prove is there's somebody home you know he's there with mental imagery and he can
2707680	2714560	and he can experience it to my great disappointment he said eight the answer was eight I said eight
2714560	2724240	he said yes the dogs ate the chicken so you know no prefrontal cortex there's a sentient being there
2724880	2733040	and Domazio reported a case patient B who had absolutely no insular cortex and the same thing
2733840	2738640	Domazio interviewed him about you know and the patient keeps on referring to me and I and I yes
2738640	2745200	of course I have a mind and yes I'm experiencing this and and Domazio's patient also had heightened
2745200	2751520	affective feelings not a reduction in affect which is what but Craig's theory but Craig is the guy who
2751520	2757520	said you know the insular is the is the is the seat of the fundamental form of consciousness
2757520	2764240	feeling well Domazio showed that with no insular cortex you still have feeling I showed with no
2764240	2771760	prefrontal cortex you still have feeling and you have sentient being reportable conscious states
2771760	2777920	so then my colleagues say well it's due to the remaining cortex so you see I can't win because
2777920	2783760	they say the case with no cortex they can't declare their states so therefore we don't know
2783760	2788480	so I say careful let's take this with no prefrontal cortex they say well maybe it's posterior cortex
2788480	2795120	take one with no posterior cortex well maybe it's anterior cortex so that's now I'm near the end of
2795120	2802720	my argument which is that so let's look at other methods other than lesion methods so if if the
2803200	2809280	feelings are actually generated in the subcortical structures I mean literally in in other words
2809280	2816560	they're not being read out by cortex because everybody knows of course these affective mechanisms
2816560	2822960	are subcortical but the idea is they're not conscious until they read out by cortex so
2824160	2832080	if that were the case then if you if you take for example positron emission tomographic images
2832960	2839040	of human beings who are in intense affective states which they can report so they say I am
2839040	2846480	feeling really sad you know I am feeling absolutely joyous I am feeling trepidatiously
2846480	2852880	fearful or I am feeling really angry each of those four states and I'm not just saying I am
2852880	2858480	feeling I mean people who who really are in the grip of intense affects if you scan them
2859120	2866080	with pet imaging what is the prediction if it's if it's the if it's the brain stem
2866080	2873040	and the and this limbic circuitry arising from it that is responsible for those effects
2873040	2877040	then that's where you should see the highest rate of metabolic activity that's
2877040	2882720	that's what we that that seems to be an acceptable method for everything else in neuroscience so
2883280	2890880	you know so yeah we're saying well if the if the greatest if the if the hot spots are in the brain
2890880	2896400	stem then that's where the state is being generated and that's exactly what you find
2897360	2905760	if you if you image people in intense affective states you see intense arousal of brain upper
2905840	2913360	brain stem structures and the circuits the olympic circuitry but not cortex you know now
2913360	2920400	what about another method so in other words the prediction is confirmed yes now what about another
2920400	2928240	method deep brain stimulation the the prediction is if the if the affects are generated in the
2928240	2933760	brain stem you know then if you generate if you stimulate those structures that you are saying
2933760	2939200	are generating the affects in other words reticular activating system the prediction is
2939200	2946400	you will stimulate you will generate artificially an intense affect and and conversely you won't
2946400	2951520	if you stimulate cortex and that's what happens you know you stimulate cortex you get just about
2951520	2955520	no affects and when you do it's they really thought they're not affects they kind of like
2955520	2961840	you know i'm remembering this time that i was a bit down you know but you stimulate this when i
2961840	2968800	speak about a bit down stimulate substantia nigra you produce within five seconds depression
2968800	2975440	clinical depression like suicidal depression you know and and you switch off the stimulator
2975440	2981680	90 seconds later the person is out of the depression and i'm talking about reticular
2981680	2986640	activating system but it's not only reticular activating system it's periaqueductal gray
2987280	2994800	periaqueductal gray which is which is in the mid-brain there's a greater variety of affects
2994800	2999920	generated by stimulating the periaqueductal gray than any other brain structure and the
2999920	3006240	greater intensity of affect and so that's a third method so the lesion method you know
3007040	3013280	you add it to the functional imaging method you add it to the to the deep brain stimulation
3013280	3021840	method then there's also pharmacological probes you know if you it's no accident that the major
3021840	3029520	psychiatric drugs the the the psychopharmacological agents that form the mainstay of of clinical
3029520	3037520	practice these days they are like like antidepressants SSRIs what are they doing they are
3037520	3044320	increasing serotonin where is serotonin sourced it's it's it's sourced in the reticular activating
3044320	3052160	system in the rife nuclei where is where is dopamine you know antipsychotics block dopamine
3052160	3056720	where's that sourced apart from the substantia nigra which i mentioned earlier the type that's
3056720	3061680	important for psychosis is sourced in the ventral tegmental area which is part of the
3061680	3068400	reticular active aging system noradrenaline is sourced in the locus cirrhulius complex you know
3068400	3075840	you you modulate noradrenaline or you you you block noradrenaline to block anxiety so if these
3075840	3084320	nuclei you know are are the targets or at least the the the the the source cells of the neurons
3084320	3090640	that the cell bodies of the neurons that are targeted by all of these psychopharmacological
3090640	3096080	agents but they they're all in the reticular activating system this tells us something you know
3096080	3101920	so so i'm saying i'm sorry i'm speaking so much devon let me just come back to my to my main
3101920	3107920	argument which is that it's not when people say moxons is going too far to say well you know
3107920	3114480	these brainstem structures and simple effects are the model example of consciousness i told you
3114480	3120160	in principle why i think effects are the right model example and then i said and empirically
3120160	3126640	you know the you look at all of the evidence all of the evidence speaks to speaks for the
3126640	3133600	conclusion that actually effects are generated there where in the part of the brain that we've
3133600	3142720	known since 1949 is the is the basic prerequisite for all other forms of consciousness the only
3142720	3148560	problem is in when magoon and maruzzi discovered that and nobody disputes it that it is prerequisite
3148560	3153920	you can't have a conscious cortex unless it's activated by the reticular activating system
3153920	3159360	yes but when they discovered that they said yes but the reticular activating system produces
3160320	3166720	around produces what did they call it the level of consciousness yes a quantitative sort of like
3166720	3173120	volume of consciousness but it hasn't got any phenomenal content and that's what i've just
3173120	3179280	shown you isn't true you know it has phenomenal content the content i grant you is not cognitive
3179840	3184880	but it is effective there's a there's something it is like to be in those states that i've just
3184880	3191920	described therefore they are they are qualitative states they're not just quantitative states
3192720	3199760	and they have content the content is you know the the the feeling of pain versus the feeling of
3199760	3204640	hunger versus the feeling of sleepiness those that's that's the content that's what those states
3204640	3211280	are about so if if the upper brain stem was was only about some quantitative dimension
3211280	3217200	the level of consciousness it would only be of interest to an anesthetist yes but
3217840	3223280	it's the characteristics of tinkering with those with those circuits so yes so there you have it
3223280	3227920	in essence the youth i mean we've used this clinical differentiation between contents
3227920	3232400	of consciousness versus a level of consciousness but you're clearly showing that in essence they're
3232400	3239440	both very much linked i mean they're they're one in the same in a sense with whether you're
3239440	3244160	whether your level of consciousness is slightly lower in terms of less the gcs scale doesn't
3244160	3250160	necessarily mean that the person doesn't have effective qualitative experiences
3251680	3257760	exactly so i find it's a very it's a totally artificial distinction there is no
3257760	3264800	such thing as i mean how can you how can you have blank consciousness you know it's what is such a
3264800	3270320	what is a blank consciousness so you know you can't be conscious without being conscious of
3270320	3276800	something i mean we've known that since Brent Arno you know it's uh so i think that that's
3276800	3284320	distinction drawn by Maguna and Maruti uh all those decades ago was because they were so
3285200	3291120	completely flabbergasted by the finding which remember they weren't in any way expecting
3291840	3298960	that if you disconnect the cat cortex from the cat reticular activating system there is no more
3298960	3305520	conscious cat you know the the the the the the the the cortical consciousness cannot
3306480	3314880	just just disappears without without reticular arousal and so it was a way because everybody
3314880	3320640	knew that the cortex was the seat of consciousness they had to explain this somehow and so they
3320640	3329280	came up with this totally artificial distinction between um this this waking state which is
3329280	3336080	contentless um and you know and then the phenomenal qualities and and contents of
3336080	3341680	that the cortex had i mean but that's what i like about your book as well is that you you do do that
3341680	3347680	you show different methods of how you can prove this and predict what your theory claims that well
3347680	3352080	because ideally that's what we want in the scientific theory of of anything you want so
3352080	3357520	you want different ways of proving the same thing which is what you've basically shown in many ways
3357520	3363280	what i find very fascinating mark is that others neuroscientists like let's say for example michael
3363280	3369760	graziano he also pays a lot of attention to the tectum optic tectum which which we call the superior
3369760	3375360	coliculus but then natural completely different conclusions they regarding i mean he uses this
3375360	3383040	as the attention schema theory where we're building models of attention but we're not really um aware
3383040	3389600	in the sense that we have qualia we rather introspectively conclude that we have this
3389600	3393440	so i still find it quite fascinating that some people are using similar brain regions and
3393440	3398160	brain structures and drawing different conclusions what are your thoughts on that yeah but but but
3398160	3405920	let me clarify there um i am not uh i don't i don't disagree with that the the the the optic
3405920	3418880	tectum or or or superior coliculi they they are they are receiving information from the sensory
3418880	3426240	end organs sensory motor end organs but that doesn't mean that that information is conscious
3427920	3433360	i mean the famous example is blindsight with with the cortically blind cases
3434160	3441600	who nevertheless can navigate an obstacle course they are completely unaware that they're seeing
3441600	3448800	anything and yet they can avoid things that are in their way and the the the the most widely accepted
3448800	3456400	explanation for that is it's because the the the optic tectum is is is processing the information
3456400	3462960	unconsciously i'm fine with that it's unconscious and and and it also receives auditory information
3463040	3471840	and somatosensory information and so on um and uh the so these kids for example the the the the
3471840	3478880	hydranin cephalic kids uh i the the reason they're able to respond to their environments is because
3478880	3488080	they're receiving information about the environment from their sensory epithelium and but it is
3488080	3496320	unconscious then they it evokes a feeling in them uh all they know all they experience on
3496320	3502960	the evidence available to me it leads me to the conclusion that they i i don't think i can claim
3502960	3508240	that they experience anything more than just a feeling they don't have to know what the feeling
3508240	3513920	is about where it came from what made me feel this what is the thing out there in the world
3513920	3519920	it it it's not necessary so i'm saying because remember the the the superior
3519920	3525920	curriculae well well the the the whole of the tectum the superior and inferior curriculae the
3525920	3535840	whole of the tectum uh is is absolutely adjacent to the periaqueductal gray so all of the well
3535840	3546640	not smell but all of the other senses of projecting unconscious visual auditory somatosensory
3546640	3556000	information to the to the tectum uh and that in turn uh is is coupled with uh all of the
3556000	3561520	homeostatic mechanisms that we've mentioned at the beginning of our discussion all of the
3561520	3568160	homeostatic mechanisms the affect mechanisms including the emotions because they are bodily
3568160	3575840	affects and their emotional affects they all send their residual error signals to the periaqueductal
3575840	3582720	gray immediately adjacent to the tectum so so it's it's something like it's something like
3582720	3590480	you know where things where things stand now in the outside world which is not consciously
3590480	3599120	registered uh and where things stand now uh from the from the endogenous perspective of the organism
3599920	3606720	and and then uh the feeling is about those things but the feeling is all that the that
3606720	3613600	that the creature experiences you then need higher uh structures and the thalamocortical
3613600	3620480	structures make it possible for that feeling to be applied to a stabilized grip because the
3620480	3625280	tectum is just like a sort of salience map it's an attentional I agree with that description of it
3625840	3633920	but the cortex has the stabilized detailed mappings uh of it's not only that they detailed
3633920	3639360	mappings of the outside world filtered through a lifetime of experience of it because cortex is
3639440	3646080	memories memory space but it's also that it can be held in mind in working memories so you can
3646080	3651600	actually you know okay I feel like this about that so what am I going to do about it you know
3651600	3658320	that's that's what the cortical consciousness adds and and and and perhaps even more important than
3658320	3666320	that is that you can then manipulate those representations virtually in other words you
3666320	3673440	can you don't only have to feel your way through the world here and now by trial and error bearing
3673440	3682080	in mind that trial and error involves errors which are which are costly so so thinking where you have
3682080	3687520	virtual representations of if I were to do that what would happen and if I were to do the other
3687520	3693840	thing what would happen then and feeling you feel your way through these virtuals and all of this
3693840	3701280	is what cortex adds um and uh I keep on saying I'm very grateful to have that and I recognize that
3701280	3708400	that is a way more complex form of consciousness than the elementary form but for all the reasons
3708400	3714080	I've already said I think that the elementary form nevertheless is the right place to start
3714080	3720480	and the elementary form nevertheless qualifies as consciousness defined as there being something
3720560	3725520	it is like to have it what what I really like is that at some point I mean when you're talking
3725520	3730080	about homeostasis you're talking about how we're trying to figure this out and quantify a lot of
3730080	3736240	these qualitative experiences you that your work then somehow links with a lot of Karl Frister's work
3736240	3740960	and I mean Karl Frister is definitely one of the like most I mean he's the most cited neuroscientist
3740960	3746080	on the planet I think um and your work seems to coincide quite well do you want to touch on that
3746080	3749920	because I find that very intriguing the way you guys have linked up I read the paper that you guys
3749920	3755040	did together as well and I even used a part of my dissertation that you were very generous to
3755040	3764240	help me with uh but yeah let's touch on that a bit so I said earlier that uh I'm a dual aspect
3764240	3772400	monist in other words I think we have two different ways of observing uh the the the mental instrument
3772400	3778720	um you can look at it from the outside as as an organ uh you can look at it from the inside
3778720	3788000	as as a as a phenomenal state of mind but these two things are reducible to one causal mechanism
3788720	3798240	and that is something you infer from the data of of of observation and and I said that if you
3798240	3805360	if you accept that the elementary form of consciousness is feeling and that feeling
3805920	3812160	is an extended form of homeostasis then you have a rather simple mechanism you know you have a you
3812160	3817920	have a good place a tractable place to start because homeostasis is not difficult to understand
3818640	3828000	and so Karl Friston published a paper in 2013 in one of the journals of the royal society it's
3828480	3836320	called royal society interface and the paper was titled life as we know it and in which is a
3836320	3847600	wonderful title and and in that paper he basically explicated uh in in in ordinary you know physical
3848560	3857200	uh terms how by which I mean by which I mean you know physical mechanics how how does how
3857200	3866960	does homeostasis work um and so I said to him on upon reading that paper you know the the the
3866960	3875200	mechanism of of homeostasis which you so beautifully uh you know reduced to equations in in uh in that
3875200	3881760	paper if if consciousness is an extended form of homeostasis and by the way all those brains
3881760	3887840	then nuclear are not all of them but I mean the the fundamental homeostasis of the of the human
3887840	3896320	body are are are you know sort of like hypothalamus and midbrain and I said it should be possible to
3896320	3902960	extend then these these mechanistic accounts that you provide of homeostasis count of feeling
3902960	3909120	so that's what the paper that I wrote with him was about um so that's background uh to move a
3909120	3915920	little bit further forward so as everyone knows so I'm not going to go into this chapter inverse
3916640	3924240	Friston has has the flag that he's tied to his mast is the free energy principle
3925200	3934000	which is which is basically a statement of the the that self-organizing systems
3935520	3941680	systems which persist which continue to exist they have to do something to continue to exist
3942480	3947920	that this is this is what distinguishes I'm not saying all self-organizing systems are living
3947920	3953920	systems but what what but all living systems are self-organizing systems and what distinguishes
3954000	3960080	living systems from non-living ones is that they oppose the second law of thermodynamics in other
3960080	3967040	words they don't just dissipate they have they have they have preferred states and they work to stay
3967040	3974240	in those states and that's how they stay alive you know in the end the second law wins we don't
3974240	3981760	stay alive forever but you know the whole the essential feature of living systems is that they
3981840	3988240	are acting on their environments in such a way as to increase their chances of carrying on
3988240	3995280	existing as systems so the free energy principle is just a formalist a formal understanding of
3995280	4002640	the mechanisms whereby that work how self-organizing systems a resist entropy and by the way when I
4002640	4009440	said not all self-organizing systems are living systems that's a good thing because living systems
4009440	4016240	evolve from non-living systems you know so the fact that we can have a physics that explains
4016240	4023440	the this basic tycov system which then became the living system is a necessary thing you know we
4023440	4030080	have to be able to explain life in terms of things that were around before life came into existence
4030080	4036000	and by the way the same applies to consciousness we must be able to be conscious life evolved
4036000	4042080	long before consciousness evolved so you know there must be something it must have it must
4042080	4048320	have been constructed out of ingredients that were already there and I'm saying self-organizing
4048320	4054160	systems provide us with those ingredients so the free energy principle explains that how
4054160	4059680	self-organizing it formalizes the mechanisms whereby self-organizing systems in order to
4059680	4065120	continue to exist they have to minimize their free energy which is basically the same thing as to say
4065120	4071360	they have to have a model of the world because how else can you act in that world to to to
4072160	4077920	maximize your chances of surviving so it's a predictive model it's a model that if I were to
4077920	4083680	do that in the world this would be the sensory consequences that's how I maintain homeostasis
4083680	4088640	say if my sensory state is I'm moving out of my homeostatic bounds I'm getting too hot
4089360	4095440	I'm getting too thirsty then I must do that I must get out of the kitchen or I must drink some
4095440	4101760	water you know that will bring me back into my viable bounds so that's the basic and and the
4101760	4107280	free energy principle says to the extent that what you predicted will happen in consequence of your
4107280	4114240	actions to the extent that it does not happen that's called surprise all average surprise all
4114240	4119440	basically is free energy in other words you must be using your energy you must bind your energy into
4120160	4127040	actions which lead to the outcomes that you require in order to survive free energy in other
4127040	4132720	words energy that is not being efficiently used must therefore be minimized in other words the
4132720	4138240	gap between you what you what you expect to flow from your actions and what actually flows from
4138240	4143920	your actions that gap must be minimized so that's the whole of Friston's work basically just boils
4143920	4150560	down to that I mean I don't want to diminish it it's absolutely genius you know but that principle
4151280	4158000	explains homeostasis and it explains the goal directed behavior is the allostatic
4159600	4164880	imperative you know in order to maintain within my homeostatic remain within my homeostatic
4164880	4170320	bounds I have to do things in the outside world and I have to have a good understanding of how the
4170320	4176720	outside world works in order for me to know what things to do and while I'm busy learning that
4176720	4182720	I make lots of mistakes and I slowly improve my predictive model in order to minimize those
4182720	4189520	mistakes that's what the whole of cognition is for and what is cognition therefore doing it is it is
4190400	4198080	serving the the the the free energy principle in other words it's minimizing homeostatic errors it
4198080	4204080	means that is in other words it is it is reversing negative effects and turning them into positive
4204080	4210560	effects that's so affect which is the demand for mental work is a demand for predictive work
4211280	4218960	and the predictive work is what our cognition is all about so I've given you a very broad brush
4218960	4224880	stroke sketch there but that's what we worked out together in that in that first paper that we wrote
4224880	4232320	together which I then expanded into my book it's showing that you know I said I don't believe that
4232320	4237040	we've solved the hard problem but I believe we've given a good clue as to which direction we should
4237040	4245440	be going in that is a monistic account it's a it's a it's a tractable quantifiable statistical
4245440	4252000	mechanical account of the the the machinery of the mind and brain which is an information
4252000	4259840	processing machinery in the service of minimizing free energy in order to maintain the organisms
4259840	4266640	within their viable bounds so that they can survive that's it so some more I mean like
4267680	4272480	you're taking a physicalist monist account of this what are your thoughts and then other theories
4272480	4277200	of consciousness in terms of philosophical theories let's take panpsychism for example
4277200	4284800	or idealism what are your thoughts on those types of theories I think panpsychism is a little easier
4284800	4296160	to deal with than idealism so let's start with the problem of other minds which is the big problem
4296160	4302080	when it comes to consciousness science it really is the because conscious states just
4302080	4312000	are subjective states you can only ever know your own so we start there this this this might be
4312000	4316640	considered a really simplistic argument against panpsychism but it's the one that I start with
4317440	4322880	I can't know whether computers are conscious and tables are conscious and walls are conscious and
4322880	4330720	rocks are conscious you know I do know I'm conscious so now am I conscious of everything
4330720	4337040	that's going on inside of me no I'm only conscious of things that are going inside of my brain
4337040	4344320	my brain the brain states are only the conscious of other bodily states to the extent that those
4344320	4351360	other bodily organs are represented in the brain so so the brain and this this is not just a
4352320	4358160	commonsensical argument it's an empirical demonstrable fact you never lose consciousness
4358160	4363280	by removing any part of the body other than removing the brain if you lose consciousness by
4363280	4368960	removing the heart it's because the heart is no longer perfusing the brain you know etc so it's
4368960	4374880	like clearly the case that consciousness is in the brain and so you know all of the other bodily
4374880	4382240	processes are not conscious I empirically I can tell you that in my own case you know there's the
4382240	4387200	only way I get to know about and there's a hell of a lot of processes which never become conscious
4387920	4395440	like blood pressure regulation for example you know it's going on all the time thank god for that
4395440	4400960	but you know there's no conscious why is there no consciousness involved in that by the way
4400960	4406000	it's because it's entirely predictable you can't leave that to reflexes you know there's
4406000	4410080	there's there's no novel situations there that you have to feel your way through
4411120	4417760	so panpsychism if you take if you take as your starting point well you know the only thing I can
4417760	4424400	know empirically is what I am conscious of well I know even in my own case there's a hell of a
4424400	4433040	lot going on within the outer surface of this thing called Mark's arms that Mark's arms is not
4433040	4438080	conscious of so you could start then saying well of course it is possible that your muscles are
4438080	4443120	conscious of themselves and they're not reporting it to you and then you know then you should start
4443120	4449760	getting into into Never Never Land because yeah that's possible I mean anything's possible
4449760	4456160	it's possible you know that you know that that pigs can fly but I've never seen one you know and
4457440	4464000	so you know that's my argument against panpsychism now I'll take that's a very simplistic argument
4464000	4469280	because it's and I start with that one because it's an empirical one it's the only empirical one
4469280	4474560	because you have to start in your own case even within the brain Tevin there's a hell of a lot
4474560	4480400	of brain activity brain structures which the activity of which we never become conscious of
4480400	4487680	you know so so consciousness seems to be something quite special limited to very particular kinds of
4487680	4495360	structures and so you know then I that's another argument another way of tackling the problem
4495920	4501680	of panpsychism is you say well let's look at the mechanism what these parts of the brain
4501680	4507280	that we know are generating conscious states like these homeostatic brain stem mechanisms
4507280	4514640	let's look at what you know what they're doing there's a very particular kind of functionality
4514640	4521520	there a very specific mechanism which is not you know you don't find it in everything there are
4521520	4528240	many things which exist which are not displaying active inference in other words they're not
4528720	4535360	trying to model their environments in order to in order to persist and you know if that is the
4535360	4541840	mechanism of the one and only knowable form of consciousness which is ours you know we we know
4541840	4548480	that the the brain stem mechanisms that generate our consciousness they seem to be doing this kind
4548480	4554240	of thing we can then look to every other creature that has similar mechanisms which by the way is
4554240	4561200	all vertebrates and we can make testable predictions we can say I predict if I stimulate dorsal
4561200	4569280	periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish you know it it won't like it it will avoid the stimulus if I
4569280	4575520	stimulate the the ventral periaqueductal gray in a zebrafish it will like it and it will approach
4575520	4581600	the stimulus and the prediction is confirmed so you know that's that's that's and that happens
4581600	4587600	every time in every creature that has the same architecture as us that we know generates
4587600	4593280	affective basic feeling states in us all the evidence suggests that they're doing the same
4593280	4598880	thing in these other creatures and also that they can make choices you know the the behavior of the
4598880	4604480	animals is consistent with our understanding and then there are other creatures which don't have the
4604480	4612720	same architecture like cephalopods and insects and so on there I'm less sure that they're conscious
4613520	4619200	you know I'm not saying they're not I'm just less sure and I I use the criterion of well
4619200	4625280	can they make choices can they feel their way through a novel situation and survive it and
4625280	4632240	they can so you know well possibly they're conscious too but there are many creatures
4632800	4639760	simple simpler creatures like bacteria whose behavior is completely predictable there's you see
4639760	4646480	no new ideas coming from a bacterium you know the only way that they that they advance is is
4647280	4654240	through over generations through through natural selection you there's there's no there's no new
4654240	4662880	problem solving you know so I'm saying that even in living things Tevin starting with myself there
4662880	4670480	lots of my own bodily processes that I know from my own case are not conscious and then I know which
4670480	4677120	parts are generative of consciousness I know what those do roughly speaking I know what their
4677120	4688800	functionality is when I test in other animals the prediction arising from the the the inference
4688800	4696160	that those structures and that mechanism is what gives rise to two feelings the predictions are
4696160	4704560	always confirmed where those are not present in living creatures that those structures and those
4704560	4711360	functions the prediction again is always confirmed that they don't show the functionality that that
4711360	4719280	seems to underpin consciousness in us then you know that's so so compelling but then you know to go
4719280	4726560	from that to non-living things I mean to claim that non-living things are conscious it's you just
4726560	4733200	outside of the not only the bounds of testability you're outside of the bounds of reasonableness
4733200	4740720	just like why would you say that and you know starting from the observables that's where that's
4740720	4746320	the conclusion you just have to arrive at if you start from first principles and you say well
4746320	4753760	it's possible that there's something it is like to be anything then well yeah it's possible
4754720	4760800	but anything's possible I don't see any reason why one would hold that view
4760800	4767200	unless one starts from the assumption that consciousness is a fundamental property of the
4767200	4774400	universe which I have to say is not not not different from the idea of God yeah that at the
4774400	4780800	time of the Big Bang there was a consciousness maybe but that's outside of science you know to
4780800	4785600	those kinds of claims that if you think about it that's something that people like Julia Tononi
4785600	4792320	and Christoph Koch have done fundamentally taking consciousness as phi they can't get as far as
4792320	4799840	fundamental and doing a lot of but I think they did it in a different way so so like let's take
4799840	4809680	Tononi's case as you've just said the the the idea that consciousness can be can be can be
4809680	4819360	objectified as as a quantity of of integrated information processing if you hold that theory
4820320	4827200	then it leads you down some some rabbit holes that you then have to go down you know because if you
4827200	4834000	say well okay the amount of integration in the information processing is what determines the
4834000	4841440	degree of consciousness then you have to say well there's no there's no you know as long as there's
4841440	4847120	any amount of information processing there must be some degree of consciousness and conversely
4847120	4854000	you have to say anything that has the requisite you know number must be conscious therefore
4854880	4863040	any highly integrated information processing system like the internet you know my theory
4863040	4871200	with me if I'm Tononi my theory requires me to say yep the internet's conscious yes so
4873360	4876880	fundamentally information at this point which is how a lot of people are seeing it
4877440	4885520	then in essence everything has a level of fire yes everything has that you know what's what's
4885520	4893120	what's a curious little historical fact is that charmers you know I'll tell you something
4893120	4898400	else which is another curious fact many people who bang on about the hard problem of consciousness
4898400	4905680	have never read charmers' paper you know if you actually read charmers' paper there's this thing
4905680	4910560	that I'm going to tell you now there's another thing which I'll tell you as an aside at the end
4910560	4915440	of the paper charmers says the hard problem is hard but there's no reason to believe that it will
4915440	4923280	forever remain insoluble and he then you know so he's saying it is soluble and and and he even goes
4923280	4929760	so far as to then present a possible solution and this is the thing I was going to say
4930640	4939920	his possible solution is that all information has a subjective aspect and that is consciousness
4940720	4946000	and it has an objective aspect which is this mechanistic thing that we see you know it depends
4946000	4950720	what kind of substrate you're using but like our computers there they are they're processing
4950720	4957280	information but the being of the computer says charmers you know because it's an information
4957280	4963040	processing device that there is some small amount of consciousness associated with it because the
4964080	4969440	internal aspect of information is consciousness therefore because information processing has
4969440	4974640	been going on since forever consciousness has been around since forever and it's a fundamental
4974640	4980720	property of the universe so I don't want to lose sight of the aside I've made there please note
4980720	4987120	charmers says the hard problem can be solved he said it himself in 1995 so all these people who
4987120	4993520	revere this problem has been completely insoluble that it's a metaphysical problem which can never
4993520	4999680	be solved by physical science that's not what charmers said but he then proposes his own theory
4999680	5004720	which is a panpsychist theory which is when it's something approaching a panpsychist theory he
5004720	5013840	doesn't say everything is conscious he says all information is conscious which is a which is a
5013840	5020240	reasonable place to start because what we know about the brain and the mind what they have in
5020240	5025760	common is that they're processing information you know and not everything in the universe is
5025760	5031280	processing information so you know that's why it's approaches or heads in the direction of
5031280	5038640	but now here's the rub for me if you read so information in Shannon's sense
5040000	5044800	which is the sense in which charmers uses the word he actually says so in that paper
5046720	5055040	so Shannon's paper which brought information into the concept of information into into physics into
5055520	5063280	the idea that there's a quantifiable thing called information and that it has causal property
5063280	5073040	does stuff you know in the physical world that for that realization and conceptualization of it
5073040	5079360	we have to thank Claude Shannon and you read his paper which was published in if I remember
5079360	5086640	correctly 1948 it's called the title says it all it says a mathematical theory of communication
5087360	5093040	it's not a theory of information it's a theory of communication because why information has to
5093040	5100560	have a source and a receiver it's information doesn't just exist information something is only
5100560	5108160	informative to a receiver of that information so information and I'm speaking pure Shannon here
5108640	5116880	information is an answer to a question you know it's is is the coin toss heads or tails you know
5116880	5125200	is it heads yes or no that's one or zero you know that is the binary digit that is the bit that is
5125200	5132160	the quantum how we quantify information so how many questions I have to ask determines how much
5132160	5140400	information I receive from from my interaction with with my environment so this information
5140400	5150560	exchange is a question asking and answering exercise and the crucial point is that the information is
5150560	5160240	subjective it's received by me who asked the question the the the system doesn't and a system
5160240	5166720	doesn't contain an objective amount of information it depends on what question you're asking of the
5166720	5176960	system so you know so the the very same I mean if for example there's a bag of of balls and we
5176960	5182960	you and I both know that the yellow red and blue ones in there and we know that they're 30 balls
5183840	5190240	I know that 10 of them are red you don't know that that that bag contains more information
5190240	5196320	for you than it does for me you know so it depends on it depends on how so information is a measure
5196320	5205440	of of uncertainty the more the more unpredictable is the outcome of an event the more information
5205440	5211920	that carries for the observer of the event and you and I might have more or less prior knowledge
5212000	5218720	so that will be more or less predictable or unpredictable to us so so the why this is also
5218720	5225120	important is that when you speak about information whether you're charmers or you to know me you
5225120	5230880	have to ask yourself the question of well who is the recipient of this information and so you're
5230880	5236720	back to the question of well where's the subject with like in the internet where's the subject
5236720	5244480	or the conscious subject of all of this information processing it's integrated you know for what it's
5245200	5251280	so it's just like a very weird way of thinking about I think to say that information in and of
5251280	5258880	itself you know is is or the integration of that information in some objective arms length sense
5258880	5265440	you know is is the mechanism of consciousness I think misses the point so so my way of thinking
5265440	5270720	about it which I tried in a very brief and rough and ready way a few minutes ago when I
5270720	5278880	spoke about Carl Friston and my work on this problem our starting point was well an infam
5278880	5286480	a self-organizing system which has to predict the behavior of the world has to ask questions of the
5286480	5293600	world you know is if I were to do this what would happen kind if I were to do this what would
5293600	5301520	happen to my free energy is basically the question that every every biological self-organizing system
5301520	5309520	has to constantly ask so the information processing that gives rise to feeling in my view is that kind
5309520	5316240	of information it's not all information it's infam it's it's it's it's it's it's it's the
5316240	5323280	answering of questions by systems that give a damn about that they need to ask questions and they
5323280	5330640	give a damn about the answers that is I think the kind of system that is the information processing
5330640	5340080	within which can can can can can feasibly or plausibly rather be be conceptualized as a as a
5340080	5348640	sentient system I must like for example mark on when I came into this podcast so when I first
5348720	5354160	started thinking about consciousness I'm very much on a similar page as you I think I think we're both
5354160	5359520	very monist physicalist we're trying to reduce it trying to figure out a nice biological approach
5359520	5365680	to it but I must say someone who came very close to really changing that my mind on that a little bit
5365680	5373200	was Donald Hoffman I don't know if you're familiar with his work yes I'm not in detail but yes I know
5373200	5379040	the basic ideas yeah so it's pretty fascinating to see that a lot of physicists nowadays are
5379040	5385760	starting to show that space time itself is not a concept that we can actually understand or
5386400	5392480	really even perceive in any real way and and therefore well now when he takes it further
5392480	5398320	by obviously making the his own conclusion that conscious agents must be fundamental
5399200	5403680	so that's a separate story but what is a bit strange is the fact that physicists are not
5403680	5409520	showing us that the reality that we're trying to reduce is not a reality that is possibly
5409520	5414640	reducible because we see we have absolutely no access to this reality what do you think about that
5414640	5427120	well um so if you if you you or any of our viewers read my book in in in the penultimate
5427120	5436240	chapter it's titled back to the cortex and there I speak about so the most of the book is about
5436240	5441680	effort it's about you know this fundamental form of consciousness and how it is generated and
5441680	5446640	what that what the implication oh sorry it's not the penultimate chapter it's the third last chapter
5447440	5452640	the second last chapter is on charmers and the hard problem the last chapter is on artificial
5452640	5460160	consciousness the third last chapter is on this this this this question of of cognitive and
5460160	5466080	perceptual consciousness you know the the type of consciousness that that we have for for the most
5466400	5473520	part focused on and there I make the argument which is again not not a a novel argument it's
5473520	5479040	it's very similar to Hoffman's although I don't cite him because actually I'm embarrassed to admit
5479040	5485600	I didn't yet know his work at the time that I was writing that book but I was aware of other
5485600	5493280	people in the predictive processing tradition you know like like Andy Clark and and and and
5493280	5499680	Jacob Huey uh speaking about you know perception as controlled hallucination
5500640	5507760	and that you know the the reality and and Dan Dennett uh you know the this whole thing of the
5507760	5514640	the use illusion and so on and I find yeah and Neil Seth I mean that whole group of him
5514640	5521280	and Neil Seth is in that same tradition and Neil Seth extends it from the extra receptive
5521280	5528160	domain to the inter receptive domain in very interesting ways um actually if we have time
5528160	5535520	I will come back to that because I think that the that that that affect is not the same as
5535520	5542320	interception you know I I have a little a little quibble about that but I don't think it's important
5542320	5548640	for our present purposes so what I'm saying is that in that tradition with although Hoffman
5548640	5553760	doesn't come up from a predictive processing background I think it's it's it's it's entirely
5554960	5563760	compatible you know the idea that the reality that we are that we are acting in is a representation
5563760	5570560	of the of of something in my language beyond the mark of blankets all I can know is my blanket
5570560	5581600	states and that that is a that is a statistical generative model you know of of of the of reality
5581600	5587840	minutes you could even say can't it's a cantium view you know I have no problem with that whatsoever
5588880	5596160	so but you know I don't think it's a and is anything spooky about that and and I don't think
5596160	5604960	that it requires us I mean all you need to say is the retina the retinal ronson cones
5605520	5613360	light waves impinge on the retina and the those cells transduced those light waves into nerve
5613360	5621920	impulses so what we um you know you never actually are you're not that you're not receiving light
5621920	5628400	waves you are representing them as spike trains you know that that's enough for me it can see
5628400	5633280	there's nothing spooky there you know and those spike trains all they are are ones and zeros so
5633280	5641520	from that I then have to infer the the the the causes of these of these sensations in other
5641520	5647840	words of these signals and I and I model it you know I'm perfectly fine with that
5650160	5656880	so I but but you know I don't see why that leads to all kinds of spooky conclusions that's
5656880	5663360	that's there are few steps beyond that that I don't think follow when I spoke to Donald when I
5663360	5668000	asked him about it because I mean a lot of us in biology in neuroscience we know that we don't
5668000	5673680	see reality every radical sort of truth we sort of represent something but his physics and his
5673680	5678880	work with a couple other mathematicians show that spacetime is fundamentally completely different
5678880	5684800	so we're not even seeing a mild representation or like something similar to reality or close
5684800	5690480	it's completely different but he does eventually say that however his conclusion that consciousness
5690480	5695760	must be fundamental is something he's willing to accept might be wrong he's just trying to figure
5695760	5700880	out a different solution so he actually doesn't take it to that point where he he claims that
5700880	5706480	consciousness is fundamental he's just trying to find some relative because reality is the problem
5706480	5712000	in essence we don't we know a lot about mind but we know almost nothing about matter pretty much
5713760	5721200	yeah I wouldn't but by the way as you can see my lights came on so so hallelujah the the load
5721200	5727840	shedding has ended for I hope my doesn't see what happens yes let's hope there's not a reciprocal
5727840	5735680	interaction between where you are and where I am but look there's there's much that I could say
5736640	5747840	about about quantum physics and that the seriously strange nature of reality and how
5747840	5754560	utterly different it is from the from the high level average states that we are able to represent
5755360	5762240	and so on you know that and those things all interest me very much I I will just say about
5762240	5770800	that that the the the approach that Carl Friston and I take which is the free energy principle
5770800	5777680	approach it's called variational free energy this is this is you know there's there's
5777680	5783200	thermodynamic free energy and there's chemical free energy and then there's informational free
5783200	5792400	energy and and some people no less than chains for example thinks the informational free energy is
5792400	5802080	is the fundamental explanation of the thing the all of those are probabilistic it's a probabilistic
5802080	5807920	theory the variational free energy has to do with statistical mechanics it has to do with
5807920	5814400	probabilities when I was speaking earlier about you know your uncertainty and the palpating of
5814400	5820240	your uncertainty and all of that we're talking about probabilities and so I think that there's a
5820240	5827600	very deep link is that there's a I think that the the whole free energy principle inherits from
5827600	5836880	the traditions that that have replaced Newtonian physics so there's there's that in all of that
5836880	5843280	interests me very much but I in the time remaining to us I would rather because I'm aware we have
5843280	5849840	limited time remaining I would rather start with this observation which is which is more concrete
5850720	5861120	you know I'm a clinician I work with neurological and neurosurgical patients every day and so I
5861120	5868320	witness you know what happens if a piece of your brain is missing and I've been around for a sufficient
5868320	5874800	number of years to have seen many many many patients with the same piece of their brain missing
5874880	5881280	and the curious or the interesting fact is that they all misperceive reality in the same way you
5881280	5889600	know that that's for example an excellent example is right parietal low patients who
5892000	5897920	they paralyzed on the left side and they believe they're not and it's patently obvious that they
5897920	5903840	are you know but they say no I'm not and so you know you see one and another and another and
5903840	5908560	eventually you realize hang you know if you haven't got a right parietal low you just there's a piece
5908560	5913760	of reality that you just don't get and never can get why because you've got a piece of your
5913760	5920400	brain missing that you need in order to be able to get that so you can from that observation
5921120	5927680	you can you can extrapolate that well all of us have a piece of our brains missing in the sense
5927680	5933520	that you know we we only have this what if we were to all have an additional lobe or an additional
5933520	5940080	hemisphere how much more would we be able to to register and compute and comprehend you know
5940080	5947920	than we currently do so so all I'm saying there is that I again on the basis of my own empirical
5948480	5956320	clinical experience you know I'm totally ready to believe that we have a horribly limited
5956880	5967600	conception and perception of reality I'm totally sympathetic with that however you know we are
5967600	5973040	where we are so you can either say okay I'm going to become a mystic you know because I don't do
5973040	5979120	anything I'm just going to believe everything or you know it's all you all you say well you know
5979920	5988720	given given the limited nature of my instrument you know I must do the best I can to to to expand
5988720	5997360	its bounds to test my hypotheses and you know be ready to find that my predictions were wrong
5997360	6004560	and I must update my predictive model and so on I didn't see what else we can do I so so so although
6004640	6012800	I am totally aware of the limits of the of the human brain it's just obvious from what I've just
6012800	6020960	said and of the limits of science because it's a method it's a it's a method ultimately you have
6020960	6026320	to have we were talking about idealism and never got back to it but you know ultimately you have
6026320	6033360	to have faith and I use that word advisedly that there is some reality beyond what I'm perceiving
6033360	6041120	that I'm probing and that you know I that I that the the the inferences that I draw
6041840	6049280	and the models that I build each time are less bad you know that that I that they they they
6049280	6058480	of course they're not reality of course they are a pathetic you know scrap of what we are
6058480	6065360	capable of grasping of the nature of the universe really but it's but we're making progress each
6065360	6073280	of us in our own lives and as a species over generations we have less bad models less less
6073280	6080400	bad understandings and but it is all based on faith you know that that this method is a reasonable
6080400	6087840	way of of proceeding um it is a matter you know you rarely can say well because it's so limited
6087840	6094720	because it's so so um unknowable reality in itself and all of that I'm just going to give up
6095280	6100400	that that's another approach that but I would rather take the scientific approach I just think
6100400	6106080	we need to have humility as scientists and recognize how how little we know but the very
6106080	6116960	physics that Hoffman um um sites as evidence for how little we know is the product of that method
6116960	6124080	you know that it has led us to know that reality is weird and it is very different from from how
6124080	6129920	we perceive it but but you know Hoffman couldn't have couldn't have come to that view if it wasn't
6129920	6135360	for the application of the scientific method to arrive at that physics in the first place when
6135360	6139360	Hoffman when Hoffman so apparently he did the calculations and he and he asked like what are
6139360	6144880	the probabilities of that our perception of reality would give us an accurate representation
6144880	6150800	of reality based on natural selection and fitness and actually evolving and surviving
6150800	6155280	and when you when you when you notice that the probability came to zero apparently had to take
6155280	6160400	a seat because he's very much a scientist and he loves the scientific method natural selection
6160400	6165440	all of it so you're here to take a seat because it like messed him up with his fundamental
6165440	6171200	perception of reality because he was very much materialistic thinker in terms of consciousness
6171200	6177840	and so it's on that note if what are you you spoke about faith there Mark I mean part of
6177840	6182800	this podcast also is for the people questioning these big topics often are trying to also find
6182800	6187920	meaning and purpose while not understanding what's really going on what are what are your
6187920	6195520	religious or spiritual beliefs and first of all I want to come back one step in our conversation
6196240	6203840	to this materialist the idea of materialist and mind versus matter and so on you know I to me
6203840	6210240	mind and matter are the same as what I was saying earlier when I said that there's a there's a
6210240	6218320	dual aspect to our monistic essence matter for me is an aspect in other words I don't think
6218320	6224000	matter is a fundamental property I think matter is a way of representing things and and that's
6224000	6229760	entirely consistent also with the the the the recent physics that we were talking about earlier
6230480	6239760	matter is not a fundamental property of the universe and the the the the so I'm not a
6239760	6248960	materialist this segues into your question now you know I I'm not a materialist I'm a dual aspect
6248960	6256400	monist who says that the material and the ideal that these are two different ways of knowing
6256400	6261840	of perceiving something which is ultimately unknowable and that's what you and I have just
6261840	6267040	been talking about the limits of science the humility that scientists have to have in the face
6267680	6277360	you know of the of the of the massive uncertainties in the universe so so my spiritual position
6279360	6285600	arises from that in other words it's one of humility I'm sorry maybe you've got the impression of me
6285600	6295360	as a kind of a pompous or noisy guy I don't know it might be hard for you to to equate
6295360	6303360	my my personality with humility but it really it is as a scientist and as as a spiritual being
6304160	6311120	my not only is it my belief that I even find solace in it Tevin I find solace in
6311120	6317600	what I don't know think I what I know I don't know you know these things are way beyond my can
6318480	6322720	questions like what happens after I die they're not empirical questions I can't
6323440	6330000	any prediction I come up with I can't test it until I'm dead you know so so and I accept that
6330000	6337600	and I say again I take I take comfort in it is there a god you know is there an afterlife
6337600	6345520	what does it all mean you know I genuinely don't know and and and so it's a kind of an
6345520	6353120	agnostic position but it is not a materialist and not an atheist position yes but but within that
6354080	6360640	within those parameters and I'm sorry I'm sort of repeating myself I then have to say okay
6360640	6367760	given those limitations what is to be done and I say well you've got to do the best you can with
6367760	6376000	what you've got and so you know so the best I've been able to come up with is science you know I've
6376000	6382720	read okay which of these things you know which of these things gives me the greatest confidence that
6382720	6388240	well yeah I might find answers or at least I might find less ignorance that's that's the
6388240	6396640	approach that that that I take and fully fully aware of the limits of the you know the limits of
6396640	6402160	the conclusions that I can come to now within that frame of reference and this is probably
6402160	6407120	be the last thing that we'll talk about I in other words using a scientific
6408000	6415520	methodology a scientific epistemology to to try to address these questions
6416960	6424960	I I think that our values you know I was talking much earlier in our conversation about
6424960	6430560	the fundamental value system of living things is that it's good to survive and bad not to
6431520	6442800	that that built upon those fundamental values or other also phenotypic values you know like
6442800	6450240	it's like it's it's bad to be in danger that's fear you know it's it's it's irritating and
6450240	6457520	frustrating to have an impeding things preventing you from that's that's rage you know that it's
6457520	6463600	bad to separate a little dependent creature from its caregiver you know that that's got to do with
6463600	6474560	attachment bonds and so on I think that these evolved endophenotypes is a word that's sometimes
6474560	6480560	used for them that they are they are basic values that we have just because we're living things and
6480560	6487360	that they are then more elaborated values that we have just because we are mammals and I think
6487360	6494320	that these provide and you know it's famously said that you can't derive an orc from an is
6494320	6500640	but I think that from these is is we can derive some orcs like I've just done bad to separate bad
6500640	6508480	to bad to injure people or injure living things it's bad to it's bad to for sentient things rather
6508480	6515120	it's bad to to separate mammals from their caregivers it's it's bad to to to you know
6515120	6521920	unnecessarily frustrated and be sentient beings and so on I think that our much more elaborated
6521920	6530480	human value systems which of course have evolved also to to to manage much more artificial
6530480	6538080	environments for which we were not evolutionarily prepared like like like like you know
6539040	6545280	agricultural and permanent settlements and and everything that flowed from that
6545840	6552320	in a private property and all of that there's a lot more that's that the values that we've
6552320	6558240	built on top of those phenotypic values but I think those phenotypic values and biological
6558240	6564480	values are the starting point of all of our values all of our values they're not they're not the
6564480	6572560	values of the universe they are our the values of us living things who have skin in the game
6573920	6579040	I look I love that mark I mean look you didn't come across as pompous or arrogant in any way
6579040	6582960	and neither does you I'm relieved I loved reading it I enjoyed it so much I mean
6583520	6588480	there's something Raymond Tellis once said I like this term he says he's ontologically agnostic
6589120	6594800	but I mean epistemologically we trust science the most is what what you're basically trying to say
6595360	6600720	that's right that's right no Mark thank you so much for this conversation I really enjoyed
6600720	6608560	myself thank you more words from your side well thank you very much and apologies again as you
6608560	6615600	can see I've lost my this is uh this is how unpredictable and uncertain the world is yeah
6615600	6622000	but I'm very glad to be speaking to you as a fellow South African and I'm glad that we are both
6622000	6630080	here these are the problems that belong to me and I'm very happy to be grappling with them
6630080	6636720	yeah and proud to know that that that that you're a South African your podcast is just great
6636720	6639840	thanks Stephen for inviting me
