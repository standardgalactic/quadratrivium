00:00.000 --> 00:15.680
Helen, I've been trying to think of a way to start this podcast interview by giving you

00:15.680 --> 00:20.520
the best opportunity to explain your view. And I think the best way to start is how I

00:20.520 --> 00:25.000
often start with certain people. I did this with Keith, I mean with illusionism. I'm going

00:25.000 --> 00:31.440
to do this with panpsychism. What I want you to do is give me a brief philosophical history

00:31.440 --> 00:37.880
of the mind-body problem from your side, from how you grew to listen to this problem, to understand

00:37.880 --> 00:44.640
it and tell me which philosophers or scientists have played the biggest roles in shaping your

00:44.640 --> 00:49.800
current view. Because I think it gives us a great understanding of how you came to this view. I

00:49.800 --> 00:54.800
know Berkeley is obviously going to be one of them, but I mean it's a great way to understand how

00:54.800 --> 01:00.160
your thought processes have formed over the years. Yeah, okay, so that's a very interesting

01:00.160 --> 01:07.600
question. So I think I first became introduced to consciousness. Actually, my dad introduced me

01:07.600 --> 01:13.960
to the knowledge argument when I was still in high school. And so and I loved that. And I had very,

01:13.960 --> 01:20.720
very strong dualist intuitions right from the get-go. So my first philosophy of mind class that I

01:20.720 --> 01:25.640
took spent a lot of time discussing different particular physicalist theories and the minutia

01:25.640 --> 01:29.920
of those theories. And I spent the whole time sitting there like, what, this is completely

01:29.920 --> 01:35.160
missing the point, right? This is missing consciousness. Where are the feels coming from?

01:35.160 --> 01:42.200
So I spent all my time sort of sitting there idly drawing little pictures and diagrams and

01:42.200 --> 01:48.600
concluded based on this that there could be no such thing as mental causation. And what I was

01:48.600 --> 01:54.120
drawing out was these standard diagrams that have been used to support epiphenomenalism. So the

01:54.120 --> 02:00.200
idea that, you know, there's the physical world and every physical event is caused by a previous

02:00.200 --> 02:06.720
physical event. And those physical events cause conscious experiences, but there's sort of not

02:06.720 --> 02:11.360
any room in the picture for the conscious experiences to do causal work. The conscious

02:11.360 --> 02:15.560
experiences are just sort of an extra that explains the feelings, but nothing more. So,

02:16.280 --> 02:23.480
so I quickly became concluded that epiphenomenalism was true and my philosophy professor spent the

02:23.480 --> 02:31.400
rest of my undergraduate career time to disabuse me of this and never succeeded. So my I while I'm

02:31.400 --> 02:37.040
currently working on idealism and developing an idealist view of the nature of reality and the

02:37.040 --> 02:42.960
nature of the mind body problem. I'm actually not not necessarily a committed idealist. I'm sort of a

02:42.960 --> 02:49.480
committed antiphysicalist. So I have very strong intuitions that consciousness can't be reduced to

02:50.400 --> 02:55.640
can't be reduced to something non conscious. And not only intuitions, I think these intuitions can be

02:55.640 --> 03:01.160
developed into good arguments to this effect. But at this point in my life, I'm sort of neutral

03:01.160 --> 03:09.720
between dualism of an epiphenomenalist sort and idealism of an epiphenomenalist sort. So I mean,

03:09.720 --> 03:13.360
I guess you asked for people who had influenced me on this journey. And it's a little bit funny,

03:13.360 --> 03:20.840
because I think I actually kind of came fully formed to these views that I have prior to reading

03:20.840 --> 03:24.440
people. And then it was subsequently I started reading people like Dave Chalmers and going, ah,

03:24.440 --> 03:30.360
he's said everything I want to say only way better than I could say it. And Thomas does have that

03:31.280 --> 03:33.120
Yes, is very, very frustrating.

03:36.400 --> 03:44.440
But so I sort of I began my career as a dualist, and I put no stock whatsoever in the truth of

03:44.440 --> 03:51.720
idealism. It sounded like a bonkers theory. I met Howard Robinson, who is a contemporary idealist

03:51.720 --> 03:58.280
philosopher when I was in grad school, and I was blown away that he was actually an idealist. And I

03:58.280 --> 04:03.560
didn't think there were any such people. But subsequently, it actually I started thinking

04:03.560 --> 04:08.600
about idealism more carefully as a result of two things. One was thinking about just reading

04:08.600 --> 04:14.680
Barkley when I was in grad school and thinking about abstract general ideas. So this is sort of

04:14.680 --> 04:20.040
the question of that the early modern philosophers were interested in of how it is that we can have

04:20.040 --> 04:25.560
thoughts that latch on to not just a particular thing, but latch on to many things that are very

04:25.560 --> 04:30.520
diverse in different ways. So how we can have a thought, a particular thought about triangles.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.720
That's not about any particular kind of triangle, but just triangularity in general. And so that

04:35.720 --> 04:39.960
led me to reading a lot of Barkley and the early modern philosophers and sort of increased my

04:39.960 --> 04:45.720
interest in idealism. And at the same time, I was being exposed to work contemporary work in the

04:45.720 --> 04:52.440
philosophy of perception. And these people called naive realists. And naive realism is this view

04:53.400 --> 05:00.600
about perception where the thought is that somebody should start with representationalism

05:00.600 --> 05:04.760
because I think it's the more intuitive view. So for a representationalist, there's this world

05:04.760 --> 05:11.000
out there and light bounces off of the object and enters my eye and stuff happens in my brain

05:11.000 --> 05:18.840
and causes me to represent a mug that's before me. But what it is that I'm sort of directly

05:18.920 --> 05:23.880
grasping is this thing that my brain generates, this experience of the mug, this representation of

05:23.880 --> 05:28.280
the mug. I don't directly grasp the mug. I sort of grasp the mug that I'm looking at or anything

05:28.280 --> 05:34.760
in the world in an indirect kind of way. And naive realists say, no, no, the intuitive view is that

05:34.760 --> 05:39.720
vision is kind of like touch. We sort of reach out and we sort of grasp the object. And the object

05:39.720 --> 05:46.360
is a part of our thoughts. And listening to this in grad school, and I found this completely

05:46.360 --> 05:53.080
just insane sounding. How is it that my thoughts, my conscious experiences could have things like

05:53.080 --> 06:00.760
cups and trees and computers as a part of them? That made no sense to me at all. And it made no

06:00.760 --> 06:06.840
sense until I started thinking, well, but if the whole world is experiences, if the whole world is

06:06.840 --> 06:12.600
made up out of consciousness, then maybe it's not quite so insane. And that sort of led me down the

06:12.600 --> 06:17.320
road of interest and idealism and just sort of playing with it as a view, not because I thought

06:17.320 --> 06:23.080
it was true, but because it seemed interesting. And I was curious, is it a view that could be

06:23.080 --> 06:28.120
defended? And actually, the more I sort of played with it, and the more I thought about it, the

06:28.120 --> 06:34.680
more I realized there actually are some genuinely good things to say in favor of this view. And I've

06:34.680 --> 06:41.240
sort of argued myself into giving it significant credence, although I'm not a committed idealist.

06:42.600 --> 06:48.360
I mean, there's so many idealists today, giving such great arguments. I mean, if you think of people

06:48.360 --> 06:53.400
like Bernardo Kastrup out there, you've got someone like Donald Hoffman who does conscious

06:53.400 --> 06:57.400
realism, but I mean, it's a form of idealism, in a sense, if you when you think about it,

06:57.400 --> 07:02.520
you take consciousness to be this fundamental reality. I mean, you're talking about a difference

07:02.520 --> 07:08.040
in the nature of consciousness. I think a great way to go with this is let's go with one of your

07:08.040 --> 07:13.560
papers is called dissolving, I think type B physicalism. Yeah. Remembering the title

07:13.560 --> 07:18.440
curriculum. Let's dissolve physicalism. Tell me why that's just go with it.

07:20.360 --> 07:26.920
Well, I don't know that we actually can dissolve physicalism. So I kind of, I think there are

07:26.920 --> 07:33.640
certain versions of physicalism that don't work. But I actually am inclined to think that there is

07:33.640 --> 07:40.040
a plurality of metaphysical views out there that actually are each, not just internally

07:40.040 --> 07:44.760
coherent, like from the inside, you can stamp your feet and say, no, I refuse to listen to

07:44.760 --> 07:50.440
anything you say, but that are sort of deeply like internally plausible, I guess is maybe the way to

07:50.440 --> 07:58.920
put it. So let me try to think how to express this. So I think it's, it's well known that

07:59.880 --> 08:05.720
you can for, you can take and you can just refuse to listen to the other people's sides

08:05.720 --> 08:11.240
arguments, you can say, I disagree with that premise, I refuse to accept that. And as a result,

08:11.240 --> 08:16.280
I don't have to accept your argument, I'm going to hold on to my, to my position. So, you know,

08:16.280 --> 08:19.800
when you have something like a physicalist faced with a knowledge argument, the physicalist could

08:19.800 --> 08:26.200
say, look, I just don't think that Mary, when she sees red for the first time, learns anything.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.320
I think that's, I think that's the wrong way of thinking about it. I don't think she'd be fooled

08:29.320 --> 08:36.600
if you showed her a blue banana. But I think that you could also be a physicalist who actually

08:36.600 --> 08:43.400
genuinely accepts the intuitive starting point, and nevertheless, can still defend from the inside

08:43.400 --> 08:50.440
that viewpoint. So I think, and I argue in that paper at the end of the paper, the idea is that

08:50.520 --> 08:55.160
it's a kind of mysterious. So the idea is that we,

08:57.880 --> 09:03.400
we have a particular sort of cognitive structure to our minds. And that cognitive structure is

09:03.400 --> 09:08.120
essentially sort of limiting to what it is, what kinds of things it is that we can understand.

09:08.680 --> 09:13.880
And depending on sort of the formatting of how it is that our brain goes about making sense of

09:13.880 --> 09:19.960
consciousness in sort of conscious terms versus physical stuff, sort of using physical terms,

09:19.960 --> 09:26.520
it may be that our brain just is not set up to be able to match those two kinds of things together.

09:26.520 --> 09:31.080
But it doesn't, that doesn't mean that it's impossible for these two things to be matched

09:31.080 --> 09:36.920
up. That could just be a limitation due to kind of like our neural hardware. And so I think that

09:36.920 --> 09:44.440
if a physicalist were to embrace a view like that, that they can simultaneously accept things like

09:44.440 --> 09:50.440
the knowledge argument, except the actual intuitive datum, the datum that Mary as a human being, Mary

09:50.440 --> 09:56.600
as somebody with an art cognitive architecture that works like ours, she would be fooled by a blue

09:56.600 --> 10:01.640
banana. She would learn something new, even if she had all the physical knowledge, but it doesn't

10:01.640 --> 10:06.680
mean that there's something more to consciousness. So I think, I think a physicalist can,

10:07.640 --> 10:11.960
can sort of embrace what the dualist says and still maintain their physicalism.

10:12.440 --> 10:18.200
At the same time, I think that a dualist can embrace a lot of things that a physicalist

10:18.200 --> 10:24.520
wants to throw at them and really listen to them and still not have to be moved. And I similarly

10:24.520 --> 10:28.760
think the same kind of thing for idealism. So I actually think that there's sort of a plurality

10:28.760 --> 10:33.800
of views that they're not just defensible from the inside in that you can say, mean or meaner,

10:33.800 --> 10:38.440
or you know, stick your tongue out at the other side and say, I refuse to accept your starting

10:38.440 --> 10:43.240
points. You can accept the starting points, explain away as needed and come to an internally

10:43.240 --> 10:50.920
plausible view for these very different views. And I kind of think that, sorry, I'm interrupting.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.800
I completely agree with that. I think that when I started this podcast, I had such a specific

10:56.760 --> 11:01.080
thought going into it. What I thought consciousness was, I wrote essays on it as well. It's part of

11:01.080 --> 11:07.080
my dissertation. So I had my own view. But when I listen to people's coherent arguments, the more

11:07.080 --> 11:13.320
you actually try and sympathize or empathize even more with these views, the more you understand

11:13.320 --> 11:19.320
that if you set up a great bunch of assumptions prior to starting the argument, you can really

11:19.320 --> 11:27.880
flow with your argument and you can give something succinct and not Nina Nina. So people can listen

11:27.880 --> 11:33.160
to it. I mean, and you do a great job at this. I think you do a perfect example. You're a perfect

11:33.160 --> 11:38.520
example of someone who can defend idealism with some really coherent arguments and even just

11:38.520 --> 11:42.840
reading your papers. I mean, you've done a great job at that. I think at this point, do you want

11:42.840 --> 11:47.640
to defend your actual position? I mean, what is your position regarding consciousness? What is

11:47.640 --> 11:53.800
consciousness to you, Helen? Okay, so would you like me to talk about consciousness or about

11:53.800 --> 11:57.880
idealism itself? Let's talk about idealism because I mean, we obviously know that that's

11:57.880 --> 12:03.320
like your view on consciousness. Okay, well, in a sense, sorry, I keep I keep sort of,

12:03.320 --> 12:07.240
I sort of agree with what you're saying, but I keep sort of also disagreeing and it's

12:07.240 --> 12:13.800
it's made it a little hard to directly answer the questions. So I think in a sense, I think that

12:13.800 --> 12:21.880
idealism is not itself a view of consciousness or a view of the mind body problem in the way that

12:21.880 --> 12:27.160
like materialism or dualism or panpsychism, those are views that are coming and are

12:27.160 --> 12:32.360
essentially trying to like answer the mind body problem. Whereas idealism, I think is

12:32.360 --> 12:39.080
essentially a view about the nature of the physical world. And the view basically is just

12:39.080 --> 12:43.480
sort of in a nutshell what it takes to be, I guess I should say an idealist of the sort that I'm

12:43.480 --> 12:48.360
interested in. So I think of this as ontological idealism. But what it takes to be an idealist

12:48.360 --> 12:54.600
basically just is to think that the physical world around us, it's real. But what it fundamentally

12:54.600 --> 13:02.920
is, is conscious. It fundamentally is built up out of phenomenology. So I sort of think of this

13:02.920 --> 13:09.400
a little bit by analogy to like reductive physicalism. So reductive physicalists, they want to say,

13:09.400 --> 13:14.440
you know, look, I think consciousness is real. I think there is such a thing as pain. I'm not

13:14.440 --> 13:18.680
trying to do away with pain, I'm trying to give an analysis of it. And this is the analysis.

13:19.240 --> 13:24.360
Pain reduces to some sort of physical state, some sort of brain state, functional state.

13:25.080 --> 13:29.720
Similarly, for the idealist, the idealist wants to say, the physical world is real.

13:29.720 --> 13:35.240
There are rocks, there are stars, there are atoms. But what are they fundamentally? I'm trying to

13:35.240 --> 13:41.480
give an analysis of it. And the analysis is such that it ultimately reduces to phenomenology.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.040
Now, that sort of doesn't answer your question, right? Because you asked me about my view of

13:46.040 --> 13:52.040
consciousness, which I haven't said anything about what consciousness is, what it is that this

13:52.040 --> 13:55.800
is built up out of. You're talking, so we're going metaphysics here, we're talking about the

13:55.800 --> 14:02.840
fundamental nature of reality. And we know that if everything is fundamentally matter,

14:02.840 --> 14:07.240
that's going to be physicalism. And if everything is fundamentally mind, then you're going towards

14:07.240 --> 14:13.000
more for an idealistic viewpoint. So you're basically saying that the fundamental nature

14:13.000 --> 14:19.880
of reality is conscious, rather than consciousness is something, something, something.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.600
Yeah. Yeah. So consciousness is sort of coming in, as you're pointing out,

14:24.600 --> 14:32.120
consciousness is coming in as a primitive. So I mean, I suppose you could try to reduce

14:32.120 --> 14:35.400
the physical world to consciousness and reduce consciousness to something else that doesn't

14:35.400 --> 14:40.120
tend to be the way that idealists go. We do tend to take it as a primitive, as just so generous.

14:40.280 --> 14:46.840
Yeah. But so, but that makes it very much very similar to panpsychism, because you're obviously

14:46.840 --> 14:53.240
now taking that to be the fundamental property of reality. At what point do you guys diverge?

14:54.520 --> 15:00.840
Yeah, that's a surprisingly tricky question. And I think the reason is because there aren't really

15:01.560 --> 15:06.760
sufficiently precise agreed upon definitions of what it takes to be a panpsychist versus to

15:06.760 --> 15:15.240
be an idealist. So there are people who are panpsychists who think that consciousness is one

15:15.240 --> 15:20.200
fundamental, one sort of fundamental property, but that there might be other sorts of fundamental

15:20.200 --> 15:25.880
properties that are not conscious. So it'd be kind of impure panpsychism, which would be quite

15:25.880 --> 15:33.320
different. The idealist, according to the idealist, it's all phenomenology is sort of what is essentially

15:33.320 --> 15:39.800
the nature of reality. So that's one potential difference. I think some of the differences

15:39.800 --> 15:46.200
between panpsychism and idealism come in in sort of two respects. One is just in the canonical

15:46.200 --> 15:49.880
form of panpsychism and the canonical form of idealism, why looking different,

15:49.880 --> 15:55.640
and the others in their motivations. So sort of the canonical form of panpsychism is what some

15:55.640 --> 16:01.560
people have called micro psychism. So this is the idea that the fundamental building blocks of reality

16:01.560 --> 16:08.760
are tiny particles, quarks, whatever it is, maybe something smaller, and those fundamental

16:08.760 --> 16:15.880
particles have as their intrinsic nature consciousness. So panpsychists give arguments for

16:15.880 --> 16:20.040
this, of course, and then everything else is built up out of them. So we get consciousness in at the

16:20.040 --> 16:26.200
ground level in building everything up, but sort of the fundamental locus of it is at the very tiny

16:26.200 --> 16:32.280
level. By contrast, the canonical representation, I think of idealism, at least in the Western

16:32.280 --> 16:39.960
tradition would be Barclay's idealism, which has basically the world all as experiences in the

16:39.960 --> 16:46.440
mind of God, at least as one way of putting it. So there's sort of a difference in terms of whether

16:46.440 --> 16:51.240
the one starts with these very, very tiny things and experiences coming in as parts of them, and

16:51.240 --> 16:55.880
the other starts with these sort of very large experiences, experiences of the universe.

16:56.840 --> 17:01.000
Now that's not essential to the two views because there are now panpsychists who call themselves

17:01.000 --> 17:09.240
Cosmosychists, Philip Goff being one of them, and they are going to embrace this bigger top-down

17:09.240 --> 17:14.600
picture. But I think the other difference between idealism and panpsychism really comes from the

17:14.600 --> 17:21.160
standard motivations for the views. So panpsychists typically come to their view as a way of giving

17:21.160 --> 17:29.960
a solution to the mind-body problem. So they look around and they go, look, I think that

17:29.960 --> 17:34.600
consciousness can be explained in the same way that we explain all the other stuff in the world.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.800
We explain liquidity by, we've got a bunch of molecules, they arrange in the right way,

17:39.800 --> 17:44.280
and liquidity emerges. I think consciousness is the same. I think you can take these little

17:44.280 --> 17:50.200
physical building blocks, put them together, and you can build consciousness. But in a sense,

17:50.200 --> 17:54.760
that's agreeing with the physicalist. But also the panpsychist says, but I also agree with

17:54.760 --> 17:59.400
the non-physicalists, with the dualists, because how could you take non-physical things and put

17:59.400 --> 18:03.400
them together and sorry, non-conscious things, non-conscious things and put them together and

18:03.400 --> 18:10.120
have consciousness pop into existence out of that. So they sort of infer from that that the

18:10.120 --> 18:15.880
consciousness must have been in there from the start. And it's the only way we're able to build

18:15.880 --> 18:22.680
big consciousnesses like ours up is that we started with little consciousnesses. This is obviously a

18:22.680 --> 18:29.480
cartoonish caricature of the view. But so the mind-body problem is the central driving

18:30.120 --> 18:35.960
force. They're getting people to panpsychism. With idealism, the standard route to idealism

18:35.960 --> 18:40.600
actually doesn't have to do with the mind-body problem. It has to do with trying to give an

18:40.600 --> 18:47.320
account of the physical world around us and just directly of its nature. So I can say more about

18:47.320 --> 18:55.560
that. Go ahead. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I mean, I guess if we sort of started with like Barclay as sort of

18:55.560 --> 19:03.640
the father of the Western idealist tradition, you know, very rough caricature again of the view,

19:03.640 --> 19:07.720
you look around and you're like, you know, what do I know about the world? Well, I know it's

19:07.720 --> 19:13.080
populated by mugs like the one I'm holding by trees like the trees I see outside by stars and so on.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.800
What's that? It's a really nice mug. You know, the last time I did an interview,

19:19.800 --> 19:27.080
I had a different mug and I was also complimented on it. I like mugs. So,

19:29.480 --> 19:32.440
right, so I know, I know all these things, but what do I know about these things?

19:33.400 --> 19:40.600
Well, the mug in my hand, I know it feels solid and warm. I know, you know, I see blue

19:40.600 --> 19:47.080
in the mug and white on the inside. I see brown, sort of with light reflecting off of it,

19:47.080 --> 19:52.040
because I shouldn't quite describe that way. I see brownish, bobby, upy, downness when I look

19:52.040 --> 20:00.200
inside of the mug and see the tea sloshing around. Now, all of these things that I just described

20:00.200 --> 20:06.280
were the ways that it seems to me were experiences that I have when I look at the mug, right?

20:06.280 --> 20:13.240
Hardness, warmth, and so on. And when you think about it, all of the information that we gain

20:13.240 --> 20:19.880
about the world around us, empirically, we gain through our senses, through the experiences

20:19.880 --> 20:23.480
that we have of the world. Even when you're, you know, in a science laboratory, you're looking

20:23.480 --> 20:28.280
through a microscope or, I mean, presumably when you're running tiny particles together in a particle

20:28.280 --> 20:34.360
accelerator, right? What it is you get from that is the experiences that you have of looking

20:34.360 --> 20:42.200
through the microscope. So now, we could say, all right, there's some sort of mind independent

20:42.200 --> 20:47.880
matter out there that we don't know anything about what it's like. We just know that it causes us to

20:47.880 --> 20:56.040
have certain experiences. That's one sort of view we could have. But why, first of all,

20:56.040 --> 20:59.240
Barkley thinks, you know, Barkley is an empiricist, he thinks we should just pause it,

20:59.240 --> 21:02.760
what we get through our experiences, and nothing more than we need to pause it.

21:03.880 --> 21:09.080
Why go about pausing that? Why not just pause it? That it is the thing that we're directly aware of,

21:09.080 --> 21:14.840
experiences. Why not just pause it that we've got warmth, cylindricality, hardness, and so on?

21:14.840 --> 21:19.640
And that's what the mug is. After all, that's all I directly have evidence of. And if you

21:19.640 --> 21:22.840
tell me there's something more to it than that, I don't know what the hell it could be.

21:22.840 --> 21:32.280
So that sort of is the motivation for Barkley getting to idealism. And I think the standard

21:32.280 --> 21:37.800
motivation for getting to idealism is thinking, you know, this is what we have evidence to think

21:37.800 --> 21:42.360
that there is. And there's not evidence to think there's anything more. So if we don't need anything

21:42.360 --> 21:46.360
more, if we can do without it, that looks like the more simple parsimonious view.

21:47.160 --> 21:52.360
Yeah, which is a very coherent way of thinking. I mean, ideally, if that's the way it all looks,

21:53.720 --> 21:57.640
the best assumption to make is that that's just the way it all looks and is.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.520
Yeah, I mean, I find this kind of argument actually quite compelling. I think a lot of people

22:06.520 --> 22:12.280
don't. I mean, I guess the question is, can we actually come to a coherent view that's able to

22:12.280 --> 22:18.520
respect what we learn from science, that's able to respect our intuitions about the world having

22:18.520 --> 22:23.560
a sort of stability that it does, and does the ultimate view that we get when we really try

22:23.560 --> 22:31.080
to flesh this all out, does that look good? And that's, I think, maybe where idealism has work

22:31.080 --> 22:39.160
to do, at least. But I hope to fill. So coming into this view, I mean, you must have had knowledge

22:39.160 --> 22:43.880
of, I mean, reality, we dark matters 95% of the universe. We don't know anything about it.

22:44.840 --> 22:48.680
It's dark energy, we know nothing about the fundamental nature of reality. So

22:49.400 --> 22:55.160
coming into this, was that does, does what we've learned from physics and basically everything

22:55.160 --> 22:59.800
we know about biology, everything else we know, did that play a huge role in forming this view for

22:59.800 --> 23:06.120
you? Was that was that a driving force for you to no longer trust reductionism or physicalism?

23:07.160 --> 23:13.400
Yeah, that's a very interesting question. That was not a driving force for me. I think that

23:13.480 --> 23:19.480
some of the cases that you present are interesting puzzle cases, though, for the idealist and cases

23:19.480 --> 23:26.520
that the idealist really needs to think about and be able to speak to. So, I mean, what I started

23:26.520 --> 23:31.240
off describing was the sort of experiences that I have of the world, right? And I started saying,

23:31.240 --> 23:35.880
you know, that it seems like we want to have a world that has that, at very least as a part of it.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.240
It's interesting that the cases that you're describing things like dark matter, you're

23:39.240 --> 23:43.560
describing things that I, as you say, you know, we don't have the ability to perceive.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.000
So that might be taken to be something that would pose a challenge for the idealist,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.360
insofar as the idealist wants to say that everything in the world is experiences.

23:54.360 --> 23:58.440
So how do we account for the sorts of things that perhaps are, you know, certainly that we

23:58.440 --> 24:05.480
can't experience or perhaps are essentially imperceivable? So would you like me to talk

24:05.560 --> 24:10.040
about this a little bit or? Yeah, this is about, I want to listen to what you have to say.

24:10.840 --> 24:16.920
Okay, all right. Yes, I mean, I just think you've sort of actually hit on quite a challenging

24:16.920 --> 24:25.000
sort of puzzle case. So I think it might make sense to get to this after getting more of the

24:25.000 --> 24:30.440
positive view out, but maybe. I think let's do that first, and then we'll get, we'll touch on this.

24:30.440 --> 24:36.600
I'll try and just make, you know, but continue. So wait, let's, let's start off with, I mean, so

24:37.720 --> 24:41.480
let's run through some of the various types of idealism that they are. I mean, because

24:41.480 --> 24:48.120
Barclay's idealism is very much, I mean, there's a lot of credence placed on God. God's one of the

24:48.120 --> 24:53.640
main driving forces behind this, and your view does not have that behind it. It's more of a

24:53.640 --> 24:58.360
secular version of this. So let me let's touch on the different versions of this and how yours

24:58.360 --> 25:07.080
differs from most of the others. Oh, I am not, I'm probably not the best person to give a rundown

25:07.080 --> 25:15.080
of all the different versions of idealism. Well, at least the most, the most commonly brought up

25:15.960 --> 25:21.880
views. Yeah. So, well, okay, so, so you've brought up Barclay's idealism. So Barclay's idealism,

25:22.440 --> 25:27.800
we started off describing a little bit how he came to the motivation for it. But as you've touched

25:27.800 --> 25:32.280
on, God is playing this very central role. So maybe I should just say a little bit about how

25:32.280 --> 25:41.880
that comes in. So if the world is just a world of experiences, if the cup that I'm seeing right now

25:41.880 --> 25:47.400
just is sort of the experiences that I'm having of the cup, you very quickly run into problems,

25:47.400 --> 25:52.360
right? For one thing, if I sort of set the cup down out of view, and there's no one else in the

25:52.360 --> 25:59.800
room perceiving it, does the cup pop out of existence? That seems bonkers. So Barclay's

25:59.800 --> 26:05.160
answer to this is no, it doesn't. The world around us is stable and persists in the way we think that

26:05.160 --> 26:11.720
it does. And the answer, the solution to this is God. So at least on the caricature that of the

26:11.720 --> 26:17.080
view that is typically presented to undergraduate students, God is always perceiving the totality

26:17.080 --> 26:22.680
of reality. So God is experiencing the cup even when I'm not. And this actually, I think,

26:22.680 --> 26:27.960
is important in other ways. So it's not just that God is ensuring that my cup continues to exist.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.800
But if you think about it, there's a lot of features of the cup that I'm not aware of,

26:31.800 --> 26:37.320
like even when I am looking at it, I'm not aware of the backside of the cup. But the cup's backside

26:37.320 --> 26:43.560
doesn't pop in and out of existence. Why will God is experiencing it? Similarly, the molecular

26:43.560 --> 26:48.920
structure of the cup that maybe with a high powered microscope I could perceive. But I'm not

26:48.920 --> 26:53.800
currently. The molecular structure doesn't pop in and out of existence because God is always

26:53.800 --> 27:00.200
experiencing it. So God is playing this really big role, which, as you've pointed out, I want to

27:00.200 --> 27:09.320
get away from for a variety of reasons. So I sort of think of my view as kind of a neo-Barclayan

27:09.320 --> 27:15.080
view. So it's very much in the Barclayan tradition. It's a realist view that, you know, a view that

27:15.080 --> 27:21.640
says cups exist, they're real, rocks exist, they're real. You can't refute the view by kicking a rock.

27:25.720 --> 27:31.000
But God is not the thing that's accounting for the stability and persistence of objects and their

27:31.000 --> 27:37.960
properties. A different sort of view that has also been kind of resurrected recently is the

27:37.960 --> 27:45.000
phenomenalist view. So phenomenalism is a position according to which reality is not

27:45.000 --> 27:51.960
constructed out of experiences per se. It's constructed out of potentials for experience.

27:53.480 --> 28:01.320
So this cup, you know, right now I'm experiencing it. I put it down and I'm not looking at it.

28:01.320 --> 28:07.480
But nevertheless, were I to turn my head and look at the cup, I would have certain experiences.

28:08.280 --> 28:12.360
And according to the phenomenalist, those potentials to have experience,

28:12.360 --> 28:18.440
those maybe conditionals, those counterfactual claims, those obtain even when I'm not actually

28:18.440 --> 28:23.800
looking at the cup. And that is what the cup is constructed out of. So this is a position that was

28:23.800 --> 28:32.200
associated with Mill and that Mike Pelisar has recently done an admirable, remarkable job of

28:32.200 --> 28:40.200
resurrecting and defending. So there's sort of another version of idealism, or not exactly

28:40.200 --> 28:46.120
idealism, but view in the ballpark. We've touched a little bit on panpsychism. There are, of course,

28:46.120 --> 28:51.160
there are a lot of views that are sort of idealists, but are very of a different kind. So there's

28:51.160 --> 28:56.040
sort of transcendental idealist views, which have also recently been resurrected as forms

28:56.040 --> 29:01.320
of linguistic idealism. So these are views basically where we're not giving a view about

29:01.320 --> 29:06.840
the nature of the world around us, we're giving a view about the nature of what we can know,

29:06.840 --> 29:14.360
and of the world as we interact with it, or maybe what it is that our words are about

29:14.360 --> 29:21.320
in the more recent forms. So I am very much not an expert on Kant, but Kant is the person

29:21.320 --> 29:27.240
associated with transcendental idealism, which would be this sort of idea that there is a cup,

29:27.240 --> 29:33.640
a thing in and of itself, but that is sort of outside of the bounds of my ability to grasp.

29:33.640 --> 29:39.640
What I grasp is something that's more akin to what a Barclay would hold that we grasp.

29:41.000 --> 29:48.440
So yeah, so we've got a whole lot of different, but sort of interconnected web of views that are

29:48.440 --> 29:58.840
all called idealism or idealist adjacent. Yeah, so there's like a plurality, I'm sorry,

29:59.400 --> 30:03.160
a bit of a tongue twister there. Yeah, so there's a lot of, there's many different views there,

30:03.160 --> 30:07.400
and a lot of them sort of coincide in certain ways, but yours differs in some other ways.

30:09.160 --> 30:15.880
Why have you excluded God from this? Okay, good. So I guess there's two reasons.

30:16.680 --> 30:23.400
One is just that, so I'm agnostic, and for Barclay, God is playing this really metaphysically

30:23.400 --> 30:28.920
like heavy weight role, right? I mean, God is ensuring that the backside of my cup at every

30:28.920 --> 30:34.120
moment continues to exist, and that, you know, that this has a molecular structure even when I'm

30:34.120 --> 30:40.280
not looking at it under a microscope and so on. And that's, I would kind of prefer a view that's

30:40.280 --> 30:47.640
just more theologically neutral in part because of my own agnosticism. But beyond that, I think even

30:47.640 --> 30:54.360
if you are a theist, a committed theist, that there is value in stepping away, at least temporarily,

30:54.360 --> 31:01.800
stepping back from God, playing the central role. Because I think that God kind of is like a black

31:01.880 --> 31:11.160
box to us. And I think part of that's that, you know, we don't feel comfortable, I mean,

31:11.160 --> 31:15.240
I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable just speculating about the structure of God's mind

31:15.240 --> 31:19.400
and what it's like and how everything hangs together, right? It's something where you'd

31:19.400 --> 31:25.560
feel sort of compelled to go and look at theology. And even then, the answer you're going to get is

31:25.560 --> 31:30.680
probably, oh, divine mystery, we don't know, humans aren't going to presuppose about what God is like,

31:30.680 --> 31:36.840
right? So I think if we sort of step back from talking and thinking about God, I mean, God,

31:36.840 --> 31:41.400
you can sort of smuggle a lot into God, you can say like, ah, well, God's doing it. And then

31:41.400 --> 31:46.200
it's sort of like, that's the end of that, right? You've shut the case, you've said God, and now

31:46.200 --> 31:51.400
there's nothing more to say. And I really think that we want to have a more substantive view than

31:51.400 --> 31:57.960
that. So I think that, you know, stepping back from God and just thinking about the structure

31:57.960 --> 32:05.640
of the mind or the phenomenal unity that constitutes reality can enable us to do that,

32:05.640 --> 32:11.080
can enable us to say something more substantive than a theistic view could. And if at the end of

32:11.080 --> 32:16.360
the day, you have theistic inclinations and want to add some of those traditional godly attributes

32:16.360 --> 32:23.320
back into the picture, you can do that, but with a sense as to how it all could work behind the

32:23.320 --> 32:30.760
scenes that I think you wouldn't get otherwise. Within your agnosticism, I mean, where are you

32:30.760 --> 32:38.920
most inclined towards? Like, are you inclined towards a sort of theistic God, a deistic God,

32:38.920 --> 32:45.160
polytheistic God? What are you looking at? If you had to sort of posit some sort of a

32:45.400 --> 32:53.720
some helpful Barclay, basically. Yeah, well, myself, I mean, this, this is not sort of part

32:53.720 --> 32:58.920
of the arguments that I give, but I'm, I'm sort of agnostic between sort of atheism and a deist

32:58.920 --> 33:06.680
God, I sort of I find, I find the cosmological argument rather persuasive. And I find, I find

33:06.680 --> 33:10.840
a particular variant of the fine tuning argument that has to do with fine tuning,

33:11.080 --> 33:16.520
psychophysical bridging laws kind of also quite persuasive. So,

33:18.600 --> 33:24.600
you know, dualists and certain sorts of idealists take it that, you know, we've got our brains

33:24.600 --> 33:28.600
and we've got conscious experiences and the relation between there's some sort of law like

33:28.600 --> 33:34.600
relation between them, right? So when my brain is in brain state five, I'm having a reddish

33:34.600 --> 33:39.160
phenomenal experience. Whereas the bridging laws could have been different, my inverted twin

33:39.160 --> 33:43.640
could have been in brain state five. And if the laws were different, it could have caused a greenish

33:43.640 --> 33:50.120
experience to be generated. And so, you know, this is a standard way that dualists think about

33:50.120 --> 33:56.680
consciousness. But then you can ask these questions like, well, why is it that our experiences,

33:56.680 --> 34:03.160
particularly experiences like pain, why is it that our pain experiences feel bad? You know,

34:03.160 --> 34:08.120
couldn't the bridging laws have been different such that whenever we have tissue damage

34:08.680 --> 34:12.040
occurring and signals being sent to our brain and this thing happening in our brain, that we

34:12.040 --> 34:17.480
feel pleasure. But, you know, our brain, you know, causes us to pull away from it, even though we're

34:17.480 --> 34:24.760
actually feeling pleasure. I think that that's perfectly possible. You might think, you know,

34:24.760 --> 34:29.480
well, it's just, it was just good luck. It was just luck that the bridging laws worked out right.

34:29.480 --> 34:35.160
I mean, you could have someone who experiences pain as we feel it, but enjoys it. I mean,

34:35.160 --> 34:41.880
to some people, the wires. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I tend to think that if for those cases

34:41.880 --> 34:47.960
of actual people, there's probably other functional differences within their brain beyond, beyond

34:47.960 --> 34:55.400
this, but, but that's absolutely right. Yeah, so, but in any event, I mean, I guess, if you don't

34:55.400 --> 35:01.320
want to posit that that's sort of just good luck and random, one way of going about explaining

35:01.400 --> 35:07.080
that would be that God ensured that we had sensible bridging laws, that God fine-tuned the

35:07.080 --> 35:11.400
bridging laws. And this is sort of, I mean, there's, it's a complicated argument, but

35:13.240 --> 35:19.160
I think this sort of fine-tuning argument gets away from you can't do things like the anthropocentric

35:19.160 --> 35:24.440
kind of response, right? So, you know, if the bridging laws were different, we would still

35:24.440 --> 35:30.360
be aware of the bridging laws being different. So, so I'm sort of, I find those kinds of arguments

35:30.440 --> 35:35.960
somewhat persuasive and persuasive enough to leave me as an as an agnostic, but I find the

35:35.960 --> 35:42.120
problem of evil, the problem of suffering really just seems insurmountable to me. So,

35:42.120 --> 35:45.480
I'm not inclined to believe in the sort of God that Barclay would posit.

35:46.440 --> 35:51.000
It's always fascinating to know someone's spiritual slash religious beliefs, because

35:51.000 --> 35:53.960
a lot of the times it does play a role in the way they view consciousness. I mean,

35:54.920 --> 35:59.880
this is a very fascinating book called by John Hogan called Blind Body Problems,

36:01.240 --> 36:06.600
where he dissects different philosophers and scientists and talks about their upbringing

36:06.600 --> 36:11.560
and how they came to a certain view that would predispose them to have that philosophical view

36:11.560 --> 36:19.000
in the end. So, yeah, you think your agnosticism played a role in this, in this idealist view of

36:19.000 --> 36:26.360
the world? Ah, I would be inclined to think not, but I'm probably too close to it to be the best

36:26.360 --> 36:31.560
arbiter. I mean, I think, you know, the sociology of philosophy, the sociology of academics is like,

36:32.280 --> 36:35.880
I mean, it seems fascinating to me, although maybe it's just because I'm an academic and so

36:35.880 --> 36:40.520
everybody thinks the sociology of them seems fascinating, but yeah, no, I mean, I think it's

36:40.520 --> 36:45.800
a super cool, super cool question. I might need more distance from myself. Yeah, no, I do know

36:45.800 --> 36:51.160
that your your husband is as an ethicist and you guys have written a lot of papers together as well.

36:51.880 --> 36:57.560
Because this podcast is also all about reality, the nature of reality, morality. I mean, I think

36:57.560 --> 37:02.840
it all plays a very big role. So Metaethics is a big part of what you discuss as well. How do you

37:02.840 --> 37:08.760
think that this view sort of changes the way we should behave morally? I mean, how has it, how

37:08.760 --> 37:17.960
can it affect us? So how, how idealism could affect us? People perceive the nature of reality in

37:17.960 --> 37:26.200
this way, then there's no physical person. There is a mind that's possibly there are these conscious

37:26.200 --> 37:32.040
agents, in a sense, but there is no physical person to actually go and kick if I had to.

37:32.600 --> 37:42.280
Yeah, my answer might be somewhat disappointing. So I actually think that there's probably very

37:42.280 --> 37:49.560
little by way of implications here. And I think part of the reason is that one thing that I'm

37:49.560 --> 37:57.080
aiming to do with idealism is to sort of show, to show that, you know, we have our views about

37:57.080 --> 38:01.160
what the world is like, and we get our views partly just by the way the world seems to us,

38:01.240 --> 38:05.480
partly from science, right, from gaining, we gain knowledge all sorts of different ways.

38:06.520 --> 38:12.440
But what I wanted to do is to see, can we, can we show that there could be a world whose nature

38:12.440 --> 38:19.560
is an idealist world that looks just like we think our world actually is? So in a sense,

38:19.560 --> 38:24.600
I'm sort of using the way that we think that the world is as a guide, and then trying to say, you

38:24.600 --> 38:29.960
know, yeah, the world could be just that way as an idealist world, and that I think there are

38:30.440 --> 38:36.680
advantages to doing so. But as a result, since I'm using what we think about our world as the guide,

38:38.120 --> 38:41.400
I think it's going to wind up looking very much the same as we ordinarily think.

38:42.680 --> 38:47.400
So I actually do think, you know, you said there aren't physical, there aren't physical

38:47.960 --> 38:53.480
beings. And in a sense, that's right. But in another sense, that's, that's wrong, right? So there

38:53.560 --> 38:59.800
are bodies that have all of these, you know, there are, I have a body and it's solid and it's

38:59.800 --> 39:05.720
warm. And, you know, I have a brain and it's you cut my head open, it's sort of gray and squishy.

39:05.720 --> 39:11.320
And if you look at me under an FMRI, you know, you'd see different patterns of things lighting up,

39:11.320 --> 39:16.440
corresponding to blood flow in my brain. And all of that's true. So in a sense, in a sense,

39:16.440 --> 39:20.440
I'm sort of maybe making a very Barkley in point. So Barkley, when people would say, you're doing

39:20.440 --> 39:25.000
away with matter, you're doing away with, with the world that we know it. And he's like, no,

39:25.000 --> 39:29.400
I'm doing the common sense thing, I'm giving you matter. If what you mean by matter is something

39:29.400 --> 39:34.040
we don't know anything at all about, yeah, I'm getting rid of that. But I'm not getting rid of

39:34.040 --> 39:37.080
bodies. I'm not getting rid of any of the properties you know about.

39:38.680 --> 39:44.280
Okay, no, that's, that's a very good answer. I think, I think that there was, there was a,

39:44.280 --> 39:48.520
oh yes, a part of me wanted to ask at that point, let's say, let's, let's move beyond

39:49.000 --> 39:53.800
hurting someone or kicking someone. What happens then when someone dies? Because ideally,

39:54.520 --> 39:59.080
at that point, this is going to become a very different place. What goes on then? What happens

39:59.080 --> 40:05.720
when someone dies in this reality? Yeah, I mean, I suppose there's a sense in which

40:07.080 --> 40:12.520
the idealist view that I'm developing is sort of under, under determines that. So certainly,

40:13.480 --> 40:21.160
you know, we have a body, and it's fundamentally made up out of phenomenology. And I have a brain

40:21.160 --> 40:25.480
that's also made up out of phenomenology, and it's going to start functioning very differently,

40:25.480 --> 40:30.120
right, just as we ordinarily think. So, you know, blood, my part's not going to be pumping

40:30.120 --> 40:35.000
blood, my lungs aren't going to be breathing, decay is going to eventually set in, and the body

40:35.000 --> 40:41.560
is going to rot. All of that's going to happen within the physical world. And just the way that

40:41.560 --> 40:48.120
we think that it does. But the idealist is giving a particular account of sort of the nature of

40:48.120 --> 40:54.760
the things that are rotten, basically. And the nature of the decay, I guess, itself is that it's,

40:54.760 --> 41:01.320
it's all sort of, in some sense, phenomenal, in some sense, conscious. Not that my body remains

41:01.320 --> 41:05.720
conscious. It's not that there's a little consciousness experience in my body, but that,

41:06.520 --> 41:12.200
you know, when you think about the bones that make up my skeleton, you know, yes, they're there,

41:12.200 --> 41:15.720
they're made up out of whatever molecules they're made up out of, structured in the way that they're

41:15.720 --> 41:22.920
structured. But what are those things, ultimately, like, you know, what is, you know, a physicist

41:22.920 --> 41:27.160
could give us a mathematical equation that explains all of these things, they can tell us about the

41:27.160 --> 41:33.400
relations between things. But what fundamentally is the intrinsic nature, what are the things that

41:33.400 --> 41:39.880
have these properties that have these sandwich relations, I guess. So that's what the idealist

41:39.880 --> 41:45.720
is telling us. So, you know, the body is going to wither and rot. Then there's the question of the

41:45.720 --> 41:50.520
mind, which we haven't really talked about how the mind and the body are related on the idealist

41:50.520 --> 41:56.760
view. And I think there's not just one view that ideals could have about this, I think idealism

41:56.760 --> 42:02.520
is compatible with a number of different views on this. But I think probably any view that a

42:02.520 --> 42:06.520
physicalist or a dualist, I guess maybe more dualists could have on this would be open to the

42:06.520 --> 42:12.840
physicalist, or sorry, it would be open to the idealist. So, you know, I think it would be

42:12.840 --> 42:17.480
compatible with an afterlife to whatever extent other views are compatible with the afterlife.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.840
But I don't think idealism itself determines that.

42:23.480 --> 42:29.960
It's, it's, it's, when you, when you talk about this nature of reality, this, in this ideal world,

42:30.280 --> 42:36.040
let's talk about things like that we talk that a lot of people, let's say illusionist, for example,

42:36.040 --> 42:40.760
that try and count, count to these arguments, we're saying, look, the truth is, is that our

42:40.760 --> 42:46.200
perception of reality is not what we think it is. Fundamentally, the more we've been learning,

42:46.200 --> 42:52.120
the more we've been exposing how little we know, how little we matter, and how not important we

42:52.120 --> 42:56.520
are, for example, Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain, and you've got people taking us

42:56.520 --> 43:00.600
out of the center of the universe slowly, we're learning that this is not really about us. And

43:00.600 --> 43:05.640
just because we have these experience doesn't mean it should be fundamental to reality. So,

43:06.200 --> 43:11.160
does that bring us towards some sort of a solipsistic view on how we view ourselves and

43:11.960 --> 43:19.240
consciousness or well, mind? Yeah, there's actually a sense in which I think that idealism

43:19.240 --> 43:24.520
of the sort that I'm interested in meshes really well with the observations that you were making.

43:24.520 --> 43:29.880
So, you know, you talked about Darwin taking us off of the, you know, Darwin just putting us,

43:29.880 --> 43:35.480
we're just another animal, right? And our sun isn't the center of the universe, our planet isn't the

43:35.480 --> 43:42.520
center of, you know, the solar system, right? Now, when I talked about idealism thus far,

43:42.520 --> 43:46.520
and I was talking about Barclay and idealism, I mean, I was giving examples of the sorts of

43:46.520 --> 43:53.560
experiences that I have. And I was saying all of these things seem like, you know, they're telling

43:53.560 --> 44:02.520
me something about reality, like they're a part of reality. And on the view that I defend, that is

44:02.520 --> 44:09.160
true. So, in a sense, I am saying the thing that you're disagreeing with, namely that our experiences

44:09.160 --> 44:15.160
are a part of reality. But I don't think that that's in any way privileged or special. So,

44:15.240 --> 44:23.880
in a sense, I completely agree with the examples that you're giving. So, I, yes,

44:23.880 --> 44:29.160
I have certain experiences, I look out and I see a tree and it looks green. And the greenness,

44:29.160 --> 44:36.280
I think, seems like it's there as part of reality. And the idealist is going to say it is. But my

44:36.280 --> 44:41.160
inverted twin, or there to be an inverted twin here would look out and would see a tree and it

44:41.160 --> 44:46.440
would look red. There's no reason we should privilege my experiences over my inverted twins.

44:46.440 --> 44:53.480
Redness just as well seems like it belongs as part of the world. Similarly, a bee has their

44:53.480 --> 44:59.080
perceptions. A bee perceives maybe ultraviolet that I don't perceive. That all, just as well,

44:59.080 --> 45:02.840
I mean, nothing privileging my experiences, the bees experiences seem like they're equally

45:02.840 --> 45:07.960
well part of reality. The bat echo locating, its experiences equally well seem like they

45:07.960 --> 45:12.120
count as part of reality. And you could go on and on and on and on. And all of these

45:12.120 --> 45:17.080
experiences, none of them seem privileged or prior to any of the others. So, for the idealist

45:17.080 --> 45:21.960
view that I'm developing, and I would be inclined to think that really on a Barclay in view as well,

45:22.600 --> 45:28.440
all of this is part of reality. And there's not sort of a, there's not special glowing experiences

45:28.440 --> 45:35.560
that are the real true ones. They all equally count. And if you think about it, God, Barclay's

45:35.560 --> 45:40.920
God doesn't just perceive the world from a human point of view, right? He doesn't have a single

45:40.920 --> 45:44.840
vantage point on the world. The idea is that you perceive the totality of the world, he perceives

45:44.840 --> 45:50.600
the totality of the world, which is going to include vastly more than human beings are aware of.

45:51.800 --> 45:58.200
So the idealist view, there's a lot of phenomenology and it's not, for my view,

45:59.160 --> 46:04.440
not necessarily for all idealist views, human experiences are not privileged in a way that

46:04.440 --> 46:10.360
they would be maybe for like John Foster, possibly. In psychiatry, there's this field

46:10.360 --> 46:17.160
that's called phenomenological psychopathology. And there's, there are these two tools used to try

46:17.160 --> 46:22.840
and understand schizophrenic patients. And one is called the ease and the other's called the EE,

46:22.840 --> 46:29.480
but it's the examination of anomalous self experience and the examination of anomalous

46:29.560 --> 46:34.040
world experience. So what happens is you look at this patient and you try and understand

46:34.040 --> 46:40.200
while they psych out, almost becoming psychotic. So close to psychosis, they start to do all the

46:40.200 --> 46:43.400
things you're talking about. I mean, to have these different experiences that are so diverse

46:43.960 --> 46:49.720
from the average experience. I mean, someone starts seeing the world as being a part of it,

46:49.720 --> 46:54.600
being part of consciousness, someone, someone might not see red the same anymore. Some of them

46:54.600 --> 47:00.520
even don't see visual illusions that we often see. They actually see it as accurate representations.

47:01.640 --> 47:06.760
They see the truth actually, they see more than we do in that sense. So it's intriguing to see

47:06.760 --> 47:13.400
how different experiences do exist even among this one species that has really identical DNA.

47:13.400 --> 47:19.640
I mean, we're all basically the same. It kind of fits with your view in a sense, if you think about

47:20.600 --> 47:25.160
Yeah. Yeah. No. And I mean, and questions about how to deal with hallucinations and illusions

47:25.160 --> 47:29.800
are also just like a super interesting question. And I think even within just sort of like a

47:29.800 --> 47:34.920
neurotypical subject, I mean, you think about things like after images, right? Where you're

47:34.920 --> 47:41.560
looking at, you know, some red light and the relevant photoreceptors become fatigued and

47:41.560 --> 47:46.120
then you look away at a white wall and you see this green patch. Well, in a sense, you know,

47:46.120 --> 47:51.560
what you're perceiving of the wall, on my view, like that really is a feature of the wall,

47:51.560 --> 47:56.120
the greenness of the wall is a feature that some other, you know, some other creature with a different

47:56.120 --> 48:02.760
sort of visual system that maybe only is capable of seeing green green light would see. And that

48:02.760 --> 48:09.640
also is a feature that is a part of reality and that puts us in touch with reality, but in a very

48:09.640 --> 48:14.360
different way from the way that we normally are. But I think there are challenges for the idealist

48:14.360 --> 48:20.920
in how to make sense of these things. It's a it's a complex picture. But but yeah, I think the

48:20.920 --> 48:27.080
idealist has the resources to deal with the complexity. The I think it's really fascinating

48:27.080 --> 48:34.360
to see when someone really becomes when they're psych patients, where I mean, I don't mean to

48:34.360 --> 48:39.640
use them as like tools of examples, but it's really fascinating to see when someone becomes

48:39.640 --> 48:44.920
truly solipsistic, where they really think that once they close their eyes, nothing else exists.

48:44.920 --> 48:49.960
And it's a it's an intriguing thing to perceive because I've witnessed it from patients. And when

48:49.960 --> 48:55.160
you see how real that feels for the person, you can understand that that might be a real feeling.

48:55.160 --> 49:00.200
I mean, it might be a real experience. And so it does coincide well with what you're saying. I mean,

49:00.200 --> 49:07.160
this this could just be the way the world really is for all of us, fundamentally. But yet this

49:07.240 --> 49:10.120
person is just fortunate enough to experience the reality of it.

49:12.440 --> 49:17.800
Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, I guess, sorry, I've had a whole lot of thoughts as you've been talking. So

49:17.800 --> 49:24.040
one is that I mean, there's there's an interesting question about what sorts of things for the idealist

49:24.040 --> 49:29.560
are part of reality and what sorts of things are just parts of our minds. So the way that I think

49:29.560 --> 49:38.600
about it, I the view that I develop is one on which reality is this vast unity of consciousness.

49:38.600 --> 49:44.680
But it's just sort of sensory experiences that are bound together into a unity. So if you sort of think

49:46.440 --> 49:50.200
to me, would it be okay if I sort of said a little bit about my view and how it works?

49:50.200 --> 49:58.920
I think so, yeah, I think. Okay, so. So we had sort of Barclay's view that I gave where we

49:59.720 --> 50:05.080
have God and God is always perceiving the totality of reality. God doesn't just see the world from a

50:05.080 --> 50:09.960
single vantage point. He sees it from all vantage points. He sees, you know, he sees all of it.

50:11.240 --> 50:14.680
But it seems like there's a lot about God that's not essential to

50:16.680 --> 50:21.800
to ensuring the stability and persistence of the world as he needs to for Barclay's view.

50:22.360 --> 50:28.920
So, you know, I think God doesn't have to be all good. God doesn't have to be all powerful.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.320
I don't think God has to be an agent. I don't think God's beliefs are a part of what's doing the work.

50:33.320 --> 50:38.760
What's doing the work is God's experiences, right? And God's experiences, God is not just

50:38.760 --> 50:44.120
having, you know, a giant experience of everything that's happening that's just all disconnected

50:44.120 --> 50:48.680
from itself. God's experiences are structured in the same way that our experiences are structured.

50:48.680 --> 50:54.360
So when I, when I look at a tree, I don't just see greenness and leaf shape and brownness and

50:54.360 --> 51:00.120
trunk shape all sort of scattered around. The leaf shape and the greenness are bound together.

51:00.120 --> 51:04.840
The brownness and the trunk shape are bound together. My experience has structure

51:05.560 --> 51:10.520
along various different dimensions. And the thought is that God's experience in order to be

51:11.160 --> 51:17.240
a single experience of the world and in order to be coherent has to have structure too. And so

51:17.240 --> 51:21.560
God is having the thought is for Barclay. We can sort of think of God as having this

51:22.200 --> 51:27.320
gigantic multi-perspective experience. And that experience, that multi-perspective experience

51:27.320 --> 51:34.040
is what's doing the work of ensuring that the world persists even when we're not perceiving it,

51:34.040 --> 51:44.360
when we're not there. So for me, reality, just the physical world around us just is this structured

51:44.360 --> 51:49.800
multi-perspective experience structured using the same resources that structure our own experiences.

51:49.800 --> 51:52.440
You sort of refer to it as like a tapestry of reality.

51:53.160 --> 51:57.400
Yeah. Yeah. So I like the analogy of a tapestry because a tapestry, you've got all these threads

51:57.400 --> 52:03.000
that are, they're not just separate threads, like, you know, piles of little yarn everywhere, right?

52:03.000 --> 52:07.080
There are threads, which in the case of reality are phenomenal threads, bits of,

52:07.080 --> 52:12.440
bits of experiences. And then they're, but they're structured, they're woven together into a single

52:12.440 --> 52:19.640
whole unit, kind of like a tapestry. But so on this view, the idea is that what makes up

52:19.640 --> 52:27.080
reality is sensory experiences. So, you know, experiences of color and warmth and solidity

52:27.080 --> 52:35.080
and line and smell and pitch and so on. Now, there are more to our experiences than just

52:35.080 --> 52:39.800
sensory experiences. So I think, I'm inclined to think there's something called cognitive

52:39.880 --> 52:46.200
phenomenology. So this is the phenomenology of thought. And I'm inclined to think that cognitive

52:46.200 --> 52:51.320
phenomenology is not a part of the physical world itself. The cognitive phenomenology sort of comes

52:51.320 --> 52:58.520
from our minds. And it's kind of like, like a cognitive overlay on reality. So when I'm aware

52:58.520 --> 53:06.760
of the physical world around me of this sensory tapestry, I don't know, do you remember those

53:06.840 --> 53:09.960
overhead transparencies? Did you have these when you were a kid in school?

53:10.520 --> 53:14.440
Yes. The clear, the clear overhead and then they put it down and then they could like write on it

53:14.440 --> 53:17.880
with markers and you could put another overhead transparency on top. I kind of think about

53:17.880 --> 53:25.800
cognitive phenomenology like a, like a overhead transparency on reality. But it's coming from

53:25.800 --> 53:32.200
our minds. So, sorry, this has taken us quite far from where you started, but you had this

53:32.200 --> 53:42.920
really interesting point about. Well, you had, you'd raised this really interesting

53:44.040 --> 53:50.920
case of people who wind up, you know, not just believing that they're the only person who exists,

53:50.920 --> 53:58.440
but having this experience, this sensation as of being, you know, the only thing that's real.

53:58.680 --> 54:03.640
And so I think, I think it's quite interesting because on this sort of view, cases like that,

54:03.640 --> 54:07.560
there's going to be a question of, is that what kind of phenomenology is that? Is that some sort of

54:07.560 --> 54:15.160
cognitive phenomenology? Or is that actually sensory phenomenology? And not obviously not all

54:15.160 --> 54:19.480
sensory phenomenology is part of the physical world. I think there can be hallucinations that

54:19.480 --> 54:25.880
are part of our mind, but not the physical world. But it is interesting because whether,

54:26.200 --> 54:32.760
whether something is purely cognitive or whether it's sensory does wind up

54:33.320 --> 54:36.520
playing a big role in how we think about it fitting into reality.

54:38.280 --> 54:43.320
Along with you with, in your idealism, you also talk about naive idealism. Do you want to touch

54:43.320 --> 54:52.360
on that as well? Sure, yeah. So this is a view about perception that I think that idealism meshes

54:52.440 --> 54:59.320
really well with. So for the idealist, for the idealism, just as I, as I've stated it,

54:59.320 --> 55:04.200
just as a view about the physical world and what the physical world is ultimately like.

55:06.360 --> 55:10.680
But then there are all these other questions that that doesn't touch on. So when one question is,

55:10.680 --> 55:16.280
it doesn't tell us about how our minds relate to our brains. So it doesn't directly answer the

55:16.280 --> 55:21.080
mind-value problem, although it has implications for it. Another thing that it doesn't do is it

55:21.080 --> 55:28.440
doesn't tell us anything about how it is that we, maybe our minds interact with the world,

55:28.440 --> 55:37.560
how it is that we perceive the world around us. And I think I mentioned earlier that when I had

55:38.600 --> 55:43.000
first come to idealism and started thinking about it, part of what led me to do that was

55:43.000 --> 55:49.240
thinking about this view naive realism, which is this idea that what perception is essentially

55:49.240 --> 55:55.720
is this relation between us and objects in the world. And that when we stand in this relation,

55:55.720 --> 56:00.840
sort of the objects in the world, in some sense become a part of the experience or part of the

56:00.840 --> 56:07.560
character of the experience. And that's something that always struck me as really, really mystifying.

56:09.320 --> 56:15.800
And this still strikes me as completely mystifying. The basic idea behind naive idealism

56:15.800 --> 56:23.160
is that that sort of intuitive idea of perception that naive realists want to hold on to is something

56:23.160 --> 56:31.000
that I think we can get and we can get really intelligibly, but only if the objects in the

56:31.000 --> 56:39.880
external world that we're related to are themselves mental or phenomenal kinds of things. So I mean,

56:39.880 --> 56:46.440
I think it doesn't make any sense to take an apple, a material apple and sort of shove it into

56:46.440 --> 56:52.840
a computer program. I mean, I take my T mug for anybody who sees this online and I try shoving

56:52.840 --> 57:00.840
it at the screen. I don't therefore put my mug into the computer. It's just not the right kind

57:00.840 --> 57:06.120
of thing to be a part of the computer or a part of a computer program. Similarly, my mug is not

57:06.120 --> 57:11.240
the right kind of thing to become a physical material mug. I don't understand how it can

57:11.240 --> 57:16.920
be a part of an experience. I understand how I can be related to it in different ways,

57:16.920 --> 57:20.360
but I don't understand how it can be an elementary constituent of an experience or

57:20.360 --> 57:26.600
the phenomenal character of my experience. By contrast, if you think about something like

57:27.480 --> 57:33.880
maybe stepping back from thinking about perception, it's really easy to see how my

57:33.880 --> 57:39.800
experiences just in general can be constituents of other experiences and other judgments and

57:39.800 --> 57:48.040
things in my mind. So when I introspect and I don't know, I feel slightly hot,

57:49.880 --> 57:55.320
I'm able to directly, my mind is able to directly apprehend the hot feeling that I have right now

57:55.880 --> 58:00.760
and the hot feeling can actually become sort of a part of the thought. It doesn't stand at a

58:00.760 --> 58:04.760
distance from the thought. They're both constituents of, they're both sort of mental things, right?

58:04.760 --> 58:10.440
There's the hot feeling and then there's the thought about it and there's not a mystery as to how

58:10.440 --> 58:21.080
the one can literally sort of subsume the other. Well, if the cup itself is a phenomenal item,

58:21.080 --> 58:28.200
is a bit of phenomenology, the thought is that we can have the same sort of thing be true

58:28.200 --> 58:34.040
of perception. So I actually think I might need to say a little bit about,

58:36.680 --> 58:42.440
no, I'll just try saying it without backing up anymore. Explain yourself as much as possible

58:42.440 --> 58:50.760
so that it's... All right, well, the idea is that when we perceive objects, our mind literally

58:50.760 --> 58:59.800
comes to overlap with the perceived objects. So when I perceive the cup, the cup winds up,

58:59.800 --> 59:05.480
the cup is a part of the phenomenal tapestry, it's a part of the physical world. But the idea is

59:05.480 --> 59:11.960
that the cup also becomes unified with my mind. So, and how is it that this is possible? Well,

59:11.960 --> 59:17.880
the cup is more phenomenology. The cup is kind of like pain. Pain can be unified with the rest

59:17.960 --> 59:25.160
of my experiences. And similarly, the cup itself, my mind can sort of, in perception,

59:25.160 --> 59:30.920
can sort of reach out and expand and pull the cup into it, in a sense. So, I mean, we're not

59:30.920 --> 59:36.280
talking about physically pulling the cup into it, like in terms of a spatial relation, but the thought

59:36.280 --> 59:42.520
is that the elements of my mind are unified with the cup in the same way that they're unified with

59:42.520 --> 59:48.680
my pains or my warm feeling. So the cup, actually, in a sense, is part of the physical world, but

59:48.680 --> 59:54.760
it's also a part of me. And as such, I can think about it directly. I can directly grasp and apprehend

59:54.760 --> 01:00:02.280
it and know about it. And that, I think, is one of the things that idealism can get that materialism

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.960
can't get, and that I think is a really interesting advantage to the view.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:15.880
Yeah. This is bringing me back to one of your papers. I think it's called dualism all the way

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:22.440
down. You're talking about, you talk about phenomenal judgment, you talk about self-knowledge,

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.720
and I know how critical this relationship is. What is the paradox there? I forgot

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.640
what it was called, the paradox of? The paradox of phenomenal judgment.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.160
Yes. Explain that to me, because while reading it, a part of me was just a little bit confused.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.800
I wanted to just understand that a little bit more. Yeah. So this is a paradox that doesn't

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.840
have to do with idealism, particularly. It's a paradox for epiphenomenalist dualism.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:57.320
So the dualist takes it that there's the physical world, and then there's also

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.040
consciousness. And consciousness can't be reduced to things in the physical world,

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:11.000
so we need a duality. And we quickly run into this problem, if you're a dualist,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.840
namely the problem of how consciousness and the physical stuff interact with each other.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And there are some reasons that I think I mentioned very early on for thinking that

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.280
they actually can't. That maybe the physical stuff can generate consciousness,

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.360
but we should think that consciousness can't actually affect the physical world.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.600
Why not? Well, it seems like every physical event can be entirely explained in terms of

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:45.080
earlier physical events, or at least every physical event that has a cause or something like that.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.880
So that's one reason. I mean, conservation of energy also is going to potentially play into this.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:00.120
So that might push you towards a version of dualism called epiphenomenalism,

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:06.600
which is the view basically that every physical event, everything happening in my brain,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.720
everything happening in my body, can be explained entirely in terms of earlier

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.400
things happening in my brain, my body, the physical world around me.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.800
So I can completely explain all of this without needing to posit consciousness.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.400
But there also is consciousness, and consciousness is not just physical.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:33.560
So when I take a pencil and I stab myself and the signal is sent to my brain and my brain does,

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.960
it's whatever it does, then there's also, I say, ah, and I pull away from the pencil,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:46.040
but I also have an experience of pain. And the experience of pain itself doesn't cause me to

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.800
do anything. The experience of pain doesn't affect anything in the world. We could get rid of it,

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.120
and I would still, though, I would still pull away from it. So that's the epiphenomenalist

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.880
position. And it's a position that seems deeply counterintuitive to many people,

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:12.040
because you think, isn't it obvious that when I go and I order, I order a cup of tea,

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.360
that I ordered tea because I was thirsty and wanted caffeine, right? I mean,

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.240
isn't that what could be more obvious than that? And for the epiphenomenalist, that's just not the

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.640
case, right? You ordered the cup of tea. Why? Well, because your brain was sending certain

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.680
signals down to your body, which caused blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.760
But you also do feel thirst. Now, why does the epiphenomenalist hold this? Well, because the

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.520
epiphenomenalist is convinced by the, you know, first that we have conscious experiences that

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:47.560
nothing could be more obvious than that, because we feel them. And second, that physicalism can't

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.800
account for these conscious experiences. Yeah. So we pause at the experiences because we know

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.640
that there are experiences, not because we think we need them to do causal work.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:06.040
But then you run into this problem, the problem of the paradox of phenomenal judgments.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.680
Sorry, I realized how it took us, of course, there, but it's fine.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:20.120
Sorry. Well, we're here now, I guess. So the paradox of phenomenal judgments is basically

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.720
this idea that, you know, there are these experiences, the experiences don't come down

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:34.040
and sort of affect my brain. So how is it that I could possibly know about these experiences

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:43.720
if they're not actually doing any causal work? And so this paper is attempting to respond to this,

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:50.840
to this, and to give an account of how it is that a dualist, an epiphenomenalist dualist could accept

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.400
that you actually can know about your experiences, even if they're epiphenomenal.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:02.440
And actually, it sort of made sense that you thought of this in the earlier response that I

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:09.720
was giving, I think, because the response that I give there appeals to the idea that the experiences

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:18.440
themselves, while they're not a part of my brain, they are a part of my mind, and they are embedded

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:24.280
in a sense in the judgments, which are also mental things. So there's this conscious judgment that has,

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:32.040
as a constituent, the pain itself or the phenomenal redness itself. And what I'm aware of

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.640
is the conscious judgment and the thing that I'm judging. And both of those things are generated

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:44.520
by my mind. But the awareness sort of isn't happening in my physical brain, the awareness

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.000
is all stuff that's being generated by my brain and is all happening sort of at the conscious

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.560
mental level, in a sense. Helen, who do you, which philosophers or philosophical views do you think

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.160
challenge your nature of reality the most?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.440
It's interesting to see how we perceive our, the people who say no to our theories.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, well, I mean, who gives the best examples of why this, this wouldn't be true.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:29.560
Yeah, it's a little hard. It's a little, I'm sort of paused for a little bit, in part, because

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:35.960
I'm not, I think maybe the task that I've set myself in a sense is easier than the task that

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.720
I think a lot of idealists have set themselves, in that I'm not trying to argue that you have to

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:44.840
be an idealist. I'm just trying to argue that idealism is possible, as opposed to that it's

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.480
necessarily true. I'm trying to argue first that it's possible and second that it's

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:55.480
more likely than you might have thought. So it's harder to give a knockdown argument of that

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.000
than it would be to give a knockdown argument of this is necessarily the way that reality is.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.680
So, I mean, if you wanted to argue that it's not even possible,

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.120
sounds like a very strange, it seems like a very hard task to set yourself to argue that's not

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.840
possible. I think the biggest pretty much possible, I think that's why this is, I mean, it's because

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:22.600
no one can do that. Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest challenges to idealism come from the

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:30.120
incredible complexity of idealism. That's not necessarily a view as just a straight up problem

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.320
that the idealist has to reckon with. So, I mean, like I was telling you, when you were pointing

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.720
out that, you know, well, look, we're not at the top of the, you know, maybe we're at the top of

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.400
the food chain, but we're not at the top of like, in the sense, we're not has some privileged,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.760
glowing place in reality, right? And I was like, yeah, but I don't think our experiences have

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.480
a privileged, glowing place in reality. There's, you know, the tapestry of reality is this, you

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:59.560
know, incredibly complex, rich thing that includes far more than us and our experiences aren't in

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:07.480
any way special. But once you accept and embrace that, you see that reality for an idealist is

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.760
incredibly complicated. I mean, you know, you think, well, my experiences are part of reality.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.480
The experiences that an inverted twin would have, they're part of reality, the experiences a bat

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.440
would have, the experiences the bee would have, the experiences the snake would have,

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.520
the experiences the Martian would have. I mean, once you get to that, you're like,

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.400
is there any limit to all the experiences that are bound up as part of reality? Or is

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.320
reality sort of infinitely complex? And I think there are ways for the idealists to

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.400
stave off the idea that it's infinitely complex. But it does wind up being incredibly complex,

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.360
whereas, you know, a materialist can come at the idealist and say, look, we just think there's

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:53.640
this little simple particle, and it just has one simple little nature to it. And it, you know,

01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.440
combines with other particles that are similarly simple and minimalistic. And the diversity of

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.320
experiences is just something that happens when you have different perceivers who actually are

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:10.840
perceiving things. But those aren't extra parts of reality, and they don't exist unless they're

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.920
actually is a bee or a bat or a person in the room. So I think that that's really the biggest

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:23.000
challenge for idealism just is the the profligacy of it, I guess, the idea that that it has all

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.320
this richness built into reality. Are there any specific idealists or people who believe

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:35.640
that ideally that the fundamental fundamental nature of reality is mined? Any specific philosophers

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:41.880
or scientists today that you think are providing this view with a lot of backing and like support

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:50.440
in a very effective manner? Yeah. You're just going to see my own ignorance and how at the

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:57.240
extent to which I'm in my own mind here. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of there are a lot of

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:03.960
different people playing with a lot of very different but related views. I'm most

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.520
views are very different from each other. They're from what I've gathered so far.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.160
Right, right. So I mean, I'm more familiar with the philosophical side of things, although I'd

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.880
love to learn from you about people in other disciplines who are doing relevant related work.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.320
So I mean, I think there's a lot of work in panpsychism to sort of had a bit of a rise

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.640
before idealism has so it's sort of more well known and has had more development of it.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.800
But I know Noam Chomsky had been referencing Galen Strausson who is, as he says, quite brilliant

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:44.520
and excellent and Philip Goff had a march. So there have been a lot of panpsychists recently

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:48.200
who've been sort of developing and trying to refine and hone those views. They're quite

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:55.320
different views, I think, from the view that I'm interested in. I really admire the work of Mike

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:02.280
Pelisar, who's a phenomenalist, again, a very different sort of view. But he's done just a

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:09.480
remarkable job of trying to show that phenomenalism, which is a view that I think a lot of people had

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.960
decided was dead and buried, actually has a lot more going for it than you might think. And he's

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.160
somebody who also you're asking about views that pose challenges to idealism. He's somebody that

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.000
does do that, that actually directly takes and says, look, phenomenalism trumps idealism and

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:39.800
gives a really kind of clever argument to that effect. So Pelisar argues that we, he sort of

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:46.600
imagines a world that has one sort of intrinsic nature, maybe it's a materialist world. And then

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.280
overnight, while we're sleeping, the nature of the world changes. And now it's a Barclayan world.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.200
And then overnight, it changes again. Now it's a panpsychist world. Then overnight,

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:04.680
it changes again. And we're all living in the matrix. But of course, throughout all of this,

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.120
there is no change whatsoever to anything that we observe. The world seems, from our

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.680
perspective, exactly the same. And then you imagine that at the end of all of this,

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.560
the newspapers reveal nature of reality constantly shifting. Now, what would the newspapers say?

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:27.480
Would they say that the world ceased to exist? In every night, the world is ceased to exist?

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.680
No, they wouldn't say that. They'd completely ignore it. Or they'd be like, weird fact.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.240
So the lesson that Pelisar draws from this is that what's essential to being our world,

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.080
the world that we care about, is the thing that all of these things have in common,

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:49.320
namely the potentials for experiences that we're having throughout all of these.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:13:00.680
And so it's not, even if our world ultimately has a Barclayan god that is at the base of it,

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.840
that's not really what's essential to being our world. What's really essential is the potentials

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:10.840
for experience. So this is something that Pelisar has argued against all the other views,

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.080
which I think is a fun and clever argument.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:21.720
Red argument. Yeah. I think the idealist can resist it. Whereas I think the other people

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:27.800
can't resist it, which is I think kind of cool. But it would be very difficult to tell the difference

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:34.280
if it did change constantly. Yeah. Yeah. This is very several philosophical questions indeed.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.480
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, I think, you know, the way that an idealist potentially

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:46.600
could resist it is, you know, if you imagine that the world has been, imagine an idealist world.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.040
And as I said, as I said a little bit ago when we were talking about naive idealism,

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:59.720
about the theory of perception that I propose, for the idealist, we're directly in contact

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:06.760
with reality, right? We directly grasp the world around us. So a way that I like to put it is that

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:13.560
so Dave Chalmers has this paper where he talks about like perception and the fall from Eden,

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.160
where he imagined this perceptual Eden. And in perceptual Eden, you know, the world, the world

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.560
was just as it seemed, right? The world seems like it includes, here we go. I've got a green dinosaur

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:30.760
I'm holding up. The world seems like it includes, you know, phenomenal greenness there as a part

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:37.560
of it. Greenness is a primitive element of reality. And it seems like I directly apprehend

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:44.440
this greenness when I look at the green dinosaur that I'm holding up. And then, you know, Chalmers

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.400
says, look, we think these things. And then we do some science and we realize, no, greenness

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.960
isn't out there in the world. There's just a surface reflectance property that the dinosaur has

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.040
certain wavelengths of light bounce off of it. My brain does certain things and I have an experience

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:05.160
as a result. But there's no like green property out there in the world. And, you know, similarly,

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.880
we maybe think that we directly apprehend, you know, properties in the world that we directly

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.160
grasp them. And then we learn that no, actually, we only grasp them in this very indirect way,

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:23.080
through this long complicated causal chain of, you know, physics. Now, if idealism is right,

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:31.960
we actually do live in Eden, right? If idealism is right, the world around us is precisely the

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:39.480
world that it seems. Greenness, warmth, you know, all of these things are actually part of reality.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.400
And furthermore, they're part of reality that we directly apprehend. We don't stand at a distance

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.520
from them and just sort of, you know, get them indirectly and then have some experience that

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:56.360
our brain generates, right? We really are in touch with reality. So I think if that's right,

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.360
and if we imagine that we live in an idealist world, you know, that's the world that we've

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.200
always grown up in. And then, you know, at midnight last night, it turns out that

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.320
the nature of reality changed. And now we all live in a materialist world.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:16.200
I actually do think, whoa, wait a minute, we went from having a world that is just the way

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.440
that it seems, that has greenness as part of it, that I directly apprehend to a world that I'm only

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.840
indirectly in touch with, and I, you know, just sort of stand at a distance from, and there's no

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:33.400
greenness or warmth in the world. That's a big cost. And yeah, I do think, you know, maybe that,

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:39.400
maybe we would say the world that we knew is gone. So I think, I think the idealist has

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.080
some resources to respond, but I still think it's a very, a very clever argument.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:50.200
But ideally, ideally, if everything is fundamentally matter or mind,

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.880
there shouldn't necessarily be a change in our perception when the thing does change

01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:02.680
from material to mind. I mean, it shouldn't actually still feel the same way, except we

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:08.680
haven't learned the science, perhaps in this new materialistic world that provides us with

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.960
knowledge now, that that's not true. You probably would still experience it as

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.720
Yeah, it would still seem the same way to us. But in a sense, something very different would

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.240
be going on. So it would be kind of, you know, like, like, you know, I could have, I know this is

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:31.720
just a philosopher's imagination of hallucinations, that we don't actually have hallucinations that

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:37.640
are qualitatively indistinguishable from from this, this world. But, you know, you could,

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.200
we can imagine that I could have a hallucination of talking to you right now on a computer that

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:50.360
would be exactly from the inside feel exactly the same way. But without there being any reality

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.640
outside of my mind. So I think we can't necessarily read off from the way that things would seem

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:06.600
from the inside to, to, to the sorts of questions about like, whether we're truly perceiving things

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:15.080
and how we're related to things. Is there anything surrounding your, your view on idealism that you

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.320
that you've always wanted to argue or say or talk about that you've been holding in and you just

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:26.360
really wanted to get out there? I think I think that would be the best time. Oh, gosh. I mean,

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.960
something you've always felt misunderstood by I mean, have people ever come to you and said like,

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.120
do you think, why do you think that the world is all mine? Like, have people come to you with

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:39.480
some basic arguments that you've always felt? Let me clarify and clear this up right now.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.960
Yeah. I mean, definitely idealism is extremely misunderstood. I mean, I guess there's a,

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:53.400
I guess the two things that jump out are, which are things that I've said before, but, but that

01:18:53.400 --> 01:19:01.080
still, I think maybe bear, bear forcefully repeating. So the first is just that idealism is

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.320
not at least a sort of idealist view that I am defending and that people like Barkley are

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:12.600
defending. It's not an anti-realist view. It's a, it's not a theory according to which there is no

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:18.840
world, there is no physical reality. It's a view about the nature of the world and the nature of

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.880
that physical reality. So, you know, you've got the, you remember who it was? Do you remember who

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.600
it was who was trying to refute Barkley by kicking the stone and saying, I refute you thus? I think

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:40.760
it was. Not Locke. Anyway, is a famous, famous, famous, ridiculous, ridiculous. No, it was

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.400
not humor. No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't, it wasn't a super famous philosopher. It was,

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.920
yeah, some, some, oh, I kind of know what you're talking about now. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, and it,

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.000
I mean, it's just such a ridiculous misunderstanding of the view, right? Because

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.480
the view precisely is one where there are rocks and it's trying to give an account of what the

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.120
rocks are. So, I mean, Barkley. What rocks are, that's the problem is that we don't really know

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:13.480
what rocks are. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so, I mean, kicking a rock doesn't help anyone. No, it doesn't.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.440
But so I think that's why I like to, to sort of think about Idealism and to present it to people

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:28.520
who are physicalists with that sort of analogy to how reductive physicalists think about the mind.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:34.040
You know, look, you're not denying, you at least don't think that you're denying that there is such

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:38.120
a thing as consciousness. You're trying to give an account of what it is and analysis of it. And

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.440
similarly, I'm not trying to deny that there are rocks. I'm trying to give an analysis of

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.560
what their nature is. So that's, that's one thing. I mean, I think the other thing is that I think

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.680
when people hear you talking about idealism and hear you defending idealism, it's always

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.800
naturally assumed that you are an idealist and that you think that the world is an idealist world.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:04.280
And I'm actually engaged in a project that's, as I said, a little bit maybe sneakier than that

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:11.000
and harder to argue against, which is just the project of arguing that, you know, there could be

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.200
a world that is just as our world seems to us, that has a particular sort of nature and idealist

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:24.920
nature. And then second, looking at, you know, suppose that we take a world that seems just as

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.480
our world does, it's an idealist world, and suppose we take a world that seems just as our world does,

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.640
that's a materialist world, I think that there are both sorts of, I think both sorts of things are

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:40.680
possible. And, you know, take each of these possibilities and look at the complete total

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.640
worldview that's on offer from both sides. So not just what it says about the metaphysics,

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.600
but what it says about the mind-body problem, what it says about the nature of perception.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:58.520
And then, you know, take those total packages and see which one of these looks more plausible and

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.480
has more theoretical virtues. And that's the project that I'm engaged in. It's the project of

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:09.000
not arguing that you can't accept a certain view, but of arguing you can accept this view.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.440
And furthermore, when we compare the total packages, it actually looks much better than you would have

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.840
thought and perhaps better than the materialist view. Yeah, you're trying to ensure that people

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:24.600
apply as an important level of credence to this view as opposed to perhaps a materialistic view,

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:30.120
because ideally when people think about it, they automatically shun it down as if it's completely

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.000
absurd. But when you hear certain people's arguments, it means clear that this is a

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.320
possibility. This is because for people, when I started this, if I was, let's say, 10 years ago,

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:47.960
20 years ago, I would be completely materialist. I'd be physicalist all the way down. And even

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:54.040
though my intuitions are very much physicalist, I still don't, I know how much we don't know,

01:22:54.040 --> 01:23:00.760
the unknown unknowns. So it's almost impossible to have that Gnosticism regarding reality. I think

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.600
Raymond Talis, I often bring it up, he says he's ontologically agnostic, but epistemologically,

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:13.320
he knows most of us are wrong. I mean, I love that, because that's so true. That's exactly why

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.720
I have this podcast. I mean, it's an opportunity for someone to bring up a view just like this.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.760
I mean, to have that opportunity to discuss it. Helen, I mean, if we had to close off,

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.160
they've here to think of five philosophers, your favorite five philosophers, I know it's

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:32.120
difficult. It's like picking a mad rush mode of like, big people, who would those be? Because I

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.840
feel like when people read your work, get to know who you are, they're going to want to know who are

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:43.640
the people they should read that inspire you and make you the philosophy today. Okay, well, I would

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:48.280
definitely say, Dave Chalmers, who I know you've had previous guests, at least one,

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:54.200
sip me some not so favorable things about. So I'll just give a plug for Dave.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.520
Hopefully, I have Dave on soon at some point. So it's fine.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:06.040
Oh, fantastic. Well, everybody will enjoy his podcast. So actually, another person who you've

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.760
already had on whose work I just absolutely love is Eric Schwitzkabel, who I think, I mean,

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:19.400
just both in terms of defending views that might seem bonkers, but then giving really

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.960
interesting creative arguments for them that are incredibly fun. I mean, anybody who has

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.400
the opportunity to read any of his his work, I mean, everything he writes is just really fun to

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:35.080
read. Eric is very underrated. I enjoy his work very much. Yeah. And actually, my husband had asked

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:41.480
me who I thought the whatever the best philosopher of mind in the world besides Chalmers was. And

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:47.560
I was like, ah, you know, and he's like, well, who would you who would you whose work would you

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.040
be most excited about reading if you heard some new paper come out? And the tricky thing with that

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.040
is that, you know, in general, it's the kind of people who work in the on the stuff that I work

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.680
on. But I did realize that of all the people who don't do directly the stuff that I work on,

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.040
hands down, it's Eric Schwitzkabel, because anything he writes is going to be brilliant.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.720
I mean, he's got some fascinating topics like the philosophy of science fiction. I mean,

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.280
he goes into some very intriguing domain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, yeah, he's got a book on

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.640
the perplexities of consciousness that's very fun and accessible, arguing you have no clue what's

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:27.880
going on in your own mind. And I think a paper if United States, sorry, if materialism is true,

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.120
the United States is probably conscious that involves these incredible fantastical science

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:43.320
fiction examples to try to make this case. Yeah. But so I guess I've also mentioned Mike Pellisar,

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:48.840
if anybody's interested in sort of similar like idealist adjacent things, I think he's also a

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:55.640
very good and underrated philosopher. Oh, I don't know how's your name? Catty Balog is somebody

01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:05.000
who's a physicalist, a, an opistory or a physicalist, who I think is a really also very underrated,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.840
very subtle, interesting, interesting philosopher. Not sure if I've given it five.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.920
Historical philosophers, some of the. Yeah, shout outs to Barkley and Locke.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.240
I had a feeling those two names would come up. No, Helen, I mean, it's been an absolute pleasure

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.480
chatting to you. This has been such a fascinating conversation. I mean, even listening to you,

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.320
it reminds me of the conversation I've had with Eric. I can tell you that type of person who

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.640
is very intrigued by a lot of these ontological questions, the metaphysical side of things.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:40.920
And it's really great to have people like you out there challenging and pioneering these,

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:47.000
these arguments and these views, because ideally there's, then we just get stuck in our own world.

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:55.320
Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, I think in a sense, it is, it is, it's very much a creative,

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:02.600
a sort of a creative world building, almost endeavor that, but I hope is thought provoking

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.160
in the way that you described. So it's very nice to hear you say that.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.400
I think without you, this tapestry would not exist. I mean, we all have to sort of give up.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.960
Oh, no, which indicates that my view is wrong if you're right, but

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:20.200
we all have to sort of give our views and sort of get into that argument and just have a great

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.720
time doing it. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me on. This has been a pleasure.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.840
Thanks so much, Helen. I really appreciate your time and I look forward to reading more of your work.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.640
Super.
