0	14240	Su, I'm so glad we managed to reschedule this. Is the sound working fine? The internet connection
14240	19200	is great this time. Everything works. Good. I think so, yeah. Okay, my side, it's perfect.
20000	27520	How was the retreat, Su? Oh, the retreat was fantastic. I can't remember whether I told you.
28080	33600	I didn't want to go. I'd kind of signed up half-heartedly and the weather being here and
33600	40800	being over 20 degrees is amazing and sunny and I thought, you know, all this meditating all the
40800	47200	time, I wasn't looking forward to it and it was brilliant. The teacher, I really went because
47200	55360	of the teacher, Fiona Nuttall. She's a Zen master and extraordinary teachings and the Zen interviews.
55360	63600	You know, this is part of Zen retreats is the interviews and she just really rings things out
63600	69920	of you that you don't know are there and then sends you back to work. I can just talk merely from
69920	76720	your energy right now. You look in a great place. The other thing was in these particular type of
76720	82800	retreats, there were two work periods of an hour each in the day where you could be sweeping the
82800	88160	floors, cleaning the toilets, chopping vegetables in the kitchen and this lovely sunny weather,
88160	93760	you know, and you don't have any choice and I got gardening so I'm very happy. That's very
93760	99440	unzen, isn't it? Because you just do what you do because you don't do it and, you know, not care
99440	107120	about the outcome but it meant I was outside at each day doing hard physical labor which I'd much
107120	112720	rather do than chopping vegetables or something like that. So yeah, it was very good. As for,
112720	117920	you know, great insights, well a lot happened. It was, you know, struggling with a koan for
117920	123200	a week. I see. Things happened. Do you feel like philosophically any changes fundamentally in your
123200	136080	views? No but I think my way of thinking about things is kind of loosened up
136800	143040	and I spend quite a lot of time as you realise thinking about the mind-body problem, the nature
143040	151280	of mind, the nature of agency and how we wrongly feel we're controlling things and
153120	159600	this koan work tends to hint at those but I can't say I've got some great philosophical
159600	163920	breakthrough now, sorry. Well, I think while we're on that, it's the perfect time. I think
163920	169840	let's take the listeners and the viewers on a journey soon. If you could give me a history
169840	175360	of the mind-body problem from your perspective, I'm curious to know which aspects of this story
175360	182320	you tell me right now. Gosh, you kind of ask the question is though I'm a philosopher and I'm not
183040	187600	or are you doing something much more personal? No, no, I think in general what if you had to
187600	192880	think of the story of the mind-body problem, which names come to mind, what type of philosophies or
192880	198880	even psychology, neuroscience, which icons or figures in history come to mind when you think of
198880	208480	this infamous problem? I'm going to disappoint both you and your listeners because I don't really,
209120	213040	as I said, I'm not a philosopher. I don't remember the names of all the brilliant
213040	219760	philosophers and I kind of, you know, I know this problem goes way, way back into ancient Greeks but
219760	225760	you know, I don't, I'm not going to pull any names out of the non-existent that's on my head.
227680	232880	I don't think in that way about it. I think about it every day in terms of
233920	239040	what's out there and what's in here and is there a difference between inside and outside and so on.
240000	247200	But if I can twist that around to why it's been so important to me, like so many things in my life,
247200	253760	it goes back to the very dramatic outer-the-body experience or mystical experience both that I
253760	260960	had when I was 19, which is a very long time ago, which convinced me completely of a dualist view
260960	265520	as it convinces so many people. I think it's Thomas Metzinger who said, you know, anyone who has that
265520	275760	kind of experience must become a dualist, a substance dualist indeed. And so that becoming
275760	283280	utterly convinced of a dualist view and then actually deciding to devote my life to instead of,
283280	288880	you know, I had a, what I imagine would have been a very good PhD place at Sussex University,
288880	296400	which now has the, you know, the Sussex Consciousness Lab there. Not that it would have in those days but
297280	301680	you know, I turned that down because I wanted to prove dualism. I wanted to prove, you know,
301680	306560	astral planes and all these other worlds and everything and show that scientists were closed
306560	316080	minded as I'm often being accused of being. And so I set about it experimentally, being really
316080	322880	an experimental psychologist, not a philosopher. And all the evidence I got was suggested I was
322880	326720	wrong and so I had to turn to my mind. And since then, which you were talking now,
327520	333360	late 70s, early 80s. Since then, I've been pondering how on earth to make any kind of
333360	340240	monist, any kind of neutral monism actually work. I think, look, so for me, it's very difficult to
340240	346400	actually have a very skeptical interview with you. And it's because you were part of shaping
346400	354080	many of my own views. Yeah, so a big, a big chunk of my dissertation focused on illusionism. So
354160	358480	illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I used psychiatry to defend illusionism as a
358480	363120	theory of consciousness. I quoted you a couple times. And I've obviously
364080	369760	particular, I cited you many times and particularly the delusion aspect of it all. So there's many
369760	374640	aspects where I want to come as a skeptic, but I just cannot because fundamentally, I think
374640	378640	there's so many aspects of this that we agree on. It's going to make this very difficult.
378640	383360	But I think that's exciting anyway, because what I want to know is when you came to the conclusion
383360	388400	of illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I know so many people in your life influenced you,
388400	393360	people like Dawkins. I know Dennett's part of those people who you support in terms of certain
393360	398000	views. I know nowadays you disagree with many aspects. Perhaps Free Will will be one of them.
398560	403040	No, that's the only, that's really the only one. I mean, basically, I'm a Dennettian and, you know,
403040	408000	I love it when I find something I disagree with him about, we can have a great argument, you know.
408720	415600	Your books, Dennett's books, all together on my shelf. So you guys all come together in a nice
416880	420640	So when Frankish published the paper, Illusionism, and he had all you guys together,
420640	425120	Graziano, yourself, there were many of you guys together. Tell me about that journey. How did
425120	433360	that come about? I think Clive Frankish wrote and told me he had been invited to do this special
433360	440880	issue and asked me whether I'd like to write it, write something. And I was then thinking a lot
442080	447200	about the things that I wrote about in there. A lot of my thinking is taking direct experience
447200	452800	and trying to analyze it. So in that paper that I wrote, I wrote about an experience where
454000	460800	I've been on, I can't even remember what island this was, but anyway, I was on some island walking
460800	467600	up quite steep, rough sort of steps going up. And I really wanted to get to the top
467600	470960	in time to be able to go down and catch the boat back to wherever I'd come from.
471600	480720	And I can remember that as I was walking and and being mindful, somehow or another, I realized
480720	485600	that a few moments before I had, I thought, am I going to get there in time? And I thought, oh,
485600	490560	yes, because it's only five past 12. Hang on a minute. I must have just a few moments before
491040	496960	looked at my watch and I looked at it again. And it was five past 12 without in any normal
496960	501920	sense of the word being conscious of it. And this brought up all the sort of Donetti and kind
501920	507520	of thoughts. Well, what's going on? Right this moment now being mindful, I can say, this is what
507520	512960	I'm mindful of. This is what I'm conscious of. This is what I'm doing. If I cast my mind back
512960	518800	to a moment before it doesn't have to be very long. I really don't know what I was conscious of.
519280	522480	Doesn't make any sense. This is one of the things where Dennett says,
522480	527760	there is no fact of the matter. If you ask what was I conscious of a moment ago, there is no
527760	534640	fact of the matter. And yet we assume that there is an answer to that question that at all times
534640	539600	during the day, when whatever we're doing, we're conscious of something or another. Well, that's
539600	549120	simply not true, I think. So I kind of wrote my article for this around that experience and what
549120	557200	it means for why we're deluded. And the reason I say delusionism rather than illusionism is
557200	561760	illusions brings to mind very much sensory illusions, vision and hearing and so on that
561760	565680	where you get things, you know, there's the difference between reality and appearance.
566400	574000	But the delusion I was more interested in the kind of folk theories we make up about consciousness.
574000	580320	And one of those is that at all the times when we're awake and in that sense conscious, there
580320	584800	must be something we're conscious of and other things we're not conscious of. And that's not
584800	593120	true. And then I think because I tend to write not terribly academically, acceptably, I tend to
593120	596640	write rather personally, oh, I think this and I have this experience and this is what it means.
597200	601280	And so then Keith started to say, well, can you change this and can you change that? And then
601280	605600	actually he tried changing things for me. And then I was like, no, you can't do that. I wouldn't
605600	611760	ever say that. And we sorted it all out. And in the end, I was very happy with it. So that's sort
611760	616240	of how it came about and what happened. And then there are all these other interesting papers in
616320	624720	the same issue, which then became a book. I find Frankish's view too difficult for me to really
624720	629200	understand. You say illusionism is a theory of consciousness. It's not really, it's a whole
629200	634080	bunch, it's more like it's an approach to consciousness. It's a way of thinking about
634080	640480	consciousness, which has many variations. Yes, sorry, continue. No, no, go on. I was going to say
640480	644800	because yes, because you define illusionism very differently from what Frankish is talking about.
644800	650880	Yeah, that's right. You see it more as a way to rectify and clarify other views of consciousness,
650880	656480	whereas Frankish is talking about the phenomenal aspect of consciousness. Do you want to clarify
656480	664800	that in your own words? Well, yes, I think he starts by saying that the phenomenal properties
664800	671040	don't exist. Well, I'm immediately thrown into, but I'm not a philosopher and I don't know what you
671040	678480	mean. The other day, Bernardo Castro said to me, if something exists, it has properties. And I'm
678480	684080	going, well, I don't know about, I don't really know how philosophers define existence or properties,
684080	688720	and I don't want to go through the painful, I've got enough to learn that's really interesting
688720	693520	in neuroscience and psychology. And I try and read philosophical things, but I don't think I'm ever
693520	699840	going to get my head around exactly what Frankish means. And whether it's the same as what Dennett
699840	707120	means or not, going back to what you've already elucidated, it's the way Dennett pulls apart
707120	713360	the mistakes we make, the pits we fall into, the errors that just abound all over the place
714400	720960	that appeals to me. And by calling my approach delusionism, I suppose I'm just trying to say,
720960	725200	look, I'm not, I don't agree with all the other people, I'm not saying I'm right or better,
725200	730240	but I'm more interested in the kind of semi-intellectual ways we get things wrong,
730240	735040	and the assumptions we make, than I am in making an actual theory. Because I don't think
735760	741040	I don't think any of these have an actual theory, except possibly with the exception of
741040	746960	Michael Graziano, who refuses to call himself an illusionist. And it's an illusionist theory,
746960	754240	for goodness sake, Michael. I think he's a bit cowardly, really. I understand it, I get it,
754560	760480	you know, if he calls it an illusion, people will misunderstand. I've had that all the,
761040	765840	all the time I've been working on consciousness. You know, people say, you say consciousness
765840	770880	doesn't exist. I don't say that at all. I say it's illusion. How do you define illusion?
770880	776160	Something that's not what it seems to be. And that's really, if I want to say anything I will
776160	783200	say, 100% sure that I believe, it's only that, that consciousness as normally conceived of by
783200	788160	most people, it's not what it seems to be. Graziano was one of the first people I interviewed
788160	793840	for this podcast. And I remember when we spoke about, prior to that, he helped me out with my
793840	798400	dissertation. And we discussed the fact that attention schema theory is most certainly an
798400	802800	illusionist theory of consciousness. It's, it approaches it fundamentally by saying that what
802800	807920	we seem to believe is consciousness is merely an interpretation of what we think is happening around
808480	815200	it. But he calls it a caricature. And in my own work, I also said, I believe that if some,
815200	819120	if you believe something is an illusion, there's no point in changing the words around it. You
819120	824160	might as well just change other people's perceptions about the actual word. Because
824160	830400	an illusion is defined as an emiss interpretation of a sensory stimulus that does exist. So you
830400	835120	cannot say that it doesn't exist. There is a stimulation that's happening that does exist.
835120	838880	And that's fundamentally where I think Keith and you differ because you agree that something's
838880	845440	happening. I am not necessarily agreeing what you just said that it's a, it needs to be a sensory
845440	854880	stimulus. Yes. Well, does it? Um, I don't think so. It's a misinterpretation of a stimulus that
854880	860480	exists. Okay. But can that be an internal stimulus? I mean, because I'm thinking the whole gamma of
860480	867520	experience, including sensory impressions, where we make a, um, a reality appearance distinction,
867520	872400	that's one sort of illusion. But when it comes to, you know, my own, I'm shutting my eyes,
872400	879600	it's dark. I'm, you know, I'm thinking about something that, you know, I'm thinking to myself,
879600	884320	Oh, what I'm conscious of now, if I think that way, is my own thoughts about whatever it is,
884320	888240	what I'm going to do tomorrow or something, you know, that's not a sensory stimulus. In fact,
888320	892400	it's not really stimulus unless you say this bit of brain is stimulating another bit of brain. So
892400	901120	I just quibble slightly there. Yes. So I would say something is happening. And somebody's responding
901120	906400	to something that's happening. Something's responding to something that's happening. Um,
906400	912800	like Dennett, who begins, um, his 1991 consciousness explained with sitting in his rocking chair,
913760	919120	appreciating the way the light is, you know, fully on the dapples on the leaves and all that.
920480	926560	You know, I take as a similar view. I mean, look, there's this, ha, but
928560	933120	the leap that's so easy to make is there's this out there and there's me in here. And that's
933120	939840	already an interpretation. And that's an illusion. So that's where I take off from. And I, I define
939840	944880	illusion is an illusion much more simply having looked it up in various, you know, OED and other
944880	950560	such places as something that is not what it seems to be. That's, that's kind of vaguer. And I'm
950560	956000	happier with that. Yeah. Now, I think what you're doing is basically it's intuition pumps for
956880	960880	thought thinking about consciousness. It's pretty much trying to show people that, okay, look,
960880	964960	there's something happening. We don't know what it is, but assuming that you can find certain
964960	970480	entities or an Ian Vitale or an answer that's going to come out is just the wrong approach.
970480	973760	So searching for a neural correlate of consciousness is not the right way.
974960	981840	And it's amazing how popular that has, you know, good for Francis Crick and Christoph Koch,
982400	990240	starting the whole framework for consciousness and let's, I mean, Crick said, you know, we can't
990240	994640	jump straight in at causal explanations. We have to start with correlations. So what do we do?
994640	1000160	Well, here's this problem consciousness, let's look for the neural correlates. Great, as a starting
1000160	1005840	point. But when you really start thinking through intuition pumps and delusions and what have you,
1006800	1011680	it doesn't make sense anymore, because it relies on the assumption we were discussing earlier,
1012640	1016240	that there are some brain processes that are conscious and there are other ones that are
1016240	1023120	not conscious. And that is such a tempting illusion. But it's not, in my opinion, it's not true.
1024640	1028400	At what point did you realize, because there's so many different studies that show us that we're
1028400	1034160	not seeing reality for what it is. Heuristic adaptations, perhaps, shortcuts in our processing,
1034160	1039680	limited processing, perceptual experiences. So we can't even see outside the optical window,
1039680	1044400	we can only see ROYGBIV. At what part were you looking at all this information and finally
1044400	1049680	concluded, okay, you know what, there is no fundamental entity called consciousness that we
1049920	1056720	are searching for? Well, you ask that question in a way that assumes that there is some sense in
1056720	1063520	saying the world as it actually is. Yes, I must say, I'm more tempted nowadays to theories that
1064080	1072560	don't say that. I'm very tempted by various kinds of panpsychism, none of which I can fully endorse,
1073520	1079040	by information based ideas, that everything fundamentally comes down to information. So
1079040	1084320	I've been struggling without enough maths with thermodynamics and other ideas about
1085760	1091680	energy and information and evolution and how these things work. And really struggling with
1093360	1102960	some kind of straight idealism doesn't work in the sense that, you know, if everything is mental,
1102960	1107360	how on earth do you explain why we agree about things about the outside world, what you were
1107360	1112560	saying, you know, how the outside world really is? Well, I'm not going to go that far, but you
1112560	1116720	can agree that, you know, you can see my picture, I can see your picture, I can see the cupboards
1116720	1121680	behind you and the whatever, you know, and I'm pretty sure I could predict, this is kind of
1121680	1126560	important really, that if you went, turned around and pulled a book out, you know, there'd be a space
1126560	1133760	in the bookshelf. Interestingly, I've got particularly fascinated recently with predictive
1133840	1138880	processing and Bayesian brain type theories. And when I'm thinking about all this stuff,
1138880	1143840	what is the world? What is the relationship between this body and this thinking and everything and
1143840	1152080	that plant you can't see behind the screen? It's always, well, if I did that, if you turned around
1152080	1158240	and took your book out, if I picked up these glasses, then I would find they felt like this.
1158240	1164240	It's always if at last something makes sense, of course, because the predictive processing
1164240	1171760	theories are saying that that that all all of perception and of thinking indeed, and of, well,
1171760	1180640	I'll leave Pontius for a moment, but all all that is making predictions. That's what system is. So
1180640	1186320	I try to work from first principles with that sort of idea. So here's a clever brain,
1187280	1192640	multiply, it must be a kind of tangled hierarchy. It's not hierarchy with, I think,
1192640	1197120	with me at the top controlling everything, which is kind of how it seems. But it's
1197120	1202400	hierarchical, nevertheless. And at every level, there are predictions referring to the lower
1202400	1210800	level and so on. And that begins to make sense of the world, but brings me right back to, well,
1210800	1217520	then what's it all made of that's doing this? And it also raises the question of, well, does
1218400	1224480	Bayesian brain approach actually turn into a theory of consciousness and not necessarily?
1225920	1231120	So I've been playing in fact, when I was on the retreat one evening, I was, we get a little bit
1231120	1236800	of free time and I went sat under a tree, and was kind of thinking about this with respect to the
1236800	1243680	tree that that I was looking at, and trying to think about what can underlie this on any kind of
1243680	1250720	modest view. And again, coming back to kind of fundamental thoughts about information and prediction.
1251520	1256320	You see, I can't give any answers. I mean, I'm really struggling with all this stuff. I don't
1256320	1263040	have my own theory beyond, beyond everyone's else is deluded. And so am I. Look, I completely agree
1263040	1268160	with you because when I came when I started this podcast, I was so I initially came to it with a
1268160	1273040	very emergentism approach. So I thought at some point, okay, these layers will eventually
1273040	1276880	culminate into an experience that we call consciousness. Then I went down the very
1276880	1281680	illusionist path. And I think fundamentally, my view is most likely aligned with that stall.
1281680	1286320	But as you're saying, after speaking to so many people and reading so many other philosophers
1286320	1291440	and thinkers, you start to question reality in general, because materialism as it stands
1291440	1295520	matter, we really just don't understand what matters. And I think that's the fundamental
1295520	1300880	problem why we cannot ever talk about reality in a way where we think what reality could ever be
1300880	1305840	is something beyond. So I completely agree with you. So even when I said that, look, when
1305840	1309440	there's certain things we cannot see in terms of reality, I still honestly do have no idea
1310000	1317520	what we should be seeing. So I agree on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get quite annoyed. Got,
1317520	1321280	you know, bored of being annoyed that people just assume I'm a materialist. And I said,
1321280	1325040	no, I think materialism doesn't work any better than idealism work. And, you know,
1325760	1330800	that's why I call myself a neutral monist. But then when I look that up as what it actually
1330800	1334320	means in philosophical terms, it gets a little bit complicated. I think, God, I'm not that all I'm
1334320	1341920	saying is all I can say for sure is dualism doesn't work. For me, was Raymond Tellis,
1341920	1346800	he once said he's ontologically agnostic. And I like that. Oh, that's a nice phrase.
1346880	1349920	I really do. Yeah, because because ever since he said that, I think that's the
1349920	1354000	term I go to all the time. I'm ontologically agnostic. But when it comes to epistemology and
1354000	1358080	the stories we've been telling each other, I think I'm pretty much almost atheist towards
1358080	1365600	those stories or a whatever that theory is. Yeah, it doesn't have to have God, does it? A
1365600	1369280	theory story, something or another. Yes. Exactly. But I think it's a beautiful term,
1369280	1374000	ontologically agnostic. Thank you. When you think about your okay, so your journey,
1374000	1377600	you obviously at some point concluded, okay, these theories and the way we're approaching
1377600	1383040	this isn't working. It came down to ask yourself these questions. Am I conscious now? That was a
1383040	1387200	big part of your paper. Am I conscious now? Marvin Minsky once said, if you asked a computer,
1388400	1392080	if it's conscious now, it doesn't matter because humans can't answer that question. Anyway,
1392080	1397120	we spend most of our lives in autopilot. So if we ever expect a computer to really think about
1397120	1401120	the fact that it's conscious, we really do it ourselves. Is there anything you want to add on
1401440	1406080	that? Yeah, well, the large language models make that very interesting, don't they? Because
1407040	1412160	given that, I mean, the terrible thing is that they just amplify the idioses of what humans
1412160	1418160	say and write. So I imagine I've not tried this out, keep thinking I should spend some time playing
1418160	1421920	around with one of them. But, you know, given that so many people say, well, of course, I'm
1421920	1427360	conscious, then presumably picking it up from the massive database of everything people have said,
1428240	1433680	then these so-called AIs have not really, but, you know, we'll just say the same. Yes, of course,
1433680	1437200	I'm conscious. I mean, if they can say, oh, I love you and I want to be with you and all those
1437200	1441280	ridiculous things that they do, they're going to say they're conscious and that doesn't tell us
1441280	1446720	anything at all any more than it tells us when somebody else says they're conscious. But that
1446720	1455520	question that you say that I wrote in that paper, that was 2016, I think that illusionism thing.
1456000	1461680	I've been thinking about this question a lot longer than that. And it kind of began, I suppose,
1461680	1466640	when I was happily a colleague of mine. In fact, he was also a Zen master. He was a
1466640	1473920	John Crook, a biology lecturer at Bristol University and a Zen master. And I was learning
1473920	1481760	to meditate with him. And this is going back to the 80s. And he was teaching a course that was
1481840	1485600	sort of involved quite a lot of consciousness. And he wanted to leave and devote himself more
1485600	1490480	to running retreats and so on. And so I took over this course. And I began teaching that
1490480	1497040	in the late 80s at some point, with a lot of, you know, there's so little was was known then.
1497760	1503440	And then in 1991, sort of early in my first few years of teaching, it's outcame Dennett's book.
1504160	1509440	And that really changed things and really forced me to think. And I met him, he came to Bristol
1509440	1517440	and gave a lecture and that really fired me up. And that made me do the first ever experiment on
1519360	1525440	change blindness, which worked out amazingly. And he predicted that it would work. And I thought,
1525440	1533440	well, I can do that, you know, and did with a student. So when I was teaching that course,
1533440	1538400	I was already asking myself, well, I'm talking about consciousness. Well, what is it? Okay,
1538400	1543600	I'm conscious now. Or am I? What does that mean? And so I began right from the beginning of that
1544560	1550320	teaching near the beginning anyway, getting the students to do what I did. In other words,
1550320	1556800	to ask themselves many, many, many times a day, am I conscious now? The first thing I learned is
1556800	1561120	that they won't do it. Or most of them won't do it. Or the ones who say they're going to do it,
1561120	1565440	find it really hard to do. And at the end of the week, when they come back, let's say these
1565920	1569920	in those days were nice small classes, I have like 30 or 40 students and, you know,
1569920	1576240	and I could ask them all how many people did it, what happened? Most of them forgot to do it or
1576240	1583920	tried and didn't really get anywhere. Some had really insightful experiences and began to question
1584640	1591600	they had this shock, which I've written about as you probably know, but this kind of shock when
1591600	1597760	you go, are you conscious now? Hey, are you? I don't know whether I can get you to have it. But
1597760	1603600	you know, you suddenly think, Oh, well, of course I am. But a moment ago, I really don't know was
1603600	1609440	I it's as though I've woken up by asking the question. And in a way, I think this is a really
1609440	1614960	important point. I can even go so far as to say, you're not conscious unless you're asking yourself,
1614960	1620400	am I conscious? Exactly. It's that active awareness of the fact that you are asking yourself at least
1620400	1625440	it's almost that metacognition of it all. It is a metacognition, but it's a delusion,
1625440	1631440	isn't it? I mean, it's a word based thing. Am I conscious now is saying, and then you start looking
1631440	1636320	around and going, What am I conscious of? And, you know, that hence the second question in the
1636320	1642000	big textbook that I have follows. And I've just my daughter and I've just completed the fourth
1642000	1648000	edition, which will come out in a few months, I hope. And through all of the editions, every chapter
1648000	1652640	has one of these practices that I wanted students to do. I mean, a lot of them did get in the
1652640	1657200	hang of it after a while and they and really worked hard on it. But then it becomes, well,
1657200	1662800	what was I conscious of a moment ago? And lots of other questions of what, you know,
1663440	1668400	am I conscious of what what I was doing, all sorts of questions that that you can ask,
1668400	1674080	but they all depend on words. And if you do mindfulness practice without needing any words
1674160	1681040	by just kind of becoming present, then that gets you away from the wordiness a bit.
1682080	1688000	And then if you keep doing that a lot, then you're much more alert and open to what's going on.
1688000	1694320	But you can't really say anything more about it. And what's going on here? This is what's
1694320	1700480	really interests me. We fall back on these things that there's this thing called consciousness that,
1700480	1706080	you know, that we might find. And then we're back to the neural correlates of this thing
1706080	1710400	called consciousness, and it's got to be squirted out of the brain or, or as in the hard problem,
1710400	1717680	it's got to as Dave Chalmers put it, how does subjective experience arise from
1717680	1723040	objective activity in the brain. And so you come back to that sort of, to me, deluded idea that
1723040	1726480	consciousness is something that like toothpaste, it sort of comes out of your head.
1727360	1732080	You have to give me a definition of delusionism and perhaps compare it to illusionism.
1732080	1734640	How would you define and differentiate them?
1735920	1744720	Well, I would say that most versions of illusionism, I would agree with to the extent that they say
1745600	1751200	that something about our experience is not as it seems to be.
1752080	1759120	I'm more specifically saying, we are actively deluded about it. Not just that it's an illusion,
1759120	1766320	but it's a kind of thinking problem, because we jump so quickly to assumptions. And that, and
1766320	1770960	if you look up delusion and illusion, they're not really that different, but delusion carries more
1770960	1778160	of a kind of intellectual, wordy thinking thing. And I think that's why I used that word to show
1779120	1785360	that we make assumptions that we can describe in words. Well, I think consciousness is made in the
1786080	1791440	anterior of something or whatever. I think consciousness is a product of the brain. I
1791440	1797760	think consciousness extends beyond the brain into the astral worlds, or I think consciousness
1797760	1803760	survives death. Whenever we talk about, people talk about these things, they are kind of
1803840	1811680	reifying with words, this thing. And the word delusionism, I think, gets to that more.
1812480	1817280	Maybe it doesn't for everyone, but that's what I think is the difference. But it's not a huge
1817280	1824240	difference. It's just, I think, if people say that illusionism is a theory of consciousness,
1824240	1829040	you said this, and I think I would disagree in the sense that it's not one theory. It's not
1829680	1836800	a testable theory, as a whole theory. It's a bunch of approaches that different people have,
1837440	1842640	and they're all slightly different. And we probably all agree that in some fundamental way,
1842640	1846880	we've mostly got it wrong about the nature of consciousness, that we probably disagree about
1847440	1853360	where the origins of the mistakes are. Sorry, that's a bit rambly. I don't know whether that
1853360	1856720	answers your question. When I took illusion as a theory of consciousness, I was actually
1856720	1862800	directly quoting Frankish's paper, the headline. I think that's what he called it, illusionism as
1862800	1868240	a consciousness. So when I approached it, I used psychiatry to try and assist it and defend it.
1868240	1872320	But at some point, I used a lot of Carl Friston's work. I'm not sure. Are you familiar with Carl
1872320	1878880	Friston's work with the free energy? Well, I haven't read, I'm just started reading the latest book,
1878880	1883840	and it's very hard going. As I said, when my daughter and I were doing the fourth edition
1883840	1890000	of the textbook, I read a lot of the control hallucination sort of stuff, so predictive
1890000	1894800	processing. I think Carl Friston's work is brilliant, but I do not understand the maths.
1894800	1900080	I just simply do not have enough of a maths background to understand that. But I mean,
1900080	1903760	over the years, I've learned something about Bayesian theory, because it pops up in psychology
1903760	1910640	quite a lot. But I'm very much enamoured of the way that predictive processing is changing the
1910640	1915040	way we think about all sorts of things in psychology now, or in neuroscience. And I think
1915040	1918480	that's really going places. I think we're really going to get somewhere with that.
1918480	1924000	When I spoke to Carl, I actually asked him if he thinks when you apply his view of
1924000	1927600	Markovian Blankets, the understanding of the free energy principle, Bayesian brains,
1929040	1934000	does he think this is actually a theory that supports illusionism? And he said it, yes.
1934560	1940240	He actually said technically, it would, because when you take into account,
1941200	1944640	in my paper, and when I discuss this with him, if you take into account the prior information
1944640	1947840	you receive, because that's a fundamental aspect of all of this, you're taking a lot of
1947840	1952080	prior information, and then you make posterior conclusions regarding your experience. If most
1952080	1957760	of your prior information tells you things like, I'm a self, I'm a person, I have a conscious entity,
1957760	1964080	your most likely posterior outcome is going to be, I am a self, I am a person, I have consciousness.
1964080	1969520	And then at some point, I used your work to say, if you define a delusion, a fixed false belief,
1969520	1974960	and if already the illusion has promoted a false belief, it becomes fixed at some point because
1974960	1978960	of all the prior information you've already received regarding this. And at some point,
1978960	1983600	that's why delusionism is bound to occur. And I think that's how I sort of work.
1983600	1989040	Great. I must watch this, your discussion with him, which I should, but there are so many things
1989040	1994640	to watch and listen to. It's a wonderful world, but it's also so difficult to choose, but I will
1994640	2001280	do that. But you were talking about Markov Blankets and Free Energy Principle and so on.
2002160	2006480	Again, the maths defeats me when it comes to Markov Blankets, although I do want to pursue
2006480	2010720	that more. But I have spent quite a lot of time thinking about the Free Energy Principle, because
2010720	2016160	it relates to what I was saying earlier about my interest in whether we can base an entire world
2016160	2021280	on some kind of informational theory, and trying to struggle with how that relates to Gibbs Free
2021280	2028160	Energy. And there are relationships between them. But again, I don't have all the background
2028160	2034080	skills to do very well with this, but I really think this is important and will help us a lot.
2034080	2038880	And I agree. I think so as well. I think at this point in your career, which aspects of this problem
2038880	2043840	or is it free will? Is it consciousness still? What's intriguing you the most at this point?
2045680	2049360	Well, you say at this point in my career, did you say?
2049440	2053760	So much. I mean, if you think about it, your work spans on so many different aspects. You
2053760	2058640	talk about memes, you talk about consciousness, free will, Paris psychology, there's so many
2058640	2062560	different elements to your career that it makes it quite difficult for one to actually try and do
2062560	2067280	an interview. Which is why I don't call it a career, because I only had a proper job for a few
2067280	2072960	years, because I couldn't quite hack it. I prefer to work by myself sitting here, you know. So I,
2073040	2079520	you know, I always kind of feel a bit surprised. I mean, my initial reaction to that question is
2079520	2084400	I'm really struggling with, you know, I'm 71, surely. And people are always saying to me,
2084400	2088480	Oh, you don't need to work anymore. You should be. And I have a big garden on the river. And,
2088480	2092560	you know, I'm spending a lot of time growing vegetables. And why don't you just do that?
2092560	2096640	Oh, and I do painting and kayaking and weightlifting and all kinds of things. You know,
2096640	2100640	why don't you just do those things and forget all that work? When I'm sitting there doing the
2100640	2107040	email, I'm like, Oh, God, you know. And so you could say at this point, I give it all up. But
2107040	2112800	that's not true. The more serious answer is it's really we've we've touched on this many times
2112800	2120160	already. It's really the what is the nature of the world? How does a world sustain what appears
2120160	2127840	to be dual existence observers and observed experiences and experiences when I believe
2127840	2133360	and so do you, I think that there is no true observer observing them. And you can have and
2133360	2139360	importantly, you can have experience without an experiencer with a lot of practice. And that's
2139360	2147120	really interesting how brains, you know, if you are in the delusion of the self is really in charge,
2147120	2151920	then it becomes really peculiar to think, Well, I am trying to get rid of myself.
2152880	2157360	I am trying to not believe anymore in me, you know, those kinds of things you get in all sorts
2157360	2168160	of tangles. And yet certain processes lead to a brain that is more adept at dropping some kinds
2168160	2173280	of illusions. So part of the answer to your interesting and difficult question is, that's
2173280	2178960	why I still go on retreats. This particular one I've just come back from was a co on retreat.
2178960	2186160	And I had a really, really tricky and interesting co on, which I have not resolved, which is good,
2186160	2190880	because then I can keep, it can keep working, but has had some quite profound effects on me
2190880	2196240	with all the struggles going on. So that's one way. And again, that's not a career is it,
2196240	2202240	but that's one way that I want to engage by doing I meditate every day and have done for
2202240	2209120	40 years nearly. To practice and train this brain and then thinking sort of memetically and
2209120	2217840	evolutionarily. It's not me train the brain. It's this person being having picked up
2218800	2224000	Zen meditation memes over there is somehow thinks it's worth doing and goes on doing,
2224000	2229200	you know, you when he's tried to dismantle those those prior assumptions about self,
2229200	2236560	you start thinking in these weird ways. So that's one big streak of it. The other has been
2236560	2240880	for my daughter and I doing this fourth edition and me getting into the predictive
2240880	2245040	processing, I'm still really interested in that. And I've got two books at the moment that I want
2245040	2253440	to read relevant to that. I've also got totally different thread going on, which I started last
2253440	2262720	year writing a book called, well, it's pretend possible title is God's memes, how and how
2262720	2268480	religions evolve to exploit us and why we let them. So you can imagine this is, you know,
2268480	2272080	they are memes out there, horrible meme plexus that get into people's heads and then you can't
2272080	2276960	get them out. So I'm reading books now about sort of mental immunity and that kind of thing. So I'm
2276960	2283280	doing that and it's all so I can't give you an answer. Perhaps I should. I think all my friends
2283280	2286640	and family will say for goodness sake, give an answer just decide what you're going, you know,
2286640	2291600	but I can't I just get I just keep thinking and being tempted by difficult ideas.
2291600	2296880	I remember there was a time where I was about, I think I was about nine and and at that point I
2296880	2303840	became very atheist to a point where I was very anti-theist. And I still remember as the years
2303840	2308320	went on, where were you living then? What sort of situation were you in? I'm from South Africa,
2308320	2314240	but I'm from Indian descent. But in South Africa, Indians have been living here for almost I think
2314240	2319840	about 160 plus years. So we're generations in at this point. And I think I'm like eight.
2319920	2326240	So did you have religious parents or I'm just I think so they are they couldn't they Hindu
2327120	2333040	by origin. Some of my family are Islam. I've a Muslim, so they follow Islam. And but I grew up
2333680	2337600	very much Hindu. But at some point, not really convinced about it. But I think my dad
2338240	2343280	subliminally just tried to hint me towards non-believing like just not doing it. You know,
2343280	2348480	he constantly made me watch National Geographic. He made me he wanted me to break away from
2348480	2352640	it somehow. So it happened very early on. And I remember throughout the years, I was very
2352640	2357600	anti-theist. And it was when I started coming across a lot of your guys work. So so Dennett,
2357600	2363360	Dawkins, Hitchens. And I still remember thinking, I mean, this this finally I found this group of
2363360	2368240	people where they're thinking the same thing. I'm pretty much it's all I've been thinking about.
2368800	2373200	When you find yourself writing this book at this point, I'm not as anti-theist as I used to be.
2373200	2378000	I mean, I can understand why we think this and why we get to that point. But I remember you first
2378000	2382560	break out, it's almost kind of like you want to go all out and and get the best arguments.
2382560	2386080	Do you feel like that's changed for you over the years where you found yourself constantly wanting
2386080	2390960	to battle and debate? And now you kind of just like, I might as well just let the person think
2390960	2395600	what they want until it sort of involves something that's going to directly. Well, this is why I was
2395600	2401360	interested in where you were coming from, because I was brought up as a Christian. My mother was a
2402240	2406240	was quite serious Christian. I mean, in the Church of England sort of way,
2407920	2412560	when she went to church most Sundays, I occasionally went and I had phases. So I didn't
2412560	2418560	ever have any, you know, really violently. I just remember as a teenager, just I went to the most
2418560	2424480	horrendous boarding school, and we had to go to chapel every day and twice on Sundays. And I, you
2424480	2428960	know, it was so boring. And then I began to think, well, it's also rather stupid and doesn't make sense.
2428960	2437120	And so I became quite quite atheist, but not in an aggressive kind of way. Then at the age of 26,
2437120	2443680	I fell deeply in love. And both of us became kind of a bit Christian again. And we had to
2443680	2447680	get married in a Christian church, because that was what you did in those days and where we were.
2449280	2455360	And that lasted maybe a year or two and kind of gently fizzled out. So I was a very different
2455440	2461280	kind of experience from you. When I've been trying to write this book, I certainly how I
2461280	2467760	should admit that I have some times when I'm thinking, and I want to write, this is total crap,
2467760	2472560	yo, what idiot can believe this, you know, and I think, well, it's not very constructive. And
2472560	2480560	actually, they're not all idiots who believe these things. Oh, I've had the most twice recently
2480560	2489120	had time to talk at length with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. And he is such an
2489120	2498880	interesting man. There is an intelligent kind, as far as I can tell, public spirited, longing to
2498880	2507920	help people, person who will talk to me as an atheist in a very friendly and open way. And I
2507920	2512960	try to remember people like that. Now, I think he is completely deluded about the nature of the
2512960	2518960	universe and how we got here and everything else. But I really like talking to him about it. So I
2521440	2530400	guess that helps me be a little more flexible in the way I use my atheism.
2531360	2537360	Yeah, my girlfriend is Christian, and I know she is a believer in it. But I feel like this age,
2537360	2540480	and at this time in my life, it's no longer a thing, because I know if it was 10 years ago,
2540480	2546160	it would be something that would be a deal break. Ultimate, it would be done. But at this,
2546160	2549120	I often think when you're talking about this, I remember the conversation you had with
2549920	2555680	Jordan Peterson, and you guys discuss this, do you, now while writing this book,
2555760	2560400	are you looking back at certain conversations like that, and formulating counter arguments to
2560400	2565040	someone like Jordan, who's very good at arguing and counter points, even though you fundamentally
2565040	2571120	obviously disagree with? Oh, that was a quite scary encounter. But I saw a little bit of it the
2571120	2574640	other day, because somebody asked me, I get so confused about all these things, but somebody
2574640	2579920	asked me to go on their podcast or something. I haven't gone anywhere with this yet. It was
2579920	2584720	literally yesterday, and that he was putting together some kind of something or other that
2584720	2589120	included clips for me and Jordan Peterson. And so I watched it, it was very short, you know,
2589120	2594880	like a minute. I thought, oh, good for me. I actually stood up to him and argued back. I mean,
2595840	2603120	God, I knew nothing about it. I had not even heard of him. When Premier Christian Radio it was,
2603120	2610160	the discussion was on. I'd done things for, Justin Briley runs it, and I'd done things for him
2610160	2614480	before and enjoyed it very much. So I was happy to go along. And I had to look up Jordan Peterson,
2614480	2619360	but you know, time being what it is. I read his, I read his book most of it on the train going up
2619360	2628400	to London. It's three and a half hours from here. And it's 12 rules for living, which had quite an
2628400	2635360	impact on me, because some, you know, ludicrous things in there, and yet it's a bestseller,
2635360	2639440	and people follow the rules, and one must be nice to cats. And I mean, there's weird things in there.
2639440	2648000	Like make your bed and small things. Yes, yes, yes, quite good advice. And yet the whole
2648000	2652160	thing's wrapped up in these weird stuff. And I was sitting there, kind of getting cross with it in
2652160	2656400	the train. And there was this elderly couple opposite me. Now, I mean, again, I'm interested in,
2656400	2660480	in where you were when you were growing up, because during my life here in England,
2660480	2665280	people have got less and less and less religious. So this is typical of me. I don't think first
2665360	2671760	before I speak. Sorry. But there was this elderly couple opposite me on the table in the train.
2672320	2677600	And I so went, I sort of looked up at them. I said, Oh, God, this book's doing my head in
2677600	2681440	or something like that. You know, oh, what is the book? And I said, Oh, that's really interesting.
2681440	2685760	I said, Oh, he believes in God. And I went to, you know, just that's the sort of thing I would
2685760	2690640	say. And they said, Yeah, isn't that trouble? And just to completely agree with me. And that is a
2690640	2696880	kind of assumption I occasionally fall foul of. I was on a group walk up on Dartmoor a couple of
2696880	2701600	weeks ago. And I happened to say something just assuming that the two people who were listening
2701600	2707200	to me wouldn't believe in God. And one of them said, Well, I think that something about Jesus
2707200	2712720	Christ is my, you know, whatever, should be more careful, or should I? And it always raises that
2712720	2718720	question. I think the fact that I can safely assume almost all the time that other people
2718720	2723120	around me don't believe in God. They're not thoughtful. I mean, they haven't thought through
2723120	2727280	their atheism to great deep degree. They just, they just, it's the normal thing around here,
2727280	2732560	you know, people in my village, we all go and sing Christmas carols at Christmas and thoroughly
2732560	2736880	enjoy ourselves. And so, and then, you know, those things in the Christmas carols like,
2737840	2743360	does not abhor the Virgin's womb, you know, I think, Oh, yeah. And so some of us women are
2743360	2750000	going, Virgin's women, you know, we're just having a laugh. And maybe some people in the
2750000	2754160	audience in the village, if there's about 100 of us there in the village square, you know,
2754160	2759600	who are really upset by what we're doing, but that's kind of the atmosphere that I live in.
2759600	2766960	So it's very easy to be loosely atheist or more strictly atheist and not have to make a big fuss
2766960	2770880	about it. I still do remember that was quite a long time ago, because at that point, I don't
2770880	2776720	think Jordan was at this level of, of, of fame and popularity is at this point. It was around
2776720	2781280	the time I think Sam and him also got into a huge debate and they had that two part series where
2781280	2786000	they got really into it. In doing your research, I mean, are you rereading books like The God
2786000	2791440	Delusion or Why God is Not Great by Hitchens? Are you, how's your research process going with this
2791440	2800640	book? So the specific question, I started reading Hitchens again. And like the first time, I
2800640	2809280	really disliked it intensely. It's unkind, spiky. Very aggressive, yes. I don't, I don't like it.
2810080	2818000	The God Delusion, I may well read again. But most of my research has been online finding
2818000	2824480	things out. I mean, the things I found out like, okay, it seems to me that religions should
2825200	2829920	make people behave like their religion tells them and therefore be kinder and more altruistic. So
2830400	2837440	look into all the, you know, research evidence on, on whether it's true and it's not, you know,
2837440	2841680	and it was, the evidence goes in all sorts of directions, but basically it's not. And then I
2841680	2849760	got very interested in, in poverty and, you know, it's a very obvious, excuse me, it's a very obvious
2849760	2855520	fact about the world that the poorest countries are the most religious. Now, why is that? And then
2855520	2862160	there's Gregory Paul's research showing that if you compare developed countries
2863280	2871760	on what he calls a dysfunctional society scale against how religious they are, well,
2871760	2876800	the most religious countries are the most dysfunctional, meaning that the more religious
2876800	2885440	the country is, the higher rates it has of murder, teenage pregnancy, abortion,
2887600	2893280	various kinds of serious crime, incarceration rates. I mean, all the things that you would expect
2893280	2900960	that a religion would improve are actually very much worse. And then there's the question, why? So
2900960	2908720	we're back to causality and correlation. These are all correlations. Now it looks from the evidence
2908720	2919120	as though it's not that religions cause depravity, murder, incarceration rates, it's rather the
2919120	2924400	reverse. It's that living in a dysfunctional society where you are afraid for your health,
2924400	2930880	for your life, for everything makes you turn to religion. And then the means get hold of you
2930960	2934480	and you start to believe that you're good because you believe this stuff and you're good because
2934480	2939760	all of that and you're good because you oppose abortion and you whatever and you think people
2939760	2944480	should be locked up for whatever it is. And so the United States is particularly interesting
2944480	2951040	in that respect because it's a very rich country, but it has high rates of religion and it's so
2951040	2957760	different from the UK speaking sort of the same language, which we have a state religion and
2957840	2962240	they don't. It's so interesting that. So I mean, I just got myself hooked into, you know,
2962240	2967760	reading loads of stuff to draw and work out the effects of being captured by religious means.
2968720	2973200	I haven't read, I know Dawkins wrote a book, I think, it wasn't too long ago for,
2973200	2978320	was it for young teens, I think, for a book? What is it called? Do you remember? I forgot
2978320	2983440	the name of the book. No, and I haven't read it either. Maybe I should. There's so much to read
2983760	2987360	and it's so interesting. The reason why I'm asking about that is, I mean, I know that
2987360	2991200	Charles Darwin is a big inspiration for you. I mean, I love Charles Darwin. He's one of my
2991200	2996000	favorite people of all time, possibly. And, and I know Dawkins also up there, these guys,
2996000	3001600	how have they influenced your way of thinking overall in life? Oh, hugely. I mean, my two greatest,
3001600	3005760	if you have this lovely sort of dinner party thing, you know, who would you invite from the
3006080	3009200	Mount Rushmore? Your Mount Rushmore.
3011440	3015280	Why? I'm sorry, I'm not with you. So, you know, Mount Rushmore, the fourth figures,
3015280	3018480	the leading figures. It's not all those, yeah, but they're all presidents, weren't they?
3018480	3021600	But I mean, who would those four people be in terms of the thinkers? You're talking about the
3021600	3025600	dinner table. It's sort of a similar... Oh, no, yeah, yeah. That's so different, though. They're
3025600	3030080	not on a pedestal. They are. They are. I would like them, like the Archbishop of Canterbury. I
3030080	3034080	would like to sit down. I like so, my husband and I went to dinner with him. We sat around a
3034080	3038720	lovely table in Lambeth Palace and had a lovely chat. So, I'm thinking of that, not
3041360	3048560	so my top two would be Charles Darwin and William James. Now, we haven't mentioned William James,
3048560	3056320	but he is such a great hero of mine. Now, his two volumes of 1890, The Principles of Psychology,
3057040	3062720	has such a profound effect on me. And I keep thinking about him, how way ahead of his time he
3062720	3067600	was, and the way he thought about things. He clearly was struggling with the kind of problems
3067600	3072880	we've been talking about here, about dualism, about the nature of the world, the nature of the mind.
3073760	3079120	Can there be split personalities? And does that mean there's really somebody or not?
3079120	3084080	And I love one of his thoughts about, and this is all in the textbook, and my son, Julian, did a
3084080	3091600	lovely cartoon of cows, where he says the owner of the thought, and so the thought with a big T,
3092560	3097600	is then, in the next moment, passes off the owner of the cow's one, and then the thoughts,
3097600	3103440	passes them on. It's a new owner, but the same, you know, cows. There isn't a, there isn't a
3103440	3113120	continuous self. Exactly. I'm sorry about that. James's idea that, I mean, his chat is 100 pages,
3113120	3119360	his chapter on self, and it's really hard going, and I've read it a few times. I'd love to have
3119360	3125040	time to read it again, but I don't. But it very much fits with the kind of Buddhist
3126400	3133920	non-self, or another kind of view that the self isn't what you think it is. And the Buddha was
3133920	3137520	sometimes saying, there is a self in terms of isn't, which of course fits with the same thing.
3137520	3141920	There is this illusion, but there isn't the thing that you think the illusion tells you there is.
3142960	3148160	And William James was really struggling with all of that. So he would be, along with Darwin,
3148160	3155040	they're my two great historical figures that I so much admire. Of recently, well, I know Richard
3155040	3160800	Dawkins very well. He's been to stay here a few times. You know, I meet him anyway, so I don't
3160800	3169440	have to have a mythical dinner table. Then it's same. Yep. We have occasional meme lab meetings
3169440	3174320	here. We've got one coming up soon, and both of them have been to those, and we've been able to
3174320	3180880	have long chats about memes and things. And I admire both of them, but they're both still alive
3180880	3185200	and going strong, which is great. One of the William James quotes that come to my mind, because when
3185200	3189200	you think about, particularly what you're talking about with religion and how people are influenced
3189200	3194640	by other people and language, etc. I mean, he talks about how pruning of brains William James
3194640	3200960	once said, I think he said, for a child, sensory inputs, one great blooming, buzzing confusion.
3200960	3204080	I think it's something along those lines. Yes, yes, the blooming, buzzing confusion.
3204080	3207600	Yes. Because at some point, we just take in the information we receive, and then that point,
3207600	3212880	that becomes your fundamental beliefs. And if everything you, if all the memes you were gathering
3212880	3216640	over the years were about religion or about a specific view on consciousness, that's what
3216640	3221280	you're firmly going to believe at some point. But the buzzing, blooming confusion is very
3221280	3226640	interesting because it led to all these different arguments in psychology about just how much we
3226640	3232000	have prewired and how much we don't. So he was in the direction of, although not entirely,
3232720	3240320	in the direction of that it's not prewired, it's all got to be in response to the input,
3240320	3246480	which was a pretty novel idea then really. And now I think we know that there's quite a lot of
3246480	3253760	prewiring. But still, that the brain becomes organized by the organization in the, in the
3253760	3260320	structure of the input. So the visual cortex or auditory cortex get organized in the way the
3260320	3264480	input comes in. And now this is another thing to think about in terms of predictive processing.
3264480	3270000	So when you think about a system that is at many levels at once trying to predict what's
3270000	3275600	coming in the, from the next layer, that fits with it. Your, your baby with buzzing,
3276880	3281680	blooming, buzzing confusion is, is, you know, struggling. It's got a structure set up that
3281680	3285600	is capable to do this struggling, that is capable of making predictions, but they're going to be
3285600	3290720	really simple like to do with, if I put, we're back to, if, you know, if I put my arm here,
3290720	3295360	ooh, it hit something and then I'll predict and the way babies learn that and the way they blah,
3295360	3302400	blah, blah, blah, and gradually hone what the noises they make according to the responses and
3302400	3306880	so on. So yes, I think a lot of William James's ideas, not all, I mean, a lot of things he said
3306880	3311200	were simply bomb, you know, that he didn't have the physiology. But a lot of those ideas
3311680	3315360	are still helpful. I think one of my favorite quotes as well has got to be,
3315360	3320400	then it's illusion. I mean, consciousness is illusion off the brain for the brain,
3320400	3325040	by the brain. Oh, I've not heard that, but yes, yes.
3325040	3328160	Off the brain for the brain and by the brain. By the brain. Yeah.
3329440	3333120	When you hear something like that, what do you think? How do you think then it would approach
3333120	3338000	a lot of the new idealist theories that are coming out today? Any idea? I've spoken to him by email,
3338000	3341840	but seems to be relatively unavailable to chat on a podcast lately.
3343600	3350080	Oh, he's been terribly busy with all this paper on artificial persons and all the
3350080	3354480	danger of that because he normally replies to my emails very quickly and he didn't this time.
3354480	3357440	And then when he did replies, I've been totally snowed under with all this stuff.
3357440	3363920	And you know, so that's probably why I think he would be irritated by it,
3363920	3369760	but I don't know and I shouldn't speak for him. Now, I must say, I believe that when we fixed
3369760	3376880	this up a long time ago, I said I could only talk for an hour because you can tell I can't,
3376880	3380240	this is my problem. I've got chronic fatigue. It's not too bad at the moment,
3380880	3386400	but I can't not pour out lots of energy. So I've been sitting here really enjoying talking to you,
3386400	3390400	but it takes a lot of energy and I need to sort of collapse pretty soon.
3390400	3393920	So I completely understand. I know so much, but thank you. I really appreciate it. I've
3393920	3396720	been waiting a long time and hopefully in the future we can chat about something in a bit
3396720	3399120	more detail because there's so many topics I want to discuss with you.
3400080	3404240	Well, you asked brilliant questions. I do quite a lot of podcasts and they vary so much.
3405280	3410480	And you know, this is one of the fun ones where some of the questions are fun because I can
3410480	3415520	answer them easily. Others are fun because I can't answer them and you're really making me think
3416320	3420240	I'm pushing me and that's that's good. So thank you.
3420240	3423760	I really appreciate it. I mean, it's great to hear that. I feel much better
3423760	3426240	leaving this conversation knowing you feel that way. Thank you so much.
3426880	3430640	It's great. Have a great evening, Sue. And yeah, and we'll chat again.
3431280	3434800	Oh, let's do that. I would enjoy that. Thanks very much. Cheers.
3434800	3440800	Bye.
