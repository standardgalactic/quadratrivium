1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,920
Look, the last time we spoke done, we, we touched on the fact that physics and evolution

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,720
agree, space time is doomed. At this point, it is not fundamental reality, nor its objects.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,800
And today, I think our focus is going to be on your paper, conscious agents and the subatomic

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,640
world, which I've read a couple of times and still I don't think I understand it as much as

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,360
I would have to. It's very complicated. I don't have a physics background, but I'm hoping this

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,000
conversation is going to help enlighten me a bit more. Wonderful paper, by the way. How was it

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,800
working with Chetan and Swapham again? How's it going? Very, very fun. Chetan has been a

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,680
collaborator for more than 30 years. So we go back a long time from our youth. And so we're

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,600
continuing to have fun collaborating with each other. You know, we bounce ideas back and

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,680
forth. He's the mathematical genius. I'm the mathematical flunky. But he's trained me enough

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,240
so I can actually talk with him about it. And then he can do the actual hard math stuff. And

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,160
then Swapham is a world-class experimental particle physicist. He's at CERN and the Fermilab. And

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,760
he contacted us out of the blue earlier this year. He'd seen our work on consciousness and his

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:32,880
possible relationship to particle physics. And he thought that there's some possible good stuff

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,120
there. And so he looked at what we were doing in the paper. We were already halfway through that

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,800
paper writing it when he contacted us. And he decided to join forces and work with us on it. So

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,600
we're really glad to have a real professor of particle physics. He's a professor at UC Berkeley,

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,920
now emeritus, but also at CERN and Fermilab. So Swapham has been very, very helpful. He's a

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,920
no-nonsense guy. He knows what's real and what's not. And so he helps really guide us in terms of

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,240
the... We have to be daring. But sometimes you're daring and obviously wrong. So he helps us.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,320
That's amazing. And the fact that you guys have someone like that, I mean, in this paper, you

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,400
propose a mathematical model in which conscious agents are fundamental and interact by Markovian

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,160
dynamics. And some agents create space time as an interface where by the interact and physics is the

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,720
projection of the ancient dynamics onto the interface. So this is quite a fascinating idea

25
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,920
altogether. I mean, in a nutshell, you're basically saying that conscious agents create the subatomic

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,200
world. Let's start by exploring that basic concept.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,360
That's right. So it is out of the box. But here's what I think is the current state of play in physics

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:05,880
that calls for out-of-the-box thinking like this. And that is that space time, first space and time were

29
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:14,040
the foundation for Newtonian mechanics. And that was fantastic for several centuries. And so successful

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,640
that many physicists like in the 1890s figured that it was done. Physics had little mop up jobs to do

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,400
here and there, but it was done. And bright students should go elsewhere to, you know, because there

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,720
was just nothing for really bright people to do. Well, that all blew apart in 1900 and then 1905,

33
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:41,320
with Planck's work and then Einstein's work. And basically by 1905, it was over for space and time.

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,760
And it was over for Newtonian as being fundamental. Of course, we still use Newton to this day, but as a

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,400
fundamental theory, it was over. But it took a few decades for some to find that out, right? You know,

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,880
the 1922 Nobel Committee giving Einstein his prize made it clear it was not for relativity theory, not

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,160
for his theory of space time. So I mean, even though it had been over for 17 years, it takes a long

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:15,560
time for the community to understand and move on. Well, so now, Einstein's space time has been a

39
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:23,440
found fantastic foundation for more than a century, special in general relativity theories. But in

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,200
2005, David Gross, the Nobel Prize winner for his work on the strong force, you know, wrote an article

41
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,840
that was, of course, you know, in honor of Einstein and the 100th anniversary of his 1905 miracle year

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,440
and his special theory of relativity. But then he, you know, in the right spirit of science, he said

43
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,680
space time is doomed. Thank you, Einstein for space time. But now space time is doomed. It's time for

44
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,600
us to move on. And that's the way good science is. And since then, a lot of others have echoed the

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,640
same thing in Neymar, Connie Hamed and Nathan Cyberg and Ed Whitten and so forth, you know, are

46
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,240
basically saying in their own words, space time is doomed. And what that means is not that we're

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,480
going to throw space time away, but that it's, it's not a deep enough structure to be thought of as

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,920
foundational. It has specific limits. It has no operational meaning beyond the Planck scale, which

49
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,760
is like 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds. It just, it has no operational

50
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,600
meaning, which, which, which means that it's not usable beyond that. And it's really pointing to its

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,920
own limitation. So, so the question is, what, how do we go next? Because most people think, well, you

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,760
know, space time is the fundamental reality. How can I think out? So how could any objects or any

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,320
entities be outside of space time? Space time is everything there is. That's the way we think. And,

54
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:05,160
and so this requires a new level of creativity, because the idea is, you have to open your mind.

55
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Space time is not fundamental. You have to think, could there be new structures entirely outside

56
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,120
space time, not curled up inside space time, the little hidden dimensions are entirely outside. And,

57
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:27,960
and in the last nine years. So this is relatively recent. Physicists have published structures.

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,560
They've discovered beyond space time, not not not curled up again in inside space time entirely

59
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,560
outside space time. And most people have no idea what that could even mean. What could you possibly

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,240
mean about structures that are outside of space time? But that's, that's where we're headed. And so

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,400
that's what we're doing in in our work on conscious agents. And I'll just say the reason for what

62
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,160
we're doing is this. The physicists have discovered structures that are that are static, like

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,800
geometric objects and structures like permutations and so forth. But, but they haven't yet

64
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,200
posited a dynamics that would account for these structures. And so the structures that like the

65
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:18,240
amplitude hydrant and things called decorated permutations and cosmological polytopes and so

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,920
forth. So, so they have these these structures, but you know, ultimately, physics goes after

67
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,440
dynamics. But this is going to be different because these are going to be dynamical entities, not in

68
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,400
side space time, but dynamical entities, utterly and completely outside of space time. And so

69
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840
that's not going to be comfortable. What what in the world could we are? What are these things that

70
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,920
are not inside space time? I mean, you and I are, you know, here we are inside space. What are these

71
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,360
things that are not inside space time that are dynamical? And what are they doing? And why? So

72
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,880
you can see that this is this is not a trivial endeavor. And you have to, you know, you work,

73
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,520
of course, we're going to make mistakes here. And that's what we're so we're we're proposing.

74
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:15,040
I'll put it in the the least tendentious way. We're just proposing that there are these dynamical

75
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,200
entities beyond space time that have a Markovian dynamics. And the argument for this Markovian

76
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,960
dynamics in part is that we show how a Markovian dynamics projects to decorated permutations

77
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,240
and through and therefore through decorated permutations into space time. So, so what we're

78
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,600
doing is we're saying the physicists discovered decorated permutations beyond space time.

79
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,400
And it's a big surprise, you know, permutations of what and for why what who ordered this,

80
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,840
basically, you know, why why should that be what we're discovering beyond space time. And what

81
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,960
we're saying is, well, we discovered that if you have any Markovian dynamical system, the so-called

82
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,680
the the ergodic communicating classes of it, the recurrent communicating classes

83
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,480
of the Markovian dynamics are classified by decorated permutations. So that's a new result

84
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
in a paper we published in January. So we we, as far as we can tell, no one had ever published

85
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,320
that before. And so we discovered that and that gave us a way to take our Markovian dynamics

86
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,720
and say this could be a the kind of dynamics that's beyond space time because it does map

87
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
into these decorated permutations. And so there's some kind of dynamical entities.

88
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,520
That's the least tendentious way to put it. What we're proposing is more tendentious. We're

89
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,840
saying, well, we're also after consciousness, we're interested in consciousness and the hard

90
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,040
problem of consciousness, what's relationship and consciousness and brain activity. And so

91
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
we're trying to, in some sense, kill two birds with one stone, what's beyond space time,

92
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,600
and can we solve the hard problem of consciousness at the same time with that. So

93
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
we're proposing these are dynamical entities that we'd call conscious ages. But, you know,

94
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
you know, the mathematics stands by itself. If you don't like the conscious interpretation,

95
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,120
just say they're dynamical entities beyond space time. But I'm interested in pursuing the conscious

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,800
agent interpretation myself, and how this can help us with the hard problem of consciousness.

97
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I think, look, at the moment, you're doing very fascinating work. I've got a lot of notes in front

98
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,320
of me. I made tons of notes because your paper is quite extensive. As of today, I'm not sure

99
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,960
it's not yet published, if I'm correct, Don, the current paper. That's right. It's going to be

100
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,720
we submitted it as a contestant in a competition for the Institute of Neolithic Sciences.

101
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,640
And we're one of three winners of that competition. And so it's going to be released on June 24. So

102
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,120
there's going to be an online, I think Zoom, anybody that wants to can join in and I'll be

103
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,160
talking for 20 minutes describing our work there. And then the other two groups that are

104
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,640
winning will also be describing their work. So it's June 24 at the Institute of Neolithic Sciences.

105
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,280
You can just go online and it's free to log in. Okay, great. At some point, I will put a link to

106
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,960
that. And just by the way, for everyone listening or watching, I'll put the link to our previous

107
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,440
conversation as well, because there we discussed conscious realism, user interface theory, we

108
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,640
discussed quite a few things. But keeping in track with this paper, the theory of conscious agents,

109
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,600
that these two assumptions pretty much they exist conscious experiences, such as the taste of

110
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,200
chocolate or the mood of elation, that's something you've written. And they exist, probabilistic

111
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,840
relations among experiences as well. But then you go further to describe what are called CA nets.

112
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,480
So talk to me about what a CA net is, and then we'll move from there and just go through the paper

113
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,880
and a bit of a systematic approach. That's right. So the way I think to think about it,

114
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,160
that's the most easy for most people would be think about the Twitterverse, right? That's a big

115
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,680
interacting social network. There's millions of Twitter users, probably billions of tweets

116
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
that are going along. And if you think about it, you're following certain people.

117
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,080
If you're Twitter, you follow certain people, there may be a few dozen or a few hundred or a

118
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,120
few thousand people that you're following. And there might be a few dozen or if you're lucky,

119
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,640
a few thousand or a few hundred thousand that are following you. And so it's a really complicated

120
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,040
social network. And there are lots of subgroups that they have their own interests and the things

121
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,760
that they're following and so forth. And so that's what you should think about when you think about

122
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,080
this conscious agent network. There are a bunch of these agents, they're interacting. What they're

123
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:39,120
passing instead of tweets is they're passing experiences. And effectively, tweets are affecting

124
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,080
your experiences. They're thinking how you think, what videos you see, what cat video you're looking

125
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,320
at and laughing at. And so they're affecting your experiences. So that's quite parallel.

126
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,320
And so this is just doing a Markovian dynamics of this network of conscious agents and proposing

127
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,480
that that's the fundamental reality. And again, by the way, I'm absolutely not Dr. Nair about this.

128
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,760
This is like my attitude is we're taking our first baby steps out of space time. Of course,

129
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,400
we're going to be wrong. But you've got to do something precise. And it's going to be, I think

130
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,560
future work will look at that as our work is simple. But hey, it was bold and it was precise.

131
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,480
So we're trying to make a bold and precise step outside of space time. And we're proposing this

132
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,160
Markovian dynamics. So that's sort of the top level. Now, I should say why you mentioned that

133
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,240
we're talking about experiences and probabilistic relationships among experiences. You might wonder,

134
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,200
well, why in the world did they just do that? I mean, they're thinking about consciousness.

135
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,080
There's a lot of stuff in consciousness. There's the self. There's learning and memory and problem

136
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:01,440
solving and intelligence. And there's just a ton of stuff that free will. Why aren't they talking

137
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,400
about all of that and putting that right into their model? And the reason we're not putting that

138
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:15,120
right up front is the whole point of a scientific theory is to have as few assumptions up front as

139
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,800
possible. If you throw in the kitchen sink, what are you going to explain? You want to make the work

140
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,960
as hard as possible for you as few and as trivial the assumptions as you possibly can. And then you

141
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,120
have to do all the hard work to explain all this other stuff. So our attitude was,

142
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,520
if we just say that there are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate, smell of garlic,

143
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,280
whatever it might be, and probabilistic relationships among them. And we can then say, okay,

144
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:53,600
the probabilistic relationships will be Markovian. Basically, it just means probability with a finite

145
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,440
memory. That's all it really means, probability with a finite memory of what happened in the past.

146
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,120
If we start with that, then we can build networks of these interacting,

147
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,080
trivial conscious entities. But these networks, we can show are computationally universal.

148
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
So anything you can do with neural nets, you can do with these conscious agent nets,

149
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,520
even though they start off with just experiences and probabilities of relationships among

150
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,680
experiences, you can build anything that you want out of it because they're computationally

151
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,800
universal. So we can build theories of learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence, and so forth.

152
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,360
We can do all of that. And it's even more interesting because Markovian dynamical systems

153
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:51,520
are not limited to computation. They're defined on probability spaces. And the measurable sets

154
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,760
in the probability spaces which they're defined on need not be computable. So we're not doing that

155
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,800
right now in our work. We're only looking at the computational aspects. But if we upgrade our

156
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,560
brains, we might be able to go after the beyond computational aspects. But I'm happy just to

157
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,400
look at the computation for now. But so that's sort of the top level of you and why we picked

158
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:23,920
what we picked. If we put a self in there to begin with, it seems like we're just throwing too much

159
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:33,920
of the kitchen sink in upfront. And same thing with intelligence and even specific kinds of memories.

160
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
I mean, we have this one, just a finite memory of

161
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,680
concentrations. But then you think about humans, we have episodic memories and memories about

162
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,600
things learned in language, the structure of language, the grammars of language that we know.

163
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,880
And so there's lots of different kinds of memories, short term memory, long term memory.

164
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,080
So that will have to all build out of networks. So that's sort of the top level.

165
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,600
I think that that approach is both it's a humble approach and very strategic in a sense. Obviously,

166
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
you don't want to put too much out there and focus on too much. You want to maintain a core focus.

167
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,160
And I think that's great. But I think it's also nice to see someone who's claiming something so

168
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,400
extravagant. I mean, to some people, this is very outside the box. It's extremely out there.

169
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,160
And when they approach you with any questions, I always see, I love how humble your approach is,

170
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
because you'd expect someone who's claiming something so outrageous to actually say,

171
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,240
defend themselves a lot. But you don't, you often say, your goal is to be proved wrong. You

172
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,760
want people to actively prove you wrong. That is, that is something science. That's what I actually

173
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,880
love about your approach to this whole thing. So far, when you've started since starting,

174
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
how much like let's say pushback have you gotten from the scientific community?

175
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,240
This is I'm just stepping off the paper for now. So my lot of my closer colleagues are, you know,

176
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
studying consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness. And so my training is in cognitive

177
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,960
neuroscience and artificial intelligence. And, and so a lot of my colleagues and good friends

178
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,160
who are physicalists and looking after looking for how the brain or computer systems could

179
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,600
create consciousness. So we're all we're all good buddies and friends and so forth. I think

180
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:28,480
most of them aren't persuaded by a long shot. And I'm sure a few secretly think that, you know,

181
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,720
I, you know, you had a lot of promise, but look what he's squandering it, you know. So, so yeah,

182
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,320
yeah, I'm sure it, but you know, they'll be polite and have a beer and we'll have a good discussion

183
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,520
and so forth. So, you know, and that's to be expected to mean it's it's, there's nothing

184
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,040
new under the sun. This is the way it's always been in science. Most of the quote unquote

185
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,000
innovations turn out to be wrong. And the ones that turn out to be right aren't usually recognized

186
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,360
for a long time. And that's just that's, and that's the way it should be. Science is a conservative

187
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,640
enterprise in the sense that as a social institution, it's conservative. Of course, we

188
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,920
need entrepreneur, individual entrepreneurs within science to push different ideas and

189
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,280
and take them to their limits. And of course, in most cases, be wrong. But but then science as a

190
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,200
social institution checks and rechecks and shows you where you're wrong or where you need to polish

191
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,440
your assumptions and so forth. So, so yeah. But but then, you know, the pushback goes both ways

192
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,560
when my whenever I get together with my colleagues on stage who are physicalists,

193
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,680
but the one question I always ask is, okay, so you have a theory in which, you know,

194
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:53,520
integrated information patterns or orchestrated collapse of quantum states of neuronal micro

195
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:02,320
tubules or some global workspace architecture. You claim gives rise to conscious experiences.

196
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,400
Okay, great. So what specific conscious experience like the taste of chocolate or

197
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
whatever, whatever anyone you want. Can you give me one example where you say,

198
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,160
this pattern of integrated information must be the taste of chocolate. And these are the

199
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,920
reasons why that pattern of integration is necessarily the same thing or give rise to

200
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,000
the taste of chocolate and could not possibly be the taste of vanilla. I mean, this is supposed

201
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,280
to be a third consciousness. So what one conscious experience can you explain? And there's, and this

202
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,680
is a stunning result. There is in all of the physicalist theories. And I include it in that group.

203
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
They may say it's not necessarily physicalist, but

204
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,720
yes, anyway, yeah, I just spoke to Christoph Koch the other day. And I know it's almost it's kind

205
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,360
of like an idealist and sorry, a hand psychist approach, but you're not really

206
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,480
psychist. Yeah, exactly. They would say yeah, that's right. So so but I would say that they're

207
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,680
trying to have some kind of, you know, computational core, like an integrated information

208
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
shape or something like that that gives rise or is identical to the so if you think it gives rise

209
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,160
to it or is identical to give me one, just give me one example where your theory works on ones.

210
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,800
I want one specific conscious experience that we can go test. But if you don't have one with

211
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,280
a specific conscious experience that we can go test, how can this be a theory of consciousness?

212
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,320
And so there's, there's literally not one experience that has been able to be explained

213
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:54,000
by any of these theories where they say this pattern of, you know, neuronal collapse of micro

214
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,720
quantum states of neuronal microchipals must be the taste of chocolate or this global

215
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,520
workspace architecture and this pattern of activity must be the smell of, you know,

216
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,320
cherry. There's nothing on the table. And, and I think, you know, Stephen Pinker understands

217
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,840
this. He's, he's a, you know, a friend of mine for many years and brilliant. And he likes the

218
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,720
global workspace model, but he says in his recent book, The Enlightenment Now book,

219
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,800
I think 2018 or something like that, that he likes the global workspace, but, but the connection

220
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,040
between the state of the global workspace and specific conscious experiences, he says,

221
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,280
is something is the, is the last dollop of a theory that will have to be stipulated.

222
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,760
And he's right. The connections are stipulated. So there's not, they're not explained. And that's

223
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,320
the key thing. They're, they're, they're saying we have a theory of consciousness, but no specific

224
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,480
conscious experience is ever explained. It's always stipulated. And so, so what I always say

225
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,640
to my friends is, look, you guys, you're, you're stipulating these, you know, like the neuronal

226
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,080
workspace, the global, the global workspace architecture or IIT or, you know, orchestrated

227
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,120
collapses, you're stipulating that, and you're stipulating these conscious experiences. And

228
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,360
then you also have to stipulate the relationship between them. Well, I'm only stipulating the

229
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,560
conscious experiences. And I propose to show you where space time and physical objects come from.

230
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,040
So based on what we call Occam's razor, you know, the theory with the simplest

231
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,920
set of assumptions wins, this theory should prevail because we don't have, I don't have to

232
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,520
stipulate as much as you stipulate. So that's my attitude about it. And one reason I took this

233
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,960
direction, if I could have given a physicalist theory, I would have. But I realized decades ago,

234
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:04,960
it's not possible. It's just not possible. And why, why waste my time? So as strange and as

235
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,400
counterintuitive as it might be, let's just let go of space time. Let's, you mean, if I have to

236
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,160
let go of, if I, if I'm wrong, do I have conscious experiences? I'm not sure I'm right about anything.

237
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,640
So, so I'm, you know, again, I might be wrong, but, but boy, you know,

238
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,680
so let's assume that there are conscious experiences, taste of chocolate, smell of,

239
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,640
let's just make that mathematically precise. And then let's see if it's possible to boot up

240
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,280
space time. And that's what this last paper is about. So, okay, well, finally, I can say,

241
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,600
we can have a Markovian dynamics of these conscious experiences interacting. And the,

242
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
the physicist told us that we need to get it mapped onto decorated permutations if we're

243
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,400
going to map it into space time. Well, we can do that, we can map, that's a new mathematics, but we,

244
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,840
we, we discovered this new mathematics, we map Markovian dynamics to canonically into

245
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,160
decorated permutations. And then the physicist tells us how to take it into scattering amplitudes,

246
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,120
like particle scattering in space time. So that's, that's sort of the big picture about

247
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,960
why we're making these bold, crazy moves beyond space time. The bottom line is, when you try to

248
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,400
do it inside space time, you learn first, space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

249
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,520
And second, the best and brightest minds, my colleagues are brilliant. These best and brightest

250
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,480
minds on the planet cannot figure out how to boot up conscious experiences, not even one

251
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,040
from inside space time. And, and it's not because they're done, they're brilliant,

252
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,160
it's just that you can't do it from within space time. And, and that will be the lesson,

253
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,600
but we had to really, we had to spend a lot of hard work and a lot of careers to learn that it

254
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,400
can't be done. Don, are there any specific people you can think of who do not follow your theory or

255
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,240
perhaps even go against it, whose you find relatively convincing or at least respect and

256
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,440
admire their work? For example, someone with a neuroscientific theory or philosophical differences.

257
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,240
Any people that stand out to you? Any theories? Oh, well, I mean, I know most of all, all the

258
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,760
big players and their friends, and I think they're brilliant. And I think that the theories are,

259
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,160
are, are brilliant. It's just that I think they're brilliantly wrong. I think that,

260
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,560
but the thing is that they have insights and some of those insights might be

261
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
salvageable and reused in a completely different framework. In other words,

262
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,920
maybe there is something about integrated information theory that will turn out to be

263
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,520
very interesting. But it won't be that it's how

264
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,800
unintelligent and unconscious systems with the right kinds of information,

265
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,800
theoretic properties either give rise to consciousness or, or just are conscious

266
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,920
is going to be different. If we think of space time, not as the fundamental reality,

267
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,880
but just as a user interface, maybe integrated information theory might be telling us something

268
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,480
about what patterns in our user interface are giving us better pointers to the consciousness

269
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
behind the interface. So they're not, they're not telling us how consciousness is created.

270
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,560
They're telling us how our, how our interface sometimes, sometimes the interface will give

271
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,040
us better insights into consciousness and sometimes less. So maybe it will, you know,

272
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,120
there will be a complete rethinking of, of what they've done. So it's not that their work will be

273
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,240
lost, but it will be just reinterpreted just like a lot of Newtonian stuff gets reinterpreted,

274
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,760
you know, in Einstein and Primark and so forth. So, so, you know, I, you know,

275
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,680
Stuart Hemeroff, I love to hang out with him and, you know, these were all good people

276
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,160
and friends. What about Bernardo Castro? I mean, your thoughts on his work and what he,

277
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,560
and everything he talks about regarding idealism? Well, Bernardo and our good friends and I've,

278
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,840
I've begged him to come work with us. He's got, he's a philosopher, but he also has another PhD

279
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,200
with a lot of mathematical chops. So I would love to, and anytime Bernardo wants to come work with

280
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,160
us because, you know, philosophically, we're on the same page, right? Our theory is an idealist

281
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:30,720
theory. And, and I respect Bernardo's decision to, to spend his valuable time taking up the

282
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,680
philosophical aspects of this. And we've decided to, there is a little philosophy in what we do,

283
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,560
and we have a collaborator, Robert Printner, who was a professor, I mean, not a professor,

284
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,040
but, you know, his PhDs and one of his PhDs is in philosophy. And so he brings a lot of philosophical

285
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:57,280
sophistication that I don't have to, to our work in idealism. But, you know, my, my background,

286
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,920
I have a little bit of background in philosophy enough to talk and get myself in trouble, but not

287
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,080
enough to be a professional. And, and I don't know enough math to be a mathematician, but,

288
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,120
but I know in how to collaborate with the, the appropriate people who can listen to me and say,

289
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,680
well, Dan, it's not quite right. But here, this, this will, this will fix it.

290
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,800
What are you, some of your favorite aspects of Bernardo's work? What, what, what intrigues you

291
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:32,640
most about it? Well, I think that Bernardo is giving good philosophical arguments for why physicalism

292
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,280
is, in some sense, almost self-contradictory and, and, but couldn't possibly be

293
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,120
the way forward and why idealism shouldn't be dismissed. I mean, I think a lot of, for most

294
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,440
philosophers, well, most people just in general, the, the a priori assumption is that, of course,

295
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,920
space-time is fundamental. And the burden of proof was in whoever wants to say that, you know,

296
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,920
this consciousness stuff is, is, I mean, surely you, you have the burden of proof if you talk about

297
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,720
consciousness being fundamental, because we all can see that space-time and particles and

298
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,880
physical stuff is fundamental. Of course, brains are there and created consciousness.

299
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,760
You have to be a fool, I mean, you know, to not, to not think that. So, so Bernardo does a good

300
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,320
job of turning the tables and saying, no, really, the burden of proof is on the physicalist.

301
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,000
And science itself is already saying that we need to move into a post-space-time

302
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,520
framework for, for, for science. So, so I like Bernardo's work. And he's, he's very forceful.

303
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
We have different personalities in terms of how we present our ideas, very, very different

304
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,960
personalities. But, but he and I, when we get together, we get along quite well.

305
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,560
Yeah. No, Bernardo, when I spoke, when I had, when I interviewed him, he actually asked me

306
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,680
during our round two, he wants me to interrogate him a lot more intensely, apparently. So he likes

307
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,280
to be challenged. He loves that active interrogation. He said, don't be like, I was like, I can't help

308
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,840
it, but he wants that. Anyway, let's go back to the paper, right? So we think of conscious agents,

309
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,360
trace change, decorated permutations, and then you go to the amplitude hindering and then

310
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,600
particles and space-time. Let's run through that process. How do we get from conscious agents to

311
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,960
particles in space-time? Right. So, I mean, that's a very, it's a layered question because there's

312
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,160
so much to actually go into that. There's so much. I know. Maybe we'll go into it a bit more in detail

313
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,680
afterwards. Oh, just a summary. Okay. So just top-level summary. Okay. Yeah. So the top level,

314
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,080
the idea is that there are, there is a Markovian dynamics, which basically a Markovian dynamics is

315
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,600
the simplest probabilistic dynamics you could imagine. Which doesn't mean to say that it's

316
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,920
simple, but it's just the simplest that you could write down. And

317
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,840
within that dynamics of these, what we call conscious agents, but these entities beyond

318
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,280
space-time, there are certain patterns of the dynamics where you get coherence, where a group

319
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:28,640
of them have a stable dynamical system. We call these recurrent communicating classes or ergodic.

320
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,760
So you have a big dynamical system, but subsets of states are ergodic, and they give you a little

321
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,720
ergodic Markov chains, where they have long-term behavior that can be described by a probability

322
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,240
measure, an invariant probability measure. And it's these different ergodic subsets,

323
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,840
essentially, of the dynamics that we've discovered map on to the decorator permutations. So the

324
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,840
decorator permutations are basically telling you which states go together. This group are together

325
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,680
forming ergodic set, this group forming ergodic set. So that's what the decorator permutations

326
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,120
are doing. So that's the new interpretation that we're proposing. So that's actually a new,

327
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:23,360
as far as we can tell, a new contribution to mathematics. And then from that, the physicist then

328
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,600
can take the decorator permutations and show how they're related to something called an amplitude

329
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,760
hydrant. And now this is not for all particles, the amplitude hydrant is only for massless

330
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,680
particles. And it's also that it's a special case where it's a supersymmetry, n equals 4

331
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,680
supersymmetric kind of thing. So it's in some sense a toy model, but it's close enough to

332
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,360
reality that physicists take it quite seriously. And more recent work, they've been able to let go

333
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,240
of the toy and do it for all masses and spins. But for now, we're trying to understand that new

334
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,960
work and connect with that as well. But for now, we can say this map gives us, for the massless

335
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:19,040
particles, and we think also the massive, a map through decorator permutations, through the

336
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,840
amplitude hydrant for the massless particles, and they're into scattering in spacetime. And by

337
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,240
scattering, I mean, you know, you have like the Large Hadron Collider and other Fermilab colliders

338
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,040
and so forth, where you take particles at high velocities, like two protons or electron

339
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,960
smashing into a proton. And you see it's, you see the particles smash into each other and then

340
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,040
the stuff going out. And you try to figure out what's going on, just like trying to figure out

341
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,720
how cars are made by smashing them into each other and seeing all the wheel flies off and hubcap

342
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,960
and the engine. It's hard work, you can imagine. So how do you figure out, you know, it's not easy,

343
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,240
but it takes a lot of, but that's what they're doing. There's, there's smashing

344
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,600
particles together and seeing what flies out. And that's called particle scattering.

345
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,960
And that's what you can predict using these decorator permutations

346
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
and the amplitude hydrant. You can actually predict the probabilities, what they call the

347
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,840
amplitudes for these. And so what we're doing now is, is saying, what properties of the

348
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,400
conscious agent dynamics, these recurrent classes correspond to mass, momentum, spin,

349
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:31,440
energy. And how do the evolving Markovian dynamics project to what we look and see as

350
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
scattering of particles in space time? That's sort of the top level picture.

351
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,080
Okay. So look, it's interesting when you think, okay, so when you think of a collection of agents,

352
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,320
I know at some point you mentioned in your paper, I think it was Erwin Schrodinger's essay,

353
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,880
Mind and Matter. You mentioned how it links to this concept. How are these two links,

354
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,000
that concept of, or his book on Mind and Matter?

355
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:05,920
Well, Schrodinger and a number of, of the early quantum theorists. We're thinking about

356
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,240
like the collapse of the wave function. You have, in quantum theory, you have

357
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,880
Schrodinger's equation for non-relativistic quantum systems. And you have this differential

358
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,040
equation, which shows how the state evolves as a function of time. And it's deterministic

359
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,760
and unitary. But when you make a measurement, that equation no longer holds.

360
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:49,280
If you, if you want to actually say what value of the spin you got, or what value of the position

361
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:58,400
you got or momentum, you have a different, it's the collapse operator. And, and that's non-linear.

362
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,440
The Schrodinger equation is linear. So, so you have this weird situation in quantum theory where

363
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,760
when essentially you're not looking, there's one evolution. And when you look, when you measure,

364
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,760
it's a different dynamics. Well, that's not a very happy situation for most scientists. I mean,

365
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,880
that's not happy at all. And the, you know, of course, that's led to all sorts of, you know,

366
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,760
multiverse kinds of explanations and many worlds interpretations and so forth.

367
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Basically, it's more than many worlds, not the multiverse, many worlds that came out of that.

368
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,640
So, I think at some point you spoke about any collection of agents is itself an agent.

369
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,800
And then you said there is ultimately one agent. That sort of links to this.

370
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,880
Right. That's right. So, yeah, that gets to what Schrodinger was after was there is some kind of

371
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,520
unity behind all this diversity. And Schrodinger was looking at that. He, I think, was interested

372
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,520
in some of the Eastern mystical ideas and, and, and, and cites them. And so there is this notion of,

373
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,640
some whole wholeness, some unity beyond space time. And, and maybe we're gonna have to go there.

374
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,440
David Bohm also in his book Wholeness and the Implicant Order has the same, same idea. This

375
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,760
is different than his pilot wave work, you know, but, but his book Wholeness and the Implicant

376
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,040
Order is going after the same kind of thing. I think that Schrodinger was talking about that.

377
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,000
Maybe we have to go to a deeper point of view in which there is a reality beyond space time

378
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,840
that is somehow unified. And we go, we do go there. So, yeah, thanks for, you know,

379
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,480
sort of putting me on track here. We do go there with our work because we,

380
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,560
it turns out to be the case that we can think about ever larger conscious agents.

381
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,680
And then any huge conscious agent can be articulated into a bunch of interacting

382
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,560
smaller conscious agents, which, which constitute it. And so we're sort of led to,

383
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,120
you know, we can have accountable infinity of agents, which are all part of one agent,

384
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:24,240
then an ALIF one, ALIF two, there's the whole canterarchy and cantors hierarchy of,

385
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:32,400
of infinities, we could imagine agents with, you know, ALIF two trillion states

386
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,680
in it and having a dynamics and then all the sub agents that could come out of it.

387
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,320
And ultimately, this, this line of thought leads you to say there's, well,

388
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,520
there's ultimately just one agent, but we could never actually write down the mathematics for it.

389
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,600
We can only write down, you know, projections of it, you know, the, the, the part, the partial

390
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,600
agents that, that cut that are part of it. But even there, we might be able to make

391
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
some progress, but it is interesting that the mathematics is, you know, if consciousness

392
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,640
is fundamental and we're using this mathematics, there is one agent and you can do a lot of mathematics,

393
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,920
but you'll never get to that one agent. Your mathematics will never be able to,

394
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,880
you can address projections of that one agent, you can do that, but you'll never be able to give

395
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,360
the mathematical theory of the dynamics of the one agent.

396
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,720
Yeah. What are your thoughts on mathematical realism in general,

397
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,520
your views on that concept?

398
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,160
I think that's a deep, deep question. And I, I go back and forth on it. My,

399
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,640
you know, I, the way it's typically put, our mathematical theorems invented or discovered,

400
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
right? That's, that's the big, the big divide. And

401
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,400
my,

402
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,920
I go, I go back and forth on that myself. I really go, go back and forth. Somehow my,

403
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
my feeling is that perhaps the equation, the question itself

404
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,320
is making a false division and it's both. I mean, that, that in some sense, if we really

405
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,640
understood this, if I even understood my own ideas about consciousness being fundamental

406
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,520
deeply enough, I would realize that the difference between invention and discovery here was, was

407
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,000
artificial on my part, that, that, that I wasn't thinking deeply enough. But again,

408
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
I, I'm not able to think deeply enough to, to actually

409
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,200
say anything deeper about that. So if I had to bet on one, I would say discovered.

410
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,720
Not invented. But, but my, our own work on consciousness makes me head myself and say,

411
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,680
ultimately, we may find that invention is discovery. Yeah. So,

412
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,560
so that's, that's very, very deep. Yeah, no, it is kind of both. Back to the paper. So at some

413
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,280
point you said, a physicist discovered the surprise to their surprise, sorry, that decorated

414
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,320
permutations invariantly categorize the physical content of scattering amplitudes for particles

415
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,760
in space time. And then there you go on to say that you guys prove that Markov chains project

416
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,360
kind of kind of, sorry, where am I reading? Sorry, project to decorated permutations and

417
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,920
thus onto particle scattering. How do you guys prove that?

418
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:37,520
Well, so we, what we show is that we prove it by actually writing down the projection.

419
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,960
So, so, so what we do in the paper is we say here for any Markov chain, here is the algorithm

420
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,640
by which you get a decorated permutation. And then when you, when you look at it, the algorithm

421
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,120
is basically telling you how to divide the entire state space of the Markov chain into this

422
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,240
collections of states that have their own recurrent communicating class. So, so the way we prove it

423
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,880
is to actually do it. We give you the prescription for the algorithm for doing it.

424
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,000
I think on page 11 of your paper, you discuss the precise hypotheses and you label them one to six.

425
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
I don't know if you want to go through that because that's actually quite a very fascinating

426
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,840
component of this paper together. Right. And obviously at some point when the paper is out,

427
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,720
I will put a link for everyone listening or watching just to follow through.

428
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,960
It should be, a link should be put up any day now by the Institute of Neolithic Sciences,

429
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,920
certainly by the 24th of June, which is just a week from Saturday. It'll be up because that's

430
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,040
when we're going to be doing, I should probably pull up the paper, but or I could just talk at

431
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,720
top level about the paper and just so you can go through those points.

432
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,080
I think so. That'll be quite, I think good for the listeners and the viewers as well.

433
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,400
I mean, number one, you talk about each elementary particle of the standard model of physics.

434
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,200
Each boson, lepton and quark is a projection of a recurrent communicating class and it's

435
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,480
Markovian kernel that arise in samplings of trace chains of conscious agents. That's the first one.

436
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
And then you go on from very fascinating work.

437
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,480
Right. So I'll pull that page 11, page 11. Okay.

438
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,600
I mean, let's run through those hypotheses and discuss how you call, you act.

439
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,880
I think that's a really good idea. Okay. So there it is. Okay. Each elementary particle,

440
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,040
the standard model of physics, each boson, lepton and quark is a projection of recurrent

441
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,200
communicating class and it's Markovian kernel that arise in samplings of trace chains of

442
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,040
conscious agents. So it's one thing. So what we're doing there is

443
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:58,480
get back where I can see you. Okay. So the first thing we're doing is we're saying there's going

444
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,960
to be a mapping between the dynamics of conscious agents and elementary particles in the standard

445
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:12,000
model of physics. So the bosons, leptons and quarks, the bosons are the mass, well the force

446
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,720
carriers. Some of them are massless photons and gluons are massless. The others, the Higgs and the

447
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:26,240
Z and W plus and minus are massive. And then there's leptons, which are like electrons,

448
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,080
muons and Tau's and electron neutrinos, tau neutrinos and muon neutrinos. And then there are

449
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:40,800
the quarks. There are up and down, charm and strange and top and bottom quarks. So then and

450
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,800
that's the whole basic particle suit. Then you combine those to get other things like pions

451
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,440
and mesons and other other things that you that you protons and neutrons. And so

452
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,800
our first thing that we're proposing is that there is a mapping between the

453
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,040
conscious agent dynamics and these elementary particles. And that is the recurrent communicating

454
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,160
classes of the Markovian dynamics of conscious agents that will correspond to these elementary

455
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:20,160
particles. Now, I should say not every recurrent communicating class of the conscious agent dynamics

456
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,320
will project to a particle. Yes. A probably a trivial subset. There's the Markovian dynamics

457
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,960
is going to have a lot of stuff going on there. What we're doing here is saying, okay, ultimately

458
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,800
we have to get a mapping from the conscious agent dynamics, not just the particles, but to

459
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:42,080
organisms, to brains, to neurons, to neural networks. And so there's going to be a mapping.

460
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,880
So what we're doing in this paper is saying the first connection we're going to try to make

461
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,120
is to elementary particles. And so the obvious question is why? I mean, clearly everybody

462
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:01,680
thinks that brain activity is related to and you know, it's it's so why go after, you know,

463
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,360
bosons, leptons and quarks when surely the the low hanging fruit is the brain. And that's that's

464
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,960
where we have the neural correlates of consciousness and so forth. So you guys already,

465
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,640
you know, shooting at the wrong target. And the reason we're going after the elementary particles

466
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:26,160
is because we figure that those are the most simple connections that we can make.

467
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,080
And I said that even though I'm not a particle physicist, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist. For me,

468
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,480
talking about the brain is much, much easier than talking about elementary particles. I'm

469
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:46,000
having to do lots and lots of remedial reading and homework to even talk the lingo. But I realized

470
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,920
it's hopeless to go after the brain is too complicated. The simplest thing inside space

471
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,600
time are these elementary particles. So if we're going to do this,

472
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,400
the best shot we have is to connect to the elementary particles and then gradually work our

473
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,360
way up. Okay, elementary particles. Now can we get to protons and neutrons? Oh, we okay. And

474
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,440
then can we get to atoms? Now can we get to molecules? Now can we get to larger molecules?

475
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,880
No. Okay, now we can try to maybe climb our way up to the brain, but that's not going to happen

476
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,840
in my lifetime. I mean, if we can get the particles in my lifetime, I'll be delighted.

477
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,000
So that's our strategy. We're not going after particles because they're the most important

478
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,960
thing or the most interesting thing. They're the simplest possible thing, which is not to say simple,

479
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,680
but they're the simplest possible connection that we could make. So that's,

480
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,720
that's why we're going after them. And most recurrent classes of the conscious

481
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,320
age dynamics will have nothing to do directly with particles, most of it. But we're going to

482
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,320
try to find the, you know, mappings that do relate to particles so we can build our way up.

483
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,360
So that's sort of the meaning of that first one. And the second one. So then number two,

484
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:09,200
huh? Properties of a free particle, the spin, the mass, the energy momentum are projections

485
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,880
of the properties of the kernel of the recurrent communicating class. For example, the periodicity,

486
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,560
the entropy rates, heating times and stationary distributions of that communicating class.

487
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,400
So the idea here is, there's one thing to say, recurrent communicating classes correspond to

488
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,720
at least some of the corresponded particles, but you need to do more. You need to say which

489
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,880
particles as it goes on the left on a quirk. And you all need to say, okay, what property

490
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,320
of the recurrent communicating class of Mark Markov dynamics corresponds to the energy?

491
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:51,760
What corresponds to the mass, the momentum and the spin, right? No hand wave now, right? You said

492
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,200
a recurrent communicating class projects to a particle. Well, particles have energy, momentum,

493
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:08,080
spin, mass, so where's the beef? What's, but in other words, you know, the very same thing I was

494
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,800
pointing at my good friends and colleagues or said, where's the beef? What's, you know, what

495
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,800
specific conscious experience can you get out of your theory? The same finger points back at me.

496
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,960
You're saying recurrent communicating classes give us position, momentum, spin. Well, give me

497
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,160
on exactly what property of the recurrent communicating class is the mass, for example.

498
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:37,520
So we have a proposal for each one of those in this document. For mass, it's, we propose,

499
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,360
it's what's called the entropy rate of the dynamical system of the recurrent communicating

500
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,440
class. And entropy is, you know, a measure, everybody knows entropy is a measure of disorder.

501
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,120
An entropy rate basically takes a Markovian kernel that has a bunch of rows and columns,

502
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:04,080
right? It's, it's, you think of it as a square matrix. And if each row, each row is a probability

503
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,280
measure, essentially, each row of a Markovian kernel is a probability measure. So if it's an

504
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,880
n by n matrix, you have each row is, has n entries in it, and in all the entries sum to one.

505
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,640
They're all, they're all non-negative. They're greater than zero. They're all between zero and one,

506
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,080
and they all sum to one. That's effectively what a Markovian kernel is. If you write down

507
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,320
an n by n matrix, each row has numbers between, only between zero and one, and each row sums to

508
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:39,760
one, you've got a Markovian kernel. That's what it is. And if the, if that Markovian kernel is,

509
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:52,480
is recurrent, that is that any state within, you have n states, if you can get from any state to

510
00:51:52,480 --> 00:52:00,400
any other state, you can find that amount of time and back again, basically, then it's recurrent.

511
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,200
And if it's, if the entropies in the rows are not all zero,

512
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,840
in other words, if you have some, if, if a row has just zeros, and then there's a single one in that

513
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:23,040
row, that, that's a legitimate row in general, but, but a recurrent class in which every row is

514
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,120
like that is a periodic Markov chain. You, and you're, and you're going basically from step,

515
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,040
you know, state one to state three with probability one, and then to state four with, you know, and

516
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,200
then back to state two, whatever it might be, you're going from each one with probability one. So

517
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:48,480
that's a periodic chain. Those, each row has zero entropy in that case. But what we, well,

518
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,920
it's a little complicated, but I'll just say this, the entropy rate basically says this,

519
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,600
saying that that's the mass means if the Markovian kernel is periodic.

520
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,040
So if you're in this state, then you will necessarily with probability one go to that

521
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,760
state. And, and there's, so there's a, it's almost like a deterministic set of states that you go

522
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,040
through and cycle. So you're cycling through states in a specific order, that will have zero mass.

523
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:26,400
So we propose that periodic kernels map to massless particles,

524
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,720
massless bosons. Makes a lot more sense when you say it. I mean, from reading the paper, it's a

525
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,200
lot, it's a lot better to hear you say it. Yeah, it is more, there's more intuition that this was

526
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,920
the intuition that that sort of guided it. Well, no, I'll tell you what the intuition was that

527
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,720
guided it with, but, but in the case of, I'll just say a little bit more of what it means

528
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,160
than I'll give you the intuition that that does as much detail as you want on go go ahead. Yeah.

529
00:53:52,160 --> 00:54:01,360
Okay. So if, if there are entries other than zeros and ones in your recurrent communicating

530
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,400
class, then it's going to have mass, according to this entry rate, it'll be massive. And the reason

531
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,720
why we were thinking about it this way was the following intuition. What does, what does mass

532
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,480
mean intuitively, right? This is what the kind of thinking you have to do when you can try to make

533
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,640
these connections. You have to say, okay, we're trying to say what aspect of conscious agent

534
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,160
dynamics corresponds to physical mass. We're going to have to think abstractly, what do we really,

535
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:35,120
what is mass in the physical, and at least inertial mass in some sense. Well, I'll just say mass in

536
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,840
general has something to do with how much you can be influenced and how much you influence,

537
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,200
right? If you, if, if you're massless, you have less influence than if you're massive.

538
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:55,120
And so what would correspond to influence in a social network? Who are the influencers in a

539
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,200
social network? So this is the way you have to think to, because these, these conscious agent

540
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,720
networks are social networks. So think, you know, the internet, Twitterverse and so forth.

541
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,920
Well, the influencers are those who have the most followers. And, and so if,

542
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,560
in other words, they have the most connections, the more, so Hoffman has a lot fewer connections

543
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,760
on his website than Google, Google has, you know, a few, a couple dozen more connections than Hoffman

544
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,000
has a lot more power, and they're a lot richer. So, so that, that's the notion of influence.

545
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,240
How connected are you? Well, now, if we look at this Markov chain, if this state has,

546
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,280
in this role of the Markovian kernel has all zeros and only a single one, that means

547
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,400
it's not talking to anybody except one guy. Yeah, he's only talking to one guy. Well,

548
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,000
that's as little influence as you can have. And if you're talking only to yourself,

549
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,240
then you're, then, then you're, you're, you're out, you, so, so that was, you can see the

550
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,120
intuition that went into this. And so, but if you're, if you're connected to everybody,

551
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,080
you're going to be more influential. Well, if you look at how you're going to be connected

552
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,560
to everybody, that means that the entropy in your row is going to increase. The more connections

553
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,440
you have in general, you're going to be having more nonzero entries in your row. And if every

554
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:24,560
entry is nonzero, that's going to, in general, you know, it's a bit of a handway, but, but

555
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,040
it's going to, in general, mean that you're going to have greater and greater entry. So we just said,

556
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:37,280
okay, let's make it, in some sense, the, the influence of a state is the entropy of its row,

557
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,720
right? But now we're talking, we have to give a, an influence for the, in some sense,

558
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,640
a mass to the whole recurrent class. So we need to weight all the, all the influences of those

559
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,560
other guys. We have to weight them. What's the right weighting that we have to give to them? Well,

560
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:58,960
the old, there's only one canonical measure for the weighting is so-called invariant measure.

561
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,920
It's the, there is a probability measure that the, when you multiply, so if we have a kernel P,

562
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:14,320
we'll call this matrix P, and we have a measure M. So M is the measure. If M times P equals M,

563
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:22,080
that's called an invariant measure. So M P equals M. There's, for recurrent communicating

564
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,880
class, there's a unique measure that has that property. And so that's the invariant measure,

565
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,400
is the measure that's left alone by the whole kernel. And so we use that to weight

566
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,160
the entropies of the rows. And that, and, and Claude Shannon, you know, the inventor of information

567
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,320
theory, he was the one who first defined entropy rate. I mean, I'm sort of giving sort of the

568
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:48,000
kinds of ideas that might go into that. But Claude Shannon is the genius who invented information

569
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,280
theory. And he came up with the definition of entropy rate. So we just borrowed Claude Shannon's

570
00:57:53,280 --> 00:58:01,120
definition of entropy rate and said, that is, for the intuitions I just gave, give some notion of the

571
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:12,480
influence or inertia of this group of interacting conscious agents. Each row corresponds to an

572
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:20,720
agent and its interactions. And that then leads to, as soon as you make that move,

573
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,760
that means that periodic Markov change, we go from one state to the next state, you know,

574
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,360
one agent talks only to this agent, he only talks to the next agent and so forth.

575
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:39,200
They're massless. So somehow now, see, this is now that one definition gives us a real

576
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,760
rip on things, because we know that the massless particles always move at the speed of light.

577
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,960
Right. So now we all we get a handle. Okay, so, and the massive ones are always moving less than

578
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:59,920
the speed of light in their projection in the space time. Now, now, so that so that gives us

579
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,960
another thing, then we can say, okay, well, we have the mass, we made one other postulate, and that is

580
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,520
that the we go to the paper.

581
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:20,320
So by periodicity, it entropy rates hitting times and stationary distributions.

582
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,600
That's right. So let me let me just go down to

583
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,600
make sure I say what we did correctly, even though it's my own work.

584
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,880
I mean, okay, we all often do we write papers and then we do forget certain details.

585
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,480
It's normal. Yeah, here, here saying the wrong, it has to be said exactly right or you're wrong.

586
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,120
Yeah. So,

587
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,240
so the one one thing we're saying is that a communicating class, so this recurrent communicating

588
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,000
class, if it has n states, it has momentum and

589
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,280
is

590
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,880
and it has a mass equal to its entry rate, we just talked about. Okay, so that's so that's

591
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:17,280
so I bring that up because that's another postulate. The momentum is the number

592
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,960
of states, the number of agents in the class. That's the momentum. And once you have those two

593
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,120
things, then the energy falls out. Right. So so once once you have those, then you then we used.

594
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:31,920
Well,

595
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,800
there, one could say we're cheating a little bit and Schwapp-Hohn has suggested to me that we'll

596
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:46,960
need to think more about this. We're using the physics equation now that relates energy, momentum,

597
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:56,080
and mass, mass squared. But so we we we do that for now and we may need to give deeper

598
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,680
motivation for it later. But but right now, I'll just say with that proviso, once we have the

599
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,920
momentum being the number of states and we have the mass being the entry rate, then the energy

600
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,640
falls out as as from from Einstein, from Einstein's special theory of relativity.

601
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:31,120
And so so now we've got energy mass in momentum. The spin is now spin is an interesting tricky

602
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:42,480
thing. Spin of a particle is is something that's, I think, counterintuitive to a lot of people. It's

603
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,600
if you if you're spinning, you have a basketball player that's spinning a basketball on the fingertip,

604
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,400
you can go at any speed that you want, you know, they can go fast, slow, but spin for

605
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:02,240
per particles, you can only go spin at certain speeds. And there's no speed in between that you

606
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:10,720
jump at your spin values, which so the spin is is is counterintuitive. What we what we do is we use

607
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,520
a branch of mathematics called geometric algebra, sort of a generalization of something called

608
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:28,960
Clifford algebra. And we this this this gets a little bit technical, but what we what we do is we use

609
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:41,280
trying to see if there's a way to say this. Here's an intuition when a Markovian kernel

610
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:50,160
right, it's a it's an n by n matrix. If you can ask yourself, what does it do if I have

611
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:58,720
an n dimensional space, and I have unit vectors, a unit vector pointing on each of the n dimensions.

612
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,320
Let's just think about three dimensions that let them keep it real easy. So I have a three by three

613
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,920
Markovian kernels got three rows and three columns. And it's and I have I'm looking at three vectors,

614
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,920
my finger, my thumb, that are orthogonal and that are each is length one. And I ask, okay, when

615
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:23,920
when this Markovian kernel acts, it's going to move these vectors around. That's what it does. It

616
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,880
moves. It moves them around, it may shrink them, it might expand them. So so suppose I start off

617
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:39,520
with a unit volume. So this is I have three vectors, and each is like one inch long. And so I've got a

618
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:47,440
one inch cube is a cube of one inch, one inch cubed. When I act on it with the Markovian kernel,

619
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,760
those vectors are going to move, they're going to like scrunch in or spread apart somehow.

620
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,160
And some of them are going to get longer. I can't do that with my fingers. Some are going to get

621
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,800
shorter. That would be too painful. But but but what's going to happen is, and they may switch,

622
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,600
maybe maybe this one, it was this order, but maybe this one switches over and they they

623
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:16,640
can cross in certain ways. So the volume of that they define, right, they're going to follow here,

624
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,280
they're a cube, but they're going to in general, have a parallelogram of some kind, or a parallel

625
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,320
pipette parallel pipette that they're going to define. And the volume is going to be somewhere

626
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:32,480
between zero and one, it won't increase the volume, but it can decrease the volume. And it can change

627
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,240
the sign. If I think of this as a, you know, using the right hand rule that this is a positive

628
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:44,240
sign volume, then maybe that is a negative sign volume. Okay, so it can go be so it can change

629
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:53,200
the volume, which was one to any volume between minus one and plus one. So that's what the kernel

630
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,800
is doing. And that operation on these basis vectors is what we call the spin. What it does to

631
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,600
the volume is the spin. So that so there is a way to do it intuitively. Oh, that's that's okay,

632
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,960
there is a way to do it into it. If you if you want to go into the final detail, you more than

633
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,600
welcome that done. Okay, yeah, well, that was a good one, because that is actually an accurate

634
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,600
an accurate description of what we're what we're saying is happening, what what the spin is.

635
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:33,200
And by the way, one thing that this then tells us is if only periodic

636
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:49,680
chains are massless, then you can from what I just said, one can show that if

637
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,040
if the

638
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,800
number of states is even

639
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:12,400
you have to again, now you look at our paper, you have to say it exactly right. You rather make sure.

640
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:20,720
Yeah, this is tricky enough. It's very complicated. So I'm glad you actually have the paper on hand.

641
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:29,200
Yeah, I just want to make make sure I say it exactly right. I don't want to say it wrong and

642
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:36,400
then have to. Yeah, then the comment section goes wild. That's right. Okay,

643
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:47,920
so if see if this class is massless and has n states, if n is even, then this matrix has to have

644
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:56,560
spin minus one. Well, it's spin one, but with minus sign. Okay, spin one, but minus sign.

645
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:05,680
And if it's if the number of states is odd, then it has spin one that's with positive sign.

646
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,720
And what that means is

647
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,040
you can't have

648
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,400
Which page are you on at the moment? This is page 27.

649
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:35,600
Yeah, what that means, it was stunning to me. What it means is

650
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,200
if you have a massless

651
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,160
particle, according to our theory,

652
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,480
and you change the sign of the spin, plus one to minus one,

653
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,760
it has to have a change in energy. Yes, change, change in, yeah, change in energy, it has to have.

654
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,880
So you cannot have

655
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,720
two massless particles

656
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:14,960
of the same energy and opposite spins. It's not possible. So when I, so when I ran,

657
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,800
when I realized that from our mathematics, and I thought, oh, well, that's, that's where that's,

658
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,760
that seems to be, that's a very, very strange prediction. Oh, well, maybe that's where we're

659
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:30,240
going to be shown to be wrong. I mean, that's, that's, that's really wild. Or, or if it's true,

660
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:36,000
maybe, you know, it's, it's, you can have n and n plus one. So maybe, you know, the, the, the, there

661
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,320
could be an energy of, you know, one million, and then it has to be one million plus one. So maybe

662
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:49,920
it'd be too small to see the, the difference that I was thinking. So that's true. What I don't

663
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:57,200
know about physics. It was, it was a couple of weeks later that I realized, no, this is what,

664
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:02,960
what they found is, is that there's this fine structure to, like the orbital, the electron

665
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:12,080
orbitals. Now, now, what, what's going on there is you, in the Bohr model of the atom, you have

666
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,880
these different orbitals. But when you look at them very, really fine, you find that there are,

667
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,200
there's actually two, two little bands there. And so the, the photons that you're going to get

668
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:28,000
aren't the same energy photons. They're actually, there's this fine. So, so always, and so there's

669
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,080
a lot of fine structure there. And so, so that doesn't mean that we're right, but it means that

670
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,160
one thing that I thought, well, that's to blow us out of the water. I mean, this is a pretty strong

671
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,920
prediction that there's going to be this fine structure. Well, yeah, there is a, they call,

672
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,040
there is this hyperfine structure. And, and there's the fine structure constant. So now

673
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,920
I'm very interested in looking at the, the fine structure constant and seeing how that plays a

674
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:59,280
role in our COVID dynamics. So, so, so you, but that by itself made me think, well, you know,

675
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,920
of course, we're probably wrong, but this is pretty, this is a pretty interesting game now.

676
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,120
You know, the math came and hit me in the face and said, you're predicting that you can't have

677
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:16,080
two massless particles of opposite spin and have the same energy. That is a strong, strong

678
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,560
prediction. I mean, there you, there you can be, I mean, surely you can be falsified right on the

679
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,480
get go from with that one. And it doesn't look like we're falsified right out of the get go on

680
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,480
that one. So, so that gives me hope not that we're ultimately right, but that this horse may have

681
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,680
a lot of writing to do before we find out its limitations. I see. What's up on the, what's

682
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,400
am I pronouncing it correctly? Shwapong? Was he part of? Shwapong, yeah.

683
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,000
Is he the one who figured this out or was it, was it you, you got, you and Prakash?

684
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:54,640
What did you guys come to? I did. Or you did? Yeah, I was the one who, but then as soon as I

685
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,240
said it, Shwapong of course knew about the, I mean, of course, fine structure. So it was,

686
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,600
it was me, you know, because of my ignorance, not knowing about it and going through a couple

687
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,600
weeks of sweating and thinking about it. I was the one who had first noticed that, oh, wow,

688
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,120
we make this weird prediction. And I worried about it for a couple of weeks until I happened

689
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,240
to run across a video. I was doing some remedial physics training on myself. And I

690
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,880
happened to run across this video on the hyperfine strat. I said, you've got to be

691
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,080
kidding me. I couldn't have asked for something better than that. So it was, it was my ignorance.

692
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,760
First, Shwapong, it was just falling off a log. He understood this and Chaiton.

693
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,600
Yeah. Okay, let's move on to number three then of the, of the hypothesis. Each projection is

694
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,680
perceivable by some CA via a window of some finite number of steps in which the agent observes

695
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,680
the corresponding trace chain. And yeah, I think at this point we can discuss trace chains and

696
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:57,680
everything around that. Yes, let me pull up page 11.

697
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,440
All right, right, right. Page 11. Okay. Yeah, I find this page actually, I love the way you set

698
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:14,160
this up. Oh, good. Good. Makes it a lot easier for me, particularly for this interview and this

699
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:21,360
conversation. Right. Yeah. And that was partly because the Institute of Theetic Sciences asked

700
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,160
for a certain format in the, in, in these proposals. So it was very helpful to, to make it,

701
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:30,000
and their goal was to try to make it accessible. So they did a good job of that.

702
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,760
That's correct. So, so you're doing number three. Okay. Each projection is perceivable by some CA via

703
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,960
a window. Unless there was something about number two that you still want to touch on,

704
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,320
are you fine? Are we done with that one?

705
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:53,040
Yeah, I'll just say one, one other thing about two that might be of interest in that is we,

706
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,920
I haven't yet worked out the, like, the notion of the velocity of particles in space time.

707
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,040
But we know that that the massless particles go at the speed of light. So we know that answer.

708
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,000
So whatever our ultimate story is going to be about the massive particles and their speed.

709
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,920
And I can just say at top level, the kind of thing I'm thinking about right now

710
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,840
that our team is thinking about, but I won't, this is what I'm thinking about. I'm not going

711
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,560
to blame my team for any bad ideas. So if it's a bad idea, it's, it's, it's all Hoffman. If it's

712
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:36,320
a good idea, it's the team. And that is, we want some notion of the, of velocity within this Markov

713
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:43,600
kernel that will translate to what we call through projection to velocities in space time.

714
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,840
And the massless particles, which are the periodic ones, you, you, that means that, you know,

715
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,760
from this state, you always go with probably one to that state and then probably one to next.

716
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,840
There's no messing around. You go bang, bang, bang, bang. You, you, if there are end states,

717
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,680
you go through a cycle in n steps. No, it takes you only n steps to go through a complete cycle

718
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:07,040
and every cycle. But for the other, if it's massive, then it might take you if it, even if

719
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:13,440
there's n states, it might take you five n steps before you actually start with one particle and

720
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,880
visit all the other particles and get back to where you were. Right. So that's, there's a notion of,

721
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:24,000
of, you can see there's a notion of speed that, that's very natural there. And it's,

722
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:30,560
um, technical term is the commuting time. So you can talk about the commuting time

723
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:38,400
of an ergodic chain. And so what we're thinking about, what I'm thinking about again,

724
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:48,960
I won't blame them yet, is that the commuting times of within a communicating class

725
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:55,280
are going to somehow be related to the velocities that we say the particle has in spacetime.

726
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,360
But that hasn't, but that's not in our proposal. And, and we're still working on that. But, but

727
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:07,600
given that I've already, you know, given my provisos, they'll just put it out there. That's

728
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,000
part of the reason I'm doing that is, is people can see how fun this is, right? You're, you're,

729
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,840
you're playing where this is, you're exploring, you're playing and you go, what about this? What is,

730
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,160
what if this property of the dynamics of conscious agents correspond to what we call velocity in

731
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,960
spacetime? Of course, I'm probably wrong, but hey, it's a fun idea. And, you know, it's not

732
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,480
obviously stupid. Um, and, and we'll see. And I, it's the exploration that really matters. I mean,

733
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,200
it's such an enjoyable journey. And watching you talk about it as well, you can tell how much you

734
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,480
are having fun discussing it. I mean, it's, it's very apparent.

735
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,680
I'm like a kid in a candy store with this stuff. You know, you know, all along that, that of course

736
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,880
you're probably wrong, but you also have a feeling that there may be something of this that, that

737
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:59,760
actually sticks. It may, some of this may stick. We'll see. Um, and some will be corrected and,

738
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,080
and so forth. Sometimes you have to be brave and put the idea out there. That's just, that's what

739
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:12,560
science is. That's right. The nice thing about this is, um, I do get emails a lot from people who

740
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,880
have that are probably very, very brilliant and they have lots of ideas about how cockiness

741
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:24,560
related to spacetime. But, but out of a hundred emails, I won't get one where someone has said,

742
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,240
here's the mathematical connection that I'm proposing. And, and, and until you can do that,

743
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:38,000
there's nothing that scientists can look at. Yeah. It's, it's, it's when you say something,

744
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,520
here's the mathematical connection and this connection says you cannot have a massless boson

745
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:53,440
with one energy having the same, you know, a plus and minus spin one. It can't be,

746
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,760
when your mathematics gets that, that specific, then you've got something that scientists

747
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,080
will look at because in most times they'll say you're wrong and here, you know,

748
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,720
this prediction is wrong. But, but until you are mathematically precise, you're not even wrong.

749
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,400
And, and see, that's the point. You're not on the playing field until you can be wrong. Exactly.

750
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:18,160
There's no, scientists will pay attention to you. Yeah. At least I'm wrong, maybe. Yeah. Now, hopefully,

751
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,520
I mean, hopefully you're not wrong. Hopefully you're right. Hopefully I'm not wrong. Anyway,

752
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,400
let's go to number three. Yeah. Okay. So each projection is

753
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,560
perceivable, perceived by some conscious agent via a window of finite steps,

754
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,400
in which an agent observes the corresponding trace chain.

755
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:48,720
So, so the idea is how are we going to get from the conscious agents to the observations that we

756
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:55,840
make? You have mass and energy and so forth. Well, we're going to have to use other conscious

757
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,160
agents. We're going to have to use systems of conscious agents. So what we're going to have

758
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:07,280
are systems of conscious agents, basically, that do this mapping. What we're, what we're doing right

759
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:12,000
now in this proposal is we're not trying to go through and show how you construct a dynamic of

760
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,840
conscious agents to do this. We're going to, for now, we're just going to make the correspondence

761
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,880
between these recurrent communicating classes and their properties and, and spacetime will

762
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:31,680
ultimately, we want to actually build a, if spacetime is an interface, right?

763
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:39,840
And it's constructed by a network of conscious agents, like it's like a neural network, but it's

764
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,920
a network of conscious agents that's doing this construction. We need to write down what that

765
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,320
construction is and then show how it works to create that, that interface.

766
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:58,320
But we can do, and we do plan to do that, but that's, that's, you know, one step at a time. That's,

767
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,200
we have probably several years of work on this particle stuff before we actually start to do,

768
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:10,320
to do that. But one thing I will say on that is that my, my feeling is if we take, once we have

769
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:19,280
built that network of conscious agents that is taking the map from conscious agents into our

770
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:25,600
spacetime network, and we take that and we turn it on itself, we actually use the interface that

771
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,720
they construct to look at the set of conscious agents that are creating the interface. Okay.

772
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:35,600
That's a really self-referential kind of thing, but this is pretty cool. What are you going to see?

773
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,920
Well, I think in some cases you'll see it like in, for us, it'll look like neurons and brains.

774
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:48,160
Okay. Neurons and brains are what you see in your interface when you take the network of

775
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,480
conscious agents that they're constructing your interface and have it look at the construction

776
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:59,440
process itself. And that's why I think neuroscience is going to be, we need more funding for neuroscience,

777
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,880
not less. I think neurons don't exist when they're not perceived.

778
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:13,520
So neurons cause none of our behaviors, but neurons are the symbols that we see in our interface

779
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,840
that are the best, the symbols closest to the construction process of our interface.

780
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,520
And, and so neuroscience is going to be a lot more complicated than we thought. We thought,

781
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,040
I look into brains, I see neurons and synapses and, and, you know, calcium and sodium and potassium

782
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,680
and other ions. And that's because that's what's really there. That's what's, no, no, no. That's

783
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:45,440
your interface description. It is hiding an unbelievably complicated dynamics behind it.

784
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:52,240
You thought neural networks are complicated than they are, but each neuron is hiding behind it.

785
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,560
An incredible, so we need far more funding. This is job security for neuroscience for a long,

786
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,680
long time. To reverse engineer neurons into this network of conscious agents is going to be a lot

787
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:12,880
of work. So, and so, but we're not, we're going to try to work on that interface, but I suspect

788
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,400
I'm going to have to pass the torch to a younger generation. That's, that's a hard, hard problem.

789
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:24,560
It's a lot of work. What I will say on, on that, that point three is what we can do is, is say,

790
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:33,600
what that process is going to have to do. If I have some big master Markov chain,

791
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,640
well, typically when you're thinking about a Markov chain, it goes as an infinite number of

792
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:49,120
steps. The chain is an infinite number of steps. What happens when you, so suppose I have just a,

793
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:58,320
like a three by three matrix, right? And I'm not, or four by four, you know, small matrix.

794
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,440
Well, you and I haven't lived forever. We're not seeing an infinite chain of steps.

795
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,240
So we must be, we must be sampling. We must have this, this dynamics outside of space time

796
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,720
of conscious agents. And we have to make the sample, maybe have a window, maybe it's like,

797
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:23,600
I look at a trillion steps, which is a lot of steps, or a million steps or a thousand steps.

798
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:29,440
But it's not infinite. I mean, I'm not looking at an infinite number of steps. So we're sampling.

799
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,920
So now we get into the statistics of sampling. I've got this Markovian dynamics.

800
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,680
And if I, if I sample, and I then look at what, and estimate the kernel that I've sampled,

801
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,360
I'm not going to get exactly the right value. I'm going to get a kernel that's maybe close.

802
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:50,320
The more samples I have, my estimate of what the kernel is can be closer to the real thing,

803
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:56,720
but it's not going to be the real thing. So we're going to have sampling errors.

804
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,040
And then we're also going to have just due to temporal sampling, but you could also have space,

805
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,600
what we might call spatial sampling. Suppose I have, you know, a trillion states, and I have

806
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:13,040
this huge recurrent communicating classes got a trillion states. Well, you know, I don't think

807
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,960
there's any computer on earth right now that could actually simulate that Markov kernel,

808
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:27,600
because you, you, it has one trillion times one trillion entries. It's got, I don't know how many,

809
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,360
this is a lot of entries in it. And, and so to just do one step of that thing is going to be

810
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,960
tremendous amount of compute power, just to compute one step. If you want to compute a

811
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,560
million steps, I mean, I don't think, I think supercomputers are going to be, you know, grinding

812
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,680
to a halt. So, so simulating this thing is going to be, is going to be difficult, right? We're

813
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:56,800
going to have to, but, but what we can do is talk about, I talked about there was this one huge master

814
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,760
Markovian kernel that we can never look at. We're going to have to look at just some of its states.

815
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:08,560
We can't look at all of them. And so you can take a big Markovian kernel and look at, at only

816
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:14,560
what happens on a few of its states and get a new Markovian kernel. So the whole Markovian kernel

817
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,600
is influencing what you see on the smaller states, right? It's influencing them. But what you're

818
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,320
doing is you, you're getting a kernel just on the small side of it. And that's called a trace

819
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:30,960
process. So you, when you take a big kernel, and you say what, what kernel does it induce on a subset

820
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:36,960
of states? That's called a tracing process. And so, so that's going to be like spatial sampling.

821
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,720
So we'll have temporal windows and spatial windows. And what we're going to be doing,

822
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:48,160
what we're proposing in the, in this proposal is those windows are what we're going to use to try

823
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:56,640
to model the, the momentum distributions of quarks and gluons inside the proton. So particle

824
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:04,320
scattering of experiments have looked at quarks and gluons inside the proton. A proton at one scale

825
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:12,080
has like three valence quarks, two up and one down. But when you go at smaller spatial resolution

826
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:19,920
and smaller temporal resolution, that dissolves. You see at the very finest resolution that they've

827
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:28,480
gotten so far, you see what they call a gluon sea or an ocean of gluons. So it's all these

828
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,200
massless particles just in there. And they're just roiling all over the place. And then when you back

829
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,840
off a little bit, you reduce the spatial and temporal, what they call the Bjork and X and Q

830
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:43,120
squirt and this are the technical terms they use Bjork and X is like the temporal window and the

831
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,800
Q squirt is like the spatial window. When you back off, then you get to the point where the gluons,

832
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,480
they say are splitting into quark, anti quark pairs. And then, and so you get this,

833
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,880
what they call a quark sea. And you get, so all this energy and momentum in, in these quarks.

834
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,840
And then when you back off, you, you still have all the gluons messed around and all these little

835
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:11,920
sea quarks, but then you get these three big valence quarks. So the proton is really a complicated

836
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:20,320
mess. And what we're going to try to do is show that as we go from really, really small windows

837
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:32,880
of time and larger windows of trace, we're getting closer to that gluon sea. And as we back,

838
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:38,720
as we trace on fewer and fewer states, so we're making the trace smaller, but we're making the,

839
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,600
and we're making the temporal window bigger, then we're getting closer to the valence quarks.

840
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:51,920
So what we're hoping to do is show for a particular class of master kernels that we can do

841
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:58,080
various trace chains and sampling windows and model all of the,

842
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,400
what, what they call the momentum distributions, one dimensional and then ultimately three

843
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,680
dimensional momentum distributions at the various Bjork and X and Q squared.

844
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,440
I was just going to ask you about that. What are one dimensional momentum fractions or

845
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:21,840
longitudinal momentum fractions? Yeah, apparently the current techniques that particle physicists

846
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:29,120
have allowed them to assess the momentum only in one dimension, not all three, but apparently

847
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:36,080
there are some new techniques that are coming online that will allow them to estimate in three

848
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:42,160
dimensions. And so what we'd like to do is even before they get all the three dimensional data,

849
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:47,760
if we could match the one dimensional data and predict the three dimensional data before they

850
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:54,880
get it, that would be really cool. We'll see. For sure. Okay. Number four, done. Do you want to

851
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:00,880
check it up on your own or should I pull that one up again? All right. This is a very interesting

852
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,240
conversation. I'm so glad we're talking about it because the paper makes so much sense listening

853
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:10,560
to you express yourself. Oh, good. Probably easier than just reading the paper. Yeah. I mean, for

854
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,880
the listeners and the viewers, whoever are too lazy to read the paper, I recommend they do, but

855
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:20,880
it is a lot better to have you chat about it. Yeah, it gives the intuitions that we didn't have

856
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:27,600
the space. This proposal, we had a specific word limit for each section. So we had to get the ideas

857
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:32,000
and we couldn't really say, here's where our intuitions, this is what we were thinking. I'm

858
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,720
able to do that here, but I couldn't do that in the proposal. I think that's a big function of

859
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:39,760
this podcast is to allow you the opportunity to do this. Absolutely. I appreciate that. Yeah.

860
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,960
So four says the projection perceived by a conscious agent is the discrete sampling of the

861
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,560
trace chain of a trace chain of a larger dynamics onto the states of that country. So we've really

862
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:56,720
gone into that. So I just said that there's going to be a trace chain. So number five is

863
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,000
the particles perceived by a conscious agent depend on a subset of states and the number

864
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,840
of steps in the window is trace. And that's the interesting thing. So most of us think,

865
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:14,000
you know, an electron is an electron. That's because it really is an electron and a proton

866
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,760
is a proton because it really is a proton and so forth. A quark is a quark. And this,

867
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,520
our whole approach here forces us to say, no,

868
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,640
there are no, in ultimate reality, there are no particles. There are no quarks,

869
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:41,040
leptons and so forth. Those are entirely artifacts of our user interface.

870
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:48,560
They're not insights into the nature of objective reality. They're statistical artifacts.

871
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:56,480
They're sampling artifacts. So for example, if I have a small temporal window,

872
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:05,760
suppose I'm only looking at two states and I only look at, say, three steps.

873
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,280
And what I find in those three steps, particularly that I see only three steps

874
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,760
in my little two state subset, and I noticed that in one step, state one went to state two.

875
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:25,200
And then in the next step, state two went to state one. And that's all I've got.

876
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,240
Well, then I can put a, my matrix would be like this, be 0, 1, 1, 0. That would be my matrix.

877
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,280
Now that might have been a projection of a matrix that have numbers that were not

878
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,680
ones and zeros in it. It might have had all sorts of weird numbers in it, right? There could have been,

879
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:50,080
but because it's an artifact, I only looked at a small number of steps. The matrix that I see

880
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:58,320
is 0, 1, 1, 0. I see a periodic matrix. In other words, I see in our language a massless particle.

881
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,280
But the mass is not because there's a deep massless particle. It's because that's an

882
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:09,920
artifact of my small sampling size. And what we're, what the intuition here is, why are the

883
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:15,920
physicists seeing all these massless particles when they make their temporal window so small

884
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:24,400
for the reason I just gave? When you're looking at lots of states and small window,

885
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,360
you're only going to have zeros and ones everywhere in your matrix. That's all you're

886
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:35,040
going to have. Those are massless. So that's why you get this gluon C. And why is it when you

887
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,440
start to increase the temporal window and reduce the number of states that you start to see mass?

888
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,400
Well, yeah, now you're starting to get things besides zeros and ones in your matrix. You're

889
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:48,560
starting to get massive particles. And that's the big idea about how, like a top level, we think

890
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:55,440
we're going to be able to get the momentum distributions for the massless, then going

891
01:31:55,440 --> 01:32:03,200
to massive, and then finally the valence, the valence quarks. Now, an obvious for, you know,

892
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,000
the intelligent listener will go, I mean, it's one thing to say, what you just said is another

893
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,400
thing to get the exact momentum distributions. And I agree. To get the exact momentum distributions,

894
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,920
we're going to have to do more than just the hand wave that I just said. But the hand wave lets you

895
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,520
know that there is some reason to hope that we could get it. But to get it exactly, we're going

896
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:30,960
to have to have exactly the right class of master matrix. So what is the bigger Markovian matrix

897
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,000
that we're going to start with, that we're going to do all the sampling of traces and windows of

898
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:43,200
time. And so that's going to be for a computational experiment that we've proposed. And we're putting

899
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,960
together ideas about how to construct. It won't just be one master matrix, it'll be a whole

900
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:52,400
class of them that will have this property. But we have a lot of freedom, frankly, we'll be able

901
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:59,440
to play with this until we get a group of master matrices that do the job. So I don't see any

902
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:08,720
principal obstruction right now to us doing that. In fact, the argument might eventually go the other

903
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:16,560
way. Hoffman, you had so many ways to do it. What is this really telling us? And the answer, I think

904
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,400
will probably be, but we had so many ways that wouldn't do it as well. So this is very interesting

905
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:27,280
to ask. If there's this huge dynamics of conscious agents, what trivial aspect of it is being captured

906
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:32,640
by our space time? In other words, we think of space time as the be all and end all. And what we're

907
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:41,280
going to be saying is, no, no way. This is space time is one of an infinity of different user

908
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:48,400
interfaces, an infinity. And we have to let go of the constraint on our thinking and our creativity

909
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:55,920
and open up to the possibility that there's all these other interfaces. And so by showing that,

910
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,800
maybe we'll find that there's a whole class of matrices, an infinite class of matrices,

911
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,480
that will give us our space time. But we'll show that that infinite class of matrices has

912
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,520
measured zero in the set of bigger matrices. And that will sort of make the point that

913
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:16,240
space time is just a headset. And in my view, as I've said in a number of podcasts, I think

914
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:22,960
we got a cheap model. It's only three dimensions of space. I would like to be able to visualize

915
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:29,840
in 20 dimensions or 1000 dimensions. I can't. I feel really real stupid. I can imagine a

916
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,640
three dimensional geometric puzzle and I can see it. A four dimensional geometric puzzle

917
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:39,840
completely beyond me. 10 dimensional. Now it's like theorem and proof, theorem and proof to even

918
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,480
crawl your way up to figure out what's going on with the geometry of an object in 10 dimensions.

919
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:50,480
And we're doing that. I mean, Chaitan and I, our team, we're trying to study the space of all

920
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:58,240
possible Markov kernels, like the space of all 10 by 10 Markov kernels is a polytope. And it's the

921
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:07,360
Markov polytope of, you know, on 10 states. And it's, I've forgotten how many dimensions. I think

922
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:14,880
it, oh, it, yeah, well, it's an end to the, so it's a 10 to the 10th dimensional space. And it's

923
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,120
a, so it's, it's a 10.

924
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,120
Now I think it's, so it's n times n minus one is the, is the number of dimensions of the

925
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,400
polytope itself, but it's embedded in an end to the, oh, sorry, it's got,

926
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:43,200
this I'm making the point. I'm now trying to talk about the higher dimensional thing. And you can

927
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:47,440
see I'm, I'm, I'm struggling and so forth where as the three dimensions, I could just see it. You

928
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:52,080
could just see it. And here now it's there improved, there improved even talk about this stuff. And so,

929
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,640
so that's why I feel like we're cheated. And I, you know, I would love, you know,

930
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:00,720
once we take off this headset, I'd love to put on one that's, you know, that has a trillion dimensions.

931
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:06,240
And boy, that'll be, that'll be something. And, and why only three dimensions of color?

932
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:11,840
Why not a trillion dimensions of color? I mean, the Mantis shrimp seems to have more than 10

933
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:17,760
colors. The pigeons have four humans get stuck, most of us with only three.

934
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,080
Yeah. I can, you know, pigeons apparently seeing colors that I can't even imagine.

935
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:28,880
I just feel cheated. So I can't wait to, you know, well, I'll wait. I'm not here to die right away,

936
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,720
but you know,

937
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,920
Think about it. They can see ultraviolet to me birds in the ultraviolet. I mean,

938
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,440
snakes in the red with this, we saw the red logically just read some birds. I think you can

939
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:45,600
see polarization. We can't see polarization bats perceive an echolocation. What, what does that

940
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,880
like to perceive echolocation? I mean, they see a three quote unquote, see a 3d world with echolocation.

941
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,880
What's that like? There's a famous paper about what's it like to be a bat?

942
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,680
Thomas Nagel. Yeah, that's right. Exactly right.

943
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,000
No, no, let's move on to the basics then done six. Yeah.

944
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,920
So larger subsets of states and smaller windows of sampling

945
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,360
seem under stimulations to favor periodic perceptions, which we conjecture project a

946
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:18,240
massless particle. Yeah, that was exactly the point I was just making that with, you know, the

947
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,080
smaller temporal window with more states than your trace,

948
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,640
it's more likely that you'll get just zeros and ones in the in the kernel that you create.

949
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,840
And therefore it'll be a massless particle. So, so that was

950
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:37,840
Yeah, so we went through all six. Yeah. So if that's, I think first of all, that's

951
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,360
brilliant page in its own, but talk to me about the towards the end of the paper.

952
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,800
I think you talk about future experiments, the computational experiment that you proposed.

953
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:51,280
Right. Let's talk about that. What's what's what is the next step here all together?

954
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:58,400
Well, so the next step, I think is

955
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:11,040
we're going to need some bigger computers because these Markov chains, you know,

956
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:20,240
as you as the number of states grows as n grows, the number of entries in the Markov kernel

957
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:28,160
grows as n squared. It's going to continue to go. It's going to say it's huge.

958
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,120
So the next step is going is going to be

959
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:43,280
I think there's a few steps. And so I can use this as a recruiting time. We need

960
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:50,480
we need some geniuses to help us out. The pedestrian thing will be to

961
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:56,560
find and it's not pedestrian, but you know, relatively pedestrian to as I mentioned,

962
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:06,800
to find this class of master Markov chains and the set of subsets of states and windows,

963
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,280
temporal windows that will give us the momentum distributions that they're seen inside the core.

964
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:19,520
But now there's but and so but that's that's just the first that's what this proposal is about.

965
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,680
And that's the whole thing for this proposal. But that's obviously just the first baby step.

966
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:28,160
If we can't do that, then we're wrong. And but if we do that, that doesn't mean we've

967
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:34,000
we're done. It means we've taken our very first baby step. There's this huge world to explore now.

968
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,960
So I mean, a part of the exploration,

969
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:47,600
we really then want to understand in greater detail, this mapping from the Markovian dynamics,

970
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:54,560
like the Markov kernels, through decorative permutations into space time, that that really

971
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:59,520
right now that and the physicists are working really hard on that. I mean, among them are

972
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,400
Neymar Konihamed and his collaborators. And they have they were the ones who discovered the

973
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:08,560
decorative permutations, the amplitude hedron. But but they haven't stopped there, they're

974
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:14,080
looking, they're looking, they've got stuff on effective field theories and and what they call

975
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:21,280
the EFT hedron. And so there's, I think a lot of algebraic geometry, we need an algebraic

976
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:27,440
geometry, someone with a brilliant mind and a PhD in algebraic geometry to work with us.

977
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:33,200
And so if someone, if there's someone who's listening to this, and you have a PhD in algebraic

978
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:41,280
geometry, and you find this interesting, contact me, because we, we had one, we had a wonderful

979
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:48,160
friend, Bruce Bennett, and brilliant algebraic geometry. And he died, we've lost him, and we

980
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:55,120
need an algebraic geometry to, to help us here, because a lot of the stuff is the connections

981
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:59,360
we need to make require algebraic geometry. And that is an incredibly difficult branch of

982
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:05,440
mathematics. It's way above my pay grade, I mean, way above my pay grade. So we need,

983
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,920
we need people way above my pay grade here to work on this, but that will really nail down, right?

984
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:17,120
Our mapping between Markov kernels and decorative permutations and the algorithm, we, we mean,

985
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:26,400
that's an important link. But it's like the, the initial bridge, we need to build a multi-lane

986
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:33,920
highway, you know, to, to bridge the conscious agent domain into space time. So we really,

987
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,960
really need, now that we know that we think we have a connection, we need to have really smart

988
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,760
people working with us to help us, you know, where I, you know, I won't even be able to understand

989
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,880
what they say. It's algebraic geometry. It's really, really, but I will try. I will, I will

990
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:54,960
give it my, my level best. So there's, there's a ton of work in algebraic geometry to really nail down

991
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:01,360
exactly how the properties of the Markov dynamics map to properties like unitarity,

992
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:08,800
locality, and so forth inside space time. And really all the, all the complexities of, that the

993
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,920
physicists have found in quantum field theory, I mean, quantum field theory is incredibly complicated

994
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,000
kind of thing. There are all sorts of interesting, Casimir fact and all this, this interesting

995
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:25,440
stuff. Getting these momentum distributions inside the proton, we chose that now because it's the

996
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:30,480
most important, but because we think it's the, perhaps the easiest thing we could do immediately

997
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:37,040
to make people say, Oh, well, it's not obviously wrong. Okay. You know, they can do something.

998
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,320
It's small, but they can do something. Maybe then we can get, I mean, real smart people

999
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,520
way above my pay grade, who can then start to move in, who know their quantum field theory

1000
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:51,280
and no algebraic geometry. And there are a bunch of other branches of mathematics that are going

1001
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:58,880
to be. So, so in other words, if we, if we succeed beyond my wildest hopes in this, we will have only

1002
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,920
taken a tiny baby step and we really need reinforcements from really smart people to, to move it forward.

1003
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:09,840
Yeah. And a lot of, and mathematics is going to be the king here. Well, of course, we need

1004
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,840
the theoretical physicists who know the current theoretical physics, because we, that's what

1005
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:19,280
we have to project to you as the limiting case. But for my money, it's going to be the mathematical

1006
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:25,680
physicists who are going to really be able to bring this thing home. I think, well, to just

1007
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:29,440
summarize this last part of the paper, when you said the computational experiment proposed here

1008
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,640
explores how the strong force, which dominates inside protons, may arise from a dynamics of

1009
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:39,760
conscious agents. Future computational experiments will explore gravity, the weak force, the

1010
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,640
electromagnetic force, dark matter, and cosmology from the Big Bang to the entropic death of the

1011
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:49,600
universe. I mean, there's so many areas here you're going to explore. Which ones are you most excited

1012
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:55,360
about? Well, I feel like a kid in a candy store. I want to know them all. I want to explore them

1013
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:06,320
all. But each one will require a team of geniuses to do it. But I'll just give you one.

1014
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,480
Here's one that's really interesting to me.

1015
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,120
Our dynamics of conscious agents, this Markovian dynamics,

1016
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:26,880
need not have an arrow of time. So it's a dynamical system, but it need not have an

1017
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:32,480
arrow of time. By that, I mean, you could write down a Markovian dynamics in which the entropy

1018
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:41,840
doesn't increase. There's no second law of thermodynamics in it. But it's a theorem that

1019
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:47,840
if you take such a dynamics and you project it by conditional probability, so I've got this big

1020
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,800
dynamics, it has no arrow of time, but I'm going to project it in a way that loses a little bit

1021
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,680
of information. But I've got a projected dynamics. So I've got a new Markovian dynamics.

1022
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:05,040
But it's slightly simpler than the bigger one because it's a projection. The new dynamics will

1023
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:11,200
have an arrow of time because it lost information. So the projection will have increasing entropy.

1024
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:22,160
Now, that's very suggestive to me that, once again, here we are in a world that we think

1025
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:26,720
is ruled by the second law of thermodynamics. It started with the Big Bang, it's going to end

1026
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:35,120
maybe in an entropic death or some big crunch, who knows. But it's got a finite shelf life

1027
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:44,320
on this universe and things are running down. And that's a fundamental principle in physics.

1028
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:50,960
It's also the fundamental thing in evolution of a natural selection, where the fundamental limited

1029
01:45:50,960 --> 01:46:01,520
resource that we're competing against is time. If I don't get food in time, I die. If I don't mate

1030
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:08,000
in time, the species doesn't survive. So time is the fundamental limited resource.

1031
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:17,520
And so this fact suggests to me that, of course, we expect it to get space and time as artifacts of

1032
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:23,840
the projection. So space and time are not fundamental. They're not fundamental to the

1033
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:30,640
deeper reality. They're only properties of this projection. Well, here's how time is an artifact.

1034
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:36,000
It's a theorem. You can have no entropic arrow of time, but when you take a projection, you will

1035
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,120
necessarily have. So it's an artifact. Our arrow of time is not an insight into reality. Time is

1036
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:49,600
not fundamental. That notion of time is not fundamental. It's entirely artifactual. And that

1037
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:55,600
means I've done a lot of work in evolution of a natural selection and I'm very interested in

1038
01:46:55,600 --> 01:47:01,280
evolutionary game theory. And I think evolution is absolutely the best and cleanest scientific

1039
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:06,720
model we have to explain biological evolution and so forth. So I love that theory. But this is

1040
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,720
saying that that is a theory inside our space-time interface. It's wonderful theory inside our

1041
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:22,240
space-time interface. It does not generalize beyond. We could imagine that... So I'll say

1042
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:27,360
inside space and time, we have organisms competing for limited resources

1043
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:35,040
and going extinct and so forth. We have an arrow of time. But that could be a projection

1044
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:40,160
of a Markovian dynamics where there is no competition, there are no limited resources,

1045
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,680
and there is no arrow of time. And so what ultimately... Another thing I'd love to do

1046
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:52,320
is to show exactly how evolution of a natural selection arises

1047
01:47:54,160 --> 01:48:00,320
as the projection of a dynamics where there is no competition and no limited resources.

1048
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:06,400
And see, that's what we really want. When we transcend a previous scientific theory,

1049
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:14,320
we don't disrespect it. Quite the opposite. We respect Newton. What a genius. I mean,

1050
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:23,520
hats off to Newton. He was brilliant, but it's limited. Einstein is better. But space-time itself

1051
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:29,040
is doomed and so we're going to transcend space-time. But we're going to, again, hats off to Einstein,

1052
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:34,800
to quantum field theory, and to evolution of a natural selection. Whatever new theory we propose

1053
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:40,320
beyond space-time has to project into space-time and give us back those theories. That's going to

1054
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:46,960
be the discipline that our new theory has to satisfy before we are willing to saddle up on

1055
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:52,880
that pony and take it where it's going to go. If that doesn't give us back Einstein and Darwin

1056
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:58,320
and quantum field theory and so forth in space-time, then that's not the horse we need to ride.

1057
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:04,720
That's the wrong horse. So these theories are still doing incredible work for us. So you can see

1058
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:10,080
the attitude is not, oh, we're right and they're wrong and those stupid, no, no, no, no, no. That

1059
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:17,840
was brilliant work. And every scientific theory is just the next baby step, mine included.

1060
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:26,800
Century from now, hopefully much, much sooner, if this holds up, it'll be viewed as just a next

1061
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:34,320
baby step. And we know the next generation will know far deeper and will understand what I've

1062
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:39,680
done, what we've done, is just a special case of something far more general. And that's just

1063
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:46,640
the nature of science. There is no theory of everything in principle. There can be no theory

1064
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:53,760
of everything because every scientific theory starts with assumptions. We need to tell Kurt that.

1065
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:00,320
Is there John Mungle? There's no theory of everything. Oh, right, right, right. He has

1066
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:07,200
theory of everything. Well, and I think most scientists who talk about a theory of everything

1067
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:14,240
is with a wink and a nod because I think they understand that, and I think Kurt as well.

1068
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,480
I think he understands that. I think it goes with this podcast as well, when you think about it,

1069
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,680
because I called it mind body solution, paying homage to the mind body problem,

1070
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:26,560
but I don't really think we're going to find the solution. It's more of a, it's just in the

1071
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:35,840
name. Yeah, that's right. The hunt. Yes, it's more of a hunt. But in principle, we can never get

1072
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,600
a final theory of everything because every theory has to have assumptions, and those are the things

1073
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:43,280
that you don't assume. I'm sorry that you don't explain. You assume them, but you don't explain

1074
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:49,680
them. So that means we'll never get the final explanation. Although we may be ourselves the

1075
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:55,280
final explanation. There are theories in which you are what you're looking for, but you'll never

1076
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:00,080
be able to write it down. So you are it, but you can't write it down because you transcend anything

1077
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:06,480
that you can write down. But this is infinite job security for science, and I love that.

1078
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:11,760
Not that as well. I mean, your goal is to give the scientific community a reason to take seriously

1079
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:16,400
the idea that consciousness is fundamental, that consciousness can be modeled with precise

1080
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:21,840
mathematics and make precise experimental predictions, and that the dynamics of consciousness

1081
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:29,440
gives rise to space time physics by projection. And when you think about this whole journey

1082
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,040
and everything you've done regarding this paper specifically, what has been the most

1083
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:36,800
fascinating aspect of it all, and just the coolest part of it all for you?

1084
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:47,520
For me, it blew me away. A couple of things blew me away just in the last year. A year ago, we

1085
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,360
didn't have this mapping from Markov chains to the decorated permutations. And when we could do that,

1086
01:51:54,320 --> 01:52:01,600
a light went on in me, I go, oh, wow, this is real. This is a real potential here. And then

1087
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:07,840
when we said, okay, well, that's cool, but you need to get mass, spin and energy momentum,

1088
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:13,520
and you've got to get those from kernels. Good luck. And when they started cracking,

1089
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:22,400
when we started getting what we just described today, and then we got that hyperfine structure

1090
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:31,280
prediction, that really, that was when I began to start to believe that this might be the next

1091
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:41,200
baby step. This might actually be, I couldn't believe it seemed too good to be true. So what

1092
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:50,160
we'll see, maybe it is too good to be true. But what I would say is this, the thing you

1093
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:56,000
read at the end about trying to make precise predictions and so forth, that's what makes

1094
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:06,000
what we're doing here different from panpsychist approaches. And again, these are my good friends

1095
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,800
and so forth. So there's nothing personal here at all. But panpsychism means a lot of things. So

1096
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,360
I'll say the version of panpsychism that I'm thinking about here is a version in which we take

1097
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:25,600
space time as fundamental, we take quantum field theory as given, and the particles of the standard

1098
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:33,440
model is given, the leptons, bows on the corks. And what we do is we say consciousness is the fire

1099
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:39,920
behind those equations. Each particle has, you know, an electron has some conscious experience,

1100
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:43,920
a gluon has some conscious, and the different colors of gluons have different conscious

1101
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:55,760
experiences and so forth. And my attitude about that is there's no progress. We're not explaining

1102
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:02,080
consciousness. We're, it's panpsychism, but that version that I just talked about,

1103
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:06,720
panpsychism is really a dualism. Physics stuff is real. In addition, there's consciousness

1104
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:13,760
behind it. And there's no principle. Why should the, what experience, what specific experience

1105
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:20,160
should the electron have? And how does that differ from the electron neutrino and the tau neutrino

1106
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:25,760
and the tau and the mua? What are the specific experiences that are attached to each one and why?

1107
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:35,600
No one's trying that. Good luck. So to just say that there are experiences, from my point of view

1108
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:44,560
as a scientist, nothing's been accomplished. Nothing has been accomplished. It's a dualism,

1109
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:52,320
the version I just said. What we're trying to do in contrast is say, okay, we're not assuming the

1110
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,160
standard model in space-time is fundamental. They're not part of our assumptions. We have to

1111
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:05,440
derive them. All of it. We're assuming consciousness, conscious experiences is fundamental. And we're

1112
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:10,080
going to have to project into space-time and give and explain all that. And that seems, I mean,

1113
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,800
we haven't done it yet. So, you know, I'm not congratulating myself, but I'm saying that that,

1114
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,960
at least that attempt, that direction of attempt is very different from saying, well, electrons

1115
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:28,960
have experiences and tau and mua have experiences and quarks and glues. As a scientist, I find that

1116
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:34,080
exceedingly unsatisfying. I don't see where it's going to go in terms of giving me new mathematics

1117
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:40,640
that can actually do something, make predictions and eventually make new technology. If this approach

1118
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:47,760
we're talking about works, if we can actually talk about the dynamics of conscious agents outside

1119
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:58,800
space-time, and we understand what particles are and what mass is, we understand how space-time is

1120
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:06,640
constructed as an interface, then think about what you can do. If you're playing Grand Theft Auto,

1121
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:12,720
you're a user, you might be a super user, and you're able to drive your car and out and outrun

1122
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:19,200
everybody. That's fantastic. That's a great skill. But if you know the code, if you understand

1123
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:24,400
Grand Theft Auto is just a piece of software, and you wrote the code or you know how it's written,

1124
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:34,240
then you can do stuff that's completely miraculous to the guy who's the expert inside Grand Theft.

1125
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:39,200
You can take all the gas out of his tank. You can change, you can give him flat tires.

1126
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:45,200
You can take away a steering wheel, or you could change the geometry of the road he's driving.

1127
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:54,160
Or you can get him from A to B without going through the space. You could appear anywhere

1128
01:56:54,160 --> 01:57:05,120
you want to in space. If it's really possible for us to show how space-time is just a headset,

1129
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,400
and we know the software of conscious agents that creates that headset,

1130
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:15,760
and it turns out we can tinker with that software. There's a question of whether we

1131
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:25,600
can tinker with it, but if we can tinker with it, then the Andromeda Galaxy is something like 2.4

1132
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,920
million light years away. Going through space-time, we're not going to get there anytime soon.

1133
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:34,880
But what if we don't have to go through space-time? What if we can just go around space-time?

1134
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:41,600
And just be there. The technologies that this might open up are completely mind-blowing.

1135
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,680
Again, I'm saying that it's guaranteed, but I can guarantee you that the pan-psychist version

1136
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,920
thing that I said will never get there. There's nothing that even has a hope. This at least

1137
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:57,120
has a hope. We'll see if the hope is dashed, but at least it's a direction where it might happen.

1138
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,520
We'll see. I mean, if it does, it's absolutely crazy. I'm pretty sure someone who's listening to

1139
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,280
this last portion of the podcast, if they just decided to listen to it, they think we're talking

1140
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:10,880
about some crazy things. I mean, it's highly plausible. When you take everything into account,

1141
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:16,560
it makes sense. That could possibly be the future. That's right. But to someone who believes in

1142
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:22,880
flat earth, around earth, is a crazy thing. Yeah. Done. I mean, this is the last time we

1143
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:27,520
did this thing where I told you last minute objections, anything you think you're going to

1144
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:34,640
get any sort of feedback on perhaps counter-arguments. This is a chance for you to just express

1145
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:38,640
certain views and anything about this paper that you find you didn't speak about yet that you want

1146
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:49,360
to just clarify or mention. Just one thing that I'll point out. These are objections that I get

1147
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:56,960
all the time in emails from people. They'll say also, it's two things. Hoffman, of course,

1148
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:04,080
you say that what we see is not the truth. It's our construction. Well, what if a car hits you

1149
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:09,200
from behind? You didn't see it coming, but it still killed you. There you go. It's all over.

1150
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:19,360
You know, the car really does exist. That's simply just not a counter example. I mean,

1151
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:27,920
if you're again in Grand Theft Auto and you're driving and there's a, well,

1152
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:32,160
if you look behind you and you see that the red Porsche is about to come up and crash you from

1153
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:36,960
behind, right? Well, if you don't look, you're not going to see that red Porsche and you're not

1154
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,840
going to render it. So there's no red Porsche, right? In the supercomputer, there is no red Porsche.

1155
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,160
Does that mean that you're not going to get hit from behind anyway and have damaged?

1156
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:49,920
No, you're still going to get hit, but there was no red Porsche. There's some reality,

1157
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:57,600
namely the supercomputer and the software that's going to enforce. But the reality is not what

1158
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:05,280
you see in your headset. So for that whole class of arguments, well, Hoffman, why don't you step

1159
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:12,400
off a cliff? It will kill you even if you don't think it's real. All those, just my response for

1160
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,800
people with those objections. If you just think about putting on a headset and being in a virtual

1161
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:22,160
reality game, just run your question, the same thing that you think is an objection to what I'm

1162
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:25,680
saying, just run it in virtual reality and see if it still flies there. When you think about

1163
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:31,520
in virtual reality, you'll realize, oh, wow, it would happen even if I didn't render it. But the

1164
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:36,880
rendered thing doesn't exist. The Porsche doesn't exist. The cliff doesn't exist until I render it.

1165
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:45,520
But the software is not the Porsche or the cliff. The software is something utterly outside the

1166
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:50,400
headset. And that is a reality. So I'm not denying reality. I'm just denying that spacetime is the

1167
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:57,680
reality. That's one objection. The other objection, and hopefully that will save a lot of thousands

1168
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:02,560
of people having to write me emails saying, here's an obvious objection to what you're saying.

1169
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,400
The funny thing about that is, is that you obviously claim that consciousness is fundamental,

1170
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:10,320
but then you've got people like that, Dennett and Frank, who also get told the same can't argue.

1171
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:15,280
I mean, if consciousness doesn't exist, I get knocked by a bus. Did it really happen?

1172
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:24,160
That's exactly right. Because I'm unconscious. And by the way, they're both wonderful men.

1173
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:30,640
I mean, even though we disagree, I mean, they're great, then they're bright. And I'm glad to have

1174
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:39,120
people that bright that disagree. The other objection that I just raised real quick is

1175
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:47,840
the objection that, when I say that evolution by natural, and I didn't go into that too much

1176
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:54,720
today, but when I say that evolution by natural selection, we use evolutionary game theory to

1177
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:59,920
show that we evolved not to see the truth, that natural selection would not shape us to see the

1178
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:09,200
truth. There are a lot of people, including some professional philosophers who have come back

1179
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:16,160
and said, that is self contradictory. And the contradiction is this. So evolution by natural

1180
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:22,960
selection Darwin's idea is that there are physical objects called organisms competing

1181
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:31,440
in space and time for physical resources like food and eggs. And now evolutionary game theory

1182
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:38,720
is a mathematical statement that's supposed to capture Darwin's idea. Now either evolutionary

1183
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:44,400
game theory succeeded, and it faithfully represents Darwin's ideas, or it didn't.

1184
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:52,800
If it didn't, then you can't use evolutionary game theory to show that organisms and spacetime

1185
02:02:52,800 --> 02:03:00,400
are doomed. And if it did, if evolutionary game theory does successfully capture Darwin's ideas,

1186
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:07,280
then you couldn't possibly use it to show that he was wrong. So there's no way that you can do what

1187
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:12,720
you're doing without shooting yourself on the foot, logically, either way. So as one philosopher

1188
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:19,920
put it, Hoffman is in an unfortunate dialectical situation. So I'm in an unfortunate dialectical

1189
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:28,720
situation. And my response is, no, I'm in the normal situation of how science progresses from one

1190
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:36,000
theory to the next. The way science progresses is you take your ideas, like Einstein's idea,

1191
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:40,640
that spacetime is fundamental and the speed of light is universal.

1192
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:48,720
And that if you're an elevator and you're following, you'll be messless. You would weigh

1193
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:56,000
nothing. Those are his intuitions. He labors and labors and labors for general activity for many,

1194
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:05,840
many years. And sleepless nights, deep, deep struggle. In 1915, he puts down his field equations.

1195
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Now, when you use Einstein's field equations, and also his 1905 paper where he uses

1196
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,400
Planck's constant to essentially introduce quantum theory, although I didn't like it,

1197
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:26,880
he introduces quantum theory. When you bring in quantum field theory, which is based on spacetime,

1198
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:32,480
and you bring in Einstein's therapy, which I'll assume spacetime is fundamental.

1199
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:40,080
When you look at the mathematics, the mathematics tells you that spacetime has no operational

1200
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:46,000
meaning beyond the Planck's scale, 10 to the minus 30 centimeters, 10 to the minus 43 seconds. In

1201
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:53,200
other words, Einstein's theory that was capturing his intuitions about spacetime comes back and tells

1202
02:04:53,200 --> 02:05:03,520
us that spacetime itself cannot be fundamental. So, Einstein is now in this very unfortunate

1203
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:09,840
dialectical situation. Either these mathematically precise theories captured Einstein's intuitions,

1204
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:13,840
or they did not. If they did not, then they couldn't possibly show that spacetime was not

1205
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,880
fundamental. And if they did capture his intuitions, then they wouldn't contradict him.

1206
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:26,800
That's the mistake. They wouldn't contradict him. Every scientific theory has premises.

1207
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:36,560
It has a limited scope. Every scientific theory has limited scope. When you write down the mathematics,

1208
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:42,160
what you hope is your mathematics is precise enough to find what is the limited scope of

1209
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:49,120
your assumptions. How far do your assumptions go and where do they stop? Because a scientific

1210
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:59,360
theory is not a theory of everything. It has a limited range. So, what the power of science is,

1211
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:06,160
is we make our mathematics, our assumptions precise, not so that our assumptions can never be disproved,

1212
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:12,560
but so that we can find their limits and say, spacetime is great until you get to 10 to the

1213
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:20,320
minus 33 centimeters and then goodbye. And so, that's the way science progresses,

1214
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:26,720
is by one set of equations capturing one set of intuitions and showing you their limits,

1215
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:36,720
and then being the past bed for your next set of ideas, because now you have to take a leap.

1216
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:42,480
And this is the fun of science. Well, part of the fun. I mean, the mathematics is fun, too,

1217
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:47,680
if you're a mathematician. It's hard for me. I can see how it could be fun, but it's just hard for

1218
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:55,120
me. But the fun is now you have to take a creative leap to get a new framework and then

1219
02:06:55,360 --> 02:07:00,720
project it back into the old framework and make sure you get that old framework or generalization

1220
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:05,920
of that old framework. The old framework can't tell you what leap to take,

1221
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:12,800
but it can tell you if the leap was wrong, because if it doesn't project back to, so,

1222
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:19,200
so that's how science progresses. It's not that if our mathematical theories capture our intuitions,

1223
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:25,760
they could never prove us wrong. It's that mathematical theories that capture our intuitions

1224
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:33,040
better show us the limits of those assumptions, or they're not terribly useful,

1225
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:39,280
because we know we don't, we know we don't have the final theory. We know that.

1226
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:46,640
The only question is, are our equations smart enough to help us to see the limits of our current

1227
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:51,760
theory, or not? If not, then our mathematics hasn't gone far enough. We need to get a deeper

1228
02:07:51,760 --> 02:08:00,880
mathematics to find the limits of our current. So that's, at some point, I have to write a paper

1229
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:07,760
to respond to, because this has been published in philosophy journals and so forth, and so I'll

1230
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:14,720
need, but there's a finite amount of time, and I think addressing it here is easy. It takes me

1231
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:19,120
10 minutes to address it. Writing the paper would take me months, and I'm not sure at this point

1232
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:24,400
in my life I want to spend months doing that when I have some other more fun stuff to do. So I may,

1233
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:29,840
who knows, I may never respond in writing. This may be the only thing I do. We'll see.

1234
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,240
I think, look, ideally, you're doing a great job at the moment. I mean, I've watched many of your

1235
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:40,560
podcasts. You do such a fantastic job at, there's certain repetitive answers that you've got

1236
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:45,600
that work perfectly. So when I watch some of your interviews, I'll enjoy that some of your

1237
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:50,800
answers are well rehearsed in the sense that you know exactly what's been working and what isn't.

1238
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:57,120
That's right. This can be very complicated, so it's helpful to cut through it all and try to get

1239
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:00,160
to the clean intuition, because otherwise it can be very murky.

1240
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:06,400
Don, before we end, this paper specifically, I mean, let's just summarize it. The fact is that

1241
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:12,560
subatomic particles created from consciousness. That's pretty much what we're talking about.

1242
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,800
That's the proposal. I wouldn't say the fact, but I would say that that's the proposal.

1243
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,720
Anything about this paper that you want to talk about in detail specifically that you feel we

1244
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:28,480
haven't touched on that you want to address? Not today, except to say that it should be posted

1245
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:35,280
pretty soon. Within a week and a half, it should be posted online. I'll send, I can send you a link

1246
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,120
to when the Institute of Atlantic Sciences posts the link, but it's going to be

1247
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:49,360
Saturday, June 24th at 11 o'clock, a Pacific time, that there's going to be a live Zoom where

1248
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,160
all the three groups that got awarded this prize will be discussing their proposals.

1249
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:59,600
So I recommend it. It's free. People can log on.

1250
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:04,880
I'm excited for that. Thank you, Don. It's once again a pleasure.

1251
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:08,480
It's always been a pleasure to have been following you. Thank you so much, Devin. I

1252
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:13,040
really appreciate it. You asked great questions. Thank you so much. I mean, I can't wait to

1253
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:16,800
continue to watch this journey and hopefully continue to interact about it. Every paper that

1254
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:23,040
comes out, you can expect an email from me. I'll be happy to alert you to the papers too.

1255
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:28,240
It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much, Don. Good luck. I cannot wait for this paper to be

1256
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,840
published. I'm looking forward to it. I think the viewers are in for a treat for this one.

1257
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:42,800
It's pretty epic work. Thank you so much.
