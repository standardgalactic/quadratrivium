0	15680	Helen, I've been trying to think of a way to start this podcast interview by giving you
15680	20520	the best opportunity to explain your view. And I think the best way to start is how I
20520	25000	often start with certain people. I did this with Keith, I mean with illusionism. I'm going
25000	31440	to do this with panpsychism. What I want you to do is give me a brief philosophical history
31440	37880	of the mind-body problem from your side, from how you grew to listen to this problem, to understand
37880	44640	it and tell me which philosophers or scientists have played the biggest roles in shaping your
44640	49800	current view. Because I think it gives us a great understanding of how you came to this view. I
49800	54800	know Berkeley is obviously going to be one of them, but I mean it's a great way to understand how
54800	60160	your thought processes have formed over the years. Yeah, okay, so that's a very interesting
60160	67600	question. So I think I first became introduced to consciousness. Actually, my dad introduced me
67600	73960	to the knowledge argument when I was still in high school. And so and I loved that. And I had very,
73960	80720	very strong dualist intuitions right from the get-go. So my first philosophy of mind class that I
80720	85640	took spent a lot of time discussing different particular physicalist theories and the minutia
85640	89920	of those theories. And I spent the whole time sitting there like, what, this is completely
89920	95160	missing the point, right? This is missing consciousness. Where are the feels coming from?
95160	102200	So I spent all my time sort of sitting there idly drawing little pictures and diagrams and
102200	108600	concluded based on this that there could be no such thing as mental causation. And what I was
108600	114120	drawing out was these standard diagrams that have been used to support epiphenomenalism. So the
114120	120200	idea that, you know, there's the physical world and every physical event is caused by a previous
120200	126720	physical event. And those physical events cause conscious experiences, but there's sort of not
126720	131360	any room in the picture for the conscious experiences to do causal work. The conscious
131360	135560	experiences are just sort of an extra that explains the feelings, but nothing more. So,
136280	143480	so I quickly became concluded that epiphenomenalism was true and my philosophy professor spent the
143480	151400	rest of my undergraduate career time to disabuse me of this and never succeeded. So my I while I'm
151400	157040	currently working on idealism and developing an idealist view of the nature of reality and the
157040	162960	nature of the mind body problem. I'm actually not not necessarily a committed idealist. I'm sort of a
162960	169480	committed antiphysicalist. So I have very strong intuitions that consciousness can't be reduced to
170400	175640	can't be reduced to something non conscious. And not only intuitions, I think these intuitions can be
175640	181160	developed into good arguments to this effect. But at this point in my life, I'm sort of neutral
181160	189720	between dualism of an epiphenomenalist sort and idealism of an epiphenomenalist sort. So I mean,
189720	193360	I guess you asked for people who had influenced me on this journey. And it's a little bit funny,
193360	200840	because I think I actually kind of came fully formed to these views that I have prior to reading
200840	204440	people. And then it was subsequently I started reading people like Dave Chalmers and going, ah,
204440	210360	he's said everything I want to say only way better than I could say it. And Thomas does have that
211280	213120	Yes, is very, very frustrating.
216400	224440	But so I sort of I began my career as a dualist, and I put no stock whatsoever in the truth of
224440	231720	idealism. It sounded like a bonkers theory. I met Howard Robinson, who is a contemporary idealist
231720	238280	philosopher when I was in grad school, and I was blown away that he was actually an idealist. And I
238280	243560	didn't think there were any such people. But subsequently, it actually I started thinking
243560	248600	about idealism more carefully as a result of two things. One was thinking about just reading
248600	254680	Barkley when I was in grad school and thinking about abstract general ideas. So this is sort of
254680	260040	the question of that the early modern philosophers were interested in of how it is that we can have
260040	265560	thoughts that latch on to not just a particular thing, but latch on to many things that are very
265560	270520	diverse in different ways. So how we can have a thought, a particular thought about triangles.
271400	275720	That's not about any particular kind of triangle, but just triangularity in general. And so that
275720	279960	led me to reading a lot of Barkley and the early modern philosophers and sort of increased my
279960	285720	interest in idealism. And at the same time, I was being exposed to work contemporary work in the
285720	292440	philosophy of perception. And these people called naive realists. And naive realism is this view
293400	300600	about perception where the thought is that somebody should start with representationalism
300600	304760	because I think it's the more intuitive view. So for a representationalist, there's this world
304760	311000	out there and light bounces off of the object and enters my eye and stuff happens in my brain
311000	318840	and causes me to represent a mug that's before me. But what it is that I'm sort of directly
318920	323880	grasping is this thing that my brain generates, this experience of the mug, this representation of
323880	328280	the mug. I don't directly grasp the mug. I sort of grasp the mug that I'm looking at or anything
328280	334760	in the world in an indirect kind of way. And naive realists say, no, no, the intuitive view is that
334760	339720	vision is kind of like touch. We sort of reach out and we sort of grasp the object. And the object
339720	346360	is a part of our thoughts. And listening to this in grad school, and I found this completely
346360	353080	just insane sounding. How is it that my thoughts, my conscious experiences could have things like
353080	360760	cups and trees and computers as a part of them? That made no sense to me at all. And it made no
360760	366840	sense until I started thinking, well, but if the whole world is experiences, if the whole world is
366840	372600	made up out of consciousness, then maybe it's not quite so insane. And that sort of led me down the
372600	377320	road of interest and idealism and just sort of playing with it as a view, not because I thought
377320	383080	it was true, but because it seemed interesting. And I was curious, is it a view that could be
383080	388120	defended? And actually, the more I sort of played with it, and the more I thought about it, the
388120	394680	more I realized there actually are some genuinely good things to say in favor of this view. And I've
394680	401240	sort of argued myself into giving it significant credence, although I'm not a committed idealist.
402600	408360	I mean, there's so many idealists today, giving such great arguments. I mean, if you think of people
408360	413400	like Bernardo Kastrup out there, you've got someone like Donald Hoffman who does conscious
413400	417400	realism, but I mean, it's a form of idealism, in a sense, if you when you think about it,
417400	422520	you take consciousness to be this fundamental reality. I mean, you're talking about a difference
422520	428040	in the nature of consciousness. I think a great way to go with this is let's go with one of your
428040	433560	papers is called dissolving, I think type B physicalism. Yeah. Remembering the title
433560	438440	curriculum. Let's dissolve physicalism. Tell me why that's just go with it.
440360	446920	Well, I don't know that we actually can dissolve physicalism. So I kind of, I think there are
446920	453640	certain versions of physicalism that don't work. But I actually am inclined to think that there is
453640	460040	a plurality of metaphysical views out there that actually are each, not just internally
460040	464760	coherent, like from the inside, you can stamp your feet and say, no, I refuse to listen to
464760	470440	anything you say, but that are sort of deeply like internally plausible, I guess is maybe the way to
470440	478920	put it. So let me try to think how to express this. So I think it's, it's well known that
479880	485720	you can for, you can take and you can just refuse to listen to the other people's sides
485720	491240	arguments, you can say, I disagree with that premise, I refuse to accept that. And as a result,
491240	496280	I don't have to accept your argument, I'm going to hold on to my, to my position. So, you know,
496280	499800	when you have something like a physicalist faced with a knowledge argument, the physicalist could
499800	506200	say, look, I just don't think that Mary, when she sees red for the first time, learns anything.
506200	509320	I think that's, I think that's the wrong way of thinking about it. I don't think she'd be fooled
509320	516600	if you showed her a blue banana. But I think that you could also be a physicalist who actually
516600	523400	genuinely accepts the intuitive starting point, and nevertheless, can still defend from the inside
523400	530440	that viewpoint. So I think, and I argue in that paper at the end of the paper, the idea is that
530520	535160	it's a kind of mysterious. So the idea is that we,
537880	543400	we have a particular sort of cognitive structure to our minds. And that cognitive structure is
543400	548120	essentially sort of limiting to what it is, what kinds of things it is that we can understand.
548680	553880	And depending on sort of the formatting of how it is that our brain goes about making sense of
553880	559960	consciousness in sort of conscious terms versus physical stuff, sort of using physical terms,
559960	566520	it may be that our brain just is not set up to be able to match those two kinds of things together.
566520	571080	But it doesn't, that doesn't mean that it's impossible for these two things to be matched
571080	576920	up. That could just be a limitation due to kind of like our neural hardware. And so I think that
576920	584440	if a physicalist were to embrace a view like that, that they can simultaneously accept things like
584440	590440	the knowledge argument, except the actual intuitive datum, the datum that Mary as a human being, Mary
590440	596600	as somebody with an art cognitive architecture that works like ours, she would be fooled by a blue
596600	601640	banana. She would learn something new, even if she had all the physical knowledge, but it doesn't
601640	606680	mean that there's something more to consciousness. So I think, I think a physicalist can,
607640	611960	can sort of embrace what the dualist says and still maintain their physicalism.
612440	618200	At the same time, I think that a dualist can embrace a lot of things that a physicalist
618200	624520	wants to throw at them and really listen to them and still not have to be moved. And I similarly
624520	628760	think the same kind of thing for idealism. So I actually think that there's sort of a plurality
628760	633800	of views that they're not just defensible from the inside in that you can say, mean or meaner,
633800	638440	or you know, stick your tongue out at the other side and say, I refuse to accept your starting
638440	643240	points. You can accept the starting points, explain away as needed and come to an internally
643240	650920	plausible view for these very different views. And I kind of think that, sorry, I'm interrupting.
650920	655800	I completely agree with that. I think that when I started this podcast, I had such a specific
656760	661080	thought going into it. What I thought consciousness was, I wrote essays on it as well. It's part of
661080	667080	my dissertation. So I had my own view. But when I listen to people's coherent arguments, the more
667080	673320	you actually try and sympathize or empathize even more with these views, the more you understand
673320	679320	that if you set up a great bunch of assumptions prior to starting the argument, you can really
679320	687880	flow with your argument and you can give something succinct and not Nina Nina. So people can listen
687880	693160	to it. I mean, and you do a great job at this. I think you do a perfect example. You're a perfect
693160	698520	example of someone who can defend idealism with some really coherent arguments and even just
698520	702840	reading your papers. I mean, you've done a great job at that. I think at this point, do you want
702840	707640	to defend your actual position? I mean, what is your position regarding consciousness? What is
707640	713800	consciousness to you, Helen? Okay, so would you like me to talk about consciousness or about
713800	717880	idealism itself? Let's talk about idealism because I mean, we obviously know that that's
717880	723320	like your view on consciousness. Okay, well, in a sense, sorry, I keep I keep sort of,
723320	727240	I sort of agree with what you're saying, but I keep sort of also disagreeing and it's
727240	733800	it's made it a little hard to directly answer the questions. So I think in a sense, I think that
733800	741880	idealism is not itself a view of consciousness or a view of the mind body problem in the way that
741880	747160	like materialism or dualism or panpsychism, those are views that are coming and are
747160	752360	essentially trying to like answer the mind body problem. Whereas idealism, I think is
752360	759080	essentially a view about the nature of the physical world. And the view basically is just
759080	763480	sort of in a nutshell what it takes to be, I guess I should say an idealist of the sort that I'm
763480	768360	interested in. So I think of this as ontological idealism. But what it takes to be an idealist
768360	774600	basically just is to think that the physical world around us, it's real. But what it fundamentally
774600	782920	is, is conscious. It fundamentally is built up out of phenomenology. So I sort of think of this
782920	789400	a little bit by analogy to like reductive physicalism. So reductive physicalists, they want to say,
789400	794440	you know, look, I think consciousness is real. I think there is such a thing as pain. I'm not
794440	798680	trying to do away with pain, I'm trying to give an analysis of it. And this is the analysis.
799240	804360	Pain reduces to some sort of physical state, some sort of brain state, functional state.
805080	809720	Similarly, for the idealist, the idealist wants to say, the physical world is real.
809720	815240	There are rocks, there are stars, there are atoms. But what are they fundamentally? I'm trying to
815240	821480	give an analysis of it. And the analysis is such that it ultimately reduces to phenomenology.
822440	826040	Now, that sort of doesn't answer your question, right? Because you asked me about my view of
826040	832040	consciousness, which I haven't said anything about what consciousness is, what it is that this
832040	835800	is built up out of. You're talking, so we're going metaphysics here, we're talking about the
835800	842840	fundamental nature of reality. And we know that if everything is fundamentally matter,
842840	847240	that's going to be physicalism. And if everything is fundamentally mind, then you're going towards
847240	853000	more for an idealistic viewpoint. So you're basically saying that the fundamental nature
853000	859880	of reality is conscious, rather than consciousness is something, something, something.
860600	864600	Yeah. Yeah. So consciousness is sort of coming in, as you're pointing out,
864600	872120	consciousness is coming in as a primitive. So I mean, I suppose you could try to reduce
872120	875400	the physical world to consciousness and reduce consciousness to something else that doesn't
875400	880120	tend to be the way that idealists go. We do tend to take it as a primitive, as just so generous.
880280	886840	Yeah. But so, but that makes it very much very similar to panpsychism, because you're obviously
886840	893240	now taking that to be the fundamental property of reality. At what point do you guys diverge?
894520	900840	Yeah, that's a surprisingly tricky question. And I think the reason is because there aren't really
901560	906760	sufficiently precise agreed upon definitions of what it takes to be a panpsychist versus to
906760	915240	be an idealist. So there are people who are panpsychists who think that consciousness is one
915240	920200	fundamental, one sort of fundamental property, but that there might be other sorts of fundamental
920200	925880	properties that are not conscious. So it'd be kind of impure panpsychism, which would be quite
925880	933320	different. The idealist, according to the idealist, it's all phenomenology is sort of what is essentially
933320	939800	the nature of reality. So that's one potential difference. I think some of the differences
939800	946200	between panpsychism and idealism come in in sort of two respects. One is just in the canonical
946200	949880	form of panpsychism and the canonical form of idealism, why looking different,
949880	955640	and the others in their motivations. So sort of the canonical form of panpsychism is what some
955640	961560	people have called micro psychism. So this is the idea that the fundamental building blocks of reality
961560	968760	are tiny particles, quarks, whatever it is, maybe something smaller, and those fundamental
968760	975880	particles have as their intrinsic nature consciousness. So panpsychists give arguments for
975880	980040	this, of course, and then everything else is built up out of them. So we get consciousness in at the
980040	986200	ground level in building everything up, but sort of the fundamental locus of it is at the very tiny
986200	992280	level. By contrast, the canonical representation, I think of idealism, at least in the Western
992280	999960	tradition would be Barclay's idealism, which has basically the world all as experiences in the
999960	1006440	mind of God, at least as one way of putting it. So there's sort of a difference in terms of whether
1006440	1011240	the one starts with these very, very tiny things and experiences coming in as parts of them, and
1011240	1015880	the other starts with these sort of very large experiences, experiences of the universe.
1016840	1021000	Now that's not essential to the two views because there are now panpsychists who call themselves
1021000	1029240	Cosmosychists, Philip Goff being one of them, and they are going to embrace this bigger top-down
1029240	1034600	picture. But I think the other difference between idealism and panpsychism really comes from the
1034600	1041160	standard motivations for the views. So panpsychists typically come to their view as a way of giving
1041160	1049960	a solution to the mind-body problem. So they look around and they go, look, I think that
1049960	1054600	consciousness can be explained in the same way that we explain all the other stuff in the world.
1055240	1059800	We explain liquidity by, we've got a bunch of molecules, they arrange in the right way,
1059800	1064280	and liquidity emerges. I think consciousness is the same. I think you can take these little
1064280	1070200	physical building blocks, put them together, and you can build consciousness. But in a sense,
1070200	1074760	that's agreeing with the physicalist. But also the panpsychist says, but I also agree with
1074760	1079400	the non-physicalists, with the dualists, because how could you take non-physical things and put
1079400	1083400	them together and sorry, non-conscious things, non-conscious things and put them together and
1083400	1090120	have consciousness pop into existence out of that. So they sort of infer from that that the
1090120	1095880	consciousness must have been in there from the start. And it's the only way we're able to build
1095880	1102680	big consciousnesses like ours up is that we started with little consciousnesses. This is obviously a
1102680	1109480	cartoonish caricature of the view. But so the mind-body problem is the central driving
1110120	1115960	force. They're getting people to panpsychism. With idealism, the standard route to idealism
1115960	1120600	actually doesn't have to do with the mind-body problem. It has to do with trying to give an
1120600	1127320	account of the physical world around us and just directly of its nature. So I can say more about
1127320	1135560	that. Go ahead. Oh, okay. Yeah, so I mean, I guess if we sort of started with like Barclay as sort of
1135560	1143640	the father of the Western idealist tradition, you know, very rough caricature again of the view,
1143640	1147720	you look around and you're like, you know, what do I know about the world? Well, I know it's
1147720	1153080	populated by mugs like the one I'm holding by trees like the trees I see outside by stars and so on.
1155720	1159800	What's that? It's a really nice mug. You know, the last time I did an interview,
1159800	1167080	I had a different mug and I was also complimented on it. I like mugs. So,
1169480	1172440	right, so I know, I know all these things, but what do I know about these things?
1173400	1180600	Well, the mug in my hand, I know it feels solid and warm. I know, you know, I see blue
1180600	1187080	in the mug and white on the inside. I see brown, sort of with light reflecting off of it,
1187080	1192040	because I shouldn't quite describe that way. I see brownish, bobby, upy, downness when I look
1192040	1200200	inside of the mug and see the tea sloshing around. Now, all of these things that I just described
1200200	1206280	were the ways that it seems to me were experiences that I have when I look at the mug, right?
1206280	1213240	Hardness, warmth, and so on. And when you think about it, all of the information that we gain
1213240	1219880	about the world around us, empirically, we gain through our senses, through the experiences
1219880	1223480	that we have of the world. Even when you're, you know, in a science laboratory, you're looking
1223480	1228280	through a microscope or, I mean, presumably when you're running tiny particles together in a particle
1228280	1234360	accelerator, right? What it is you get from that is the experiences that you have of looking
1234360	1242200	through the microscope. So now, we could say, all right, there's some sort of mind independent
1242200	1247880	matter out there that we don't know anything about what it's like. We just know that it causes us to
1247880	1256040	have certain experiences. That's one sort of view we could have. But why, first of all,
1256040	1259240	Barkley thinks, you know, Barkley is an empiricist, he thinks we should just pause it,
1259240	1262760	what we get through our experiences, and nothing more than we need to pause it.
1263880	1269080	Why go about pausing that? Why not just pause it? That it is the thing that we're directly aware of,
1269080	1274840	experiences. Why not just pause it that we've got warmth, cylindricality, hardness, and so on?
1274840	1279640	And that's what the mug is. After all, that's all I directly have evidence of. And if you
1279640	1282840	tell me there's something more to it than that, I don't know what the hell it could be.
1282840	1292280	So that sort of is the motivation for Barkley getting to idealism. And I think the standard
1292280	1297800	motivation for getting to idealism is thinking, you know, this is what we have evidence to think
1297800	1302360	that there is. And there's not evidence to think there's anything more. So if we don't need anything
1302360	1306360	more, if we can do without it, that looks like the more simple parsimonious view.
1307160	1312360	Yeah, which is a very coherent way of thinking. I mean, ideally, if that's the way it all looks,
1313720	1317640	the best assumption to make is that that's just the way it all looks and is.
1321000	1326520	Yeah, I mean, I find this kind of argument actually quite compelling. I think a lot of people
1326520	1332280	don't. I mean, I guess the question is, can we actually come to a coherent view that's able to
1332280	1338520	respect what we learn from science, that's able to respect our intuitions about the world having
1338520	1343560	a sort of stability that it does, and does the ultimate view that we get when we really try
1343560	1351080	to flesh this all out, does that look good? And that's, I think, maybe where idealism has work
1351080	1359160	to do, at least. But I hope to fill. So coming into this view, I mean, you must have had knowledge
1359160	1363880	of, I mean, reality, we dark matters 95% of the universe. We don't know anything about it.
1364840	1368680	It's dark energy, we know nothing about the fundamental nature of reality. So
1369400	1375160	coming into this, was that does, does what we've learned from physics and basically everything
1375160	1379800	we know about biology, everything else we know, did that play a huge role in forming this view for
1379800	1386120	you? Was that was that a driving force for you to no longer trust reductionism or physicalism?
1387160	1393400	Yeah, that's a very interesting question. That was not a driving force for me. I think that
1393480	1399480	some of the cases that you present are interesting puzzle cases, though, for the idealist and cases
1399480	1406520	that the idealist really needs to think about and be able to speak to. So, I mean, what I started
1406520	1411240	off describing was the sort of experiences that I have of the world, right? And I started saying,
1411240	1415880	you know, that it seems like we want to have a world that has that, at very least as a part of it.
1416600	1419240	It's interesting that the cases that you're describing things like dark matter, you're
1419240	1423560	describing things that I, as you say, you know, we don't have the ability to perceive.
1424920	1429000	So that might be taken to be something that would pose a challenge for the idealist,
1429000	1434360	insofar as the idealist wants to say that everything in the world is experiences.
1434360	1438440	So how do we account for the sorts of things that perhaps are, you know, certainly that we
1438440	1445480	can't experience or perhaps are essentially imperceivable? So would you like me to talk
1445560	1450040	about this a little bit or? Yeah, this is about, I want to listen to what you have to say.
1450840	1456920	Okay, all right. Yes, I mean, I just think you've sort of actually hit on quite a challenging
1456920	1465000	sort of puzzle case. So I think it might make sense to get to this after getting more of the
1465000	1470440	positive view out, but maybe. I think let's do that first, and then we'll get, we'll touch on this.
1470440	1476600	I'll try and just make, you know, but continue. So wait, let's, let's start off with, I mean, so
1477720	1481480	let's run through some of the various types of idealism that they are. I mean, because
1481480	1488120	Barclay's idealism is very much, I mean, there's a lot of credence placed on God. God's one of the
1488120	1493640	main driving forces behind this, and your view does not have that behind it. It's more of a
1493640	1498360	secular version of this. So let me let's touch on the different versions of this and how yours
1498360	1507080	differs from most of the others. Oh, I am not, I'm probably not the best person to give a rundown
1507080	1515080	of all the different versions of idealism. Well, at least the most, the most commonly brought up
1515960	1521880	views. Yeah. So, well, okay, so, so you've brought up Barclay's idealism. So Barclay's idealism,
1522440	1527800	we started off describing a little bit how he came to the motivation for it. But as you've touched
1527800	1532280	on, God is playing this very central role. So maybe I should just say a little bit about how
1532280	1541880	that comes in. So if the world is just a world of experiences, if the cup that I'm seeing right now
1541880	1547400	just is sort of the experiences that I'm having of the cup, you very quickly run into problems,
1547400	1552360	right? For one thing, if I sort of set the cup down out of view, and there's no one else in the
1552360	1559800	room perceiving it, does the cup pop out of existence? That seems bonkers. So Barclay's
1559800	1565160	answer to this is no, it doesn't. The world around us is stable and persists in the way we think that
1565160	1571720	it does. And the answer, the solution to this is God. So at least on the caricature that of the
1571720	1577080	view that is typically presented to undergraduate students, God is always perceiving the totality
1577080	1582680	of reality. So God is experiencing the cup even when I'm not. And this actually, I think,
1582680	1587960	is important in other ways. So it's not just that God is ensuring that my cup continues to exist.
1587960	1591800	But if you think about it, there's a lot of features of the cup that I'm not aware of,
1591800	1597320	like even when I am looking at it, I'm not aware of the backside of the cup. But the cup's backside
1597320	1603560	doesn't pop in and out of existence. Why will God is experiencing it? Similarly, the molecular
1603560	1608920	structure of the cup that maybe with a high powered microscope I could perceive. But I'm not
1608920	1613800	currently. The molecular structure doesn't pop in and out of existence because God is always
1613800	1620200	experiencing it. So God is playing this really big role, which, as you've pointed out, I want to
1620200	1629320	get away from for a variety of reasons. So I sort of think of my view as kind of a neo-Barclayan
1629320	1635080	view. So it's very much in the Barclayan tradition. It's a realist view that, you know, a view that
1635080	1641640	says cups exist, they're real, rocks exist, they're real. You can't refute the view by kicking a rock.
1645720	1651000	But God is not the thing that's accounting for the stability and persistence of objects and their
1651000	1657960	properties. A different sort of view that has also been kind of resurrected recently is the
1657960	1665000	phenomenalist view. So phenomenalism is a position according to which reality is not
1665000	1671960	constructed out of experiences per se. It's constructed out of potentials for experience.
1673480	1681320	So this cup, you know, right now I'm experiencing it. I put it down and I'm not looking at it.
1681320	1687480	But nevertheless, were I to turn my head and look at the cup, I would have certain experiences.
1688280	1692360	And according to the phenomenalist, those potentials to have experience,
1692360	1698440	those maybe conditionals, those counterfactual claims, those obtain even when I'm not actually
1698440	1703800	looking at the cup. And that is what the cup is constructed out of. So this is a position that was
1703800	1712200	associated with Mill and that Mike Pelisar has recently done an admirable, remarkable job of
1712200	1720200	resurrecting and defending. So there's sort of another version of idealism, or not exactly
1720200	1726120	idealism, but view in the ballpark. We've touched a little bit on panpsychism. There are, of course,
1726120	1731160	there are a lot of views that are sort of idealists, but are very of a different kind. So there's
1731160	1736040	sort of transcendental idealist views, which have also recently been resurrected as forms
1736040	1741320	of linguistic idealism. So these are views basically where we're not giving a view about
1741320	1746840	the nature of the world around us, we're giving a view about the nature of what we can know,
1746840	1754360	and of the world as we interact with it, or maybe what it is that our words are about
1754360	1761320	in the more recent forms. So I am very much not an expert on Kant, but Kant is the person
1761320	1767240	associated with transcendental idealism, which would be this sort of idea that there is a cup,
1767240	1773640	a thing in and of itself, but that is sort of outside of the bounds of my ability to grasp.
1773640	1779640	What I grasp is something that's more akin to what a Barclay would hold that we grasp.
1781000	1788440	So yeah, so we've got a whole lot of different, but sort of interconnected web of views that are
1788440	1798840	all called idealism or idealist adjacent. Yeah, so there's like a plurality, I'm sorry,
1799400	1803160	a bit of a tongue twister there. Yeah, so there's a lot of, there's many different views there,
1803160	1807400	and a lot of them sort of coincide in certain ways, but yours differs in some other ways.
1809160	1815880	Why have you excluded God from this? Okay, good. So I guess there's two reasons.
1816680	1823400	One is just that, so I'm agnostic, and for Barclay, God is playing this really metaphysically
1823400	1828920	like heavy weight role, right? I mean, God is ensuring that the backside of my cup at every
1828920	1834120	moment continues to exist, and that, you know, that this has a molecular structure even when I'm
1834120	1840280	not looking at it under a microscope and so on. And that's, I would kind of prefer a view that's
1840280	1847640	just more theologically neutral in part because of my own agnosticism. But beyond that, I think even
1847640	1854360	if you are a theist, a committed theist, that there is value in stepping away, at least temporarily,
1854360	1861800	stepping back from God, playing the central role. Because I think that God kind of is like a black
1861880	1871160	box to us. And I think part of that's that, you know, we don't feel comfortable, I mean,
1871160	1875240	I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable just speculating about the structure of God's mind
1875240	1879400	and what it's like and how everything hangs together, right? It's something where you'd
1879400	1885560	feel sort of compelled to go and look at theology. And even then, the answer you're going to get is
1885560	1890680	probably, oh, divine mystery, we don't know, humans aren't going to presuppose about what God is like,
1890680	1896840	right? So I think if we sort of step back from talking and thinking about God, I mean, God,
1896840	1901400	you can sort of smuggle a lot into God, you can say like, ah, well, God's doing it. And then
1901400	1906200	it's sort of like, that's the end of that, right? You've shut the case, you've said God, and now
1906200	1911400	there's nothing more to say. And I really think that we want to have a more substantive view than
1911400	1917960	that. So I think that, you know, stepping back from God and just thinking about the structure
1917960	1925640	of the mind or the phenomenal unity that constitutes reality can enable us to do that,
1925640	1931080	can enable us to say something more substantive than a theistic view could. And if at the end of
1931080	1936360	the day, you have theistic inclinations and want to add some of those traditional godly attributes
1936360	1943320	back into the picture, you can do that, but with a sense as to how it all could work behind the
1943320	1950760	scenes that I think you wouldn't get otherwise. Within your agnosticism, I mean, where are you
1950760	1958920	most inclined towards? Like, are you inclined towards a sort of theistic God, a deistic God,
1958920	1965160	polytheistic God? What are you looking at? If you had to sort of posit some sort of a
1965400	1973720	some helpful Barclay, basically. Yeah, well, myself, I mean, this, this is not sort of part
1973720	1978920	of the arguments that I give, but I'm, I'm sort of agnostic between sort of atheism and a deist
1978920	1986680	God, I sort of I find, I find the cosmological argument rather persuasive. And I find, I find
1986680	1990840	a particular variant of the fine tuning argument that has to do with fine tuning,
1991080	1996520	psychophysical bridging laws kind of also quite persuasive. So,
1998600	2004600	you know, dualists and certain sorts of idealists take it that, you know, we've got our brains
2004600	2008600	and we've got conscious experiences and the relation between there's some sort of law like
2008600	2014600	relation between them, right? So when my brain is in brain state five, I'm having a reddish
2014600	2019160	phenomenal experience. Whereas the bridging laws could have been different, my inverted twin
2019160	2023640	could have been in brain state five. And if the laws were different, it could have caused a greenish
2023640	2030120	experience to be generated. And so, you know, this is a standard way that dualists think about
2030120	2036680	consciousness. But then you can ask these questions like, well, why is it that our experiences,
2036680	2043160	particularly experiences like pain, why is it that our pain experiences feel bad? You know,
2043160	2048120	couldn't the bridging laws have been different such that whenever we have tissue damage
2048680	2052040	occurring and signals being sent to our brain and this thing happening in our brain, that we
2052040	2057480	feel pleasure. But, you know, our brain, you know, causes us to pull away from it, even though we're
2057480	2064760	actually feeling pleasure. I think that that's perfectly possible. You might think, you know,
2064760	2069480	well, it's just, it was just good luck. It was just luck that the bridging laws worked out right.
2069480	2075160	I mean, you could have someone who experiences pain as we feel it, but enjoys it. I mean,
2075160	2081880	to some people, the wires. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I tend to think that if for those cases
2081880	2087960	of actual people, there's probably other functional differences within their brain beyond, beyond
2087960	2095400	this, but, but that's absolutely right. Yeah, so, but in any event, I mean, I guess, if you don't
2095400	2101320	want to posit that that's sort of just good luck and random, one way of going about explaining
2101400	2107080	that would be that God ensured that we had sensible bridging laws, that God fine-tuned the
2107080	2111400	bridging laws. And this is sort of, I mean, there's, it's a complicated argument, but
2113240	2119160	I think this sort of fine-tuning argument gets away from you can't do things like the anthropocentric
2119160	2124440	kind of response, right? So, you know, if the bridging laws were different, we would still
2124440	2130360	be aware of the bridging laws being different. So, so I'm sort of, I find those kinds of arguments
2130440	2135960	somewhat persuasive and persuasive enough to leave me as an as an agnostic, but I find the
2135960	2142120	problem of evil, the problem of suffering really just seems insurmountable to me. So,
2142120	2145480	I'm not inclined to believe in the sort of God that Barclay would posit.
2146440	2151000	It's always fascinating to know someone's spiritual slash religious beliefs, because
2151000	2153960	a lot of the times it does play a role in the way they view consciousness. I mean,
2154920	2159880	this is a very fascinating book called by John Hogan called Blind Body Problems,
2161240	2166600	where he dissects different philosophers and scientists and talks about their upbringing
2166600	2171560	and how they came to a certain view that would predispose them to have that philosophical view
2171560	2179000	in the end. So, yeah, you think your agnosticism played a role in this, in this idealist view of
2179000	2186360	the world? Ah, I would be inclined to think not, but I'm probably too close to it to be the best
2186360	2191560	arbiter. I mean, I think, you know, the sociology of philosophy, the sociology of academics is like,
2192280	2195880	I mean, it seems fascinating to me, although maybe it's just because I'm an academic and so
2195880	2200520	everybody thinks the sociology of them seems fascinating, but yeah, no, I mean, I think it's
2200520	2205800	a super cool, super cool question. I might need more distance from myself. Yeah, no, I do know
2205800	2211160	that your your husband is as an ethicist and you guys have written a lot of papers together as well.
2211880	2217560	Because this podcast is also all about reality, the nature of reality, morality. I mean, I think
2217560	2222840	it all plays a very big role. So Metaethics is a big part of what you discuss as well. How do you
2222840	2228760	think that this view sort of changes the way we should behave morally? I mean, how has it, how
2228760	2237960	can it affect us? So how, how idealism could affect us? People perceive the nature of reality in
2237960	2246200	this way, then there's no physical person. There is a mind that's possibly there are these conscious
2246200	2252040	agents, in a sense, but there is no physical person to actually go and kick if I had to.
2252600	2262280	Yeah, my answer might be somewhat disappointing. So I actually think that there's probably very
2262280	2269560	little by way of implications here. And I think part of the reason is that one thing that I'm
2269560	2277080	aiming to do with idealism is to sort of show, to show that, you know, we have our views about
2277080	2281160	what the world is like, and we get our views partly just by the way the world seems to us,
2281240	2285480	partly from science, right, from gaining, we gain knowledge all sorts of different ways.
2286520	2292440	But what I wanted to do is to see, can we, can we show that there could be a world whose nature
2292440	2299560	is an idealist world that looks just like we think our world actually is? So in a sense,
2299560	2304600	I'm sort of using the way that we think that the world is as a guide, and then trying to say, you
2304600	2309960	know, yeah, the world could be just that way as an idealist world, and that I think there are
2310440	2316680	advantages to doing so. But as a result, since I'm using what we think about our world as the guide,
2318120	2321400	I think it's going to wind up looking very much the same as we ordinarily think.
2322680	2327400	So I actually do think, you know, you said there aren't physical, there aren't physical
2327960	2333480	beings. And in a sense, that's right. But in another sense, that's, that's wrong, right? So there
2333560	2339800	are bodies that have all of these, you know, there are, I have a body and it's solid and it's
2339800	2345720	warm. And, you know, I have a brain and it's you cut my head open, it's sort of gray and squishy.
2345720	2351320	And if you look at me under an FMRI, you know, you'd see different patterns of things lighting up,
2351320	2356440	corresponding to blood flow in my brain. And all of that's true. So in a sense, in a sense,
2356440	2360440	I'm sort of maybe making a very Barkley in point. So Barkley, when people would say, you're doing
2360440	2365000	away with matter, you're doing away with, with the world that we know it. And he's like, no,
2365000	2369400	I'm doing the common sense thing, I'm giving you matter. If what you mean by matter is something
2369400	2374040	we don't know anything at all about, yeah, I'm getting rid of that. But I'm not getting rid of
2374040	2377080	bodies. I'm not getting rid of any of the properties you know about.
2378680	2384280	Okay, no, that's, that's a very good answer. I think, I think that there was, there was a,
2384280	2388520	oh yes, a part of me wanted to ask at that point, let's say, let's, let's move beyond
2389000	2393800	hurting someone or kicking someone. What happens then when someone dies? Because ideally,
2394520	2399080	at that point, this is going to become a very different place. What goes on then? What happens
2399080	2405720	when someone dies in this reality? Yeah, I mean, I suppose there's a sense in which
2407080	2412520	the idealist view that I'm developing is sort of under, under determines that. So certainly,
2413480	2421160	you know, we have a body, and it's fundamentally made up out of phenomenology. And I have a brain
2421160	2425480	that's also made up out of phenomenology, and it's going to start functioning very differently,
2425480	2430120	right, just as we ordinarily think. So, you know, blood, my part's not going to be pumping
2430120	2435000	blood, my lungs aren't going to be breathing, decay is going to eventually set in, and the body
2435000	2441560	is going to rot. All of that's going to happen within the physical world. And just the way that
2441560	2448120	we think that it does. But the idealist is giving a particular account of sort of the nature of
2448120	2454760	the things that are rotten, basically. And the nature of the decay, I guess, itself is that it's,
2454760	2461320	it's all sort of, in some sense, phenomenal, in some sense, conscious. Not that my body remains
2461320	2465720	conscious. It's not that there's a little consciousness experience in my body, but that,
2466520	2472200	you know, when you think about the bones that make up my skeleton, you know, yes, they're there,
2472200	2475720	they're made up out of whatever molecules they're made up out of, structured in the way that they're
2475720	2482920	structured. But what are those things, ultimately, like, you know, what is, you know, a physicist
2482920	2487160	could give us a mathematical equation that explains all of these things, they can tell us about the
2487160	2493400	relations between things. But what fundamentally is the intrinsic nature, what are the things that
2493400	2499880	have these properties that have these sandwich relations, I guess. So that's what the idealist
2499880	2505720	is telling us. So, you know, the body is going to wither and rot. Then there's the question of the
2505720	2510520	mind, which we haven't really talked about how the mind and the body are related on the idealist
2510520	2516760	view. And I think there's not just one view that ideals could have about this, I think idealism
2516760	2522520	is compatible with a number of different views on this. But I think probably any view that a
2522520	2526520	physicalist or a dualist, I guess maybe more dualists could have on this would be open to the
2526520	2532840	physicalist, or sorry, it would be open to the idealist. So, you know, I think it would be
2532840	2537480	compatible with an afterlife to whatever extent other views are compatible with the afterlife.
2538760	2540840	But I don't think idealism itself determines that.
2543480	2549960	It's, it's, it's, when you, when you talk about this nature of reality, this, in this ideal world,
2550280	2556040	let's talk about things like that we talk that a lot of people, let's say illusionist, for example,
2556040	2560760	that try and count, count to these arguments, we're saying, look, the truth is, is that our
2560760	2566200	perception of reality is not what we think it is. Fundamentally, the more we've been learning,
2566200	2572120	the more we've been exposing how little we know, how little we matter, and how not important we
2572120	2576520	are, for example, Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain, and you've got people taking us
2576520	2580600	out of the center of the universe slowly, we're learning that this is not really about us. And
2580600	2585640	just because we have these experience doesn't mean it should be fundamental to reality. So,
2586200	2591160	does that bring us towards some sort of a solipsistic view on how we view ourselves and
2591960	2599240	consciousness or well, mind? Yeah, there's actually a sense in which I think that idealism
2599240	2604520	of the sort that I'm interested in meshes really well with the observations that you were making.
2604520	2609880	So, you know, you talked about Darwin taking us off of the, you know, Darwin just putting us,
2609880	2615480	we're just another animal, right? And our sun isn't the center of the universe, our planet isn't the
2615480	2622520	center of, you know, the solar system, right? Now, when I talked about idealism thus far,
2622520	2626520	and I was talking about Barclay and idealism, I mean, I was giving examples of the sorts of
2626520	2633560	experiences that I have. And I was saying all of these things seem like, you know, they're telling
2633560	2642520	me something about reality, like they're a part of reality. And on the view that I defend, that is
2642520	2649160	true. So, in a sense, I am saying the thing that you're disagreeing with, namely that our experiences
2649160	2655160	are a part of reality. But I don't think that that's in any way privileged or special. So,
2655240	2663880	in a sense, I completely agree with the examples that you're giving. So, I, yes,
2663880	2669160	I have certain experiences, I look out and I see a tree and it looks green. And the greenness,
2669160	2676280	I think, seems like it's there as part of reality. And the idealist is going to say it is. But my
2676280	2681160	inverted twin, or there to be an inverted twin here would look out and would see a tree and it
2681160	2686440	would look red. There's no reason we should privilege my experiences over my inverted twins.
2686440	2693480	Redness just as well seems like it belongs as part of the world. Similarly, a bee has their
2693480	2699080	perceptions. A bee perceives maybe ultraviolet that I don't perceive. That all, just as well,
2699080	2702840	I mean, nothing privileging my experiences, the bees experiences seem like they're equally
2702840	2707960	well part of reality. The bat echo locating, its experiences equally well seem like they
2707960	2712120	count as part of reality. And you could go on and on and on and on. And all of these
2712120	2717080	experiences, none of them seem privileged or prior to any of the others. So, for the idealist
2717080	2721960	view that I'm developing, and I would be inclined to think that really on a Barclay in view as well,
2722600	2728440	all of this is part of reality. And there's not sort of a, there's not special glowing experiences
2728440	2735560	that are the real true ones. They all equally count. And if you think about it, God, Barclay's
2735560	2740920	God doesn't just perceive the world from a human point of view, right? He doesn't have a single
2740920	2744840	vantage point on the world. The idea is that you perceive the totality of the world, he perceives
2744840	2750600	the totality of the world, which is going to include vastly more than human beings are aware of.
2751800	2758200	So the idealist view, there's a lot of phenomenology and it's not, for my view,
2759160	2764440	not necessarily for all idealist views, human experiences are not privileged in a way that
2764440	2770360	they would be maybe for like John Foster, possibly. In psychiatry, there's this field
2770360	2777160	that's called phenomenological psychopathology. And there's, there are these two tools used to try
2777160	2782840	and understand schizophrenic patients. And one is called the ease and the other's called the EE,
2782840	2789480	but it's the examination of anomalous self experience and the examination of anomalous
2789560	2794040	world experience. So what happens is you look at this patient and you try and understand
2794040	2800200	while they psych out, almost becoming psychotic. So close to psychosis, they start to do all the
2800200	2803400	things you're talking about. I mean, to have these different experiences that are so diverse
2803960	2809720	from the average experience. I mean, someone starts seeing the world as being a part of it,
2809720	2814600	being part of consciousness, someone, someone might not see red the same anymore. Some of them
2814600	2820520	even don't see visual illusions that we often see. They actually see it as accurate representations.
2821640	2826760	They see the truth actually, they see more than we do in that sense. So it's intriguing to see
2826760	2833400	how different experiences do exist even among this one species that has really identical DNA.
2833400	2839640	I mean, we're all basically the same. It kind of fits with your view in a sense, if you think about
2840600	2845160	Yeah. Yeah. No. And I mean, and questions about how to deal with hallucinations and illusions
2845160	2849800	are also just like a super interesting question. And I think even within just sort of like a
2849800	2854920	neurotypical subject, I mean, you think about things like after images, right? Where you're
2854920	2861560	looking at, you know, some red light and the relevant photoreceptors become fatigued and
2861560	2866120	then you look away at a white wall and you see this green patch. Well, in a sense, you know,
2866120	2871560	what you're perceiving of the wall, on my view, like that really is a feature of the wall,
2871560	2876120	the greenness of the wall is a feature that some other, you know, some other creature with a different
2876120	2882760	sort of visual system that maybe only is capable of seeing green green light would see. And that
2882760	2889640	also is a feature that is a part of reality and that puts us in touch with reality, but in a very
2889640	2894360	different way from the way that we normally are. But I think there are challenges for the idealist
2894360	2900920	in how to make sense of these things. It's a it's a complex picture. But but yeah, I think the
2900920	2907080	idealist has the resources to deal with the complexity. The I think it's really fascinating
2907080	2914360	to see when someone really becomes when they're psych patients, where I mean, I don't mean to
2914360	2919640	use them as like tools of examples, but it's really fascinating to see when someone becomes
2919640	2924920	truly solipsistic, where they really think that once they close their eyes, nothing else exists.
2924920	2929960	And it's a it's an intriguing thing to perceive because I've witnessed it from patients. And when
2929960	2935160	you see how real that feels for the person, you can understand that that might be a real feeling.
2935160	2940200	I mean, it might be a real experience. And so it does coincide well with what you're saying. I mean,
2940200	2947160	this this could just be the way the world really is for all of us, fundamentally. But yet this
2947240	2950120	person is just fortunate enough to experience the reality of it.
2952440	2957800	Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, I guess, sorry, I've had a whole lot of thoughts as you've been talking. So
2957800	2964040	one is that I mean, there's there's an interesting question about what sorts of things for the idealist
2964040	2969560	are part of reality and what sorts of things are just parts of our minds. So the way that I think
2969560	2978600	about it, I the view that I develop is one on which reality is this vast unity of consciousness.
2978600	2984680	But it's just sort of sensory experiences that are bound together into a unity. So if you sort of think
2986440	2990200	to me, would it be okay if I sort of said a little bit about my view and how it works?
2990200	2998920	I think so, yeah, I think. Okay, so. So we had sort of Barclay's view that I gave where we
2999720	3005080	have God and God is always perceiving the totality of reality. God doesn't just see the world from a
3005080	3009960	single vantage point. He sees it from all vantage points. He sees, you know, he sees all of it.
3011240	3014680	But it seems like there's a lot about God that's not essential to
3016680	3021800	to ensuring the stability and persistence of the world as he needs to for Barclay's view.
3022360	3028920	So, you know, I think God doesn't have to be all good. God doesn't have to be all powerful.
3029000	3033320	I don't think God has to be an agent. I don't think God's beliefs are a part of what's doing the work.
3033320	3038760	What's doing the work is God's experiences, right? And God's experiences, God is not just
3038760	3044120	having, you know, a giant experience of everything that's happening that's just all disconnected
3044120	3048680	from itself. God's experiences are structured in the same way that our experiences are structured.
3048680	3054360	So when I, when I look at a tree, I don't just see greenness and leaf shape and brownness and
3054360	3060120	trunk shape all sort of scattered around. The leaf shape and the greenness are bound together.
3060120	3064840	The brownness and the trunk shape are bound together. My experience has structure
3065560	3070520	along various different dimensions. And the thought is that God's experience in order to be
3071160	3077240	a single experience of the world and in order to be coherent has to have structure too. And so
3077240	3081560	God is having the thought is for Barclay. We can sort of think of God as having this
3082200	3087320	gigantic multi-perspective experience. And that experience, that multi-perspective experience
3087320	3094040	is what's doing the work of ensuring that the world persists even when we're not perceiving it,
3094040	3104360	when we're not there. So for me, reality, just the physical world around us just is this structured
3104360	3109800	multi-perspective experience structured using the same resources that structure our own experiences.
3109800	3112440	You sort of refer to it as like a tapestry of reality.
3113160	3117400	Yeah. Yeah. So I like the analogy of a tapestry because a tapestry, you've got all these threads
3117400	3123000	that are, they're not just separate threads, like, you know, piles of little yarn everywhere, right?
3123000	3127080	There are threads, which in the case of reality are phenomenal threads, bits of,
3127080	3132440	bits of experiences. And then they're, but they're structured, they're woven together into a single
3132440	3139640	whole unit, kind of like a tapestry. But so on this view, the idea is that what makes up
3139640	3147080	reality is sensory experiences. So, you know, experiences of color and warmth and solidity
3147080	3155080	and line and smell and pitch and so on. Now, there are more to our experiences than just
3155080	3159800	sensory experiences. So I think, I'm inclined to think there's something called cognitive
3159880	3166200	phenomenology. So this is the phenomenology of thought. And I'm inclined to think that cognitive
3166200	3171320	phenomenology is not a part of the physical world itself. The cognitive phenomenology sort of comes
3171320	3178520	from our minds. And it's kind of like, like a cognitive overlay on reality. So when I'm aware
3178520	3186760	of the physical world around me of this sensory tapestry, I don't know, do you remember those
3186840	3189960	overhead transparencies? Did you have these when you were a kid in school?
3190520	3194440	Yes. The clear, the clear overhead and then they put it down and then they could like write on it
3194440	3197880	with markers and you could put another overhead transparency on top. I kind of think about
3197880	3205800	cognitive phenomenology like a, like a overhead transparency on reality. But it's coming from
3205800	3212200	our minds. So, sorry, this has taken us quite far from where you started, but you had this
3212200	3222920	really interesting point about. Well, you had, you'd raised this really interesting
3224040	3230920	case of people who wind up, you know, not just believing that they're the only person who exists,
3230920	3238440	but having this experience, this sensation as of being, you know, the only thing that's real.
3238680	3243640	And so I think, I think it's quite interesting because on this sort of view, cases like that,
3243640	3247560	there's going to be a question of, is that what kind of phenomenology is that? Is that some sort of
3247560	3255160	cognitive phenomenology? Or is that actually sensory phenomenology? And not obviously not all
3255160	3259480	sensory phenomenology is part of the physical world. I think there can be hallucinations that
3259480	3265880	are part of our mind, but not the physical world. But it is interesting because whether,
3266200	3272760	whether something is purely cognitive or whether it's sensory does wind up
3273320	3276520	playing a big role in how we think about it fitting into reality.
3278280	3283320	Along with you with, in your idealism, you also talk about naive idealism. Do you want to touch
3283320	3292360	on that as well? Sure, yeah. So this is a view about perception that I think that idealism meshes
3292440	3299320	really well with. So for the idealist, for the idealism, just as I, as I've stated it,
3299320	3304200	just as a view about the physical world and what the physical world is ultimately like.
3306360	3310680	But then there are all these other questions that that doesn't touch on. So when one question is,
3310680	3316280	it doesn't tell us about how our minds relate to our brains. So it doesn't directly answer the
3316280	3321080	mind-value problem, although it has implications for it. Another thing that it doesn't do is it
3321080	3328440	doesn't tell us anything about how it is that we, maybe our minds interact with the world,
3328440	3337560	how it is that we perceive the world around us. And I think I mentioned earlier that when I had
3338600	3343000	first come to idealism and started thinking about it, part of what led me to do that was
3343000	3349240	thinking about this view naive realism, which is this idea that what perception is essentially
3349240	3355720	is this relation between us and objects in the world. And that when we stand in this relation,
3355720	3360840	sort of the objects in the world, in some sense become a part of the experience or part of the
3360840	3367560	character of the experience. And that's something that always struck me as really, really mystifying.
3369320	3375800	And this still strikes me as completely mystifying. The basic idea behind naive idealism
3375800	3383160	is that that sort of intuitive idea of perception that naive realists want to hold on to is something
3383160	3391000	that I think we can get and we can get really intelligibly, but only if the objects in the
3391000	3399880	external world that we're related to are themselves mental or phenomenal kinds of things. So I mean,
3399880	3406440	I think it doesn't make any sense to take an apple, a material apple and sort of shove it into
3406440	3412840	a computer program. I mean, I take my T mug for anybody who sees this online and I try shoving
3412840	3420840	it at the screen. I don't therefore put my mug into the computer. It's just not the right kind
3420840	3426120	of thing to be a part of the computer or a part of a computer program. Similarly, my mug is not
3426120	3431240	the right kind of thing to become a physical material mug. I don't understand how it can
3431240	3436920	be a part of an experience. I understand how I can be related to it in different ways,
3436920	3440360	but I don't understand how it can be an elementary constituent of an experience or
3440360	3446600	the phenomenal character of my experience. By contrast, if you think about something like
3447480	3453880	maybe stepping back from thinking about perception, it's really easy to see how my
3453880	3459800	experiences just in general can be constituents of other experiences and other judgments and
3459800	3468040	things in my mind. So when I introspect and I don't know, I feel slightly hot,
3469880	3475320	I'm able to directly, my mind is able to directly apprehend the hot feeling that I have right now
3475880	3480760	and the hot feeling can actually become sort of a part of the thought. It doesn't stand at a
3480760	3484760	distance from the thought. They're both constituents of, they're both sort of mental things, right?
3484760	3490440	There's the hot feeling and then there's the thought about it and there's not a mystery as to how
3490440	3501080	the one can literally sort of subsume the other. Well, if the cup itself is a phenomenal item,
3501080	3508200	is a bit of phenomenology, the thought is that we can have the same sort of thing be true
3508200	3514040	of perception. So I actually think I might need to say a little bit about,
3516680	3522440	no, I'll just try saying it without backing up anymore. Explain yourself as much as possible
3522440	3530760	so that it's... All right, well, the idea is that when we perceive objects, our mind literally
3530760	3539800	comes to overlap with the perceived objects. So when I perceive the cup, the cup winds up,
3539800	3545480	the cup is a part of the phenomenal tapestry, it's a part of the physical world. But the idea is
3545480	3551960	that the cup also becomes unified with my mind. So, and how is it that this is possible? Well,
3551960	3557880	the cup is more phenomenology. The cup is kind of like pain. Pain can be unified with the rest
3557960	3565160	of my experiences. And similarly, the cup itself, my mind can sort of, in perception,
3565160	3570920	can sort of reach out and expand and pull the cup into it, in a sense. So, I mean, we're not
3570920	3576280	talking about physically pulling the cup into it, like in terms of a spatial relation, but the thought
3576280	3582520	is that the elements of my mind are unified with the cup in the same way that they're unified with
3582520	3588680	my pains or my warm feeling. So the cup, actually, in a sense, is part of the physical world, but
3588680	3594760	it's also a part of me. And as such, I can think about it directly. I can directly grasp and apprehend
3594760	3602280	it and know about it. And that, I think, is one of the things that idealism can get that materialism
3602280	3605960	can't get, and that I think is a really interesting advantage to the view.
3605960	3615880	Yeah. This is bringing me back to one of your papers. I think it's called dualism all the way
3615880	3622440	down. You're talking about, you talk about phenomenal judgment, you talk about self-knowledge,
3622440	3627720	and I know how critical this relationship is. What is the paradox there? I forgot
3627720	3631640	what it was called, the paradox of? The paradox of phenomenal judgment.
3631720	3637160	Yes. Explain that to me, because while reading it, a part of me was just a little bit confused.
3637160	3643800	I wanted to just understand that a little bit more. Yeah. So this is a paradox that doesn't
3643800	3648840	have to do with idealism, particularly. It's a paradox for epiphenomenalist dualism.
3650040	3657320	So the dualist takes it that there's the physical world, and then there's also
3658120	3662040	consciousness. And consciousness can't be reduced to things in the physical world,
3662040	3671000	so we need a duality. And we quickly run into this problem, if you're a dualist,
3671000	3676840	namely the problem of how consciousness and the physical stuff interact with each other.
3679000	3685000	And there are some reasons that I think I mentioned very early on for thinking that
3685000	3690280	they actually can't. That maybe the physical stuff can generate consciousness,
3690280	3694360	but we should think that consciousness can't actually affect the physical world.
3695800	3700600	Why not? Well, it seems like every physical event can be entirely explained in terms of
3700600	3705080	earlier physical events, or at least every physical event that has a cause or something like that.
3707160	3713880	So that's one reason. I mean, conservation of energy also is going to potentially play into this.
3715160	3720120	So that might push you towards a version of dualism called epiphenomenalism,
3720120	3726600	which is the view basically that every physical event, everything happening in my brain,
3726600	3729720	everything happening in my body, can be explained entirely in terms of earlier
3729720	3733400	things happening in my brain, my body, the physical world around me.
3734840	3739800	So I can completely explain all of this without needing to posit consciousness.
3740760	3745400	But there also is consciousness, and consciousness is not just physical.
3746680	3753560	So when I take a pencil and I stab myself and the signal is sent to my brain and my brain does,
3753560	3759960	it's whatever it does, then there's also, I say, ah, and I pull away from the pencil,
3760600	3766040	but I also have an experience of pain. And the experience of pain itself doesn't cause me to
3766120	3771800	do anything. The experience of pain doesn't affect anything in the world. We could get rid of it,
3771800	3776120	and I would still, though, I would still pull away from it. So that's the epiphenomenalist
3776120	3781880	position. And it's a position that seems deeply counterintuitive to many people,
3783960	3792040	because you think, isn't it obvious that when I go and I order, I order a cup of tea,
3792680	3796360	that I ordered tea because I was thirsty and wanted caffeine, right? I mean,
3796360	3801240	isn't that what could be more obvious than that? And for the epiphenomenalist, that's just not the
3801240	3805640	case, right? You ordered the cup of tea. Why? Well, because your brain was sending certain
3805640	3808680	signals down to your body, which caused blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3810440	3814760	But you also do feel thirst. Now, why does the epiphenomenalist hold this? Well, because the
3814760	3820520	epiphenomenalist is convinced by the, you know, first that we have conscious experiences that
3820520	3827560	nothing could be more obvious than that, because we feel them. And second, that physicalism can't
3827560	3833800	account for these conscious experiences. Yeah. So we pause at the experiences because we know
3833800	3837640	that there are experiences, not because we think we need them to do causal work.
3840040	3846040	But then you run into this problem, the problem of the paradox of phenomenal judgments.
3846520	3850680	Sorry, I realized how it took us, of course, there, but it's fine.
3852920	3860120	Sorry. Well, we're here now, I guess. So the paradox of phenomenal judgments is basically
3860120	3865720	this idea that, you know, there are these experiences, the experiences don't come down
3865720	3874040	and sort of affect my brain. So how is it that I could possibly know about these experiences
3874040	3883720	if they're not actually doing any causal work? And so this paper is attempting to respond to this,
3884520	3890840	to this, and to give an account of how it is that a dualist, an epiphenomenalist dualist could accept
3890840	3895400	that you actually can know about your experiences, even if they're epiphenomenal.
3896600	3902440	And actually, it sort of made sense that you thought of this in the earlier response that I
3902440	3909720	was giving, I think, because the response that I give there appeals to the idea that the experiences
3909720	3918440	themselves, while they're not a part of my brain, they are a part of my mind, and they are embedded
3918440	3924280	in a sense in the judgments, which are also mental things. So there's this conscious judgment that has,
3924280	3932040	as a constituent, the pain itself or the phenomenal redness itself. And what I'm aware of
3932040	3937640	is the conscious judgment and the thing that I'm judging. And both of those things are generated
3937640	3944520	by my mind. But the awareness sort of isn't happening in my physical brain, the awareness
3944520	3949000	is all stuff that's being generated by my brain and is all happening sort of at the conscious
3949000	3957560	mental level, in a sense. Helen, who do you, which philosophers or philosophical views do you think
3957560	3961160	challenge your nature of reality the most?
3970600	3976440	It's interesting to see how we perceive our, the people who say no to our theories.
3977640	3983000	Yeah, well, I mean, who gives the best examples of why this, this wouldn't be true.
3983720	3989560	Yeah, it's a little hard. It's a little, I'm sort of paused for a little bit, in part, because
3990440	3995960	I'm not, I think maybe the task that I've set myself in a sense is easier than the task that
3995960	3999720	I think a lot of idealists have set themselves, in that I'm not trying to argue that you have to
3999720	4004840	be an idealist. I'm just trying to argue that idealism is possible, as opposed to that it's
4005560	4009480	necessarily true. I'm trying to argue first that it's possible and second that it's
4009560	4015480	more likely than you might have thought. So it's harder to give a knockdown argument of that
4015480	4021000	than it would be to give a knockdown argument of this is necessarily the way that reality is.
4023160	4026680	So, I mean, if you wanted to argue that it's not even possible,
4029080	4032120	sounds like a very strange, it seems like a very hard task to set yourself to argue that's not
4032120	4036840	possible. I think the biggest pretty much possible, I think that's why this is, I mean, it's because
4036840	4042600	no one can do that. Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest challenges to idealism come from the
4042600	4050120	incredible complexity of idealism. That's not necessarily a view as just a straight up problem
4050120	4055320	that the idealist has to reckon with. So, I mean, like I was telling you, when you were pointing
4055320	4059720	out that, you know, well, look, we're not at the top of the, you know, maybe we're at the top of
4059720	4063400	the food chain, but we're not at the top of like, in the sense, we're not has some privileged,
4063400	4068760	glowing place in reality, right? And I was like, yeah, but I don't think our experiences have
4068760	4073480	a privileged, glowing place in reality. There's, you know, the tapestry of reality is this, you
4073480	4079560	know, incredibly complex, rich thing that includes far more than us and our experiences aren't in
4079560	4087480	any way special. But once you accept and embrace that, you see that reality for an idealist is
4087480	4092760	incredibly complicated. I mean, you know, you think, well, my experiences are part of reality.
4092840	4097480	The experiences that an inverted twin would have, they're part of reality, the experiences a bat
4097480	4100440	would have, the experiences the bee would have, the experiences the snake would have,
4100440	4104520	the experiences the Martian would have. I mean, once you get to that, you're like,
4104520	4109400	is there any limit to all the experiences that are bound up as part of reality? Or is
4109400	4115320	reality sort of infinitely complex? And I think there are ways for the idealists to
4115320	4121400	stave off the idea that it's infinitely complex. But it does wind up being incredibly complex,
4121400	4126360	whereas, you know, a materialist can come at the idealist and say, look, we just think there's
4126360	4133640	this little simple particle, and it just has one simple little nature to it. And it, you know,
4133640	4140440	combines with other particles that are similarly simple and minimalistic. And the diversity of
4140440	4145320	experiences is just something that happens when you have different perceivers who actually are
4145320	4150840	perceiving things. But those aren't extra parts of reality, and they don't exist unless they're
4150840	4156920	actually is a bee or a bat or a person in the room. So I think that that's really the biggest
4156920	4163000	challenge for idealism just is the the profligacy of it, I guess, the idea that that it has all
4163000	4169320	this richness built into reality. Are there any specific idealists or people who believe
4169320	4175640	that ideally that the fundamental fundamental nature of reality is mined? Any specific philosophers
4175720	4181880	or scientists today that you think are providing this view with a lot of backing and like support
4181880	4190440	in a very effective manner? Yeah. You're just going to see my own ignorance and how at the
4190440	4197240	extent to which I'm in my own mind here. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of there are a lot of
4197240	4203960	different people playing with a lot of very different but related views. I'm most
4204920	4208520	views are very different from each other. They're from what I've gathered so far.
4208520	4213160	Right, right. So I mean, I'm more familiar with the philosophical side of things, although I'd
4213160	4217880	love to learn from you about people in other disciplines who are doing relevant related work.
4218760	4225320	So I mean, I think there's a lot of work in panpsychism to sort of had a bit of a rise
4225880	4229640	before idealism has so it's sort of more well known and has had more development of it.
4230600	4235800	But I know Noam Chomsky had been referencing Galen Strausson who is, as he says, quite brilliant
4236520	4244520	and excellent and Philip Goff had a march. So there have been a lot of panpsychists recently
4244520	4248200	who've been sort of developing and trying to refine and hone those views. They're quite
4248200	4255320	different views, I think, from the view that I'm interested in. I really admire the work of Mike
4255400	4262280	Pelisar, who's a phenomenalist, again, a very different sort of view. But he's done just a
4262280	4269480	remarkable job of trying to show that phenomenalism, which is a view that I think a lot of people had
4269480	4275960	decided was dead and buried, actually has a lot more going for it than you might think. And he's
4275960	4281160	somebody who also you're asking about views that pose challenges to idealism. He's somebody that
4281160	4287000	does do that, that actually directly takes and says, look, phenomenalism trumps idealism and
4287000	4299800	gives a really kind of clever argument to that effect. So Pelisar argues that we, he sort of
4299800	4306600	imagines a world that has one sort of intrinsic nature, maybe it's a materialist world. And then
4306600	4312280	overnight, while we're sleeping, the nature of the world changes. And now it's a Barclayan world.
4312280	4316200	And then overnight, it changes again. Now it's a panpsychist world. Then overnight,
4316200	4324680	it changes again. And we're all living in the matrix. But of course, throughout all of this,
4324680	4330120	there is no change whatsoever to anything that we observe. The world seems, from our
4330120	4334680	perspective, exactly the same. And then you imagine that at the end of all of this,
4335640	4341560	the newspapers reveal nature of reality constantly shifting. Now, what would the newspapers say?
4341560	4347480	Would they say that the world ceased to exist? In every night, the world is ceased to exist?
4348040	4354680	No, they wouldn't say that. They'd completely ignore it. Or they'd be like, weird fact.
4356040	4361240	So the lesson that Pelisar draws from this is that what's essential to being our world,
4361240	4365080	the world that we care about, is the thing that all of these things have in common,
4365080	4369320	namely the potentials for experiences that we're having throughout all of these.
4370760	4380680	And so it's not, even if our world ultimately has a Barclayan god that is at the base of it,
4380680	4384840	that's not really what's essential to being our world. What's really essential is the potentials
4384840	4390840	for experience. So this is something that Pelisar has argued against all the other views,
4390920	4393080	which I think is a fun and clever argument.
4395080	4401720	Red argument. Yeah. I think the idealist can resist it. Whereas I think the other people
4401720	4407800	can't resist it, which is I think kind of cool. But it would be very difficult to tell the difference
4407800	4414280	if it did change constantly. Yeah. Yeah. This is very several philosophical questions indeed.
4415000	4419480	Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, I think, you know, the way that an idealist potentially
4419480	4426600	could resist it is, you know, if you imagine that the world has been, imagine an idealist world.
4426600	4432040	And as I said, as I said a little bit ago when we were talking about naive idealism,
4432040	4439720	about the theory of perception that I propose, for the idealist, we're directly in contact
4439720	4446760	with reality, right? We directly grasp the world around us. So a way that I like to put it is that
4447080	4453560	so Dave Chalmers has this paper where he talks about like perception and the fall from Eden,
4453560	4459160	where he imagined this perceptual Eden. And in perceptual Eden, you know, the world, the world
4459160	4465560	was just as it seemed, right? The world seems like it includes, here we go. I've got a green dinosaur
4465560	4470760	I'm holding up. The world seems like it includes, you know, phenomenal greenness there as a part
4470760	4477560	of it. Greenness is a primitive element of reality. And it seems like I directly apprehend
4477560	4484440	this greenness when I look at the green dinosaur that I'm holding up. And then, you know, Chalmers
4484440	4489400	says, look, we think these things. And then we do some science and we realize, no, greenness
4489400	4493960	isn't out there in the world. There's just a surface reflectance property that the dinosaur has
4493960	4498040	certain wavelengths of light bounce off of it. My brain does certain things and I have an experience
4498040	4505160	as a result. But there's no like green property out there in the world. And, you know, similarly,
4505160	4509880	we maybe think that we directly apprehend, you know, properties in the world that we directly
4509880	4515160	grasp them. And then we learn that no, actually, we only grasp them in this very indirect way,
4516040	4523080	through this long complicated causal chain of, you know, physics. Now, if idealism is right,
4523800	4531960	we actually do live in Eden, right? If idealism is right, the world around us is precisely the
4531960	4539480	world that it seems. Greenness, warmth, you know, all of these things are actually part of reality.
4540760	4545400	And furthermore, they're part of reality that we directly apprehend. We don't stand at a distance
4545400	4550520	from them and just sort of, you know, get them indirectly and then have some experience that
4550520	4556360	our brain generates, right? We really are in touch with reality. So I think if that's right,
4556360	4560360	and if we imagine that we live in an idealist world, you know, that's the world that we've
4560360	4564200	always grown up in. And then, you know, at midnight last night, it turns out that
4564760	4569320	the nature of reality changed. And now we all live in a materialist world.
4571080	4576200	I actually do think, whoa, wait a minute, we went from having a world that is just the way
4576200	4582440	that it seems, that has greenness as part of it, that I directly apprehend to a world that I'm only
4582440	4586840	indirectly in touch with, and I, you know, just sort of stand at a distance from, and there's no
4586840	4593400	greenness or warmth in the world. That's a big cost. And yeah, I do think, you know, maybe that,
4593400	4599400	maybe we would say the world that we knew is gone. So I think, I think the idealist has
4599400	4603080	some resources to respond, but I still think it's a very, a very clever argument.
4603080	4610200	But ideally, ideally, if everything is fundamentally matter or mind,
4610200	4615880	there shouldn't necessarily be a change in our perception when the thing does change
4615880	4622680	from material to mind. I mean, it shouldn't actually still feel the same way, except we
4622680	4628680	haven't learned the science, perhaps in this new materialistic world that provides us with
4628760	4633960	knowledge now, that that's not true. You probably would still experience it as
4636440	4641720	Yeah, it would still seem the same way to us. But in a sense, something very different would
4641720	4647240	be going on. So it would be kind of, you know, like, like, you know, I could have, I know this is
4647240	4651720	just a philosopher's imagination of hallucinations, that we don't actually have hallucinations that
4651720	4657640	are qualitatively indistinguishable from from this, this world. But, you know, you could,
4657640	4662200	we can imagine that I could have a hallucination of talking to you right now on a computer that
4662200	4670360	would be exactly from the inside feel exactly the same way. But without there being any reality
4670360	4677640	outside of my mind. So I think we can't necessarily read off from the way that things would seem
4677640	4686600	from the inside to, to, to the sorts of questions about like, whether we're truly perceiving things
4686680	4695080	and how we're related to things. Is there anything surrounding your, your view on idealism that you
4695080	4699320	that you've always wanted to argue or say or talk about that you've been holding in and you just
4699320	4706360	really wanted to get out there? I think I think that would be the best time. Oh, gosh. I mean,
4706360	4709960	something you've always felt misunderstood by I mean, have people ever come to you and said like,
4710840	4714120	do you think, why do you think that the world is all mine? Like, have people come to you with
4714120	4719480	some basic arguments that you've always felt? Let me clarify and clear this up right now.
4720600	4727960	Yeah. I mean, definitely idealism is extremely misunderstood. I mean, I guess there's a,
4727960	4733400	I guess the two things that jump out are, which are things that I've said before, but, but that
4733400	4741080	still, I think maybe bear, bear forcefully repeating. So the first is just that idealism is
4741080	4745320	not at least a sort of idealist view that I am defending and that people like Barkley are
4745320	4752600	defending. It's not an anti-realist view. It's a, it's not a theory according to which there is no
4752600	4758840	world, there is no physical reality. It's a view about the nature of the world and the nature of
4758840	4763880	that physical reality. So, you know, you've got the, you remember who it was? Do you remember who
4763880	4768600	it was who was trying to refute Barkley by kicking the stone and saying, I refute you thus? I think
4768600	4780760	it was. Not Locke. Anyway, is a famous, famous, famous, ridiculous, ridiculous. No, it was
4780760	4785400	not humor. No, no, no, no, no, it wasn't, it wasn't a super famous philosopher. It was,
4786360	4792920	yeah, some, some, oh, I kind of know what you're talking about now. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, and it,
4793960	4797000	I mean, it's just such a ridiculous misunderstanding of the view, right? Because
4797880	4801480	the view precisely is one where there are rocks and it's trying to give an account of what the
4801480	4806120	rocks are. So, I mean, Barkley. What rocks are, that's the problem is that we don't really know
4806120	4813480	what rocks are. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so, I mean, kicking a rock doesn't help anyone. No, it doesn't.
4818200	4822440	But so I think that's why I like to, to sort of think about Idealism and to present it to people
4822440	4828520	who are physicalists with that sort of analogy to how reductive physicalists think about the mind.
4829080	4834040	You know, look, you're not denying, you at least don't think that you're denying that there is such
4834040	4838120	a thing as consciousness. You're trying to give an account of what it is and analysis of it. And
4838120	4842440	similarly, I'm not trying to deny that there are rocks. I'm trying to give an analysis of
4842440	4847560	what their nature is. So that's, that's one thing. I mean, I think the other thing is that I think
4847560	4852680	when people hear you talking about idealism and hear you defending idealism, it's always
4852680	4857800	naturally assumed that you are an idealist and that you think that the world is an idealist world.
4857800	4864280	And I'm actually engaged in a project that's, as I said, a little bit maybe sneakier than that
4864280	4871000	and harder to argue against, which is just the project of arguing that, you know, there could be
4871000	4878200	a world that is just as our world seems to us, that has a particular sort of nature and idealist
4878200	4884920	nature. And then second, looking at, you know, suppose that we take a world that seems just as
4884920	4889480	our world does, it's an idealist world, and suppose we take a world that seems just as our world does,
4890040	4893640	that's a materialist world, I think that there are both sorts of, I think both sorts of things are
4893640	4900680	possible. And, you know, take each of these possibilities and look at the complete total
4900680	4905640	worldview that's on offer from both sides. So not just what it says about the metaphysics,
4905640	4910600	but what it says about the mind-body problem, what it says about the nature of perception.
4911640	4918520	And then, you know, take those total packages and see which one of these looks more plausible and
4918520	4923480	has more theoretical virtues. And that's the project that I'm engaged in. It's the project of
4923480	4929000	not arguing that you can't accept a certain view, but of arguing you can accept this view.
4929000	4934440	And furthermore, when we compare the total packages, it actually looks much better than you would have
4934440	4938840	thought and perhaps better than the materialist view. Yeah, you're trying to ensure that people
4938840	4944600	apply as an important level of credence to this view as opposed to perhaps a materialistic view,
4944600	4950120	because ideally when people think about it, they automatically shun it down as if it's completely
4950200	4955000	absurd. But when you hear certain people's arguments, it means clear that this is a
4955000	4961320	possibility. This is because for people, when I started this, if I was, let's say, 10 years ago,
4961320	4967960	20 years ago, I would be completely materialist. I'd be physicalist all the way down. And even
4967960	4974040	though my intuitions are very much physicalist, I still don't, I know how much we don't know,
4974040	4980760	the unknown unknowns. So it's almost impossible to have that Gnosticism regarding reality. I think
4980760	4986600	Raymond Talis, I often bring it up, he says he's ontologically agnostic, but epistemologically,
4986600	4993320	he knows most of us are wrong. I mean, I love that, because that's so true. That's exactly why
4993320	4997720	I have this podcast. I mean, it's an opportunity for someone to bring up a view just like this.
4997720	5002760	I mean, to have that opportunity to discuss it. Helen, I mean, if we had to close off,
5002760	5007160	they've here to think of five philosophers, your favorite five philosophers, I know it's
5007160	5012120	difficult. It's like picking a mad rush mode of like, big people, who would those be? Because I
5012120	5016840	feel like when people read your work, get to know who you are, they're going to want to know who are
5016840	5023640	the people they should read that inspire you and make you the philosophy today. Okay, well, I would
5023640	5028280	definitely say, Dave Chalmers, who I know you've had previous guests, at least one,
5028600	5034200	sip me some not so favorable things about. So I'll just give a plug for Dave.
5036120	5038520	Hopefully, I have Dave on soon at some point. So it's fine.
5038520	5046040	Oh, fantastic. Well, everybody will enjoy his podcast. So actually, another person who you've
5046040	5052760	already had on whose work I just absolutely love is Eric Schwitzkabel, who I think, I mean,
5052760	5059400	just both in terms of defending views that might seem bonkers, but then giving really
5059400	5063960	interesting creative arguments for them that are incredibly fun. I mean, anybody who has
5063960	5069400	the opportunity to read any of his his work, I mean, everything he writes is just really fun to
5069400	5075080	read. Eric is very underrated. I enjoy his work very much. Yeah. And actually, my husband had asked
5075080	5081480	me who I thought the whatever the best philosopher of mind in the world besides Chalmers was. And
5081480	5087560	I was like, ah, you know, and he's like, well, who would you who would you whose work would you
5087560	5092040	be most excited about reading if you heard some new paper come out? And the tricky thing with that
5092040	5096040	is that, you know, in general, it's the kind of people who work in the on the stuff that I work
5096040	5100680	on. But I did realize that of all the people who don't do directly the stuff that I work on,
5100680	5104040	hands down, it's Eric Schwitzkabel, because anything he writes is going to be brilliant.
5105560	5109720	I mean, he's got some fascinating topics like the philosophy of science fiction. I mean,
5109720	5116280	he goes into some very intriguing domain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, yeah, he's got a book on
5116280	5121640	the perplexities of consciousness that's very fun and accessible, arguing you have no clue what's
5121640	5127880	going on in your own mind. And I think a paper if United States, sorry, if materialism is true,
5127880	5132120	the United States is probably conscious that involves these incredible fantastical science
5132200	5143320	fiction examples to try to make this case. Yeah. But so I guess I've also mentioned Mike Pellisar,
5143320	5148840	if anybody's interested in sort of similar like idealist adjacent things, I think he's also a
5148840	5155640	very good and underrated philosopher. Oh, I don't know how's your name? Catty Balog is somebody
5155640	5165000	who's a physicalist, a, an opistory or a physicalist, who I think is a really also very underrated,
5165000	5170840	very subtle, interesting, interesting philosopher. Not sure if I've given it five.
5170840	5174920	Historical philosophers, some of the. Yeah, shout outs to Barkley and Locke.
5177000	5183240	I had a feeling those two names would come up. No, Helen, I mean, it's been an absolute pleasure
5183240	5187480	chatting to you. This has been such a fascinating conversation. I mean, even listening to you,
5187480	5191320	it reminds me of the conversation I've had with Eric. I can tell you that type of person who
5191320	5195640	is very intrigued by a lot of these ontological questions, the metaphysical side of things.
5195640	5200920	And it's really great to have people like you out there challenging and pioneering these,
5200920	5207000	these arguments and these views, because ideally there's, then we just get stuck in our own world.
5207640	5215320	Yeah. Yeah, no, I mean, I think in a sense, it is, it is, it's very much a creative,
5215320	5222600	a sort of a creative world building, almost endeavor that, but I hope is thought provoking
5222600	5225160	in the way that you described. So it's very nice to hear you say that.
5225160	5229400	I think without you, this tapestry would not exist. I mean, we all have to sort of give up.
5229400	5233960	Oh, no, which indicates that my view is wrong if you're right, but
5234920	5240200	we all have to sort of give our views and sort of get into that argument and just have a great
5240200	5243720	time doing it. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me on. This has been a pleasure.
5244840	5248840	Thanks so much, Helen. I really appreciate your time and I look forward to reading more of your work.
5249640	5255640	Super.
