0	2720	So it's a weird world we live in. It's a strange universe.
2720	8400	I call ourselves a conscious conglomerate of cells assembled by atoms, manufactured by molecules
8400	12640	designed by DNA, forged by fusion via stellar supernovae.
12640	17760	I mean, this is a crazy story, but every night you have to go to a tribal council to sacrifice
17760	23920	and legitimately think about who you would kill, who you would you be willing to actively kill
23920	28720	a tribal council. It's like basically sitting in heaven looking at all the people you killed
28720	33360	and then asking them for forgiveness and then to still give you a million dollars or a million
33360	37680	rent. It did spark a memory for me, though. I've only actually shared this with two other people
37680	42000	in my life, so this is opening up a bit. If you think that there's somebody else or something
42000	47600	else controlling it, it is very eye-opening. I remember feeling so free. That day when I
47600	51920	left the temple, I remember just thinking, this is the most free of ever felt amount,
51920	57760	just pure ecstasy of freedom. Any decision I make from here on out is my own decision.
58320	62800	And I will bear the responsibility, whether it's praise or blame,
62800	68720	I take it. It's ultimately my fault. There's no one to blame for this. There's no one to praise for
68720	75600	this except, and I think it's quite a freeing and yet terrifying. Possibly, I can't call it a
75600	80320	quarter-life crisis or whatever, but it's a very young life crisis. Dr. Tevin Naidu is a medical
80320	85200	doctor, philosopher and ethicist, born in South Africa of Indian descent. He attained his bachelor
85200	89520	of medicine and bachelor of surgery degree from Stellenbosch University and his master of philosophy
89520	95120	degree cum laude from the University of Pretoria. His academic work focuses on theories of consciousness,
95120	100400	computational psychiatry, phenomenological, psychopathology, value space, practice, moral
100400	105600	luck, addiction, and the philosophy and ethics of science, mind, and mental health. He has a
105600	110480	television background as the host of two popular South African shows as a castaway on Survivor
110480	115040	South Africa. He is currently the host of the Mind, Body, Solution podcast. Tevin, thank you so much
115040	119280	for coming on. Thank you so much for having me. It's an absolute honor to be here. Thanks for that
119280	124480	wonderful introduction. I mean, you did it yourself, my friend. That's your background.
125200	128240	We got it together quite well. They make me sound better than I think I.
129360	133600	I've done a lot of research. I'm a big fan of your channel. Yeah, I mean, I've loved it. I
133600	138480	discovered it a little over a month ago, I think, and I've, I mean, over half of your episodes I've
138480	144400	listened to and I plan to just absorb the whole library soon. I'd love to start off kind of early
144400	150240	because one of the one of the really core pieces of content was actually someone else's interview
150240	157920	of you, Dr. Tony Nader's interview with you, which I loved. And one piece that really piqued my interest
158800	165200	was when you're talking about how early you started questioning things, asking the big questions,
165200	171280	metaphysics, etc. And you said this around the age of nine or so, I believe you said. And I love
171280	176000	if you could just give us some context around that and what that was like. Yeah, no, I mean, it's,
176000	182000	it's, it's such a strange world. I think it's, I mean, I was just discussing this with my girlfriend
182000	188160	and one of my friends today. The universe is such an intriguing place. There's so much going on.
189760	193440	I mean, someone always comes to mind is Charles Darwin. I think about the years he spent on the
193440	200240	Galapagos Islands just traveling and inflicting views with his own theory and his religious beliefs
200240	203840	and how he spent so many years trying to convince himself, not others, but himself,
204720	212240	that what he believed religiously just did not correspond to the data. And for me, when I was
212240	217200	a kid growing up in South Africa, it's very, very multicultural, very diverse. We've got 11 official
217200	222160	languages. There are so many different cultures and backgrounds. And I mean, people often say
222160	226720	Cape Town, when you're in Cape Town, you feel like you're in the rest of the world is, is just
226720	233440	so many different people all coming together. And me personally, part of my family, very much
233440	239040	Muslim, traditional Indians, the other half in the traditional Indians, then you've also got
239040	244720	Christian, traditional Indians, but still South African at heart. So I consider myself more South
244720	250720	African than I do in India, because we've been here for around seven, eight generations. Oh,
250720	256800	wow. Westport is endangered laborers by Brits. And then at some point, obviously,
256800	263520	off post-apartheid sort of built their way up and made their way into society. But so the cultural
263520	268240	dynamic is very intriguing at that point, because I have my Muslim best friends and cousins on the
268240	273040	one side of my Christians, best friends and cousins on the one side of my Tamil, Hindu, everybody is
273040	278800	all just integrating so well. And none of the ideas corresponded. And I found that very frustrating.
279120	284800	I felt that when I went to school, when I read books, when I went to science, for example, class,
286160	290240	was always some sort of a consistency with the story. And if something did change, which it often
290240	297200	does, science consistently replaces older science with new data sciences. These stories sort of
297200	302480	set in stone. And I didn't like that. I didn't like the fact that whatever the person said was
302480	307200	the gospel of the truth. I felt that, I mean, channels call the truth. I felt like if I had to
307200	312960	look for radicality and truth, this is probably not where I'm going to look, because I had this
312960	319360	bad tendency of asking questions and I would often get kicked out of temple while I get kicked out of
319360	326480	the mosque. So when that happens, you start to question, I mean, is this really the story you
326480	331280	want to be told? Are you being told the story or taught the story? What's the difference? And
332080	340400	at that point, I stopped. I became completely atheist. I was nine. I remember I left the
340400	344160	temple. I remember being so frustrated at that point, I actually became quite anti-theist. I
344160	349440	became very much anti-religion. I remember being so irritated by this whole story,
349440	354640	like that people are so convinced by these ideas. And as the time went by, I became a lot more
355600	361760	conservative with that view. I'm no longer anti-religion, anti-theist. I think everyone's
361760	366880	entitled to their own views. I respect them all. I think that at the time it was more my own
368480	374000	hatred towards the person who spoke to down to me at the time that caused this almost
374880	382240	neo-Atheistic view. You know, the sort of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens,
382320	387760	type of Sam Harris annual dinner type of hatred. And that's slowly changed. I mean, I have huge
387760	395840	respect for Christian scholars, theologians, and even gurus, priests alike. I mean, to me,
395840	400800	it's changed over time. It's an interesting dynamic. It started when I was nine, which was very
400800	406000	young because many of my friends thought I was crazy. Of course. Yeah, that's so young to be
406000	411760	questioning. You must have been a curious kid. Do you remember, was it a gradual thing?
412240	418720	Was there a moment in time where something snapped? I think it was always brewing. I think my dad
419920	425040	always told me to watch Discovery Channel, National Geographic. I mean, he forced me to
425040	430240	sort of watch this when I'm watching Cartoon Network. He changed the channel. That's good.
432000	435280	In hindsight, I mean, at the time, I obviously didn't like it. But when I look back, I think,
435280	440000	I mean, those are the stepping stones. Sort of those curiosity builders that started asking
440000	444480	the deeper questions within because often growing up, I wanted to be an astrophysicist and
445280	450960	I've always wanted to be an astrophysicist. I remember just getting 100% for mathematics
450960	455280	every year, all the time, just thinking it's going to happen. And then as you get older,
455280	459040	you make the more conservative choice. And at the time for me, it was to look after my family,
459040	468720	my peers, and Indian cultures. I mean, becoming a doctor is sort of pretty much an expectation.
468800	473680	And I think I sort of fell into the trap. But very great. I enjoy it. I love it very much.
474800	478560	I went for the conservative choice, but astrophysics in space, just trying to understand
478560	484640	the nature of this universe. It's an incredibly complex system. How does it all function? What
484640	488800	is the purpose of all of this? What is the meaning behind all of this? I think it intrigues a lot
488800	493760	of people. And I think religion does provide people with those, it provides us with those answers.
493760	499120	But for me, it wasn't enough. I wanted to find out for myself. And that's what sort of stirred me
499120	504560	towards that. My parents were never that religious anyway. They were very cultural. We often celebrated
504560	511840	Diwali or the Hindu festivals. We went to prayers. I still go to many of them. But yeah,
511840	518000	they never really ingrained the religious doctrine within. So they often allowed me to do whatever
518000	524480	I wanted. When I was nine, I told them I'm done. They were fine. It was like wow. That was just like
527040	534400	my goodness. That's so cool. Well, it did spark a memory for me though. If I may, I know I'm
534400	539600	interviewing you, but if I may share something, I've only actually shared this with two other
539600	545440	people in my life. So this is opening up a bit. It's not like crazy big, but I remember because
545440	549360	you said around nine and I was around eight or nine years old. I remember I was definitely in
549360	554560	the third grade. So whenever that's around them. And I remember the moment when
557200	562400	I was in my childhood bedroom, a lit bedroom, I was looking through the doorway into the hallway
562400	570720	that was dark. And all of a sudden it was like something changed. It's like the top down control
570720	577040	became apparent. If that makes any sense. I didn't know the word agency at the time, but
578000	586800	it was like oh, I have control over this. It wasn't solely the ether of my childhood, let's say.
587920	592080	But it was like a moment. And from then on, I remember going to school the next day and being
592080	599520	like oh my goodness. Everything just clicked at a critical time. It gives you that power,
599600	603600	that sort of autonomy you've been looking for. Waiting for the autonomy. I mean,
603600	608320	everybody just craves it. Everybody wants it, but he really gets it. If you think that there's
608320	613280	somebody else or something else controlling it, it is very eye-opening. I remember feeling so free.
614320	618960	That day when I left the temple, I remember just thinking this is the most free I've ever felt
618960	627200	about. Just pure ecstasy of freedom. Any decision I make from here on out is my own decision.
627680	634640	And I will bear the responsibility, whether it's praise or blame, I take it. It's ultimately
634640	639360	my fault. There's no one to blame for this. There's no one to praise for this. Except me.
640240	645440	And I think it's quite a freeing and yet terrifying. Possibly, I can't call it a
645440	648800	quarter-life crisis or whatever, but it's a very young life crisis.
648800	653040	A one-tenth life, a one-twentieth life crisis. Hope you live to go into it a long time.
653760	657280	Huh, that's so interesting. So then from there, the progression,
659200	664160	you said astrophysics was a big passion of yours. You got through high school,
664160	668080	you obviously, I'm assuming you were a great student, you know, never causing any trouble in
668080	673280	the classroom. It's on top, and then I had archaeology as one of the others. Oh, interesting.
673280	678880	Qing is one of the others. What was the other one? Teaching, just general teaching. Most likely
678880	685360	mathematics or physics. Oh, wow. Very cool. I mean, archaeology, I mean, I loved it so much.
687120	689760	I speak very highly. I mean, Darwin's one of my favorite scientists of all time.
691200	696080	Just going back, I mean, Stephen Jay Gould, when I think about the work they did back in the day,
696080	700640	I mean, it's some of the best things I've seen. Absolutely. It's incredible.
700640	705440	Cool. So that's a good point. I was very much in the sciences, very, very science-oriented.
706320	710000	And then as you get older, you start becoming more philosophical. You're scientific.
710720	715600	Start to question those as well. So at nine-year-old, then she had to change when he turned 19,
716240	722720	now 29. I'm currently 29, but over time, things have changed every sort of decade or so.
723680	727360	Sure. And what made, like, when did you decide you wanted to become a doctor?
729600	732720	It was always one of the choices. It was something I've always loved. But the main reason,
732720	738880	a lot of people find this completely absurd and ridiculous is I was watching House and I love House.
738880	741360	Yeah, great show. I remember I watched it as a kid, too. Yeah, sure.
742240	746640	Probably my favorite series of all time, because I've watched it so many times.
748320	752960	There's eight seasons. I've watched all of them back to front, possibly like around eight times.
753760	754960	And I know it's a lot of...
755920	757200	Holy shit.
757200	758960	It was before mid-school days.
758960	761600	Yeah, yeah, a lot of time. A lot more time back then.
763440	766480	I sort of made the excuse in mid-school that this is me studying.
768480	769040	As if.
770320	773680	Always, whenever someone asks, it's always Lupus. It's always the first.
775760	778480	Lupus or Sacoidosis, the other one.
778480	780400	Oh, Sacoidosis. I forgot that. Yeah, okay.
780800	785200	Those are the... So I was watching House. I remember my mom running down the stairs when I was at home.
785200	788640	And I was like, you got in for mid-school. And at the time I'm watching House,
790480	794320	I look at the TV and I look at her and I just think, and I just say, let's go. Let's just do it.
795360	799360	It was one of those... There's both the moment thoughts where I just didn't even think about astrophysics.
799360	801840	I didn't think about anything else. I just... Let's just do it.
802400	805440	And when I got to mid-school, I realized it's nothing like House.
808000	809600	Very different. Yes.
810400	813200	And how would you describe your experience in mid-school?
814080	821600	Super difficult. School was very well. I got to mid-school. And I think this is where cultural
821600	827440	dynamics in South Africa play a big role because when from a school where school had a majority,
827440	833200	800 black students, in South Africa, we refer to mixed-race people as colored. And this is
833200	837760	not politically incorrect within this country. So we refer to mixed-race people as colored.
837760	843520	So there were about 800 blacks, 200 colors, about 200 Indian people, no white people at all.
843520	848880	And then I went from that school to Stellenbosch University, which is a majority Afrikaans white
848880	855440	university. It was a complete cultural shock for something I never anticipated. I mean,
855440	860080	I did Afrikaans as a language in high school and primary school, but always sort of learned it
860080	863280	with a pitch of salt, like thinking I'd never use this. It's not going to be something I'm going
863280	868720	to be using. And I get to Stellenbosch where it kept on 75% of the population speak Afrikaans
868720	873600	and I was completely shocked. I couldn't believe it. And this is the first language. So it was very
873600	879840	surprising. I immediately felt homesick. Just when into sort of a depression, I would say very
879840	886240	dark. I would go to lectures to fall asleep and go home and self-study because I just couldn't,
886240	889520	they were speaking Afrikaans. I couldn't understand what they were saying. What they were
889520	894320	saying, I couldn't understand the lecture. So I just, it was very, very difficult. But over time,
894320	898880	you get used to it. It's not that bad. You start to fall in love with it slowly. Trauma starts to
898880	904800	become like a, it's almost like a toxic relationship. You hate it, but you love it. You keep going back.
904800	908640	So I kept going back. He's got better. I slowly fell in love with it.
909520	915840	Cool. But it was difficult, I'm sure. And then you, I mean, you can imagine yourself being in a
915840	921200	war-drowned and guys just talking to you in a different language, sort of talking down to you
921200	926720	as well, because he sort of assumes I don't understand the language. And then you don't
926720	933280	realize he's asking you the question he's asking. And this is you in a war-drowned,
933280	937920	academic war-drowned for Marx. You're getting graded on this. And then you put a mark because
937920	943440	you just don't really know. It was very, very frustrating. I sort of built up a little bit
943440	950000	of anger within me. I remember not wanting to learn Afrikaans just to spite them. But I learned
950000	955040	it eventually anyway. Yeah, you had to. You had to. I had to pass. I had to figure this
955040	963760	word thing out. But Africa is so politically complex. You can imagine, I mean, 11 official
963760	967920	languages. Afrikaans is one of them. English is one of them. That means there's, I and other
968000	973040	official languages left. I used to speak Zulu quite a lot back when I was a kid.
974560	980800	And then in Cape Town we have what's known as Isikosa. So there's so many different languages.
982880	988400	Difficult to learn them all. Sure, yeah. You have to just cover what you can and move forward
988400	995280	from there. So you could with some of them. Yeah, right. Yeah, gesture and get by that way.
995760	1000160	You get sort of the vernacular, you get the gist of it. And you can get through a conversation.
1000160	1008400	Sure, sure. So you're in med school. And how did you get into this television media space?
1008400	1013440	Like what was, what was that path? This is my first time actually, just by the way,
1013440	1017040	because it's just doing an interview where I'm integrating all these lives together.
1017040	1022400	Because I've either done specifically television stuff, and then I've either done academic medical
1022400	1026240	or mind body solution content. It's kind of intriguing to have this discussion. It's my
1026240	1033440	first time. So for me, it was, I was in high school, I remember. I think I was about six foot
1033440	1040960	one at a time, height. And I met this model agent who told me I should try and just do some modeling
1040960	1046160	to earn some extra cash. And obviously, I didn't grow up in a very rich area. It wasn't very wealthy.
1046160	1053120	And I thought, this is a great way to make money. And it was. Awesome. Great.
1054720	1063600	And then at some point, I entered this into the state of South Africa. I was, I think about 17.
1065200	1069760	The agent said, enter the competition, do this, you might win it. You do go on to bigger things.
1070640	1073120	And I did. And then I ended up winning it. And I went on to
1073360	1078240	then host a television show in South Africa. And it's one of South Africa's most popular
1078240	1082640	Asian lifestyle television shows. So millions of views every week. And I was fortunate enough,
1082640	1087760	it's called Eastern Mosaic. They contacted me because they saw me when they saw the competition,
1087760	1093360	which is pretty cool. And asked me to join team and I did. And at that point, I think
1093360	1099680	was 17 when I won the competition, 18 sorry, when I won. And when I won it, and then afterwards,
1099760	1103520	I went on to TV show and I was in my first to second year of med school.
1104080	1107200	So around then I've been living, I've started living this double life. It's like
1108080	1113280	entering two different realms. I mean, you mentioned in your emails, Joseph Campbell,
1114480	1117680	I mean, a hero's journey type of thing, you know, that call to adventure. This is,
1117680	1120960	this was it, you know, because I really started this medical journey. And
1121920	1124640	then I got approached by this other world that was completely different.
1125040	1129840	Yeah. For a guy who's homesick, really irritated with the way things are going and not really
1129840	1136880	happy with where he is. This was like a blessing. This is completely, this was fun to travel. I got
1136880	1141680	to teach because I wanted to be a teacher this whole time. So presenting to me became this platform
1141680	1146880	where I could teach people, speak to an audience. And I think I really enjoyed that. And I loved
1146880	1151120	lecturing. I loved giving talks. So it was, it was pretty cool because it got to then
1151120	1156400	use a lot of these hobbies to get to sort of something that made money and help pay med school
1156400	1162160	fees and help do a lot of things for my own lifestyle in general. And then at that point,
1162160	1166160	the show was doing very well. We ended up getting another show and it all just rippled from there.
1166160	1169440	I mean, I kept doing TV shows, but then I was sort of living this double life.
1170960	1176640	And it started becoming a little difficult. I mean, I'd go from a 36 hour shift at the hospital
1176640	1181360	and then I have to film an entire event the next day, the television show. And so I'd be
1181360	1186800	exhausted. I remember I liked it. It was completely dark and like sunk and I'd look
1186800	1191280	tired all the time. So it was like a chronic fatigue. I loved it. It was too exciting to stop.
1191280	1198480	It was almost like being on drugs. I love this energy that you just keep wanting to get addicted
1198480	1204800	to the dope bike. And and back then I had a lot of social media. I was using, I was actively
1204800	1210720	engaging with the community. So that constant feedback started really feeding the ego, I would
1210720	1216400	say. And I mean, I enjoyed it at the time. But then at some point I decided there's got to be a
1216400	1224240	limit. I have to either continue with one or continue with the other. And I chose the medical
1224240	1231040	and science background. How did you make that choice? It was difficult. I mean, I always would
1231040	1236640	have. It was it was never and it was never me actually thinking of giving that. But it was more
1236640	1246160	that you get tired of the, I don't want to son, you get tired of it. So it's almost like a fake
1246160	1251440	world. It's kind of like a curated world that you start getting a bit but frustrated. You're
1251440	1256400	tired of the fact that everybody has this facade. They're not showing the true colors. They're not
1256400	1262720	being themselves. Whereas in medicine, people are being, lack of better terms, I'm assholes to you.
1264880	1270640	Which was nailing you, just telling you how bad you are at this thing. No filter, absolutely no
1270640	1276080	concern of whether he hurts me or not. And and I found that a little bit better for somebody.
1276080	1282000	Felt like I'd rather know exactly where I stand with you versus going into this big event with
1282000	1286560	everyone just being fake the whole time, pretending like they love you, pretending like
1286560	1291920	they care constantly in this environment. You don't really know how to read people. You,
1291920	1296320	for someone who loves psychology, philosophy, you want to know how people are thinking. You want
1296320	1300880	to know why they think a certain way. I mean, in this act, it's sort of like it's constantly
1300880	1307040	acting. And I didn't really like it. And then the politically correct, started growing over time.
1308000	1312080	I had my own views on that. And I, it's, it's sort of becoming too much. I felt that
1312960	1316720	being, being online, not being able to speak your mind, not being able to talk and openly
1316720	1320400	and have discourse, which is the main reason why I started MindBodySolution was
1320400	1324560	having a platform to provide a lot of these people, have theories they're afraid to actually
1324560	1331360	share sometimes, because of the repercussions. So I was always a fan of having that freedom of
1331360	1336000	speech, trying to be able to say what you want to say, and without offending people with intent.
1336000	1343440	I mean, context is always important. Content is not relevant without considering the context it's in.
1344480	1349920	If you, if you just take content for what it is, that's, that just doesn't work. Someone can say
1349920	1354320	something. It can mean a completely different thing in a different contextual situation. So
1354320	1361040	I found that very, very frustrating about the television slash online world where context
1361040	1368720	is completely eliminated and possibly eradicated on the scenario. And yeah, it became easier at
1368720	1373520	that point. Had it not become that way, I think I might have stayed longer. But the more I watched
1373520	1380800	the way it started to go that route, I decided to take a step back. I put my mouth too much. So I
1380800	1387440	think context is very important. Sure. And it's funny because this is part of the reason why these
1387440	1391520	long form discussions I think are so popular and has become, have become popular in less,
1391520	1397520	you know, 10 years or so, is that we get the time to have the whole, the context is,
1398880	1404640	you know, it's built in there. And on TV, it's like, give me your sound bite, give me 30 seconds,
1405280	1410720	make it quick, because we got a mistake. What's that? I missed it. Like a 10 second clip of
1410720	1419040	making a mistake and just wait a lot more to say they stopped it just not a fan of that.
1422320	1426960	Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I agree. I think it is. I'm personally, I'm just getting into it. You know,
1426960	1433120	this is sort of the beginning of a new chapter for my channel. I want to do some more long form
1433120	1441360	stuff like this. And because I think it's fascinating. Oh, thank you. Oh, geez, stop.
1442080	1448640	Flatir really got you very far. So I appreciate that. I mean, you are, but I mean, I can tell
1448640	1453120	one of the things that comes through on your channel, which I will get to in a little bit,
1453120	1459200	because I think I'll be the main focus of the discussion, is how polished you are. I mean,
1459200	1464240	how clearly, how clearly you have your what, five, six years of TV experience? I mean,
1464800	1471440	yeah, but more than that, I think like, yeah, about, I started in 2012 or so, and I ended in around
1472560	1478720	18, 19. And what I did, but then I did, obviously, I mean, as you know, Survivor and the other shows.
1478720	1486080	Oh, yeah. Different reasons and different circumstances around that. Well, since you brought
1486160	1494080	it up, let's talk some Survivor. Survivor, one of my favorites. If not house, it's going to be Survivor.
1494960	1498800	Yeah, if you have to choose, your on a deserted island, which one do you go with?
1502480	1506080	I think I'll go with, if I'm on a deserted island, I think I'll go with Survivor at that point.
1506880	1510640	So I would say the same thing, but then you're also, you're in this vicious loop where you're
1510640	1514320	on an island watching a show about an island. You might want to escape from that.
1514320	1518000	Especially if I'm watching a season where I'm on, because then it's going to feel very much like
1518000	1524720	inception. Oh, absolutely. Were you on two seasons or one season? Two. So we recently just,
1525440	1530640	this year, had our first South African return season. So it was pretty much an all-star season.
1530640	1534560	And that was very, very cool. Went home too soon again.
1536640	1541840	Yeah, that is so cool. And what made you apply for Survivor? Or did they reach out to you?
1541840	1547360	Did they see you? Like, how did that work? So no, no, no. So I love Survivor. I've been a fan
1548080	1552560	since I was probably around nine as well. I mean, I think there's one climate in 2000.
1554160	1559120	Oh, yes. The original one. Richard Hatch, that season? Yes. I think it was 2000 or 2001,
1560320	1566480	which meant I was around seven, actually, seven or eight. And I started watching from then. And
1566480	1571280	it's a family show. My mom loves it. My sister loves it. We've been watching it as a family
1571280	1577120	since then. And I often save, I used to save seasons, come in a different city to watch it when
1577120	1583440	I get back. I download and get back to the other city to watch it with them. And I've been a fan
1583440	1589120	for such a long time. I love the psychosocial behavioral dynamics of it all. For me, it's very
1589120	1595680	much a biopsychosocial game. Medicine, we focus on a biopsychosocial model. It's extended itself to
1595680	1601760	biopsychosocial spiritual, biopsychosocial cultural. But when you think of Survivor, it's not just
1603040	1607840	a television show to me. To me, it's more for pretty much what Jeff Probst says. It's a social
1607840	1613600	experiment, except I think it's a lot more complex than I think. I think there's a lot of dynamics
1613600	1619920	behind the game that they can dictate how people behave in real life and how people perceive themselves
1619920	1625840	within the game dictates a lot about what they don't know they're doing real life. Because
1626720	1633040	people have this image of almost when you enter this game, it's not reality. You're almost taken
1633040	1638480	away from reality because they build this box where you can behave a certain way based on the rules
1638480	1644720	that they've set out. This box just so happens to be within the real world that you've always been
1644720	1650000	apart of. So you can never really escape reality. So a lot of people who have this perception that
1650000	1654240	when you leave the real world and enter Survivor, you can be an asshole, you can be a dick, you can
1654240	1659680	be these people. I don't think that's true. I think the way you behave, yes, if you want to play a
1659680	1664960	character, entertainment purposes, very enough, I'm all about that. I did that my first season.
1664960	1672080	Very mischievous, very much the naughty guy trying to put people against each other. The second time
1672080	1677760	I played, I was a lot more mature. I was a bit four years older. But then I wanted to play more
1677760	1682080	like the doctor that I am. And it comes across on the show. You see myself in the first season,
1682080	1689120	very naughty. She was lying, making up stories. And I went through this intention. I told them,
1689120	1693360	like, listen, I come from a television background. I'm here because I love the show and I want to
1693360	1697760	make the show better. Mangle here is not just about me. It's about less make South African
1697760	1703200	Survivor as cool as it can be. At this point, Survivor had just finished season five, and season
1703200	1708720	six got taken over by a new production company called Afrocons. And this production company is
1708720	1714960	filled with massive fans, just huge, like big Survivor fans. One of the producers, he's like
1714960	1720160	one of the, he's got a tattoo of the Survivor staff on his arm. His name is LB. One of the
1720160	1724960	biggest fans out there. So I got onto the show at the right time because this group of people
1724960	1730320	decided to make it just like the US version. And it became one of the best seasons internationally.
1730320	1735040	I mean, at some point, people didn't know of international ranking. And it comes out second,
1735040	1739920	season six of South Africa. So it's Philippine. I think one of the US seasons was first and
1740800	1744880	second was Survivor South Africa Philippines. And then thereafter is an Australian season.
1745520	1750560	I can't remember which US season it was. But yeah, at the time, it was because of how good
1750640	1757680	the production crew managed to edit the show and make it so realistic. It stayed true to everyone's
1757680	1764160	characters. It gave enough content, of context, which is also quite cool. Not just those snippets
1764160	1770160	to create characters. We sort of had the freedom to make our own characters. And nobody comes there
1770160	1774960	to act. Nobody's there. It's not scripted. It's not an act. It's not a play. We do everything's
1774960	1780880	legit. So the big thing is, is though, if you want to play a character as a fan, we'll do it.
1781520	1787600	So if I if I love Richard Hatch, for example, I'm more likely to then play a little bit villainous
1787600	1793680	and I'll be a little bit more than someone else. It's quite a fascinating scenario.
1794560	1798960	Absolutely. What was it? I mean, what was the most surprising thing about it? What
1799760	1804960	what didn't you expect or what was when you actually got there? You know, day one,
1805840	1811440	everyone must just be here on the moon or it's just a panoply of emotions. But what was different
1811440	1816160	about the experience? What surprised you, I guess? I mean, just for some context, I mean,
1816160	1820400	I don't think I answered your question. When I saw that Survivor South Africa season six,
1820400	1824160	because this has been years in our sense, he's in fine. We haven't heard about it for a while.
1824160	1828560	So then they announced that season six happening. And the day before the auditions were finished,
1829200	1833920	one of my best friends at the time, she sent me a message to say that survivors happening again
1833920	1838720	and how much you love it. Don't you want to enter? But I just finished a 26 hour shift at the hospital
1839280	1844720	and I sent a video of myself in scrubs. I think it quickly got home. I made a quick
1844720	1848880	recording on my cell phone just saying, listen, I love this game. I'm going to be a villain.
1849440	1854160	Just point blank. I'm going to be a villain. It's hell of a background. I'm going to entertain
1854160	1858000	and just lie sheets, steal, do whatever it takes to make sure the audience
1858000	1861840	and the tribe mates are eating out of the palm of my hands. I had this whole thing prepped.
1864320	1869440	It worked. They called me back and they said, okay, they knew that I was from television,
1869440	1872960	obviously, but they actually asked me, am I going to come as the television presenter?
1872960	1878720	Or am I going to come as Dr. Naidu? And I said, I'm coming as Dr. Naidu. So let's forget about
1878720	1882400	the fact that I've ever done anything on television, coming as someone who has a background in
1883280	1889600	psychology, neuroscience, medicine, and I'm going to play mind games. This was my character. I was
1889600	1894880	a really curated character. And so you get to Philippines, fast forward a couple months later,
1894880	1901680	and you have to isolate in a room for about 10 days. It's so crazy. You start losing
1901680	1905760	a bit of yourself during that period. Why do you isolate? What do you mean, like before the game
1905760	1912160	starts? Yeah, yeah. And this is pre-COVID as well. So it's a good way to get everyone onto the
1912720	1917440	same country without seeing each other. So you get one contention at a time, because you might,
1917440	1921280	because especially in a place like South Africa, let's say you're in Durban or Cape Town, you might
1921280	1926240	know the person who comes across at the airport. So you'd rather avoid that scenario. Let's let them
1926240	1932560	go through one to many and not allow them to actually leave the hotel room. So you have to stay
1932560	1938960	inside. It's horrible. That's probably one of the worst experiences. Have you ever watched
1938960	1946880	Mindfield with his name? He's a YouTuber. He's got this show called Vsauce, Michael.
1947920	1952720	Yes, it's been a while, but yeah, yeah, of course. He's got this YouTube show called Mindfield,
1952720	1957360	where he sits in a room for about, in a black room with nothing to do for about 10 days. I can't
1957360	1963440	remember exactly. But that's what it felt like. You're stuck in this room. No clocks, no watches,
1963600	1969600	cell phones, nothing. So no, my room specifically had no window as well, because it was covered by
1969600	1974480	some sort of a dark alley that had a roof over it. So I couldn't tell whether it was night or day.
1975600	1981120	I had no inkling of what time it was ever. The only thing that can be sort of on track was each
1981120	1987840	time a meal came to me. And it messed me up. I remember getting off because I had all these
1987840	1992080	notes for all the cool things I was going to do on the island. And day one, I completely
1992080	1998640	forgot about it all. I went there just, I hadn't slept for like three days before coming onto the
1998640	2006000	game. And I think it was seven days. I spent seven days in the hotel, not 10, but seven days of just
2006000	2011440	not knowing what time it is, not knowing what's going on. It's quite rough. Weird. Weird setup for...
2012880	2016240	It gets to you. And I think in the second time, because of COVID, it was another, it was just
2016240	2020080	the same. You had to stay in the hotel room. At least it was light. There was sunlight in this
2020080	2025520	hotel room. So much better experience. But still, it gets to you because you then play
2025520	2031200	the game within your head too much. And you can be your own worst enemy, especially in a game like
2031200	2036320	Survival, where you're completely paranoid all the time. You don't trust anyone. You really don't
2036320	2041760	know what to expect. You get out there and you realize that they're all doing the same thing
2041760	2046960	you're trying to do, which is lie to you. And you realize you're not that good at it. You think
2046960	2052560	you are. You think you are. Yeah, right. But you're not that good at it. Because you're a good
2052560	2057680	guy. You're not doing that in the real, you're not getting practice in your real life. You know.
2057680	2062160	I'm going, they're trying to put on a show. That's what the second time I tried to be a bit more
2062160	2066960	like myself, which then became bad thing anyway, because then I got to seeing this guy who's in
2066960	2072000	charge of the truck, who look up to me, people are constantly asking me for advice, who want to
2072000	2077200	know what to do. And then you get labeled with a different label, which is he's winning material,
2077200	2085200	someone who's going to possibly with it. It's a crazy, it's a, it's a wonderful, I agree. It's
2085200	2091760	a wonderful game. I think I mentioned to you in our correspondence before that it's funny because
2091760	2097520	I might not be here. We might be having this conversation unless I applied for a survivor
2097520	2101680	like five years ago. And I got, I got to the final stages. I did the whole thing, you know,
2101680	2105360	you're in the hotel room, you can't talk to the other contestants there, but you know,
2105360	2109760	there, everyone else is around, you know, you know who the people are. And I mean,
2109760	2113360	it's a while, it is for a week, you know, you're, you're, it's, yeah, it's kind of messing with
2113360	2119600	your head. And I did a bunch of crazy stuff. I would show up to breakfast and a robe and a crazy
2119600	2124880	outfit and stuff like that. And just like trying to create attention for myself, you know, trying
2124880	2132640	to create like some intrigue around me. And I get to the interviews with like the casting person
2132640	2138560	and Jeff Probst, you know, which is like, whoa, holy shit, it's Jeff. And they'd be like, hey,
2138560	2142320	everyone's talking about you, you know, you're causing a stir. Like, and I was like, yeah,
2143040	2149040	I was like, that's what I will do on the show. Put me on and I will do, I will do stuff, you know,
2149120	2155200	to be interesting. But yeah, and I had, oh my God, I was so into it. I like had,
2155200	2159680	I have an 80 page Google doc of like survivor strategies, you know, all this stuff to do.
2160320	2164000	I completely agree. I did the same thing. I had this huge with a whole bunch of notes.
2168000	2171840	I also put on like, because I was thinking, I went into it and
2173600	2178640	at the end of the whole process, I thought to myself, that's the best I could possibly do.
2178640	2183120	I was like, I have no, I left it all in the field, you know, I was like, that's all I got.
2183120	2188640	And I thought I did, I did as good as I could. And so I was like, the turnaround between when
2188640	2193680	they tell you you're going to go on and when you go is a month, I don't know, it's quick. So I,
2193680	2198640	my thought process was like, okay, you're going to lose a lot of weight when you're on the island.
2198640	2203920	But you don't want to, you don't want to like, eat a ton. You don't want to put on like,
2203920	2207520	10 pounds right before you go. Because your body is used to that. So when you're
2208080	2214000	fasting, it's going to be way worse. So I thought, what I'll do is I'll put on like 20 pounds a few
2214000	2220240	months before, get my body accustomed to that weight, and then fast as I approach the date.
2220800	2223120	But I didn't get it. So I just put on a bunch of weight.
2225120	2229440	That's, that's almost exactly what happened to me. Because when I, I first, I remember for the
2229440	2236560	second time, I got so ripped. I exercise and train every day and got covered. Then I got the flu.
2237120	2243360	Then I got covered again. So I ended up eating and just laying in bed for the next two months
2243360	2248720	before I got into survival. And all I remember seeing on TV was me just with this huge tummy
2248720	2254800	to all unfit. And I thought like, I was, I was hoping I'd be a bit more fit for this tribe.
2255600	2257600	Luckily, I was still manageable.
2258160	2260480	Whatever. I mean, you can always frame it. What's funny is,
2262720	2267040	if you are the ripped guy, then you have like, you know, a target sort of, you know, survivor,
2267040	2271760	you know, challenge threat or whatever. So you can always kind of work it in a way.
2271760	2275920	That's exactly what I did. I used it to my advantage. I was like, they aren't all more ripped guys,
2276880	2277360	let's go.
2279360	2286080	And it's so interesting too, like the, I love it for like the game, the game theory behind it,
2286080	2290080	you know, all this kind of stuff. But what it always, what it ends up coming down to, it's,
2290960	2297520	you know, the emotional, you know, you're at the mercy of the jury at the end. And their decisions
2297520	2302800	are, in my opinion, from what I've seen, it's like 95% emotional, you know, did they like you
2302800	2306400	or not? You know, it's what it always comes down to.
2306400	2311120	It's so difficult to remove your emotions from the game. In fact, that plays the biggest role.
2311120	2315680	You're correct. You're 100% right. Because I remember when, when I got voted out, when I got
2315680	2319040	home, I thought to myself, the person, like one of the people who voted me out, I thought I'd
2319040	2324560	never vote for that person. Even though I knew that person was playing the best game. Wow.
2325760	2330640	When I thought about it, I was that person, I was that guy who always said, I'd never do that.
2330640	2337280	I would never allow my emotional judgment to hurt the rational thinking behind my
2337280	2343520	mind. And it happened. That's how strong the game gets you. You're broken down to core. Literally
2343520	2352720	just dirty, hungry, tired, burnt, scarred, bruised, bleeding, starving. There's no food,
2352720	2357280	you're losing weight at a rapid pace. The first time I lost eight kilograms in 18 days.
2358000	2364400	And that's too much weight so fast. It's not healthy. Sure. It's absurd. But I still remember
2364400	2369120	thinking when I often, one of the things I said when I interviewed for, when I tried to audition
2369120	2374160	for the game was think of survivor as real life and actually think about it philosophically.
2374800	2380560	You are placed in the scenario where you're forced to lie, cheat, steal, whatever, make an
2380560	2386960	environment, create a social structure, try and create society. And thereafter, think of it as
2387040	2391920	a tribe, because we are a tribe. And every night you have to go to a tribal council to sacrifice
2392480	2398240	person. So think of it that way and legitimately think about who you would kill, who you would
2398240	2404720	be willing to actively kill. Tribal council that way. Really give that some thought because that's
2404720	2409360	primarily what's happening every night. We're actively going to kill someone. So you have to,
2409360	2413440	so I even approach a lot of people that next, the second time I played with this argument,
2413440	2418960	I was like, if you are willing to kill me versus this person, really, that's what you're doing at
2418960	2424480	this point. Really give it some thought philosophically. Take the game for its core meaning. Because I
2424480	2430800	know when, I think it was Mark Burnett, who took over from Charlie Parsons, author rights. Charlie
2430800	2436480	Parsons was a Brit, I think is Brit. And he started off with this shot. I think it was in Sweden,
2436480	2440240	of Switzerland, where he got this bunch of guys together and he put them on this island and he
2440240	2444080	sort of realized that this has potential to be something intriguing. Because fundamentally,
2444080	2450400	that's the core of the game. It's this whole psychosocial element where you have to get people to
2450400	2457040	forgive you for putting them on the other side. And that's so difficult. Unless you're a really,
2457040	2461680	really nice person, you're never going to get forgiveness. It's going to be ancient.
2463280	2469360	Wow. I haven't heard these kinds of framings before around, or maybe it's been a while,
2469520	2476000	around your sacrifice, human sacrifice. And then at the end, you're asking for forgiveness from
2476000	2481200	the tribe. It's like basically sitting in heaven, looking at all the people you killed,
2482320	2487600	and then asking them for forgiveness. And then to still give you a million dollars or a million
2487600	2497920	rent. Sure. It's amazing. Crazy stuff. I mean, I was crazy talking about this. I just seem like
2497920	2503760	the psychophilosopher. No, it's cool. It was way too hard and it was too much for some.
2504960	2507360	Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so interesting.
2508560	2513360	Dance of overthinking. Yeah, that can happen. Yeah, pretty easily. I feel like we could talk
2513360	2519440	about Survivor for a long time. But let's, I mean, there's a lot that we could talk about there,
2519440	2522240	but I'm sure that you have lots of like little stories and stuff like that. But
2522960	2528320	I'd love to get about another time. Yeah, yeah. No, I'd be very interested for sure.
2530000	2536000	So Survivor happens. You're coming out of that. You decide. And I think you may mention even on
2536000	2540240	an interview that you had to like turn down a position to do Survivor even get to like.
2540240	2548240	Yeah, I mean, was that my second time on I got accepted to do a specialist program
2548720	2555360	or microbiology at the time? Because this was in COVID was at its ripe. It was super ripe.
2556480	2560000	Everybody was talking about microorganisms. I was like, this is fascinating. Let me read
2560000	2563840	more about it. I was doing lectures. I was in the military at the time working for the
2563840	2569440	military. And I remember just going out giving public lectures on virology, microbiology,
2569440	2574960	just discussing how organisms work, how COVID's nothing more than just a virus,
2574960	2579120	just like every other virus. In fact, I just read a Lancet paper just today
2580160	2585440	that shows that September 2022, which is now, well, we're in October, but last month.
2586880	2592000	The most common respiratory viruses in South Africa have been rhinovirus, adenovirus,
2592720	2596720	and influenza virus was third. The COVID's not even in the top 10 at the moment.
2598240	2601680	I was trying to give this lecture to put some context into the situation because a lot of people
2601680	2607440	get very, very hyped when they hear something new. Novelty really creates chaos. And that's
2607440	2614160	exactly what happened with COVID. We really lost the idea that there are other viruses out there,
2614160	2619600	or high blood pressure and diabetes still exist. You can't sit at home and hide from the world and
2619600	2626640	then eat a bunch of cakes for the rest of your life. There are other killers out there. My
2626640	2630640	lectures were focused on that. And then I wanted to do microbiology, but then got this second
2630640	2638400	opportunity. I'll take survival. Sure. Yeah. When you're that big a fan, it's an easy choice.
2638400	2645520	A lot of doctors literally despise me. So not okay. Yeah. Who cares about that?
2650160	2654160	Yeah, right, right. Survivors only got, I mean, but if they came back to you now, would you do it
2654160	2661120	again? Yeah, 100 days. Are you just always in? Third time's the charm. I think. Yeah, right.
2661840	2664000	Third time's the one. I have to just play my card.
2665040	2671120	If we get a bit wiser, I need some wisdom. Wisdom helps. It's always useful. And then
2671120	2675440	at that point I came back and, well, it was often my first time on SurvivorWay, I started to
2676160	2680320	think about maybe starting a podcast. And I think that's where the journey started to take.
2681040	2687760	Okay. How'd that start? Yeah, I mean, I was in Otsun, which is a small town outside of Cape Town.
2687760	2693120	So it's about five hours away from Cape Town in South Africa. And I was doing my master's degree
2693120	2698080	at the time. And I started doing it in philosophy and ethics of mental health. And this took me
2698080	2705440	into a hugely different domain. As a doctor who's focused primarily on physical sciences, biology,
2705520	2711120	chemistry. When you do a philosophical degree and you write dissertations and you try and actively
2711120	2715280	argue certain points, you start to really realize how flawed a lot of your thinking was
2716480	2720080	while studying the topic you were studying. And that's exactly what happened to me,
2720080	2725280	because I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I wanted to be perhaps a neurologist or a psychiatrist. And
2726160	2730480	when I started this degree, I started to listen to the arguments or the counter-arguments of
2730480	2736480	physicalist theories or how we just make the assumption that the brain is merely a correlation
2736480	2739760	of this, I mean, the mind, sorry, is merely a correlation of this part of the brain. And I
2739760	2745920	started to really dissect this philosophically within the degree. Still very much physicalist at
2745920	2752880	heart, even currently. But I remember really thinking about it, thinking, right, I mean,
2752880	2758240	we can't just make these assumptions and assume it's correct. We can't, we barely know anything
2758240	2762800	about physics. I mean, we'll discuss metaphysical things. I'm sure I'm sure we're going to discuss
2762800	2767040	at this point. But when you think about the metaphysical reality and the fact that 99
2767040	2771200	points, whatever percent of the universe is dark matter, and we can't really even tell you what
2771200	2776800	that is, you have to really question your physicalist view. You can't make the assumption that the
2776800	2782720	physical reality is verticality or vertical truth. When you're asking yourself what is the truth
2782720	2787280	of your podcast and your YouTube channel, I mean, what is the truth? When you look, I mean,
2787280	2790160	when I look at you right now, I'm seeing photons of light hitting my retina,
2791520	2795760	trying to getting transduced, I mean, converting processing information, and then I'm getting
2795760	2801200	that back. That's not even happening right now. So when we think of temporality, we think this is
2801200	2806480	that right now. That's not this time that takes for the light to come by. It takes time to get
2807280	2812240	cortex, come back, get processed, memories come back in, flood in the last time I chatted to you.
2813200	2819200	And then I bring up this sort of vision of you. And that takes a long time.
2820000	2827280	Joshua Bach talks about that temporality and the ontology of reality is very blurry.
2828960	2837760	I call myself epistemologically, I call myself ontologically agnostic, but epistemologically,
2838400	2841200	I can tell you that certain things I know to not be true.
2843440	2849200	So if I had to say, one of the things would be, when it comes to my views on religion or God,
2849200	2854160	I'm ontologically agnostic regarding the origins of the universe, what's out there,
2854160	2859120	and what could be. I don't know fundamentally. I can tell you what I don't think is there.
2859120	2863600	I don't think that there's a man in the sky. I don't think that somebody can
2864160	2868720	tell you what to do, tweak it here or there. I actually don't even think that
2868720	2873360	deistic views are possibly true. You're always going to fall into that
2874720	2881920	infinite regress of who made the deist, who made that, and just keep going and going.
2881920	2885680	I think it's so much more complicated. I think that whatever the truth actually is,
2886320	2891280	is not something we're ever going to be able to understand. I don't think we have,
2891840	2900400	and I find it very, very arrogant that a lot of us think that we will gain access to this knowledge.
2902160	2906400	I think that the truth is not something to ever see.
2908240	2911120	You think the truth is something we'll never see, we'll never experience, you think?
2911120	2915920	Yeah, we'll never really, I mean, we barely experience reality. If you think of the optical
2915920	2920960	window on Earth, it's called the optical window because it's all we can actually see. It's all that
2921040	2926400	electromagnetic radiation that the light passes through, and it's all from ultraviolet to infrared.
2927280	2931280	We don't get anything more than that, anything less than that, and then some species can see
2931280	2937120	the ultraviolet rays, for example birds, and some can see infrared like snakes. We see everything
2937120	2945920	in between. We'll never see gamma rays. We never, ever see radio waves. I mean, they're always here,
2946880	2954240	but we don't see it. We see almost nothing, but we do experience something.
2955600	2961120	Why is that, and what is the case? That's primarily the reason for my podcast is
2962000	2969760	my views changed so much over the last five to ten years regarding my own beliefs. I was very much
2970720	2976320	a physicalist, hardcore materialist, not materialist in the sense that I like to buy fancy things,
2976320	2981200	in case anyone's watching this. The philosophical sphere, I mean, I'm not
2981200	2985600	materialist in the sense that I don't think everything's material. I mean, I thought everything
2985600	2990640	was material, sorry, and that the physical world was the objective reality and the
2990640	2996480	objective truth, but that changed completely. It slowly became very much emergentist. I thought,
2996560	3002640	okay, consciousness probably merges over time, and with my body solution, the podcast that I have,
3003440	3010400	the goal was to see if that's true at the time, and during that period, while doing my mental,
3010400	3015600	my master's in philosophy and ethics of mental health, I slowly became an illusionist. I started
3015600	3020880	to really question whether we really see reality for what it is, and illusionism became very
3020960	3027360	convincing, and that's Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, Michael Graziano, Joshua Bach. They're
3027360	3033600	very much illusionists at heart, and I found myself very convinced on the argument to be
3033600	3038640	very convincing. Galen Strossen calls it one of the stupid, one of the most idiotic or stupid
3038640	3045360	theories he's ever had in his life. No phrasing, but Galen's, I mean, I'm scheduled to chat to
3045360	3049440	Galen at some point. I mean, he's very, very prominent in the philosophy of my sphere, and
3050400	3056480	I mean, he's a mysterious, I mean, and I think at this point, I'm closer to that. I just don't
3056480	3063440	know, and I don't claim to know. It's too complex, it's too complicated.
3064320	3069920	Sure, but you still want to get close. That's the goal of this podcast, is explore this, and I often
3069920	3074560	close the podcast, I'm not sure if you noticed, but I often say thanks for taking us one step closer
3074880	3080080	to the mind of the solution. I never said thanks for providing me with a mind-body solution.
3080080	3085360	Yes. Because I don't think we're gonna get it. I think that this podcast is merely a stepping
3085360	3091680	stone to what could have been. That's interesting. But you still, I mean, we still enjoy the
3091680	3097280	investigation. We enjoy it. I love it so much. I mean, knowing isn't disheartening to me.
3098000	3102320	It makes it even more intriguing. I would love for someone to give me a theory that I cannot
3102320	3110560	refute, or that other philosophers or scientists cannot refute. Just completely construct information.
3110560	3117120	I mean, it's concrete info that I cannot dispute. And I think that's impossible. I don't think,
3117120	3120720	not me personally, but I think it's possible for someone to give that information where
3120720	3125680	someone else is not going to counter it with something else. Sure, yeah. And I agree, I mean.
3125680	3130160	There's so good theories out there. Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, there's so many
3130240	3134800	interesting theories, interesting people to talk to. And even sometimes, I feel like
3135840	3141520	even if a theory is wrong, the process of going through and thinking through it
3141520	3145600	can lead you to some insights that you'll apply somewhere else. You know, it's not like all or
3145600	3155040	nothing. And just thinking back, my channel is called The Truth. I think the closer to truth
3155040	3159360	is already taken. I don't know if you've ever seen that. So I was like, ah, shit, I can't, I can't.
3160320	3164240	Lawrence Kuhn took that from you. Yeah, he's great. And he's lovely. I mean, his interviews are
3164240	3171920	awesome. One of the people that I wanted to curate by content and sort of align it with his size,
3171920	3177520	he sort of show. That was why she got into television was I try wanted to actually host
3177520	3182960	something like that. That was the main reason I went down down the route. Okay. Oh, now I'm
3183280	3188640	we're pulling stuff out here. We're like, okay. So when I started thinking, okay, if I start here,
3189280	3195840	I could end up doing a closer to the truth type. So cool. One day I might be able to do this. And
3195840	3199760	it never happened. Unfortunately, I tried to approach the South African Broadcasting Commission
3201120	3204480	with many ideas about this, but they felt that the niche audience
3204960	3213520	is. Yeah, it's a real, the audience size. I don't know, I feel like there's a hunger for it.
3215840	3216800	I mean, clearly, you know,
3218960	3222800	but it is tough, you know, it's like how accessible can you make it to people like
3223680	3227600	some folks have an interest in it and they don't maybe perhaps they don't have the
3227600	3233600	educational background to sort of like get there, you know, there's one of the things I try to do
3233600	3239760	with some like explainer videos is provide a lot of visualizations to the point where like,
3239760	3245360	if someone is interested but can't quite get there, the visuals can kind of get them closer,
3245360	3250800	you know, it can kind of be like, okay, it's kind of building and maybe, you know, they return to
3250800	3256560	the video a year later or the topic a year later, and their mind has had time to think it, you know,
3256560	3260720	think it through in the back of their head, they return, oh, I kind of get that a little bit closer,
3260720	3266480	right. So there's like a lot of different ways that we can help teach people and get them.
3266480	3270080	And I was watching your videos and I think that that you do a great job of doing that because
3271200	3275520	I mean, you say you're starting out, but I mean, the way you're able to edit your videos and get
3275520	3281680	them all into such as succinct and detailed manner, it's pretty it's pretty epic. I find it quite
3281680	3287360	enjoyable to watch. Thanks, man. I will never tire here in that. Thank you so much. That's really
3288320	3294960	quite a nice binge. Oh, nice. That's why I want that session time, baby. Get it up there. I will
3294960	3302960	say too, though, I haven't considering a rebrand and maybe like true enough, instead of the truth,
3302960	3310400	you know, but then I feel like the association might be that it's not good that people are like,
3310400	3317040	it's close, not really good. Really? Yeah, but I do think, well, that's something that we can talk
3317040	3323440	about, maybe jump into Hoffman a little bit, which is your most popular video so far. And I've
3323440	3331280	covered him. Well, just to spin a speed truth there on my channel, this idea of like, satisfying,
3331280	3336880	this idea of like, good enough, true enough, right? I can't remember which philosopher it was,
3336880	3341600	Schopenhauer maybe, who said like, the truth is just what's true enough, you know, you have to just
3342320	3349040	accept the limits and move on with your life. And you know, you can't, because otherwise, I mean,
3349040	3355440	you can really easily, and I know I've been there in my life at times, where you get into this like
3355440	3364480	existential nihilism about it, where the weight of it, the fact that you can't get there, weighs you
3364480	3368800	down so much. And I've even had friends over the years who have been in that situation as well.
3369600	3375600	And it's a tough spot to be in. Like, it sounds like, yeah,
3375600	3381360	I've been as well. I think that when you question too much, you can take you down the rabbit hole,
3382560	3385600	right down there to a point where you just think there's no way out.
3387120	3393520	What is the purpose of this? Why am I here? It's like, you're not even a speck of dust
3393520	3399680	on a stage. This place is just not about you. That's what it can take you towards. When you
3399680	3405680	really start digging deep, what is this universe? Where are you? That existential nihilism is very,
3405680	3413200	very easy to fall into. And I've been there. But then you find things that can bring you back up.
3413200	3416560	I don't know how you managed to do it. Do you want to share that with me?
3417200	3421200	I would. Yeah, if you'd like to hear, I want to hear what you kind of touched on,
3421200	3425600	and I think quite a bit at the beginning. I had that kind of period during college
3426240	3432160	between my junior and senior years for about a year where in hindsight, I didn't realize it was
3432160	3437840	like my first oppressive period where every day I woke up and all I could think about was,
3439520	3444320	does God exist? Like, what is going on here? Metaphysical questions, right? Like, what do I do?
3445200	3455040	And I was a very religious person growing up, and it was partly due to my folks and my family,
3455680	3462080	Catholic, go to Mass every Sunday. So I was kind of instituted, but I took the ball in high school
3462080	3470640	and went running on my own too. It was something that was very significant to my life and my identity,
3470640	3475520	and I believed in it wholeheartedly. I mean, you know, all the way through, and I led retreats,
3475520	3484960	and I was very religious, and then I got to college, and I went to Brown University, which is,
3484960	3490160	you know, a very liberal place, super different than what I was used to going to Catholic school my
3490160	3496320	whole life growing up, and that just, you know, that religious tendency, that conservative tendency
3497120	3501600	crashed into that world, and it was very difficult, especially at the beginning,
3501600	3506080	but then slowly I started to open my mind to other ways of thinking, and then,
3507520	3515520	yes, at some point I thought, how can I ration my way to the, yeah, to the core, right, to the truth?
3516720	3522000	And I wrestled with it for like a year, I mean, every day. It was like really weighing me down,
3522080	3527920	and at the end of that period or so, between my fall and spring semesters at college,
3528880	3533280	I just threw my hands up, and I was like, I don't know, I can't, I have to be agnostic,
3533280	3540320	I can't choose, because what I was also finding was I was like getting to my, I was kind of
3540320	3544880	like logically trying to get to where I already was, you know, I was like, oh, let me, because
3544880	3549120	it's comfortable, and there's a lot of good reasons to, I'm not anti-religious, by the way,
3549680	3557280	I'm very, you know, whatever works for people, you know, very open to it, but I just had to
3557280	3563040	let that go, and you hinted at it before too, it's scary to be like, you thought you had,
3563040	3569680	you had this feeling like you had the support that everything was going to work out, that,
3569680	3575040	you know, a guiding principle, and then you're in the void, you know, you're by yourself,
3575360	3579520	you have only yourself to rely on, and your relationships with other people, of course,
3579520	3585920	in the world, but yeah, that was the period of, yeah, the darkness, and then I just,
3586560	3591760	a certain amount of acceptance that just wasn't going to get there by rationality alone.
3593600	3597840	Yeah, it's one of those strange feelings you feel, like I said, I felt super free at the time,
3598560	3605040	and I mean, that didn't last very long, it was, it quickly deteriorated into this
3605040	3608400	downward spiral of trying to search, I mean, what is the point of this,
3609200	3613040	what, doing this, I mean, you start asking yourself some dark questions,
3613840	3617280	but then you slowly fall in love with certain things again, and you start to,
3618320	3622160	and you start enjoying the chase, I mean, that's pretty much what you're doing now with the truth,
3623120	3627840	you're trying to find it, and you might not think you will, you might think you get close enough,
3627840	3633680	true enough, but same goes for me, I mean, I'm all about the journey at this point,
3635120	3639600	it's not about finding the mind-body solution, I mean, the mind-body problem is, to me,
3640240	3645120	my favorite problem, philosophically, it is what I live for at this point,
3645840	3652000	I mean, it's become pretty much my identity at this point, but the mind-body solution is something
3652000	3657440	I don't think we will find, not at least in my lifetime, but I think that trying to find the
3657440	3662080	solution or getting people to discuss it and have this discourse and communicate, I mean,
3662080	3666160	the fact that we're discussing it right now, I mean, it's pretty cool, it's so cool to know
3666160	3670800	that there's so many people out there who want to talk about this, and when I started the podcast,
3670800	3674720	I was so surprised because I initially intended on not doing any sort of active
3675360	3681040	marketing or trying to promote the podcast or doing anything, and I haven't, it's just grown
3681040	3685600	very, very naturally, a lot of people have been coming to messaging me, emailing me,
3686320	3692400	making contact very naturally, and it's pretty cool because it seems like people are longing for
3692400	3698000	this information, they want to see this or listen to this discourse, and I think that time has come,
3698000	3703280	and podcasting has given us this opportunity where finally the deeper questions can be
3703280	3706160	spoken about without sounding like your biggest psychotic episode.
3706800	3712320	Sure, absolutely, and I want to touch on one thing that interests me, and it brings me to
3713440	3720560	your interview with Chomsky, because you asked him about, I think, the mind-body problem or
3720560	3725280	something or consciousness in general, and he said something to the degree that it didn't really
3725280	3730160	interest him that much. He wasn't that interested in consciousness, and I actually, oh sorry, go
3730160	3734880	right ahead. Can I continue, I'll touch on that. I was going to say, when he said that,
3736960	3741920	I don't want to say I agree with him, but it interests me, it's like an interest of mine,
3741920	3747200	of course, I mean, it's like a core question, right? Like, what we have access to is this experience,
3747200	3752000	that's what we have, that's, you know, the big problem, but I do think it's interesting that,
3752960	3757840	like, to me, the question is like, what is reality? You know, what is every, you know,
3757840	3764240	everything, and including consciousness, right? And so, I want to hear, I don't hear why it's
3764240	3770720	the most interesting problem to you, like, yeah, if you could. I think, so I agree with you, I think
3770720	3777520	that fundamentally, I actually care more about what reality is than consciousness. So, the essence,
3777600	3785200	I'm on the same page, but for me, the issue comes with the fact that you can have a theory of
3785200	3792240	consciousness that does incorporate reality within it. So, Donald Hoffman, for example,
3792800	3799360	a lot of panpsychist theories and certain idealist theories, reality can become part of consciousness.
3799360	3805440	So, because it's the only thing except for reality that you can sort of bring into the topic,
3805440	3809120	and the fact that I studied medicine and did a master's in mental health and did psychiatry,
3809120	3815440	obviously, I came towards it with a bias towards the mind. But overall, I still came more about
3815440	3821520	what reality is. And I agree with Om Chomsky, because what he said was that the more important
3821520	3827840	question is what is reality? And I agree, because the issue is that we don't know what reality is.
3827840	3834640	So, physicalist views don't really hold much weight, particularly today when people are showing
3834640	3838880	that you don't know what physics really is. I mean, quantum physics says one thing,
3840080	3845760	general relativity says another thing. We're struggling to coincide these two theories,
3846560	3850880	and then there are physicists out there that are showing that spacetime. I mean, Donald Hoffman
3850880	3854080	says this all the time, and it says time is doomed, and then you have to start wondering,
3854080	3861680	why are they saying it? It's such a weird statement to hear a physicist say spacetime.
3862640	3866160	That would freak someone out who doesn't take, I mean, if you take physics seriously,
3866160	3872160	you take predictions and mathematical calculations seriously, you have to start pondering why would
3872160	3878720	someone with such a vast intellect and knowledge base say something so absurd, maybe because it's
3878720	3886400	true, maybe because it's the truth. Maybe. So, for me, that was a big part of this whole thing.
3886400	3890960	I started to wonder, okay, if we're not seeing reality for what it is, that's why I went down
3890960	3895600	this illusionist route. I was like, okay, why are we so obsessed with this question in the first
3895600	3905440	place? Because I know David Chalmers calls it the metaproblem of consciousness. The fact that
3905440	3909760	we're so obsessed with this problem of understanding consciousness in the first place is the hard
3909760	3914080	problem. He first labels it the hard problem, and then he labels it the metaproblem. Why do
3914080	3920080	you want to know this? What's the problem here? And I started to realize it's because human beings
3920080	3926320	have the tendency to put themselves in a slightly higher pedestal than every other species. We've
3926320	3932080	done so for many years. In my dissertation, I have one line where I said the same way that Copernicus
3932080	3936880	took us out of the center of the solar system, the same way that Darwin took us out of the top of the
3936880	3941520	food chain, illusionism will do the same for consciousness. It'll take us out of this idea
3941520	3950720	where we think we have this essence or this Ion Vitale-like soul, for example, that only we have,
3950720	3955120	only human beings tend to possess. For some reason, we love to put ourselves up there.
3957360	3961120	And then over time, I did the podcast, and I started to question illusionism, so I couldn't
3961120	3966800	say how that happened. It all just keeps changing. I'm so agnostic at this point. I have absolutely
3966800	3971760	no idea what I think. It actually can cause mental distress, to be honest.
3972720	3977520	Still. And I spoke to, I mean, Kurt, Jay Mungle from Theories of Everything, we were discussing
3977520	3984640	how, I mean, our podcasts are very similar. And we were talking about how the more we investigate
3984640	3989760	these topics and these phenomena, the more you start questioning your own mind, reality,
3990720	3996400	and it really can get to you. It can drain you. It can almost put you into, it can either make
3996400	4001840	someone very schizophrenic, psychotic, in the sense that they start to lose touch with reality.
4002880	4007440	Psychothermia, for example, is not really a split mind. It's more of a split reality.
4008960	4018000	You start to misinterpret information a lot. So let's say, give you an example, if Donald
4018000	4023600	Hoffman comes to me and tells me that spacetime is doomed, and he shows me the physics, teaches me
4023600	4027920	why, I mean, I could, at some point, just lose touch with reality altogether. I could, at some
4027920	4032800	point, just not care anymore. And what's the point in waking up and going to work anymore, if this
4032800	4040320	is not, that's a poor example. I feel like I've given you a better one. But the fact is, if someone
4040320	4045440	gives you something like that, if someone tells you, look, the sun doesn't really exist. And what
4045440	4052800	if the sun was my favorite thing to wake up to? It can affect your mind. So we were talking about
4052800	4058000	how these theories of everything and these theories of consciousness, in my case, the more you dig
4058000	4063920	deep, the more you delve into it, and the more confused you get, the more you lose touch with
4063920	4069200	reality. And that's what it's like to be schizophrenic, in a sense, is losing touch with
4069200	4073600	reality. The sensory stimulation versus your interpretation of what's going on starts to
4073600	4078640	change. And I know Kurt spoke to Carl Friston about this, and I want to ask Carl Friston about
4078640	4082880	this as well. He's one of the most cited neuroscientists on the planet, if not the most cited
4083520	4088720	neuroscientists on the planet. And he often talks about it as well. I mean, we take in prior
4088720	4093200	information and make posterior conclusions regarding what's going to happen. So for example,
4093200	4098960	if you're a musician and I'm a painter, you and I both enter a lecture at Brown one day.
4099760	4104240	The first thing you might notice in the lecture theater is a lecturer's guitar, whereas I might
4104240	4109760	notice the artwork on the walls. So the fact that we both enter the same room discussing the same
4109760	4115440	thing while heading there with the same intention, the moment we enter, sensory stimulation enters
4115440	4120720	our listeners, completely changes the way we'll experience this lecture from the beginning to the
4120720	4126640	end, because the prior information dictates the posterior conclusions. So a lot of neuroscience
4126640	4131840	is very intriguing in that regard, and starting to show a lot about how we really think. And we
4131840	4138400	have heuristic adaptations to the world. So we take shortcuts a lot of the time. We don't really
4138400	4144320	see anything for what it really is. And the brain has to make assumptions. So we have to guess
4144960	4151280	estimates, basically, of what's really happening out there, caricatures of the reality. And to me,
4151280	4156560	that's a big problem, because that means trying to find the truth in a world that is a caricature
4157040	4162080	or a cartoonish version of what reality might be. It's going to be a very difficult task.
4165760	4169600	Yes, absolutely. Shoot, that's so much done back. I want to,
4172960	4176160	well, let's talk, we want to talk about Donald Hoffman a little bit, because you spoke with him.
4178160	4182480	We actually just chatted the other day, and we're scheduling around two.
4183040	4188480	We're discussing one of his new papers as well. And he's here to publish it, so I can't chat about
4188480	4197200	the paper. But ideally, Donald is such a great guy, such a kind. Yeah, I mean, he's so, so
4197200	4203120	misinterpreted. And that's something I love about this podcast that I'm doing, is that I get a guy
4203120	4209280	whose theory is so perhaps outrageous to so many other people, and then try to incorporate that
4209280	4214400	theory into and make it understandable to an audience that might have misinterpreted it from
4214400	4221600	the get go. And so my goal is never to actually debate. The goal is to always try and understand
4221600	4227840	their point of view. And even if I disagree with it, try my best to actually defend their view
4227840	4233680	during the podcast and play the devil's advocate every now and then, but then slowly try and portray
4233680	4239920	their view in a way I think I would have liked them to have articulated it to me, and the way I
4239920	4244720	can tell that the viewers from their comments want to hear it, because obviously read the comments
4244720	4248240	and try and determine, okay, what are people saying when they do an interview with someone else?
4248240	4251760	What are they asking? And I try and incorporate those questions as well. So it's very well
4251760	4257200	researched and refined, and I try and ask very informed questions, not always the best. And
4257200	4263040	so I mean, we're all learning, we're all trying our best. But with Donald, it was so easy. I mean,
4263040	4268720	he's so courteous, he's so kind. He really liked the fact that I did do that, but I took the time
4268720	4272640	to try and understand his theory, because he told me after the interview was done, that he'll be
4272640	4276880	willing to come on the show whenever he wants, whenever I ask him, which is a really great thing
4276880	4284800	to know. So his theory is so incredible. So he speaks about how he was doing the calculations,
4284800	4291680	and he decided to calculate what are the odds that if fitness payoffs or trying to determine how
4292640	4297360	we would have to survive within the reality we live in, based on the information we receive
4297360	4302080	by the retina, by the auditory system, proprioception, knowing where we are, etc.
4302960	4307280	What are the odds that we would see reality for what it is? And he did the calculation, he sat on
4307280	4313440	with a bunch of other physicists and mathematicians, and they came up to the amazing, astonishing
4313440	4319520	number of zero. Probability of seeing reality for what it is would be zero. And he said,
4320320	4325600	he had to sit down, paraphrasing, but he had to sit down and just take a breather. And when he
4325600	4333920	told me that, I remember also, it's crazy, it's zero. Not even one. Not even point zero one,
4333920	4339120	yeah. Well, I think it's the, it approaches zero at the limit or something. It's like,
4339120	4344560	if it goes to infinity, if you have an infinite number, it's like zero. It's just a zero point
4344560	4351200	zero zero something. And yeah, really, really concerning. I was like, wow. He's not the only
4351200	4356320	one. Firstly, I asked one of my friends, who's a physicist, and he heard in South Africa, I asked
4356320	4363200	him, what are your thoughts on space time? And do you think universe is real? I remember him just
4363200	4370160	saying, no. And he said it's so, he was just kind of like, no. What do you mean? He said, no, if you
4370160	4373680	do the calculations, you sit down, you actually think about it, reality is nothing like what we
4373680	4378000	think it is. Then you have to really ask yourself, okay, physicists are really starting to take
4378000	4383520	this idea seriously. Here comes a guy who's doing that and then adding another theory to it.
4384960	4390560	So he's done two things. One is he's sort of shown us that space time is not fundamental
4391120	4398880	the way we see it. But he takes it further, which is where a lot of people then disagree with Don.
4398880	4402800	And a lot of other neuroscientists and philosophers of consciousness disagree with Don,
4402800	4408640	is where Don decides to make conscious agents a fundamental aspect of consciousness. And this
4408640	4413200	is the issue where he has to not fight a battle. The introduction of conscious agents is always
4413200	4417120	an assumption that we have to make. I mean, anyone who makes a theory has to start off with a basic
4417120	4422960	assumption. And if you introduce conscious agents as the basic assumption, one problem is you
4422960	4427520	introduce conscious agents, which is not necessary, but the second problem is you always need two
4427520	4432560	conscious agents, according to Don's theory. And that makes it a lot more difficult because now
4432560	4439840	you've basically doubled the problem. And a lot of even idealists, because Don fundamentally
4439840	4445200	conscious realism, which is the name of his theory, is a form of idealism. And a lot of idealists
4445200	4450240	disagree fundamentally with the fact that he introduces conscious agents. Yeah, I mean, Don's
4450240	4456320	theory, I mean, I'm never going to do justice to it by discussing it. But I can tell you one thing,
4456320	4461280	it's far more complicated than what I just said. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I've gone down the rabbit
4461280	4465680	hole. I've read most of, I mean, most of his paper, like, yeah, a lot of his papers. I mean,
4465680	4469920	I've read his book, and I think about 20 different papers of him and his colleagues,
4469920	4476640	Singh, but the others. But she's so it's very intricate. These guys have spent time, years,
4477200	4482720	effort, reducing the wonderful mathematics they have. Yeah. And I did, I mean, I've done a three
4482720	4488880	part series on just fitness beats truth. So not even getting yet to I mean, interface theory
4488880	4495520	perception builds out of that pretty, I think, intuitively, but the conscious agents, what I
4495520	4500640	what how I describe it to people sometimes is like, and I'm not sure if Don would say it this way,
4500640	4510240	but most people assume that consciousness is like a bottom up process that like it forms from the
4510560	4517520	neuronal activity in the brain, right? Don's is like top down. Like it starts with consciousness
4517520	4521840	and works its way, you know, that way. That's, that's how I think about it. And I'm like, okay,
4521840	4531440	maybe yeah, I'm, I think I'm super interested in that idea. I'm most, I think I'm most convinced
4531440	4536640	by fitness beats truth, because there's a layer, there's something intuitive about it that just
4536720	4544160	when I first heard that his TED talk, six years, however long ago it was, I was blown away. All
4544160	4548480	they could think about for, you know, weeks, telling people about telling my friends, telling
4548480	4552160	family, oh my God, this is crazy. You got it. You got to get this. No one was interested.
4553360	4556880	Especially funny. One of the reasons why I started this channel was that I couldn't find
4556880	4562000	anyone in my social circles that cared about this stuff. Same. Same. You too. Okay, cool. We have
4562000	4568480	a related thing. It's like, how do you not think this is interesting? Come on, wake up. But
4569040	4573840	watch that TED talk. You're talking about the one with the blue shirt. Oh yeah, absolutely. I've
4573840	4577840	cut that one up quite a bit for my videos. I've like thrown in a lot of hero shots of him from
4577840	4585120	like below where it's him in the background. And I think it's incredible. Maybe this is really
4585600	4593040	first. I think it was, was he called again? I guess, I think he has two books, I think.
4593680	4599600	The Case Against Reality. Yes, Case Against Reality was the one. Oh yes, I had the hard cover
4599600	4605360	version. I think it's got a white cover instead of the colorful flower on the paperback version.
4605360	4609280	But I remember reading that and then I went straight into the rabbit hole. I watched the
4609280	4615520	TED talk. I started reading all his publications and just went in depth. So I was super excited
4615520	4620240	to chat to him. Yeah, I got to reach out to him. I mean, I will, at some point, reach out to him
4620240	4626640	and see if he wouldn't mind doing maybe. Yeah, I'll definitely do that. I'll actually direct him to
4626640	4632320	your three-part series. I'm sure he'll enjoy that. Oh, yes, please do. I would, I mean, dude, that
4632320	4640160	would be, that would be like a dream. I mean, to chat with him and let him know that I had a chat
4640160	4645040	yesterday and I want you to watch something. Tev. Oh my goodness. Thank you so much. That's
4646000	4651120	you're kind. I appreciate that a lot. I really do. I really, really do. Because I also, it's so
4651120	4656080	clear. I've listened to so many hours of his interviews. So clear. He's a nice guy. You can
4656080	4663360	tell, like, kind soul, like, yeah. So he emailed me. Yes. I think it was two days ago. He just,
4663360	4667680	I mean, this is like months after we last spoke. Well, a couple, probably weeks,
4667680	4671280	but it was just out of nowhere email. We just said, Hey, Tev, I've got a guest that I'd like
4671280	4676880	for you to possibly speak to. I mean, and he introduced me so much. So amazing. I'm super
4676880	4681280	keen to introduce to the audience of MindBodySolution. But I mean, it's one of those small
4681280	4685600	things that he does. I mean, just randomly thinking of me, sends me an email and says,
4685600	4689840	I think you do a great job at getting her views out. And I was like, yeah, thanks. Thanks, Don. This
4689840	4695680	is amazing. Awesome. That's great. So he's really, he's really cool. Yeah, yeah, it's great.
4696960	4701040	What was that? Very smart. Oh, I'm very intelligent. Absolutely.
4702720	4707280	Super kind. Yeah. Super kind. Yeah. Very misunderstood as well. Very misunderstood.
4708080	4712160	That's interesting. I guess whenever I've listened to him, he's in the context of like
4713200	4717920	an interviewer who's open to the idea. So I haven't heard, I guess I haven't like
4718640	4722800	come up against a lot of the criticisms, but I'm sure there are. I mean, it's an, it's,
4722800	4728400	you know, counter to what I also find kind of meta interesting about that, about him doing his career
4728400	4735200	is like, he kind of found the most potentially the most fit option for his career in terms of like
4735200	4739520	going against the grain, you know, broadly, that like everyone was approaching the idea
4739520	4744640	of the concept this way, the question this way. Why not go over here where there's a lot of space
4744640	4750480	to like grapple with these things. And maybe there's, there's like something really substantial
4750480	4756160	here. I think that there is. Yeah. I mean, he has that way of thinking because he never really
4756160	4761600	wanted, he never really took serious the idea that we could understand everything with the
4761600	4765760	perception we currently have. Yeah. And I think it's stuck with him throughout life. And I think
4765760	4770240	he wanted to figure out why he would think that. But I don't think he was ever prepared for the
4770240	4777520	outcome when he's maths told him it's zero. Well, it goes to zero. Apparently, he sat down and felt
4777520	4782560	faint. He felt, he felt ill. Like it's one of those feelings when you know that gut-wrenching
4782560	4787200	feeling when you know someone's in danger, or someone's about to break up with you. It's sort
4787280	4792880	of that deep sensation that he felt. He describes it very perfectly. And I think, yes, I can imagine
4792880	4797920	if you are someone who understands the maths and physics, and you get, and you literally figure
4797920	4804000	out for yourself that spacetime is not what you think it is. It's both got to be pretty, pretty
4804000	4809600	horrific. Absolutely. And you've gone down the rabbit hole of, because usually when he refers
4809600	4816400	to spacetime, Izumi talks about Nima Arkani-Hamed's Amplitahedron. Yeah, that's something I have to
4817520	4820880	say. It's very confusing. I mean, it seems like a mapping.
4820880	4826480	It's the Harvard lectures. I think it's Harvard lectures that he has out online. It's super
4826480	4833280	difficult to understand. I've tried. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you've got to give it a go every
4833280	4838800	few months, space repetition, and then slowly figure it out. Yeah, I think that's a good, I
4838800	4843120	agree. It's sort of like you take what you can handle, go to your, go to the edge of your understanding.
4843120	4848640	And when it's just too incomprehensible, you're just kind of like, I'll return back to it. And
4848640	4855440	that's the great, great thing about doing that. I'd love to hear too, just a touch on one of my
4855440	4862000	favorite interviews that you did with Lisa Feldman Barrett. Yeah. Fantastic. I never, I had not come
4862000	4868560	across her before. And lovely. I mean, fantastic interview. I really loved it. Yeah, it's really
4868560	4874080	cool. She's so fun. And we actually, I'm scheduling a lot of round twos at some point.
4875280	4877840	And because there's so many things we could discuss, and we just don't have the time a
4877840	4883840	couple of times. And she's, I remember reading her book as well. And I thought, this woman is so
4884560	4889680	intelligent. It's, this is such a great book. And I couldn't, I had to have her. And she was one of
4889680	4895360	the first people I thought of putting onto the show. She might have been number one, but Michael
4895360	4902400	Graziano helped me out during my dissertation. So kind. And he came to me, I mean, he replied
4902400	4907280	instantly and helped me out to formulate my theory of consciousness and what I was defending in my
4907280	4911280	dissertation and all the things I was doing. So I wanted my first kiss to be someone familiar
4911280	4916000	to me. Sure. And but she was the second, she was my next option. And right there. And I mean,
4916000	4921600	we had such a cool chat. She knows so much about particularly the emotional brain and hierarchical
4921600	4926480	Bayesian brains. She knows the same thing. Friston works on where you look at the brain as sort of
4926480	4932400	this Bayesian like organ functioning like a statistical organ is taking in prior information
4932400	4939120	and constantly producing posterior outcomes. It's very much like that. Then we also have to take
4939120	4944400	into account that we've always thought that the brain is similar to the current zeitgeist. So pumps
4944400	4949600	back in the day, you think the pump like system, you think that brain is sort of a hydraulic system
4949600	4955200	at some point. Every time the science changed or the industrial revolutions changed or the
4955200	4964000	electrical revolution changed, we slowly changed our theory. So very different. So that's interesting.
4965360	4971520	Because we do and you can't blame people for using like the most advanced technology to explain
4971520	4978240	the thing, right? And now, of course, it's algorithmic simulation, computational.
4978880	4983600	So it makes me think, oh, well, we're not even close, because we're just going to go the next
4983600	4988480	thing will be the next thing. And we're just going to keep using that. But what else can you do? I
4988480	4992080	mean, you can only do the best you can with the tools that you're disposable. So I don't blame
4992080	4999760	people for thinking that way either. That's the same reason why I say that it's, it's closer to
4999760	5005040	the mind body. So never go together. But too wordy. That's too wordy, closer to yeah.
5006800	5009520	And who knows, maybe sometimes we're taking a step further away.
5011440	5018400	So difficult to tell. Sure. Sometimes we've had like spirals of revolutions where we thought
5018400	5021600	something and then we've come back to it and then we've thought it again and we've come back to it.
5021600	5027360	You know, I mean, there was a time where people considered consciousness to be fundamental. And
5027440	5033760	over time it lost its edge. Now it's back. But panpsychists, idealists who think consciousness
5033760	5040240	is the primary reality. So we're going to go through these cycles quite a lot, I think. And
5041120	5045520	I think it's cool. I think it keeps the conversation flowing, keeps it going.
5045520	5050400	Hopefully we're alive long enough to see some progress being made. But neuroscience is doing a
5050400	5057200	lot. But it still doesn't help us figure out what reality is. Right. Do you have a
5058160	5062480	I know you're agnostic about this stuff, but do you have I know you're at least open to the idea,
5062480	5069280	but panpsychism, are you you're open to more open than perhaps most doctors, I would assume. But
5070560	5071840	do you think it's wrong? Do you think it's wrong?
5071840	5075600	Certainly people's arguments very convincing. You've got someone like Philip Goff who can
5075600	5081840	can articulate an argument very well. And very difficult to counter argue. It was several points.
5081840	5088640	But I do have certain points where I don't agree. I don't know. I would be less likely to call
5088640	5093920	myself a panpsychist. Even though I'm not even though I say I'm agnostic, I'm very much still
5093920	5105440	firmly more materialist slash physicalist than I am idealist slash panpsychist. But I'm also not
5105440	5113280	convinced by the physicalist materialist argument either. Yes, like this is this is where I was
5113280	5118560	talking about you start losing your mind. Because I mean, I believe this. And I think this, I think
5118560	5128400	my phone is real. And I know it's real. Then you think about what is an atom in 99.9% empty space.
5128400	5132960	And then I'm like, how is this even possible? Right. I'm not really touching the phone.
5133680	5139360	But I am touching the phone. Yeah. So it's a weird world we live in. It's a strange universe.
5139920	5146560	And I mean, I said this, I mean, you spoke about Tony, there's talk and I mean, I call ourselves
5146560	5153760	a conscious conglomerate of cells assembled by atoms manufactured by molecules designed by DNA
5155120	5161040	forged by fusion via stellar supernovae. I mean, this is a crazy story. I've got a couple lines
5161040	5164400	there as well. I mean, this was part of my dissertation, organized by organelles,
5164400	5171440	said this cool alliteration of lines. The story of how we were made is so much more complicated
5171440	5177600	than any story we've ever told so far. I mean, when you think about every religious text and the
5177600	5184400	story of how we were made, I mean, 6,000 years or the Boomba people in Congo, I mean, we Boomba
5184400	5191200	spits out the earth. I mean, we've got so many different stories. Krishna, my own cultural
5191200	5195840	stories, my religious stories. Sure. Then you think about the actual one that science has told us.
5196640	5204400	I mean, stars had to die in order for us, in order for atoms to forge into hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms
5204400	5208960	that provide to form helium, really carbon, oxygen, everything nitrogen, and it just goes on.
5209680	5214640	And slowly they all come back together at some point. And then you find these single-celled
5214640	5221280	organisms, I mean, about 4.8 billion years earth, 13.8 billion year light years across universe.
5221280	5228800	I mean, it's quite crazy. It's an incredible story. It is, yeah. And it's so convincing. And yet,
5228800	5235440	we don't know what dark matter is. We don't know what 99% of this amazing story is. So it's amazing
5235440	5241920	and still so incomplete. In fact, it's just incomplete. It's not even, the story is so,
5241920	5248320	probably so untrue. And but yet to me, it is the story I go with. It is the story I'm most convinced
5248320	5255520	by. And if I give a lecture on what is reality, it's the story I will tell. So yeah, if you had to
5255520	5261680	give, put me in a box, I would still be very much physicalist, yet with very counter-intuitive
5262640	5269920	intuitions about my own intuition. Sure. Open, always open to... It's very, very
5269920	5276720	agnostic. Yeah. I think that's the way to be. Why be stuck with one model when you, you know, you
5276720	5284640	have to, you have to accept things at a certain point to live your life, you know, to get by and
5284640	5289520	do the things you want to do. But then, yeah, just keep your mind open and keep exploring while we
5289520	5294480	can. Can I ask what, which guest of yours has been the most surprising?
5295760	5303360	Oh, that's a very good question. Well, I've had some guests who, I mean, I've been idols of mine.
5304320	5309520	And I mean, I've loved neuroscience for such a long time. If, like astrophysics, archaeology,
5309520	5315840	I mean, medicine mostly because I wanted to somehow go into some sort of a neuropsychological
5316480	5321520	route. And when I was doing that, I mean, I had all these idols. Lisa was one of them.
5323840	5329760	Noam Chomsky, I've been such a huge fan. Of course, yeah. That's right. It was, to me, that was,
5331360	5337520	I felt like I'm interviewing a god. Yeah, he's a legend. I mean, yeah. This is a living legend.
5337520	5341360	He's 93 when I spoke to him. I have another interview I've just done with him that's going
5341440	5346880	to come out soon. There'll probably be 94 when it's out. I don't know. It's surreal to know this
5346880	5357920	guy is 93 and still cognitively engages with as an equal. I mean, it's phenomenal. As someone who
5357920	5363920	treats geriatric patients all the time, he has such a sharp mind. It's incredible because it shows
5363920	5370480	how well he's done over the years to consistently keep his mind up to date and active. And that's
5370480	5375680	what happens when you read and learn as much as you do as he's done over the years. I mean,
5375680	5382880	it's so easy to talk to him. So I think he surprised me the most for sure. I figured it would be
5382880	5388720	difficult, but it wasn't just floated. I would say the only thing that was was obviously, I mean,
5388720	5394480	Noam's getting a little older. So hearing you have to sort of speak a little louder into the
5394480	5403040	mic. That makes sense. If I thought more Patricia Churchland or someone I really enjoyed interviewing
5403040	5409600	as well, because when I was doing my dissertation, I came across a limited materialism and
5410880	5414880	her husband Paul Churchland is someone I also really admire. So the two of them are very cool
5415760	5422880	people who I've also looked up to for a while. There's also Rebecca Goldstein. I mean,
5423840	5429120	she's really cool. Steven Pink and his wife. I mean, the two of them are living legends.
5430240	5434560	Both of them. I mean, I'm going to chat to Pinker at some point as well. But it was so cool to have
5434560	5439040	her as well, because I'm a huge fan of the both of them separately and together as a couple. I
5439040	5446080	think they're pretty awesome. And a dynamic duo. Yeah, I mean, there's been so many. There's been
5446080	5450960	too many of them. And it's growing. I mean, I've got a lot lined up as well. So more is going to come
5450960	5456800	out. But I've taken a break. I was just on vacation. So if anyone's wondering why I've been
5456800	5461600	taking a little bit of a break, you deserve it, man. Where'd you go? Now, I just went on holiday
5461600	5468160	back home to the city of Durban, where my family's from. And yeah, just relaxed for a bit. It wasn't
5468160	5475440	like a full on trip overseas or anything. It was just, you know, that's great. That's lovely.
5475440	5478560	And what do you have? I mean, what do you have in store for the next, you know,
5478560	5482640	a few months next year for the channel? Like what kind of how often do you come out? Like,
5482640	5488320	what's your plan for it? Usually, it used to be around two weeks, every two weeks. But because
5488320	5492400	of I mean, I mentioned to you while we chatted before coming on the show, I mean, there's so much
5492400	5500640	political race in South Africa at the moment. They randomly cut the power. You cannot prepare
5500640	5505040	yourself. So we could be chatting right now. And they could change the stage of what's called
5505040	5510080	low chatting. That means they'll switch off the electricity in the entire country at a random
5510080	5515200	moment at any point of the day. And that's making it very difficult for me to schedule any interviews
5515200	5519680	with guests overseas, because obviously, I don't want to waste their time. And when the day comes,
5519680	5523600	because this has happened about five times already, we're about to cancel an interview.
5523600	5528880	It's very embarrassing, because you've got this guest, you've been looking up to your entire life,
5528880	5534560	and you finally have them. And then they just leave the fingertips of your palm and you're like,
5535120	5541440	oh, I almost interviewed so and so. I can't believe it. I mean, that happened to Noam and I the
5541440	5546320	first time. So Noam and I scheduled an interview, no chatting hit. Noam is so generous, because
5546320	5549920	he obviously knows a lot about South African politics. He said, don't worry, I completely
5549920	5554960	understand. I know exactly what's going on. And then we just rescheduled. So I mean, we've had our
5554960	5558640	number two. So I mean, Noam, you can expect Noam Chomsky one more time. You can expect Donald
5558640	5564560	Hoffman again. All the guests I've had on, you can possibly expect back. I'm going to try and
5564560	5569440	change the format a little at some point. I'm going to try and just update it. Perhaps, I mean,
5569440	5573120	I've been doing everything on my own at this point. It's my hobby, host, something I've been writing.
5573760	5580640	And I think I need to get together because it is a bit overwhelming. It does, it does get a bit
5580640	5586560	hard. I think I need to at some point invest more energy and time into building this. Because I
5586560	5592080	can tell that there is an audience that wants to engage and want this content. And I think I'm
5592160	5598720	going to do my best to provide it. I love it. I live for it at this point. It is my favorite thing to
5598720	5604400	do. When I talk to some of these years, I feel like I'm talking to childhood heroes, some of them
5604400	5611680	are current active heroes. And it's a real, it's actually pretty cool to speak to them as a peer.
5613680	5617920	I remember watching Noam Chomsky as a child, like legitimately a baby. I feel like I was a three
5617920	5625680	year old. Watching an old, huge, you know, the box TV sets, just watching him before it starts
5625680	5632960	to cut to that black and white fuzz. I remember he had this one chat with Michel Foucault,
5633600	5639280	just a sort of debate. He had one that it was televised here in South Africa. This was the
5639280	5646080	coolest thing I've ever seen. Foucault versus Chomsky just having a fun debate. And they both
5646080	5650000	understand each other. One speaking French, the other one speaking English, and there's no need
5650000	5654320	for a translator. They're just, I'm watching the subtitles just thinking, how are these guys so
5654320	5662880	intelligent? That's like upper, upper class. It's crazy. It's so cool. And you get to talk to them
5662880	5670880	and engage with them in this modern world. It's amazing. It is. It's so epic. I can only describe
5670880	5676720	it as awesome. It's just epic. Yeah, very fortunate. Yeah, I mean, even chatting to you right now,
5676720	5681280	I mean, this is like the content you've curated and created at this point. I mean, one of your
5681280	5687360	videos has over 300,000 views. That's that's pretty cool. Oh, yeah, the fourth dimension. Yeah. That's
5688480	5694320	thank you. Yeah, it does feel good that something kind of clicked, I guess. You can never know what
5694320	5699360	it's a funny thing is you don't know what's going to what's going to work. That's the nice thing.
5699440	5703520	You're having such a diverse and different part because it's that you can experiment. I mean,
5703520	5706720	your YouTube channel is able to actually do that, which is pretty cool. Yeah,
5707280	5712640	topic and go with it. Give some what they want. And I mean, I mean, that's the beauty behind
5712640	5719200	this platform is we get to showcase content that we love and that hopefully other people love
5719200	5723840	because clearly 300,000 views later, thousands of people have to have loved it too.
5724320	5730080	Yeah, it does feel good. It's cool. Yeah, it's hard to wrap your head around just like reality.
5731120	5738560	That is a lot. It is a lot. If you could, I mean, talking about Tesseract and a fourth dimension,
5738560	5743360	I mean, it is something people want. I mean, I mean, you've it's such a cool topic. It's one of
5743360	5747520	those things you want to hear about. It is a cool price. I mean, we're into it nowadays.
5748080	5752640	Yeah, me too. I mean, I did that one because I wanted to figure it out for myself. I didn't get it.
5753840	5760080	And I just kept on going back to it. And I think it only took me three or four days to put that
5760080	5765840	together from soup and nuts. Yeah, it wasn't too long. I mean, I was like, early on, I was like,
5767200	5774000	really hitting it hard and trying to pump those out quickly. But so that was cool that it just
5774000	5781280	kind of resonated with some folks. If you could talk to yourself at the beginning of you making
5781280	5787840	the podcast, you know, go back a year or so. I mean, if you give yourself one piece of advice,
5787840	5792640	what would it what would it be? Take your time. Don't edit it too much, which I
5793440	5798560	beginning I did. And then I stopped. Not very much unfiltered. It's almost just raw. I just
5799360	5804880	cut the beginning, cut the end and upload it as it is. I've learned to be less harsh on myself.
5804880	5808880	Just I don't like the way I've responded. If I go too much, I don't care.
5810880	5814560	It's more about getting their views out there. It's more about the guests at this point.
5815280	5823120	My best advice would be, take your time. Don't be too greedy for views or likes. It'll grow.
5824000	5831200	Start low, go slow. And it'll flow. I guess I want to keep going. Love it. Yeah.
5831840	5836000	But I mean, you're talking about a year ago. So what had happened was I started,
5836000	5841280	I uploaded four within, I think, a month or two. Sure. And then I completely quit.
5842720	5846000	And the first four were, I think it was Michael Graziano, Lisa
5847040	5854240	Feldman and Nicholas Humphrey and Keith Frankish. And then I stopped for months. So I think it was,
5854240	5857920	I think I stopped for about six to eight months. I gave up on the podcast.
5858000	5861600	Why? Because of that impatience. I thought like, is this actually going to get dark? What am I
5861600	5867600	going to do? I want to do this. And then I came across, I actually sent Kurt a message about this.
5868640	5872080	I came across Kurt's channel and I remember thinking, this is exactly what I want to talk
5872080	5877520	about and do. And he seems to be growing this very well. I might as well just continue.
5879120	5882800	And then so he actually inspired me to continue doing it. And then we've chatted since then.
5883520	5886160	He even made a video, I remember, where he mentioned me in his podcast.
5887600	5891120	He said that this is a very, so you made a video about underrated podcasts.
5891120	5897200	Yes, I think that's how I found it. Okay, great. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's how
5897200	5901360	I came out. I remember the day he posted that I got a lot of new subscribers and a lot of engaging
5901360	5906560	subscribers. It wasn't just subscribers if you subscribe and don't interact. I was getting
5906560	5911760	engagement, you know, those real comments that people arguing, having full on debates in the
5911760	5916640	comments that I started loving that I was like, this is great. So glad I continued because this
5916640	5922720	is exactly what I wanted to have. The people not talk about me, but rather talk about the theories
5923760	5928880	that I'm allowing these people to portray and discuss. So the goal is for them to portray them.
5929440	5936000	So yeah, by the way, Nicholas Humphrey is one of the guests I've had on the show. He's someone I've
5936000	5941280	read a lot of his books. I mean, one of his heroes was, I mean, Richard Dawkins, I mean,
5941280	5946240	he really loved these people that I loved growing up. And he was one of those people because he was
5946240	5953280	part of that group of biologists who sort of combined biology with psychology. And so he was
5953280	5957840	also someone who I really considered an idol. I have so many of his books on my shelf. I swear
5957840	5964240	about 10 different titles, 10 different books. I know I've got about 15 to 20 books, I think.
5966480	5970160	Yeah, I mean, I'm chatting to these people. I mean, Steven Pink, when we have our chat,
5970160	5973920	it'll be like me chatting to another hero. I've got about also about 10 plus.
5976960	5983600	So yeah, I mean, advice, just take your time and enjoy the process. And I am at this point. I mean,
5983600	5989120	I don't rush. If I don't post in a month, I mean, I haven't posted in time a month, and I'm okay.
5989120	5993520	I'm not really that stressed. I've got videos waiting. I'm not really panicking.
5994080	5999760	Sure. That's a great thing. I am worried about the viewers and the fact that they might be waiting
5999760	6004960	for the next video. And I take that into consideration. So I will post it based on that. But
6005680	6010480	pressure to post is no longer. But I think if you can afford getting a team to get
6011760	6018560	then you probably should take off some of that stress. Because it's a lot of work, editing,
6018560	6023760	post production, pre production, preparation, getting a logo, getting the podcast together,
6023760	6029040	trying to find a song, a theme, everything. It's such a it's so much. Yeah, I get it. Yeah,
6029040	6034480	you're talking pretty little choir over here. I mean, what would you give me? What's that?
6035120	6041600	Do you have to give me advice? What would you give me? Make my advice now? Oh, my goodness.
6042880	6045440	You're a content creator, call us. I mean, at this point, you've done
6046400	6049040	an extraordinary work. You can give me advice.
6049040	6052000	That's what's so kind of you to say. I think very highly of your work, too.
6054080	6058080	Huh. I have to think about I don't have anything off the top of my head. Honestly, I mean, if I had
6061680	6068560	Hmm. No, I have nothing. Wish if I think I promise if I think of anything, I will email you. I
6068560	6073440	promise. I promise if I didn't think comes to mind. Oh, yeah, please do. The bangle is
6073760	6078720	grow. We can't. I love when people give me constructive feedback because I mean,
6078720	6083360	there are times we have noticed things that you notice things you do. You sort of, you might
6084160	6091200	out loud go. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. That's fine. I think that's okay. Fine. Until you find like five comments
6091200	6095360	in the video where you're like, why does this? Why does the host keep humming? And then I'm like,
6096000	6101680	guys, you need to relax. It's a conversation. Yeah, calm down. Yeah, yeah, it's totally fine.
6102320	6108320	Calm down and just enjoy the content. Not perfect. Neither are my guests and they don't
6108320	6113760	claim to be either. So a lot of my effort actually goes into her making sure that the guest
6114320	6118320	is taken care of because the last thing I want is for them to say something politically incorrect
6118960	6124240	that might get them into trouble, which I think a lot of people try to get for click bait. And
6124240	6128240	I think that's something my guests have noticed. And that's why they want to come back is
6128240	6132160	you make them feel comfortable, which you've done so very, very well so far. And
6132800	6138560	I'm sure you'll continue to. We're going off the rails, baby. We're taking this to crazy town.
6139680	6142800	Not a good start, but I think one of the things he told me at the end was, I mean,
6142800	6148320	where he comes from, it's good to actually go in detail and dissect me. He wants me to. So for
6148320	6152400	round two, he actually wants me to play devil's advocate as much as I possibly can. And I said,
6152400	6159680	okay, I can do that. I choose the peaceful route. Yeah. Yeah. If you want the devil, we can bring
6159680	6166160	him out. I mean, it's always good to make sure the guest feels comfortable. So my advice would be
6166160	6171520	take your time, go slow and make sure the guest is always comfortable. I mean, in this type of
6171520	6176080	podcast setting. Yeah, sure. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's as well as what I was trying
6176080	6182320	to do. So I'm glad that that it came through. So if we can, and also just to like, just reminded
6182320	6186960	me something about, I'm so glad you didn't, you came back and that you didn't abandon the channel.
6186960	6192800	I mean, yeah, because I get it. I mean, it's probably so many creators go through the same
6192800	6198400	thing where you try and you put all of yourself into the work and you see nobody watching it.
6199120	6204960	And you're like, what is this? But it was, Joseph Campbell said something to the degree of like
6206080	6209040	when you found your passion, you find the thing that you want to do.
6210880	6217280	He's like, be willing to suffer for about a decade at least in pursuit of it. Like if you're not
6217280	6222560	willing to give yourself over, that's a lot of time. I mean, obviously not everyone has the
6222560	6226960	resources at the time, you know, you have to make these trade offs, you know, for your passion,
6226960	6232400	sometimes with the demands of life and the things that come at you. But on the side, if you just
6232400	6237600	keep on going and you love the process, you know, like you were mentioning before,
6238560	6244560	all the things that it takes to do this well. And I was talking to somebody last night about this,
6244560	6250720	like a content creator, and he said to like, you know, as soon as you can, as you can offload
6250720	6256160	this stuff, certain parts of this you have to, because you know, you need to be able to focus
6256160	6261360	your time and attention on other stuff. But I mean, I'm so curious, I like learning all these
6261360	6267600	things. Like, and I would like, I think it's interesting. It's like, let's go into it, right?
6267600	6274080	Maybe not now editing stuff as precisely after a while, you're kind of like, God, I wish this was
6274080	6279360	over. But initially getting in there in the project, like, I get into Final Cut, and I'm moving
6279360	6285840	stuff around, I get into flow, I lose hours of time, flow right by. And it's like, that's why,
6285840	6291040	you know, that's one of the reasons why I got into this is to lose yourself in the process. So
6291680	6295680	I completely agree. I mean, I also came back because that is something I missed, actually,
6295680	6300160	at the point I was thinking about it. I mean, I loved doing it. And why am I letting the fact
6300160	6304560	that people aren't enjoying it as much as I thought they would affect the fact that I love
6304560	6309760	doing it. So I just came back because I enjoyed so much. I mean, even just just having the
6309760	6314080	conversations, even editing it, I love listening to it, because I'm obviously relearning it.
6315280	6320960	Reabsorbing the answers the person has given me. And you're right, you get into that flow state
6320960	6325280	and you start editing, you can quickly chop, paste. I've made my life so much easier by just
6325280	6330480	starting it, cutting the beginning, cutting it and just uploading it raw. So I've taken a lot
6330480	6336080	of hassles. Yes, there's something the guest has said that they really didn't like, perhaps
6336080	6341440	wanted to be cut out, I will go through and cut it out. Other than that, it's very much raw uncut
6341440	6346720	footage. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll probably do something. I mean, after this, I'll probably do
6346720	6350640	something similar in terms of because this is such an enjoyable conversation from my end.
6350640	6354560	And I hope you hope you enjoyed it as well. And you and I mean, your story too.
6355440	6361920	It's just so perfect because you really and you're you're young guy, you're 29 years old,
6361920	6367120	right? I think you mentioned so and you've come around already, you had this call to adventure,
6367120	6373200	you, you know, this interest, this passion that's always been there. And then you went into the
6373200	6382560	chaos of, you know, med school and 30 hour shifts to then doing the TV media hosting stuff,
6383200	6389360	survivor, you've got, and now you're integrating so much of your different experiences.
6390160	6396000	You know, it's like two or three dimensions of, of things that you're bringing together
6396000	6401680	with this podcast. On top of your, you're still practicing medical doctor, right? I mean, on top
6401680	6406240	of that, you know, you have, and that's, I think, I think something beautiful too is that your day
6406240	6414960	to day practice, you know, that work that you do informs the podcast in an angle that you don't
6414960	6423440	really get that perspective from so many people. So it's just, you made it so easy for me because
6423440	6427600	it's a perfect journey, you know, it's coming through. And yet there's still more to come,
6427600	6431280	you know, I mean, you're going to go through that process again and again in terms of
6431760	6435840	that call, you know, to do even more and integrate even more of your experiences.
6437040	6442400	You know, thanks so much. I really appreciate it. It's, you're right. It's, it's this podcast is
6442400	6448080	pretty much me putting them all together into one part now, finally, being able to put everything
6448080	6453440	into one thing that I love so much. And it truly is that one, that place I go to zone out, this is
6453440	6459520	my hobby. This is something I love to do. And it, it feels like I'm reading because my favorite
6459520	6464160	thing to do is reading books. So when I'm doing a podcast with the guest, I know I've read all
6464160	6469440	their books, it feels like I'm reading a book again. And that's pretty, it's pretty cool.
6469440	6473520	It's the best feeling I can, I can't even explain it. It's just, it's real.
6474720	6478480	I'm sure it is because yeah, you take that written experience,
6480720	6484400	which is like in their psyche, it's like a part of them, you know, it's the patterns that you're
6484400	6489200	getting through. And then you can actually engage mind melds, have the discussion.
6491280	6495920	It's pretty, it's pretty surreal. I must say. It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal.
6495920	6500320	What a time. What a time to be alive. Do you have anything else you want to say to the audience?
6500320	6504720	Anything else you want to ask me? Good luck to you, man. This is going to be a crazy adventure.
6504720	6508720	This is going to be something you're going to look back and think, I'm so glad I continued.
6508720	6513280	I'm so glad I changed the format now and then. I said, you said you're planning to do that.
6514400	6518880	More you engage and experiment, the better it's going to get. So I just want to say thank you
6518880	6523920	for continuing what you're doing. Thanks for the opportunity for chatting to me and finding my
6523920	6529040	story so compelling, compelling enough for you to interview me. I appreciate it. I had such a great
6529040	6535120	time firstly, but more importantly, I think you're going to do a great job. This is going to be,
6535120	6539280	this is going to be something I'm going to keep my eye on. Definitely going to probably have you
6539280	6546000	on the show at some point. Yes, I need time. Absolutely. I think we need to have a nice
6546000	6550720	discussion on the mind and why you think reality, why you think we're going to find the truth.
6552560	6556240	I didn't say that. Did I? I mean, I think we might get close.
6558880	6562560	True enough, at least. Yeah, just like a. Are you going to change the name? Are you
6562560	6567040	actually going to do this? You know what? I've done like a little bit of a the last few weeks,
6567040	6571360	kind of a restructure, figuring out the future of the channel. Like obviously this is one step in
6571360	6575520	that direction doing. I want to do like one interview a week. It's kind of something I'd
6575520	6581120	like to do it going into 2023, possibly like one live stream per week where I'm doing like a lecture,
6581120	6584800	kind of educational stuff on the fly, but pre-prepared, obviously to a degree.
6585520	6589440	So I think I'd be like a nice, you know, because you got to get the stuff out, you know,
6589440	6593280	you have to create a lot of stuff and put it out there and see what happens. So that's kind of
6593280	6599120	vaguely what I'm thinking about. And I have a lot of ideas for, yeah, a rebrand new structure,
6599120	6603120	sort of a new title, sort of, but it's up in the air. I don't know. And one of the cool things about
6604400	6608160	YouTube in particular, but also all the social media platforms really is that you can rebrand
6608160	6612320	on the fly. You know, you can like really change stuff. You don't want to do it too often. Obviously,
6612320	6618000	you confuse your audience, but. I've done that. So I, when I started this podcast, it was before
6618000	6625280	the four episodes uploaded right to that. I started the podcast, I think almost four months or so
6625280	6631440	before that, but it was a mental health podcast. I started it where I just did episodes talking
6631440	6637840	about mental health in general, just me speaking, no guests. I found myself slowly not really enjoying
6637840	6642640	it. I didn't like it. I didn't like what I was doing, was not enjoying the content. I stopped
6642640	6646960	completely revamped it, brought on guests and decided to make this a two way street
6647600	6652560	and have a look back. So I think if you're feeling that urge to change it up, change it up.
6653440	6660080	I am. Yeah. This, and this I think is good because very, I mean, I think it's honest criticism of
6660080	6666640	my own stuff. So myself in front of the camera, like I had like a teleprompter prescripted, you know,
6666640	6672400	every word exactly how I wanted, which I wanted for quality control, but obviously scale,
6672400	6677040	scale wise, it just really reduces your output. And then I watch myself now and it's, I'm so
6677040	6683920	stilted and stiff on camera. And I mean, I do think it's tough to read off a teleprompter, like
6683920	6688080	to do that with like, you know, fun energy, you know, you have years and years of experience
6688080	6694560	doing stuff like that. We got some training in that. Yeah. Yeah. You got some training. I did
6694560	6700080	that. So I look back and I'm like, Oh no, I look terrible, but whatever. You know, you got to just
6700080	6706400	accept it and say, you need to make stuff and mess up. And then you kind of,
6706400	6709520	I mean, as you said, it's Joseph Campbell says it all. It's the hero's journey. You were just
