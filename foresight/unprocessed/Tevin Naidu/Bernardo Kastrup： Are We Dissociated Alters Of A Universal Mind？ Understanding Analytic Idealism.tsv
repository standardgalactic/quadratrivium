0	14400	Good afternoon, Tevin Bernardo. Welcome back. Welcome back to my body
14400	18880	solution. How are you? Good to see you. Great to see you, man. How have you been?
20400	26160	Busy. I can imagine. I mean, Bernardo, the last time we spoke, I mean, your video has been very
26160	30560	engaging. A lot of people have been going back and forth in the comment section. I mean, it's
30560	37040	it's been an intriguing journey to watch. Cool. I spoke to Sue Blackmore, I think it was last week,
37040	42480	and I was thinking about the, the wonderful discussion you guys had, the your location with
43360	52240	Kurt. How was that for you? It was a while ago, because it was published quite a while after it
52240	61840	was recorded. I mean, I like Sue. I met her in person a couple of times. So yeah, if you like
61840	69840	someone, it's pleasant to talk. I don't think she's an illusionist at all. Because the way she
69840	77120	defines illusionism is not what other people call illusionism. But other than that, I think it was
77120	81600	a productive engagement. It was it was amazing. The last time we spoke, we touched on so many
81600	87840	different topics, Bernardo. We spoke about Carl Jung, Schopenhauer, mental health, psychiatry,
88560	94000	life, death, religion. And to a point where I was trying to figure out how do I approach this
94000	98080	conversation? How do we do a part two that's engaging and that the listeners and viewers want
98080	103520	to watch? And the conclusion I've drawn is, let's do a crash course on analytic idealism.
104320	108960	And what inspired me was obviously your course with the Essentia Foundation. I mean, brilliant
108960	113280	course, well structured. How do you feel about that? How do you feel about this approach?
114880	120000	I'm gain. I'm keen. And look, so I've broken it down into the seven chapters. And I think we'll
120000	124720	move from chapter to chapter. At any point, I feel that there's anything I want to clarify
124720	127840	or to provide some new content for the listeners. I think it's a great
128480	133360	opportunity. And for you to also rectify or clarify anything you think you might have wanted to say,
133360	138160	and and feel like this is the perfect opportunity. Do you want me to run down the seven chapters
138160	142640	for you? Or do you just want to go step by step? Help me out, give me the structure.
142640	145760	Okay, so the first question, I mean, we'll go through chapters. The first one will be
146720	150720	investigating whether our ordinary intuitions about the nature of reality and the world at
150720	155760	large can be true at all. Is the world really what it looks like on the screen of perception?
156320	159840	Then on the, no, no, so do you want me to just break it down for you? You want to go?
159840	164800	No, no, let's do it one by one. So I don't have to push the many things to my stack before it
164800	168960	starts popping. Okay, now then let's do it. I think yeah, let's start off with that. Chapter one.
169920	173120	So this is a crash course on analytic idealism for all the listeners.
174320	179280	So the question is, is the world what it what it seems to be in the sense that
180000	185920	does the world contain these forms and shapes and entities and events that we discern on the
185920	190400	screen of perception? And the answer is a categorical no, there are many things about
190400	196000	analytic idealism that are sort of best guesses guided by reason and evidence,
196000	202880	but other things are pretty established. They are just not mainstream yet. They didn't percolate
202880	210880	up to the froth of culture. The world cannot be what it seems in the sense that it cannot have
210880	217360	those shapes and forms and events and spatial temporal positions that we discern on the screen
217360	222320	of perception because for the latter to be true, our inner states would have to mirror
222320	229840	the external states of the world. But there is no a priori upper bound to the dispersion or entropy
229840	235680	or level of disorder of the states of the world. We cannot decree that the world has an upper bound
235680	242160	in entropy. So if we were to mirror the states of the world in our inner states, then our inner
242240	248000	states would have no upper bound in their entropy. And therefore, perceiving the world
248000	255280	could be deadly. You could melt into hot meat soup, because your internal entropy has to be bound.
256320	261360	Unbound internal entropy is not compatible with life. We would become soup, literally.
262480	268880	So no, our inner states do not mirror the world. Another line of argument is evolution wouldn't
268880	274960	have given us a perceptual apparatus that mirrors the states of the world. It would be confusing.
274960	281920	It would be information overload. What we want is to be able to discern the salient aspects of the
281920	289040	world in an encoded form that facilitates prompt responses to environmental challenges
289040	294640	and also limits our internal entropy. So to summarize it all, the world as it is in itself
294640	301360	is not physical, because what we call physical are the things we discern on the screen of perception
301360	308240	which are describable through physical quantities, such as length in centimeters, weight in kilograms,
308240	315760	electric charge in Coulombs, and so on and so forth. But these cannot be the way we would
315760	320320	describe the real states of the world. These are descriptions of our internal cognitive
320320	326560	representations, not of the states that they represent, the external states. So the real
326560	331840	external states of the real external world are not physical in the sense that they are not
331840	337120	describable through physical quantities. And then it raises the question, are there states
337120	342880	that are not describable through physical quantities? Obviously, how many centimeters does
342880	349200	your thought have? How many kilograms does your emotion weigh? What's the electric charge in
349200	357520	Coulombs of your depression, your fantasy? So what the prospect that it raises is that
357520	363600	the external world is probably made of what we call mental states, experiential states.
364160	371200	And the physical world is our cognitive inner representation of the real external states of
371200	378960	the world. Tell me, Bernardo, how aligned is this view? Are you familiar with the work by
378960	383680	Jude Caravan? And I mean, of course, you are with, I mean, you're not really okay. But with
383680	388480	Don Hoffman, I mean, you know that your guys idealism theories are very similar. Of course,
388480	393680	we spoke about this before, where you separate at the point where I think he takes conscious
393680	397760	agents to be fundamental. So you need that human consciousness element.
400000	405680	No, so is that not we don't don doesn't say that humans are an instance of
406640	413600	okay. So so fundamentally, when you think about the pioneers of this thought, because Don obviously
413600	418080	wrote about the case against reality and your work also describes I mean, when you talk about
418080	424880	the fact that we have this dashboard in terms of the use the plane as a common example,
425760	430720	and measurement, briefly elaborate on that just for all the listeners who are not familiar with
430720	438640	that analogy. Think of an airplane, an airplane has sensors that measure the external states of the
438640	446800	sky, air pressure, wind direction, humidity. In the case of a weather radar, it will pick up also
446800	453520	all these elements, but in a more compound manner. So the airplane has sensors. Now,
453520	460560	the results of the measurements that are performed by the airplanes sensors are displayed to the pilot
460720	467760	on a dashboard. So the states of the dashboard represent the real states of the world outside.
468960	476800	But the dashboard isn't the real world outside. That's obvious. Yet you can fly the plane without
476800	483920	a transparent windscreen, you can fly the plane by instrument alone, because the dashboard conveys
483920	488960	accurate information about the states of the world without being the states of the world.
489680	497360	So the idea here is that our perception states, the colors we see, the sounds we hear, the smells
497360	503360	we feel, the texture on our skin, all that. These are dashboard representations of the real
503360	508240	states of the world. We are airplane pilots that were born inside a cockpit without windows.
508800	516080	And all we have ever had is the dashboard. And we've come to take the dashboard for the world,
516960	524080	which is understandable, but not under the light of 21st century analytic philosophy and science,
524080	531120	because we should know better now than to make what Donald Hoffman calls a rookie mistake,
531120	536640	which is my metaphor to take the dashboard for the sky. One represents the other. It doesn't
536640	543120	mean that the representation is the thing represented. Do you ever feel that there would
543120	551280	be a way for us to get that dashboard to not be our main perceptive reality? Do you feel like
551280	555040	whatever reach a point where we can actually see beyond into the true nature of reality?
556480	563600	Whatever that is, whatever that means. Mystics throughout history seem to claim that that is
563600	575440	possible. It hasn't been possible to me. And I'm not sure about the analytic coherence of that claim,
575440	582880	but I'm open to my ability to analyze things rationally to be limited. I mean, why would the
582880	588880	nature have to conform to the limitations of a monkey like me, a primate that has been running
588880	595520	around with an intellect for only about 30,000 years? I mean, for all I know, it may be possible.
595520	601760	I think on the basis of reason and evidence and not spiritual introspection and insight,
602480	610640	I think the dashboard is an artifact of life. The dashboard was constructed by evolution
610640	616640	in the journey that life has undertaken on this planet. So if you don't want to have the dashboard
616640	624320	on your way, that time is coming because you're going to die. And once you die, this dissociative
624320	629280	process in the mind of nature that we call ourselves will no longer be dissociated because
629280	633920	life is what the dissociation looks like. If there is life, it means there is dissociation
633920	638880	because life is the representation. It's what that dissociation looks like. It's the extrinsic
638880	643760	appearance of the dissociation. And the dashboard is an artifact of the dissociation
644560	650080	because the dashboard is the panel that allows you to have commerce from external states to
650080	655600	internal states. But for there to be external versus internal, there has to be a boundary.
656240	660160	Otherwise, everything is just outside or everything is just inside and there is no
660160	665760	boundary and then there is no dashboard. What is that boundary? That boundary is the dissociative
665760	673360	boundary. It's a cognitive boundary enforced by the dissociative process we call life because
673440	679360	it looks like metabolism when represented on another dashboard. So the end of life is the
679360	686240	end of that boundary and therefore it's the end of the dashboard. And it's the difference between
686240	693360	perceiving the world and being the world. So to be honest, personally, I'm not in a hurry to get
693360	700560	rid of the dashboard. I'm okay if it takes a while. Have you ever thought about what I mean,
700560	705440	evolution obviously provided us with these tools, hid the truth from our eyes in a sense.
708320	712720	Why would you think that is the case? Do you think that there could have been alternative
712720	716320	ways to do this? Do you think that there were other options possibly available?
716960	718160	Options to what?
718160	726320	To perceiving reality in a different way. I think every species has a slightly different
726400	731600	dashboard. I don't think they are completely different because of convergent evolution.
732240	738240	If doing things one way worked out very well for one branch of the evolutionary chain,
739120	744000	chances are that other branches will hit upon that as well and that will be fixed by evolution
744000	751120	because it works well and therefore things will converge. So I don't know that our
752000	759280	dashboard, our screen of perception is the most optimal way to cognitively represent
759280	765360	the external states of the real world. But if it's not that, it's not a bad way either,
765360	770400	otherwise we wouldn't be here talking about it. So I don't think it's the only way.
771600	778640	I think there are conceivably almost infinite other ways to represent the world.
781120	786240	It's a way that works and I would expect that even other species have similar
787280	794480	dashboards, similar perceptual screens, but not identical because it doesn't need to be
794480	801120	identical. Bees see ultraviolet. There are species that detect infrared. Some species have
802240	807200	sonic radar and we don't have. What is it like to be a bat or a dolphin?
808000	814000	So ours is certainly not the only one. This is certainly not the only way.
814800	820880	But it seems to have been good enough for the past, what seems to genus Homo has been around
820880	827680	at 1.8, maybe 2 million years. I think you once spoke about,
827680	833120	I think you had one psychedelic trip. How did your dashboard change at that point?
833680	839840	Oh, I have had several psychedelics. In my mid 30s, I was writing about consciousness and I
839840	845680	thought it would be lapse to the point of irresponsibility to write about consciousness
845680	850320	and not investigate consciousness through every avenue that we know to be safe.
851120	856960	So I did several fairly high dose psychedelic trips. I am in a country where it's legal
857600	860960	to the point that before I did my first trip, I went to my doctor
861600	866480	and I told him what I was about to do and asked for him to check me up. So I had my liver checked,
866480	872080	I had my heart checked, blood pressure and all that good stuff checked and I was given an okay and
872080	882160	here we go. I don't know whether psychedelics trip is so overwhelmingly rich and intense
882720	885760	that it's very difficult to make statements about
887680	894640	what the causality behind what you are experiencing is. Where does that stuff come from?
894640	899440	Is it from outside me? Is this my own stuff, my own shit, the skeletons in my own
900720	911120	cupboard? Is it from aliens? Is it from another dimension? It's virtually impossible to say this
911680	918960	and to be honest with you, I don't think it's very important either because the most baffling
918960	923200	thing about a psychedelic trip is that it seems to be exactly what you need
924880	931120	and where it comes from is utterly unimportant because the effect will be the same.
932880	938560	So I don't know that psychedelics allow you to see the world, this world as it is.
939200	945840	Could they do that? Yeah, I even suspect they might to some extent do
946720	952080	but even in that case, even if they do to some extent allow you to see our surroundings as our
952080	956880	surroundings really are and there's good reason to think that they might be doing that because
956880	961920	psychedelics reduce brain activity. So chances are that what is being reduced is in fact the
961920	967040	dissociative process itself, the dissociative boundaries being weakened so you're taking
967120	971680	in things as they are as opposed to representing them on a dashboard. But I don't think that's
971680	978080	the only thing psychedelics do or even the main thing because if that were the main thing they do,
978080	983120	we could die from a psychedelic trip because the entropy of our inner state to be unbound again,
983760	989600	you see? So I don't think that that's the only thing that is going on and even to the extent
989600	996320	that that is going on, I think it sort of gets mixed in with all kinds of other things. So it's
996320	1002160	impossible to make a statement that, oh, that particular experience, that was the world as it
1002160	1009120	really is. I personally feel incapable of making that pronouncement. I mean, while sticking to
1009120	1015680	this chapter's theme on our intuitions and whether it is a true reflection of reality, when people
1015680	1020320	do have these trips or make certain claims, whether it's religious psychedelic trips,
1020320	1025120	spiritual claims, and the way they link it to idealism, how do you feel that impacts
1025120	1028960	the field of analytic idealism? Spiritual claims in general.
1034240	1041920	I don't have the delusion that I am in some sense owner of analytic idealism or even idealism.
1043440	1050000	So what people make of it, it's their own personal freedom and their own personal
1050080	1057200	responsibility, as long as they don't attribute that to me or attach that to analytic idealism as
1057200	1062400	a pronouncement of analytic idealism, what they make of it in their own lives, I think it's
1063840	1069680	their business, it's their responsibility, it's their lives. The way analytic idealism informs
1069680	1075120	their lives is their own thing. So long as they don't attribute spiritual claims to
1075120	1084480	analytic idealism itself or to me, I think it's okay. Okay, great. So okay, we've touched on that,
1084480	1088080	is reality what it looks like? Anything else you want to touch on regarding our screen of
1088080	1093040	perception and this nature of reality that you find on that? Okay, let's discuss then why
1093040	1099600	mainstream physicalism in general fails on all key post-enlightenment values, such as coherence,
1099680	1105040	internal consistency, parsimony, explanatory power, and empirical adequacy.
1106160	1113040	Let's start with coherence. Mainstream physicalism is internally contradictory,
1114320	1123600	probably more ways than one, I will mention one. Physicalism will say we have these physical
1123600	1129440	quantities that describe the contents of the screen of perception. So if I lift a heavy piece
1129440	1138480	of luggage, I can describe that heaviness that I feel as 50 kilograms or the lightness of a feather
1138480	1148160	that I feel as five grams. So physicalism starts with the obvious, we describe the perceived world
1148960	1156160	through physical quantities. This is metaphysically neutral and eminently reasonable. Galileo
1156160	1162480	started doing this. But then physicalism makes a very weird step. It says, oh, those descriptions,
1162480	1169600	those physical quantities, they precede the thing described. What really exists is not
1170240	1175760	the feeling of heaviness that I have when I lift the 50 kilograms piece of luggage. What really
1175760	1183680	exists is the 50 kilograms and somehow my feeling of lifting it arises from the 50 kilograms or is
1183680	1189760	modulated by the 50 kilograms. And the same thing for everything else. What really exists
1189760	1198080	are kilometers, joules, coulombs, seconds, grams, and so on and so forth. And the things that are
1198080	1204960	described through these quantities, they are secondary and they arise from the quantities.
1206000	1213440	That's eminently incoherent. It's like saying, I can pull the territory out of the map. The map
1213440	1219360	which describes a territory precedes the thing that is described. The moment you do that, your
1219360	1224640	descriptions lose their semantic anchoring. Because the lines on a map only have meaning
1224640	1230000	so far as you can link them to the territory. But if the map precedes the territory, the lines mean
1230000	1239920	nothing. And that's what we call the hard problem of consciousness. We cannot derive the territory
1239920	1244800	out of the map because the map loses its meaning unless from the moment zero,
1245520	1252880	it's cementically anchored to the territory. So to translate it into real life, we cannot derive
1252880	1260160	the sweetness of eating an apple from the mass, charge, spin, momentum of the molecules constituting
1260160	1266320	the apple. Of course not for the same reason that you cannot pull Cape Town out of the map
1266320	1271680	of Cape Town. Because the map loses its semantic anchoring the same way, mass,
1271680	1276000	charge, spin, momentum. If you say that they precede the sweetness of the apple,
1276000	1281040	they lose their semantic anchoring. In other words, they mean nothing. And you cannot derive
1281040	1286480	anything out of something that doesn't have meaning. So that was coherence. What was the next one?
1286560	1287600	Internal consistency.
1289600	1297840	Physicalism defines matter as that which has nothing to do with the qualities of experience.
1299120	1306080	And then tries to explain the qualities of experience in terms of matter. Good luck with that.
1309440	1315040	I mean, that settles. It is quite a tough one. I mean, particularly knowing that
1315600	1321520	a mainstream physics has had so many different revelations over time. And each time we seem to
1321520	1327280	be more and more confused about it. And knowing that matters like 99.9 recurring percent,
1328080	1332320	we just don't know what it is. There should be a clear indicator that we really just don't know
1332320	1342480	what matter is. The human psychology is such that the most obvious and self-evident bullshit
1343440	1350080	gains an aura of plausibility if enough people, along enough time, tell you that it's true.
1351600	1356400	That's human psychology. That's very true. Okay, let's go into the next one. Possimony.
1360160	1367600	The one ontological category that we absolutely know to exist because it precedes theory
1368560	1373360	are the qualities of experience. Qualitative stuff. That's how we begin. That's how we begin
1373360	1379520	experiencing the world. That's how everything started. And then we started theorizing after
1379520	1386000	that, but it begins with qualities. Now, the most parsimonious account of reality would be one
1386000	1392320	that explains reality in terms of qualities alone. Not only the qualities you experience,
1392400	1398480	or only the qualities that I experience, but qualities as a type, as a type of existent.
1399200	1403680	If we can make sense of nature in terms of qualities alone, that's the most parsimonious,
1403680	1407840	because it only grants existence to the one ontological category that we know absolutely
1408800	1414400	surely to exist because it precedes theory. Physicalism, however, postulates another one.
1414400	1419520	Physicalism postulates another type of existent that's not qualitative at all,
1419520	1425840	but can be exhaustively described in terms of quantities alone. Mass, charts, being momentum,
1425840	1432640	geometrical relationships, and so on and so forth. That is only justified if you can't make sense of
1432640	1438560	reality, account for the dynamics of nature in terms of qualities alone. If you can't, then okay,
1438560	1443600	you postulate something else. But if you can, then postulating something else violates the
1443600	1449120	principle of parsimony. And physicalism does that. All we need to account for nature is that there
1449200	1457040	are external states beyond our individual minds, external qualitative states, experiences that
1457040	1463920	are not mine or yours. They are experiences of nature out there. These are real external states.
1463920	1468880	But they can also be experiential just like mine and yours. In the same sense that my thoughts
1468880	1475200	are external to you, but they are still experiential states. If you were not around,
1475280	1479520	would still be having my thoughts from your perspective, they are external and objective,
1479520	1485120	but in their own nature, intrinsic nature, they are subjective and qualitative. So that's all we
1485120	1494480	need to explain nature, external qualitative states. But physicalism conflates everything,
1494480	1501280	and in postulating external states outside our minds, it thinks that those external states
1501280	1506800	should also be non-mental because anything outside our minds should be non-mental. Why?
1508000	1514080	Why the hell? I mean, my thoughts are mental, but they are outside your mind. So from your
1514080	1520320	point of view, if I tell you, well, the black holes are made of experiential states,
1520320	1525760	it's entirely analogous to my thoughts being experiential and outside your minds too.
1526400	1531840	So that's a grotesque violation of the principle of parsimony.
1532800	1536800	Yeah. The last two are explanatory power and empirical adequacy. I mean,
1536800	1542080	another part of it, I mean, I wanted to ask you about certain things like the observer effect or
1542080	1546960	perhaps even the big bang and how we explain all of these using this concept now and understanding
1546960	1552000	it differently. I'm not sure what people mean by the observer effect.
1552880	1556080	Yeah, because it has to be an observer and it has to be separate at that point.
1558560	1564720	I don't know how to map it to the technical aspects of quantum theory, what people refer
1564720	1568800	to as the observer. There is a measurement problem. That's probably what people mean by
1568800	1573520	the observer effect. I don't know. Okay, why is physicalism then not empirically adequate?
1575040	1580640	Physicalism assumes that what really exists are physical states. In other words, states that
1580640	1587280	can be exhaustively described through numbers or quantities alone. And we call those states
1587280	1594240	strictly physical states. If physicalism is correct, then physical states or physical entities or
1594240	1599440	physical properties have standalone existence because they are supposed to be the bottom level
1599440	1606320	of reality. All states such as mental states are supposed to arise epiphenominally from
1606320	1611760	physical states. But what really has standalone existence, in other words, states that do not
1611760	1616800	depend on anything else to exist, those are physical states. Physical entities do not depend on
1616800	1623440	anything non-physical to exist. They do not depend on processes to exist because physical entities
1623440	1632080	are the bottom level of reality. Experiment contradicts this. There is a series of experiments
1632160	1637520	which had been going on about 45 years, and each won the Nobel Prize in physics last year,
1638560	1643280	which shows that if you have two particles, physical particles that are entangled,
1643840	1647840	and you shoot one at the speed of light in one direction, and you shoot the other in the opposite
1647840	1653760	direction, and then after a while, let's say scientist Alice makes a measurement on particle A.
1654400	1658960	And at the same time, scientist Bob makes a measurement on particle B,
1659760	1665600	and Alice and Bob do not talk to one another. It turns out that what Alice chooses to measure
1665600	1672480	about particle A determines what Bob sees when he looks at particle B. How can this be? If particle
1672480	1677120	A and B are fundamental, if they have standalone existence, they should be whatever they are,
1677120	1685600	irrespective of what Alice chooses to measure. Measurement is supposed to merely disclose what
1685600	1691360	the particle already was immediately prior to measurement. That's not what turns out to be
1691360	1700240	the case. Alice's choice of what to measure, technically, for instance, the axis of angular
1700240	1708320	momentum in which you measure angular momentum. That choice by Alice determines 100% what Bob
1708320	1713440	sees when he measures particle B. How can particle B change and be something different?
1713440	1718480	Because of what Alice, on the other side of the universe, chose to measure about particle A.
1718480	1723200	So what this is telling us is that physical entities do not have standalone existence.
1723200	1729840	Physical entities are a product of measurement. They arise from measurement. The thing that is
1729840	1736400	measured, the state that is measured in the first place, isn't physical. It can give you a metaphor.
1737280	1743120	Suppose you love football, but you can't go to the stadium. So you buy two television sets,
1743120	1748160	and you put them in your living room, and you watch the match on both televisions at the same
1748160	1755520	time, but on different broadcasters. Now, assuming that each broadcaster has their own cameras in
1755520	1760560	the stadium, so the images on the two televisions will not be the same because they are produced by
1760560	1766400	different cameras, but they will be completely correlated because they are images of the same
1766400	1772400	football match. Now, if a time traveler from the 19th century were next to you watching this in your
1772400	1778160	living room, the time traveler would be discombobulated, flabbergasted. How do the little man inside the
1778160	1785520	box to the left can run exactly in synchronicity with the little man inside the box to the right
1786160	1791680	without communicating? The box are separate. How do the little man on the left know what to do
1791680	1796480	based on what the little man to the right are doing? The mistake our time traveler does is to
1796560	1803680	confuse the appearance, the image of a phenomenon, the representation of a phenomenon, for the
1803680	1808880	phenomenon itself. The time traveler thinks that there are real little man inside the two boxes.
1809760	1815920	He doesn't understand that those images are just that, images of something else, of a reality,
1815920	1822240	but that reality is in the stadium. What you see on the television are just appearances thereof,
1822240	1827360	and the appearances are synchronized because they are both appearances of the same thing.
1827360	1832640	Now, what the Alice and Bob experiment tells us is that what Alice sees and what Bob sees,
1833280	1839840	the particles they measure, they are the images on the television screen, and Bob's measurements
1839840	1845440	are completely correlated with Alice's measurements, just for the same reason that the images on the
1845440	1850000	two television screens are correlated with one another. In other words, the particles are not
1850000	1856800	the thing in itself. The particle is the appearance that arises upon measurement when the cameras
1856800	1863520	shoot a frame on the stadium. That's why they're synchronized. They are both frames of the same
1863520	1869120	underlying reality, and the clue that that's underlying reality is the same is the word
1869120	1877600	entanglement. And we have to part with this notion that when we make a measurement and we see a
1877600	1882560	particle, that the particle was the thing measured. No, the particle is the image on the television
1882560	1888640	screen. The thing measured isn't a particle. It isn't physical. It isn't exhaustively
1888640	1894720	describable through physical quantities. It is almost certainly a mental state, not in your mind
1894720	1902320	or my mind. A mental state out there in nature at large. I mean, you spoke about entanglement,
1902320	1906960	and I mean, I'm just thinking about you mentioned that Nobel Prize. And when you think about
1906960	1911760	Nobel Prizes, they're usually given to settled sciences. So when something is settled, you get
1911760	1916640	the prize. I was just discussing the other day how Einstein never got the Nobel Prize for the
1916640	1923680	for relativity rather for the photoelectric effect rather than that. But more and more,
1923680	1929520	there's a growing body of evidence that seems to be showing us just how in true this non-locality
1929520	1935440	actually is. The fact that something that happens here is can happen 12.8 billion
1936160	1942400	light-years away. And how do you feel that these new physical data, well, we'll call it physical
1942400	1948560	data for now, actually provides more evidence for your claim rather than for the physicalists out there?
1950480	1956240	The Nobel Prize tends to be given to discoveries that have meaningfully and positively impacted
1956320	1962720	human life. So that's something to keep in mind. Even the Nobel Prize last was given to those scientists
1962720	1967760	because of quantum communication and quantum encryption. In other words, it tends to focus
1967760	1974240	on the applications rather than the raw theory, which is one of the reasons why there is Nobel
1974240	1981280	Prize in mathematics. You wait until it's applied by engineering, and then you get a Nobel Prize
1981280	1985440	in engineering or physics, and then you get a Nobel Prize somewhere else. In mathematics,
1985440	1990720	there is the Feuds Medal, which is something different, but just as important.
1993200	1998960	Look, there is no question that these new scientific results, which are not only
1998960	2003360	foundations of physics like we talked about, but also in the neuroscience of consciousness.
2003920	2009760	We've known for 10 years now, and this result has been repeated ad nauseam, that psychedelics
2009760	2014720	only reduce brain activity. They don't increase brain activity anywhere beyond measurement error.
2015680	2023760	That's also not what physicalist intuitions would expect. There is no question that these
2023760	2032400	results are not what the physicalist intuition would expect. But what happens is, and this is
2032400	2036800	nothing new. This has been the case throughout the history of science, and if you want to know
2036800	2042800	about it, read a wonderful little book called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions written
2042800	2046480	in 1969, I believe, the third edition, which is the one you should read.
2050000	2053280	What's happening now is what has happened many times before in history.
2056080	2061520	A certain metaphysics, a certain worldview, a certain paradigm, which is the word used in that
2061520	2071040	book, resists evidence that contradicted, and it keeps on resisting that evidence until it becomes
2071120	2078000	completely untenable. There are two conditions. One, it becomes completely untenable. You run
2078000	2085760	out of excuses, and two, you have to have an alternative that is viable. You never abandon
2086960	2095120	a paradigm or a metaphysics or a worldview just because it is untenable. Human psychology sticks
2095120	2100880	to what it knows isn't true until it has an alternative that looks more appetizing.
2102320	2109360	These two conditions have to be fulfilled, and the alternative cannot be something that you
2110240	2118240	find in a book after you devoured an enormous library for 10 years. It cannot be hidden.
2118240	2124000	It has to be in your face. It has to be talked about. It has to be known. It has to be common
2124000	2131040	knowledge in a culture. Analytic idealism, more idealism in general, has not achieved
2131040	2139360	that status yet. There are a surprising number of academics who do not understand idealism.
2139360	2147440	They mix it up with solipsism. They mix it up with upon experientialism. It's a catastrophe of
2147440	2157200	ignorance. The first criterion is not yet met, but the second one is also not met,
2157760	2166080	which is we haven't run out of excuses yet. Our tolerance for absurd excuses has increased
2166080	2173920	a lot because of science fiction. We have become trained by mainstream science fiction
2174720	2181440	to completely abandon our natural sense of plausibility. Think of theories like Black Mirror
2182000	2191680	and stuff like that. You can upload your consciousness to a computer. It griges nonsense,
2193600	2200480	or the aberration view of multiverses. There are many multiverse theories, some of which are quite
2200480	2209040	reasonable, but this particular one is egregious as well. The way we explain how Alice and Bob's
2209040	2214080	measurements are correlated is that everything that can happen actually does happen just in a
2214080	2221600	parallel universe. Congratulations. You just found a way to accept anything, any kind of bullshit
2221680	2226960	that doesn't violate first principles can now be accepted on the basis of this. But
2228560	2234720	look, from the moment my mouth started open when I said the last word,
2236080	2243280	countless gazillions of physical universes, as big as this one, have popped into existence
2243280	2247920	out of nothing for no reason, for which we have precisely zero empirical evidence.
2248320	2257200	I mean, we now accept this as plausible. Now, there are YouTube videos from respectable channels
2257200	2264720	like Veritasium that say, well, this is probably true. I mean, you have to hang your rationality
2264720	2272400	at the door when you come into a room before you say that. But we have legitimized nonsense
2272960	2278000	through science fiction, which has given enormous scope for excuses.
2278720	2285040	So it allows people to say, well, those experiments that just won the Nobel Prize,
2285040	2290720	they don't mean actually that physical entities do not have standalone existence. You know why?
2290720	2297600	Because there are these hidden variables in nature that are global. They are spread across
2297600	2303360	space and time. They are everywhere. And they do exactly what needs to be done for us to continue
2303360	2310400	to believe in physicalism. But how? Oh, we have no idea. Okay. What are those hidden variables?
2310400	2317440	Can you at least theoretically define them? No. We define them in terms of what they need to do,
2317440	2322480	so we can continue to believe in physicalism. Is there any evidence for these hidden variables?
2322480	2331760	No. Not an iota. Yeah. I mean, this is worse than religion. It's much worse than religion because
2332640	2340800	in religion, you at least are basing your faith in some states, like your intuitions.
2342800	2350800	You're basing it in some states, in something that comes across as substantial in some way.
2351760	2357600	But this is based on nothing. This is based on trying to make nature fit your theory,
2357600	2364640	as opposed to making your theory fit nature. Unfortunately, this is widespread. So we are
2364640	2372960	nowhere near running out of excuses because we've now been, we've grown in our culture to accept
2372960	2378720	tremendous implausibility as something that may be the case. It's probably true.
2379360	2386800	No, it's probably true. There we go. Yeah, there's a lot of those. Okay. So chapter two, I think,
2386800	2391840	look, so physicalism, we've concluded, we've spoken about why that fails on all those post
2391840	2395360	enlightenment values. Anything else about physicalism you want to touch on, Bernardo?
2395360	2401360	Anything else? Yeah, chapter three, right? Let's investigate now. We'll move on to the next one.
2401360	2404480	I mean, this one is something I know you're very passionate about talking about as well.
2404560	2409120	Let's investigate the insoluble problems of constitutive panpsychism.
2409120	2414160	Passionable metaphysics postulates consciousness to be a fundamental property of matter.
2415600	2421840	Well, let's first look at the differences. What idealism says is that everything is mental state,
2422960	2427360	not your mental states alone or my mental states alone, mental states at large,
2427360	2432480	everything's a mental state. Physical states are representations of mental states upon
2432480	2437760	measurement. But even the physical states are mental, because the contents of the screen of
2437760	2445600	perception, the things we see, hear, touch, feel, they're experiential as well. So we have mental
2445600	2452240	states representing other mental states. All there is is mental state. Matter is a mental
2452240	2462000	representation of other mental states. Pencychism is not like that. Pencychism says what really exists
2462000	2467680	is matter. And matter has physical properties that are not mental, such as mass, charts,
2467680	2473280	pain, momentum. But in addition to having physical properties, matter also has mental
2473280	2479760	properties that are fundamental and irreducible. So mass, charge, momentum, and an experience.
2481200	2487040	Still, an experience is now seen either as a property of matter or as the intrinsic nature
2487040	2493600	of matter. In this latter case, it comes closer to idealism, but not much. Because even if experience
2493600	2499760	is the intrinsic nature of matter, the structure of reality is still the structure of matter,
2499760	2504080	the structure we perceive on the screen of perception. In other words, reality is still
2504080	2509920	made of tiny little particles that come together to form bigger physical arrangements and bigger
2509920	2515200	consciousnesses. Because the mental states somehow are supposed to combine with one another until
2515840	2521600	giving rise to what it feels like to be us. A combination of the mental states of every
2521600	2528880	subatomic particle in our brain. Something like this. So constitutive Pencychism is different
2528880	2534800	from idealism. Now, why is constitutive Pencychism obviously wrong? There are many reasons. I
2534800	2541120	mentioned one reason, and then I'll try to dissect the intuition behind Pencychism. So even drop
2541120	2548480	that motivation to begin with. But first one, Empiricalism. Pencychism assumes that at the
2548480	2554400	bottom level of nature, according to modern physics, there are subatomic particles. In other words,
2555280	2562400	discrete little building blocks with spatial boundaries that form structure. By the way,
2562400	2569600	they either split apart or come together. This is incredibly naive. This would have been acceptable
2569600	2578720	in physics up to the mid-1920s. But by the late 1940s, we've known better. When physicists,
2579760	2586000	and by this, what I mean is high-energy physicists or theoretical physicists working foundations
2586000	2591840	of physics. Because we have solid state physicists and applied physicists, applied physics guys,
2591840	2598240	and they tend to make the same mistake. Because it's a model that works in practice. Let's think
2598240	2606000	of nature as casillions of little bricks. But we know that's not the case. Because since the advent
2606000	2612080	of quantum field theory in the late 40s, well, that was quantum electrodynamics by Feynman. And then
2612080	2620560	that was extrapolated not only to electromagnetism, but to all the other families of particles.
2621200	2626960	So now we have quantum field theory. We know that what we call particles, we use the word as a
2626960	2637040	metaphor. Particles are like ripples, excitations of underlying quantum fields. A ripple on a lake
2637680	2643840	can be characterized through physical quantities. A ripple has a certain height, has a certain speed,
2643840	2650640	a direction of movement, a certain width and breadth. But that doesn't mean that the ripple is
2650640	2655840	something other than the lake. The ripple is a doing of the lake. You cannot fish the ripple out of
2655840	2661920	the lake. The ripple is something the lake does. There's only the lake. There are no ripples. You
2661920	2667520	see what I mean? So in exactly the same way, there are only the quantum fields. There are no
2667520	2673600	elementary subatomic particles. And yet we talk about the properties of elementary subatomic particles,
2673600	2677840	spin, charge, momentum. Yeah, just like the ripple has a certain height, speed, the direction of
2677840	2682000	movement. It doesn't mean that there is anything to particles other than the underlying quantum
2682000	2688160	field. There are only quantum fields and they are not spatially bound. They do not have spatial
2688160	2696640	boundaries. They cut across the entire universe. And this is true in very significant ways because
2696640	2701920	without it, we could not explain a great many things. For instance, we could not explain particle
2701920	2709040	interactions, which is how I grew up. My first job was at CERN. And CERN is about the experimental
2709120	2713600	study of particle interactions. You use a collider to make particles interact.
2716560	2723760	When particles interact, they produce other particles that were not part of them.
2724880	2730080	For instance, when you produce a Higgs boson in the atlas experiment at CERN,
2730880	2736800	that Higgs boson decays into particles that were not part of the Higgs boson.
2736800	2740720	And that's what we measure. You can never measure the Higgs boson. It decays too quickly before it
2740720	2746960	interacts with any measurement surface. So one of the possibilities is that the Higgs boson decays
2746960	2754080	into two muons or heavy electrons. But the Higgs boson is not made of two muons. There aren't
2754080	2760720	muons inside the Higgs boson. And yet somehow the Higgs boson, when it seizes to exist, two muons
2760720	2766320	appear. And that's what we measure. How do you explain that? Well, you cannot explain it without
2766320	2772560	quantum field theory, because the muon was a certain ripple, and that ripple decayed into two
2772560	2778080	other ripples. And that's all there is to it. There was never a Higgs boson. There were never
2778080	2784400	two muons. There were patterns of excitation of underlying quantum fields, which decay and
2785040	2791040	take on different patterns. A ripple can decay and become lower in height, longer in breath,
2791600	2798720	and reduce speed. That's why particles decay into other particles. Or another thing that you
2798720	2804160	cannot explain without quantum field theory, unless you are prepared to accept magic,
2804160	2810160	is quantum fluctuations, the spontaneous appearance and disappearance of elementary
2810160	2815600	particles in a complete vacuum. I mean, this is bloody magic if you think particles are little
2815680	2821840	bricks. Little bricks pop into existence, and little bricks pop out of existence. No, that's
2821840	2830240	not what's happening. What's happening are the unavoidable noise or the unavoidable excitation
2830240	2834960	on the surface of a lake. If you look, even a very calm lake, if you look at it with a
2834960	2840000	magnifying glass, you see there are tiny little ripples appearing and disappearing everywhere.
2840880	2845440	The same thing on the fabric of reality, and that's quantum fluctuations. I mean, I could
2845440	2850960	go on and on. There are no bloody particles. There are only feuds. Feuds are not spatially
2850960	2859040	unbound. Therefore, insofar as constitutive pentpsychism assumes very naively that the
2859040	2863600	elementary building blocks of nature are particles, which it does for it to be able to work.
2864400	2871680	It's just wrong. This is not a philosophical opinion. This is a scientific bloody fact.
2872640	2880640	The whole thing is based on a surprising ignorance of, we could say, modern physics,
2880640	2888080	but it's by now a century old. I mean, it's not even really very modern anymore. For the past 50
2888080	2893840	years, we've been trying to go beyond quantum field theory and fold gravity into it. I mean,
2893840	2898080	that quantum field theory is right. I mean, it's the most successful theory in the history of mankind.
2899040	2905680	So, yeah, it's pentpsychism is wrong. Now, let's explore the intuition behind it. Sorry for the
2905680	2910000	long-winded answer. Go ahead. I mean, this is literally your opportunity to do that.
2911680	2919520	The intuition behind pentpsychism is that we are compound beings. We are made of discrete
2919520	2928240	little cells, billions of them. Therefore, our minds should be compound as well. Our consciousness
2928240	2935280	should also be made of a combination of casillions of little consciousnesses. Our subjectivity should
2935280	2941280	be made of the combination of casillions of little subjectivities, because after all, we are compound.
2942240	2946720	So should our consciousness be compound? Ergo constitutive pentpsychism.
2947600	2953520	Now, this makes all kinds of mistakes. The first one, which I would just mention without going in
2953520	2959360	depth, is it mistakes the structure of what is represented on the screen of perception
2960160	2966080	or the structure of the perceiver. It's like mistaking the pixelation of my screen
2967120	2975280	for a pixelation of my subjectivity. Particles or elementary subatomic processes,
2975920	2982960	they are the pixels of the screen of perception, not necessarily the structure of the perceiver.
2982960	2989360	But you say, well, you are a perceiver, and if I would look at your body with a big magnifying
2989360	2995520	glass, I would see that it's made of little pixels, little subatomic particles. And I know
2995520	3001680	my body is not my subjectivity. My body is the appearance of my subjectivity on a screen of
3001680	3007920	perception. My body is itself a representation. It's what my subjectivity looks like on the
3007920	3012720	screen of perception that we call the physical world. So that pixelation you're seeing is the
3012720	3018400	pixelation of the representation of my subjectivity, not necessarily of the subject. So that's one
3018400	3023280	error. The other error is more subtle, so I won't spend a little more time with it.
3024080	3031280	It's this very notion that we are actually assembled together by a number of cells.
3033040	3038800	If we look at a grown human body, yes, you'll find lots of cells. And then you may confuse it
3038800	3045920	with a car, because a car is also made of parts. We are made of parts, cells, the cars made of parts.
3045920	3050240	What you have to remember is how the car came to being and how a human being came to being.
3050800	3058000	A car was assembled. Parts were brought together from different places and then welded together
3058000	3065680	or bolted together to form a car. Our car truly is a compound entity. But we are not.
3067760	3074400	We were not formed by gazillions of little cells crawling towards one another on the
3074400	3079440	ground and then piling up on top of one another until, hey, here, a human being. That's not how
3079440	3085440	it happened. We grew. We were not assembled. And if you look at growth, immediately after
3085440	3094320	facundation, and you know that, of course, better than most people are hearing, the egg,
3094320	3102160	the fertilized egg, is a single cell. It's not a compound organism. It's one cell.
3102400	3110160	Three days later, it's eight cells. But if you look at it, you realize that those eight cells
3110160	3118480	is just a linguistic way to say that the original zygote or the original egg fertilized developed
3118480	3128400	in their structure. Our cells are not parts. They are a kind of self-similar or fractal
3129360	3137120	inner structuring of the original zygote. In other words, I am still that zygote that was
3137120	3143280	in the womb of my mother nine months before I was born. It's just that that zygote got bigger
3144160	3150720	and created internal differentiation in a self-similar way. So it started as a cell,
3150720	3157920	so its internal differentiation has the shape of, guess what, cells. Because it was a cell. It
3157920	3163200	only knew how to be a cell, so its internal differentiation is cell-like. There's nothing
3163200	3170480	really counter-intuitive or surprising about this. We are as unitary and non-compound as adults
3170480	3176800	as we were when we were a one-day-old zygote in the womb of our mothers. It's just that it's a big
3176800	3182720	and highly internally differentiated zygote right now. We are not compound, so that very
3182800	3190560	intuition behind panpsychism is wrong because it naively presupposes that we were formed by
3190560	3195600	casillions of cells crawling towards one another and piling up on top of one another to make us.
3196800	3202320	Sorry, that's not how it worked. And the clue to it is that every cell has the same genome.
3203600	3205840	That's the physical clue that we are not compound.
3206640	3210640	And Tammi Bernardo, why do you think it's on the rise the way it is?
3212240	3213520	Panpsychism, that is.
3215040	3224800	Because we, as a culture, even amongst the elite, cultural elites in academia, I use this word
3225760	3233440	in a rather pejorative sense, so I mean it pejoratively. I think this whole elite stuff
3233520	3239680	is one of the biggest bullshit in the history of mankind, which doesn't mean that everybody's an
3239680	3248800	authority on anything, but anyway, I digress. There is this sense in academia and in cultural
3248800	3256800	elites that you know what, physicalism indeed doesn't work. We are screwed. It's not going to go
3256800	3263920	anywhere. Chris, of course, just lost his bet to David Chalmers made 25 years ago,
3264480	3271040	that in 25 years science would have an account for experiential states or consciousness. Well,
3271040	3278560	it doesn't. And it's not any further than it was before. In fact, things got worse. So,
3278560	3283920	Christo, we have to give Dave, I think, what was it? I think it was a case of wine. I forgot what
3283920	3296000	the bet was. So, there is this sense of impending doom for physicalism, but there is a very strong
3296000	3306960	psychological need to see this process, not as an error, but as a step in a kind of evolutionary
3306960	3314400	path in which we are constantly getting things more and more right. So, physicalism was a step
3314400	3322560	forward, but it was not the final step. So, now we have to take the next step by reusing
3322560	3328960	the good parts of physicalism, namely that the universe is made of matter. Now, we just add
3328960	3335040	experience as a fundamental property of matter or the intrinsic nature of matter. And physicalism
3335040	3342240	still sort of survives. And we have this warm fuzzy feeling that, oh, it was not all for nothing.
3342240	3349920	We were not stupid. We just didn't see far enough. And therefore, panpsychism now adds the ingredients
3349920	3356320	that was missing. And merrily, we go onwards. It's a progression. It's not an error. That's
3356320	3363840	the psychology underlying this. We want to hold on to as much as possible of what we used to believe.
3363840	3370560	Even after we realized that it will not deliver the child that the child is stillborn,
3370560	3376080	we still want to stick to as many aspects of it as possible in order to go to bed with that feeling
3376080	3383040	that we didn't waste our intellectual lives. Well, this is complete nonsense, of course.
3383040	3390640	This injects human subjectivity into what is supposed to be a rational reason and evidence-based
3390640	3397600	process. No, physicalism is just bloody wrong. And that's the end of it. We owe nothing to it.
3398160	3403040	Science doesn't depend on physicalism. Science is metaphysics agnostic. Science is the study
3403040	3408880	of what nature does, not what nature is. All scientific entities, theoretical entities,
3408880	3413600	are convenient fictions. Nature behaves as though those entities really existed.
3413600	3417600	Whether they really exist or not is irrelevant. We can still build mobile phones
3418560	3424560	and put a spaceship on an asteroid, even knowing that Newton's laws of motion were wrong.
3425440	3432960	Newton's laws were wrong. And we put a spaceship on the surface of an asteroid using Newton's laws
3432960	3440320	of motion because things behave as though they were true. So these convenient fictions are the
3440400	3448320	bases of both science and technology. We owe nothing to physicalism. The only thing we owe to
3448320	3454720	physicalism is that less scientists died burned at the stake during the early stages of the
3454720	3463840	Enlightenment. After Bruno was burned in 1600 in a central square in Rome, burned at the stake for
3463840	3471200	holding scientific views, scientists realized, damn, we have to come up with the story here
3471760	3475920	to say that, you know, we are working on something completely different from the church and we are
3475920	3482800	not a threat to the church. So what's this domain of the church? Well, the church claims domain
3482800	3492160	over a psyche, the Greek word for spirit and so, but also mind. In ancient Greek, there was no
3492160	3498800	differentiation between mind and spirit and so it was all psyche. It's okay, that's the domain
3498800	3504160	of the church. Let's invent another one, one that is not psyche, one that is not mental.
3504800	3510240	And we were not to burn at the stake and lo and behold, it worked. And the problem is that
3510240	3515360	the early figures of the Enlightenment knew what they were doing. They needed to always on record
3515360	3523440	saying, materialism, the old word for physicalism, materialism doesn't work, but we have to keep on
3523440	3529120	using it as a weapon against the church. I mean, this is written, it's on record. They knew that,
3529120	3535200	but at some point with the bourgeois intellectual revolution of Darwin in the mid 19th century,
3536560	3542240	intellectually it's figured not only can we survive the church, we can supplant the church
3542880	3548880	and drunken, as they were in that time, they started believing their own snake oil
3550000	3553920	and they bought into physicalism. There were other psychological factors as well. You know,
3553920	3560320	you get rid of hell, you get rid of the greatest fear of mankind, which is what will we experience
3560320	3565360	after we are dead. That has been the greatest anxiety of mankind throughout our history.
3565360	3572800	And in the mid 19th century, it was gone. I mean, this is fantastic stuff, right? And then we
3572800	3580720	forgot that certain things were never meant to be truly believed. They were political tools. And now
3580720	3588160	we believe that shit. Sincerely. Sincerely. You mentioned so many different things that I want
3588160	3592480	to touch on. I mean, I think the first thing that stood out, I mean, you mentioned Christ of
3593440	3597280	and he lost that bet. I spoke to him quite recently. And I'm just thinking about when,
3597280	3600880	if you were there when Francis Crick was started this whole talk about the neural
3600880	3602880	correlates of consciousness, what you have said to him?
3605760	3612960	Christoph, I regard Christoph very highly. And I tell you why Christoph is sincere.
3613520	3622400	Yes. He's not a politician. He's not trying to protect his image or his respectability.
3623040	3632480	Or his grants. He's honest. He's sincere. And his view of things therefore evolves.
3633440	3639600	Because as he thinks more deeply about things, as he's exposed to more evidence,
3639600	3645600	as he exposed to different ideas, he is incorporating all of that in his inner mental
3645600	3653280	processes. Outwardly, of course, he will be cautious, because nobody in science
3653280	3661200	or analytic philosophy wants to be coopted by the nonsensical fringes. Nobody wants to do that.
3662080	3668160	I run this risk more than most because idealism has for so long been associated with religion
3668160	3674400	and spirituality. Even though that's not my angle on it, I run that risk. But I'm not an
3674400	3680320	academia. I don't depend on grants. I'm pretty free to say what I really think.
3682080	3685520	But Christoph, I think he's quite sincere.
3687840	3693920	And the influence of Francis Crick on him was, of course, immense. Christoph was very young.
3694640	3699360	Francis was already a Nobel Prize winner. And Francis was beyond the Nobel Prize winner.
3699440	3704800	He's the guy who discovered DNA. I mean, this is the Nobel amongst the nobles.
3704800	3712240	This is the meta Nobel Prize. And the guy was his mentor. I had a mentor too,
3712240	3718560	Rudy Bock, who was a famous physicist at CERN. He was a father figure to me. I know what it is
3719200	3726640	to be in the field of a mentor. And I don't know for a fact that that happened to Christoph.
3726640	3733360	But Christoph is human, just like the rest of us. I would be surprised if that hadn't been a factor
3734080	3740320	there. So in other words, I am prepared to give Christoph all kinds of passes for
3741760	3745520	because I believe in his sincerity. Yes, now he's a wonderful. I believe in his honesty.
3745520	3749920	Yeah. And your thoughts on just general neural correlates of consciousness,
3749920	3751040	anything you want to say about that?
3751360	3761920	I think it is undeniable that there are correlations between patterns of brain activity
3761920	3767360	and inner experience. I just interpret that differently. Instead of thinking of patterns
3767360	3773360	of brain activity as the cause of inner experience, I interpret them as the appearance
3773360	3778560	of inner experience. In other words, brain activity is what inner experience looks like
3778560	3784240	when it's observed from the outside. And this is not surprising, the appearance of a phenomenon
3784240	3790560	correlates with the phenomenon. It's an appearance of, I mean, right? So it's a different interpretation,
3790560	3796800	but not a denial of the fact of the correlation, the correlation is there. And to do neuroscience,
3797520	3804080	all you need is the correlation. Because an objective measurement of brain activity
3804880	3809760	gives you an extrinsic appearance of what's going on in the mind of the subject.
3810640	3817680	And that ought to be tremendously useful. So analytic idealism does not contradict neuroscience.
3818320	3824880	On the contrary, it validates neuroscience metaphysically. You should keep on doing brain scans
3824880	3830560	because that appearance is what the phenomenon you're interested in looks like.
3830560	3835120	You look at the image of a phenomenon to study it. There is nothing wrong. I mean,
3835120	3839680	this is the essence of science. Sciences, we look at the image of a phenomenon. For instance,
3839680	3843920	when I am in my work bench here behind me and I'm using an oscilloscope to measure electrical
3843920	3849600	activity, I don't think that that picture on the screen of my oscilloscope is the phenomenon.
3850160	3855760	No, it's what the phenomenon looks like upon measurement. But that appearance is extremely
3855760	3861520	useful. I use it every day. Now, the same thing for brain activity, you're looking at the appearance
3861520	3867280	of the phenomenon you're interested in and that science, that's legitimate. So I think looking
3867280	3873680	for the neural correlates of consciousness, pay attention to the words, the neural correlates of
3873680	3881280	consciousness, not the neural causes of consciousness is incredibly valid. I think there is an issue
3881600	3884880	that for a long time we mixed up the neural correlates of consciousness
3886000	3892400	with the neural correlates of meta consciousness. In other words, reportable experience, which is
3892400	3899120	something extra on top of the experience itself. But awareness of this conflation is growing.
3899840	3906320	And so now we will be adopting, say, no report paradigms to look at the
3906880	3912960	true neural correlates of consciousness and I'm all for it. I'm all for it. I think neuroscience
3912960	3921360	is critical for a healthy future of the human species. And I am not skeptical of neural imaging
3921360	3926480	to the extent that others are because those bugs were found in analysis software a couple of years
3926480	3932320	ago and people said, well, throw away 23 years of neural imaging. I don't think that I think some
3932320	3938480	results are so robust that despite those bugs, many of the conclusions can still be said to hold.
3939680	3946720	So I'm not antagonistic at all. What I'm antagonistic of is when a neuroscientist is biased
3947360	3956640	and tries to fit or communicate his results in a way that makes it sound compatible with
3956640	3965280	physicalism. That I think is dishonest. I think it's a lie. I think not only it defaces science,
3967760	3974880	but it's immoral. And I think things like that should end scientific careers
3976240	3980720	when they become public. I think before we close off a chapter three, which is...
3980720	3984960	By the way, Christoph is guilty of none of what I just said. I had other people in mind.
3986560	3988400	Do you want to mention them or should we just move on?
3990160	3992880	Whoever pays attention to my output knows who I'm talking about.
3995200	3998400	I mean, we're closing off on panpsychism. Before we do that, we have to address the
3998400	4003600	elephant in the room, which I think in this case has to be Philip Goff. Because the last time we
4003600	4007440	spoke about, we had a chat, you mentioned Philip Goff and how he changes his views all the time,
4007440	4011280	but we didn't go into it. So I think this is a perfect time to touch on this.
4012480	4019360	Oh, but that's cruel, because now you're inviting me to freely criticize a colleague.
4019360	4023360	I mean, if Philip's a colleague of mine too, we've chatted as well. So this is not a platform
4023360	4026720	for hatred or anything, but just more often a critique of his ideas.
4027440	4031440	Now, if you give me a specific point that I disagree with,
4032960	4037040	point that Philip makes and I disagree with, I'm prepared to argue why Philip is wrong.
4037120	4042160	But if you just invite me to say, okay, now, no, okay, criticize Philip Goff.
4042160	4045200	Okay, not Philip Goff. Philip Goff's version of panpsychism.
4047120	4051120	It is a form of constitutive panpsychism in which instead of saying that
4052960	4059680	experiential states are a property of matter, he says experiential states are the intrinsic
4059680	4065600	nature of matter. In other words, matter is experiential states and physical properties
4065600	4071360	are sort of epiphenomenon. So it comes very close to idealism in a sense, but not at all in
4071360	4078000	another sense, which is it still attributes to consciousness, the structure of matter.
4078880	4084800	And that's the error of taking the pixelation of the image for the structure of the thing that
4084800	4090720	is represented as an image. For instance, on your screen right now, I appear pixelated. Unless you
4090720	4096800	are using an Apple retina display, if you look close enough, you see that Bernardo on your screen
4096800	4102720	is made of little rectangles. But that's the pixelation of my representation on your screen.
4102720	4109040	Bernardo himself is not made of little rectangles. So when Philip says the structure of nature is
4109040	4114320	the structure of elementary subatomic particles, he's making precisely this mistake. He's taking
4114320	4120320	the pixelation of the appearance for the structure of the thing that appears. And he also makes
4120320	4128480	the mistake, which was forgivable for him when he began, of taking elementary subatomic particles
4128480	4139200	as irreducible things. While physics, for the past 90 years, or at least 80, knows that, no,
4139200	4145360	particles are just ripples of fields. What really exists are the fields. Now, I've made this criticism
4145360	4153120	to Philip years ago. And his response was to say, well, but there is one possible theory of physics
4153120	4157760	which acknowledges that there really are particles. And that's Bohmian mechanics.
4159840	4169760	Came out in a famous double paper by David Bohm in 1951, famous pilot wave theory, which is an
4169760	4174640	interpretation of quantum mechanics, according to which particles really exist as little things.
4175920	4182000	But there is a reason why that thing was never taken seriously by the vast majority of scientists.
4182000	4192720	There are many reasons. Many of them technical. There is that check, or is it Slovakian? There's
4192800	4202960	check physicist, Motel, I forgot. Ludo, Ludo's Motel, I forgot his name. But he once wrote sort of a
4205760	4212080	the definitive criticism of Bohmian mechanics. He took the time to elaborate in every technical
4212080	4220720	detail why that thing is just nonsensical. But an intuition survived because there was a famous
4220720	4227920	experiment done many years ago with droplets on a fluid that were that was claimed to emulate
4227920	4232160	the results of the double slit experiment, but with little droplets, in other words, physical
4232160	4241760	little entities. But three years ago or four paper came out showing that those results were because
4241760	4248240	of experimental errors. Those results were not valid. So even the intuition behind it, it's
4248240	4256160	now gone. So Bohmian mechanics is history. It just it doesn't have a chance. And even if it had,
4256160	4264160	it's such a niche thing that if Philip hangs the plausibility of his view on that, as he did a couple
4264160	4273280	of years ago, then might as well give up instead of going to Joe Rogan and other podcasts and
4274000	4278160	talking about something that by now he shouldn't know is untenable. There's something else he
4278160	4283760	should know. But apparently he's still talking about it. He says idealism is inflationary compared
4283760	4290160	to pent-psychism. And the reason is he says, well, Bernardo, you yourself talks about mind
4290160	4295760	underlying the physical world. So you have these two things, the physical world and mind, which
4295760	4300640	makes me go that, oh, my God, no, I would expect that from a podcast listener, but not from a
4300640	4306000	professor. He's running away with language and failing to understand what is meant.
4306800	4313120	And under idealism, mind underlies matter only in the sense that the thing that really exists is
4313120	4321040	mind. And what we call matter is itself a mental process that represents mental processes. In
4321040	4326960	other words, there is only mind. There aren't two things. The usage of the word underlies is just
4326960	4334000	to cater to popular intuitions. You see a physical world. There is something that underlies that
4334960	4340160	in the sense that the sky underlies the indications on a dashboard. But the dashboard and the sky are
4340160	4347680	physical. The sky is not a separate ontological category. In the same way, the physical world
4347680	4353680	is mental because it's an experience I have. And what underlies this mental process is another
4353680	4358480	mental process that is represented by the first one. In other words, there are only mental processes.
4359120	4364720	There is absolutely no inflationary approach here if you bother to think about it for 10 seconds
4364720	4370720	and try to understand what is meant as opposed to sticking to the mere word underlies as if it's
4370720	4378800	signaled ontological inflation. It doesn't, sorry. I wanted to move on to Jep to four before this,
4378800	4383120	but I have to ask you this question. I know because Philip and Keith now have the podcast
4383120	4386880	mind chat. I love the fact that more people are chatting about this. We're getting into this a
4386880	4391760	lot more in depth. What are your thoughts on that as a concept? Because I know Philip does say that
4392320	4399360	if panpsychism does not work, the most reasonable theory that he thinks is second best is illusionism.
4401040	4407760	I think it's the stupidest thing in the history of philosophy. It's a completely self-defeating
4407760	4415760	thing that only survives by making its own proponents very confused and all tied up in a
4415760	4421680	conceptual web. So confused that at some point they squint their eyes and wave their hands and say,
4421680	4428640	oh, and behind all that, there's the answer. That's how it survives. It's not a product
4428640	4436080	of clear thinking. Let's first address it from the obvious perspective. We will go deeper because
4436800	4443520	most listeners should believe that the proponents cannot be this drastically wrong,
4443600	4448000	that they see a little deeper than this. So the obvious perspective is
4448800	4454800	an illusion is already an instance of a conscious process. You experience an illusion.
4455680	4460880	So you cannot dismiss the existence of consciousness by appealing to illusions
4460880	4468400	because illusions are already instances of that which you want to dismiss. So it's immediately
4468400	4474720	self-defeating. If consciousness is an illusion, then consciousness exists. If every content of
4474720	4480080	consciousness is an illusion in the sense that it doesn't correspond to external states of affairs,
4480640	4486480	consciousness would still exist and actually it would be the only thing that exists because it's
4486480	4490640	all illusion. So there is nothing else. There is only the illusion. Illusion is already an instance
4490640	4497920	of consciousness. And then you might think, oh, but these guys with PhDs, they must see
4497920	4503440	deeper than this. There must be something to illusionism beyond this, right? Not really,
4503440	4509600	but they think there is. And I'll tell you what they think is there, what they say is the following.
4510240	4515520	And this could be a paraphrasing, not only of Keith Frankish, but of Danny Dennett,
4515520	4526880	his master as well. It goes like this. If my experiences are actually just brain activity,
4528480	4537200	why do my experiences not look like firing neurons? If my experience is firing neurons,
4538400	4544640	why do they not look like firing neurons? If I experience the night sky, the night sky
4544640	4551760	doesn't look like firing neurons. The theory goes as follows. Oh, it's because the brain
4552560	4563440	produces a kind of summary digest of its own activity. And what we experience is that sort of
4563440	4571120	summary digest. Now, the summary digest is not the original brain activity. And that's why we
4571120	4576640	don't experience things that look like brain activity, that look like firing neurons. It's
4576640	4583520	because what we experience is a summary digest produced by the brain of its own activity and
4583520	4591600	not the original activity itself. Does it sound reasonable? It's difficult for me to say because
4591600	4596640	I mean, initially, when I came into this podcast, I actually supported illusionism as a theory of
4596640	4601920	consciousness. It does sound reasonable, doesn't it? So that's the thing to me. It actually does
4601920	4608240	sound pretty reasonable. Now, let's take the next step. What is this summary digest?
4610240	4618320	It's brain activity. It cannot be anything else. Yes. Because if you say, well, it's the soul,
4618320	4623280	then you're not an illusionist. If you say it's mental stuff, then you're not an illusionist.
4623600	4630720	Right? You could say, well, it's not brain activity, it's liver activity. But you still have the same
4630720	4636720	problem that I'm about to tell you. The argument is we don't experience firing neurons because what
4636720	4642640	we experience is a summary digest of firing neurons. But that summary digest can only be
4642640	4649840	firing neurons. There is nothing else it can be. So why doesn't the summary digest itself
4650160	4656800	feel like firing neurons? Oh, because there must be a meta summary digest.
4658240	4661920	Yeah, but the meta summary digest can only be firing neurons.
4663440	4671600	And infinite regress is upon us. You cannot escape this. Yes. And people think they can escape this
4672320	4678560	by doing all kinds of linguistic hand waving. Keith, for instance,
4679840	4690960	the way he defines qualia makes you dizzy. And at some point, you realize that there really
4690960	4698320	is nothing there. There is just an attempt by otherwise intelligent people to accommodate
4698320	4707280	their belief system. And therefore, fooling themselves, they need to fool themselves in order
4707280	4714240	to accommodate their own belief system. And they will fool themselves linguistically and through
4714240	4720640	conceptual obscurantism, which is not malicious, normally obscurantism is malicious, you do that
4720640	4727280	in order to deceive other people. But there is such a thing as auto obscurantism, which is
4727280	4734160	something your mind does to safeguard its own belief system. So you will start adding layers
4734160	4739200	of conceptual abstraction one on top of another until you can't see the end anymore. Oh, but
4739200	4742720	there is something there. Therefore, I can continue to believe that materialism is right.
4743680	4748560	Do you think you fully grasped Sue's version of illusion or delusionism?
4749600	4753840	No, it's not illusionism. Because if you look at the conversation,
4754800	4760080	she defined illusionism as the idea that that some things we experience are illusions.
4761040	4768400	Well, yeah, it's certainly right. But it's not what Danny Danette and Keith Frankish
4768400	4776240	make of illusionism. Because the problem of illusionism is that it is either incoherent,
4776480	4786640	or it is irrelevant. Because if it is relevant, then it offers an avenue for solving the hard
4786640	4791600	problem of consciousness. And for it to do that, it has to convince people that consciousness
4791600	4796880	doesn't exist, that it's some kind of illusion, which backfires because an illusion is already
4796880	4802080	an instance of consciousness, but never mind. So for it to be relevant, it has to solve the hard
4802080	4808160	problem, or at least offer an avenue for treating the hard problem. Or in that case, in this case,
4808160	4813360	the illusion problem is what they refer to. Yeah. So for it to be relevant, it has to do that. But
4813360	4819120	if it does that, it's incoherent. Now, if you don't want it to be incoherent, you have to redefine
4819120	4823920	illusionism in a way that makes it coherent. But then it no longer addresses the hard problem at
4823920	4830880	all. And therefore, it's irrelevant. Illusionism is either nonsensical, or it is irrelevant.
4832160	4838400	And that's a conundrum. And because of that, he will see true illusionists, not Sue. Sue,
4839200	4843920	based on our conversation, she clearly is not an illusionist in the strict sense of the word.
4843920	4848880	I mean, I spoke to her last week, her view is more about our delusions about how we approach
4848880	4854400	consciousness, and the illusions of how we perceive the word per se, or the way we perceive
4854400	4861120	everything about this concept. So it's a lot of nonsense in there. Yeah, lots of illusions in
4861120	4871120	there. The problem is that they, this can be a way to create straw man. I had a direct
4871120	4875680	acceptance of this, I once wrote an article criticizing the work of a neuroscientist from
4875680	4881040	California, Antonio Damatio, I think. No, yeah, Antonio Damatio, the guy who said consciousness
4881040	4887760	doesn't doesn't exist. It doesn't happen. He is on record saying that in an article on new science,
4887760	4894240	cover feature. And I criticized that. And the way I criticized that was that
4895440	4901120	what he defined as consciousness is not what philosophers call consciousness at all. It's
4901120	4906960	not even what the regular person on the street would call consciousness. He defines consciousness
4906960	4916960	as a kind of immortal soul, a kind of a ghost, a kind of persistent self that inhabits our body.
4916960	4921760	And then he proceeds to dismantle that notion that there is no self, no personal self,
4922480	4927040	all of which I agree. There is no stable personal self. There is no personal self this.
4927600	4932800	It's an illusion. The personal self is an illusion. But that's not what we mean by consciousness.
4932800	4938800	What what we mean by consciousness is the qualities of experience. And Damatio's argument
4938800	4946880	doesn't even touch that. So I criticized him. And he replied with pure ad hominence.
4947440	4956320	Portraying me as some kind of spiritual wacko, religious fanatic. And I was amazed with that.
4956320	4965760	I mean, I confess it drew a smile, because it was a answer to a criticism that in over 800 words,
4966400	4972880	didn't at all touch the criticism. It was a non answer. And but it dawned on me
4973840	4980800	that it is the illusionists that are confused about what is meant by the word consciousness.
4980800	4986720	It is they who are thinking of disembodied souls or permanent personal selves.
4987520	4994240	It's they who make that mistake. And now they found a way to refute the mistake they make.
4995040	5000400	But they project that on other people. But the other people are not making that mistake.
5001360	5005520	You see what I mean? Like Danny Dennett, he went to great lengths to dismiss
5006480	5011840	the homontulus idea that consciousness is a little guy sitting inside your head,
5011840	5016400	watching the output of your brain. I mean, that's nonsense. I mean, congratulations,
5016400	5023520	you refuted something. Everybody in the world in the 21st century know is untrue. But don't
5023520	5030320	attribute that nonsense to me. Don't attribute it to the analytic idealism and then go and burn
5030400	5036400	the straw man you created. So what dawned on me after that interaction with Damazio was that
5037920	5044320	they are not refuting the confusion of others, the illusionists. They are refuting their own
5044320	5050160	confusion. And they think that they are refuting other people. I don't think that's what's going on
5050160	5054240	here. Yeah. What about Galen Strossen and Mysterionism?
5054400	5063200	Well, Mysterionism, by definition, is not a step forward. In term, it's not a positive step forward
5063200	5069680	in the sense that it's not bringing new clarity. It can be positive in the sense that it at least
5069680	5075600	avoids the bullshit. It avoids the bullshit of saying, oh, consciousness is just brain activity.
5076960	5083440	No, brain activity is probably, it's certainly correlated with consciousness. But the causality
5083440	5089200	here is probably to substantiate that for one and a half century and fail. Then now we know for
5089200	5093920	sure that it's not there. So at least we avoid that false conclusion by saying, well, we don't know
5093920	5100080	what it is. So there is a negative step forward in the sense that you negate a step backwards.
5100720	5104000	But you don't produce a step forward by saying, well, we don't know what it is.
5104720	5111360	I think it's too soon to give up because the problem is not as intractable as it seems. It only
5111360	5118400	seems intractable if one makes some unexamined assumptions that make it intractable. But if
5118400	5124320	you drop those unexamined assumptions, and you clear your head, and you approach the problem with a
5124320	5131360	clear, unprejudiced head, it's certainly not as intractable as it would otherwise seem. So
5131360	5137760	I'm not prepared to give up. Yeah, I will. What was the other thing you said, Mysterionism?
5137760	5142080	I think I just said Galen Strossen. I was just mentioning Galen Strossen and Mysterionism.
5142080	5145360	I'm trying to think there's no other theory of consciousness. But anyway, Chapter 4 is pretty
5145360	5150240	much moving away from the other theories of consciousness, where I wanted to go into depth
5151120	5155840	on analytic idealism itself, discussing how it makes sense of reality without requiring
5155840	5162400	anything other than nature's soul given, which is experience. So I think let's do that.
5163120	5167600	Yeah, can we take a quick bio break? I need to go to the toilet. Let's do my bottle.
5170720	5173840	I just realized that would have actually been a perfect opportunity for me to test out some of
5173840	5174880	these bumpers I created.
5182160	5188640	Okay, yeah. So let's go into depth. Let's go in depth into analytic idealism itself,
5188640	5193680	discussing how it makes sense of reality without requiring anything other than nature's soul given,
5193680	5200560	which is experience. Yeah. So to make sense of nature, we have to grant that there is an external
5200560	5206080	world that we inhabit. If I were in your studio with you right now, I would describe it in a way
5206080	5211840	that would be consistent with your own experience of it. So our experiences are not identical,
5212640	5219680	but they are clearly modulated by something outside them, some set of states that we inhabit
5219680	5229760	and which surround us. In other words, solipsism, we cannot, not solipsism, we cannot say that
5230720	5237680	the whole of nature is made of individual mind states. In other words, mind states within people
5237760	5244960	and animals and avoid postulating an external world. I believe that is impossible. There are
5244960	5252240	attempts to do that that are not necessarily incoherent, tends to go by words like radical
5252240	5260560	constructivism or inactivism. But I believe, and that may be just my being old fashioned or too
5260560	5266160	stupid to understand some of these approaches, I believe ultimately to prove impossible to get
5266160	5274080	rid of the external world. There has to be external states that we inhabit. But in admitting
5274080	5279920	this, we do not need to make them non mental. To make them non mental is equivalent to the
5279920	5286560	following. It's equivalent to be standing on the earth, looking until the horizon and understanding
5286560	5291600	that everything we see until the horizon is colloquially physical in the sense of no contents
5291600	5297680	of perception. But then saying beyond the horizon, it's not planet earth anymore. Until the horizon
5297680	5302320	it's planet earth. But beyond the horizon, I acknowledge there is something beyond the horizon,
5302320	5308960	but it's no longer planet earth. Why? Beyond the horizon, it's just more of the same type
5309520	5318080	of what is in the horizon. In the same way, beyond individual minds, it's more stuff of the same
5318080	5322800	type that individual minds are made of. In other words, mental processes, mental states.
5323600	5328160	They are beyond the horizon. They are not within my individual mind. If I stopped existing,
5328160	5332960	those external mental states would still exist. If every living being would die, those mental
5332960	5337920	states would still exist. They existed before the first living being popped into existence.
5337920	5344480	But they were still intrinsically mental. It's just more earth beyond the horizon. That's the idea.
5345440	5350480	And with that, you can explain nature as something separate from our individual minds and which is
5350480	5358880	not susceptible to our whims, our fantasies, our fears, will not change what it does because of
5358880	5366160	our morning affirmations. There is still a world out there that is objective from our perspective,
5366160	5372720	but from its own perspective, it is subjective. Just like my thoughts are objective to you,
5372800	5378000	but from their own intrinsic perspective, they are subjective. So that's an analytic
5378000	5384400	idealism in a nutshell. And the question that remains unanswered is what creates this inside,
5384400	5389600	outside division? Because to speak of individual minds and a world outside individual minds,
5389600	5395280	you need boundaries that determine the inside of the individual mind. If everything is mental,
5396560	5401600	what mental process accounts for this boundary? Well, the answer is a mental process we have
5401600	5410400	known to exist already for centuries, but we know for sure is a fact of nature for the past 20 years
5410400	5419200	or so. And that's dissociation. Dissociation can literally make you blind to what is right in front
5419200	5425760	of your open eyes, as has been shown in Germany in 2015. So dissociation creates a cognitive
5425760	5431920	boundary within a single mind that leads to the appearance of multiple disconnect centers of awareness.
5432800	5436960	In psychiatry, these different centers of awareness go under the technical name
5436960	5444720	altars or alternative personalities. Studies by Harvard show that 25% of people with
5444720	5452240	dissociative identity disorder have dreams in which multiple altars partake at the same time.
5452800	5458480	They experience the same dream, each from its own perspective, and they see one another as
5458480	5464960	characters within the dream. They can even club each other over the head, speak to one another,
5464960	5470480	touch one another. And when the person is awake, a person with dissociative identity disorder,
5470480	5475600	depending on the altar that is in executive control of the body, that altar will relate to
5475600	5481440	the therapist, the same dream, but from its own point of view, describing the other altars as
5481520	5488160	characters within the dream. And the other altars do the same thing. So the hypothesis is that,
5488160	5495360	okay, there are only mental states. So the unified field of physics is a field of subjectivity.
5496720	5503280	Excitations of this field of subjectivity are what we call experiences. And within this field,
5503280	5511200	dissociative processes form that create these cognitive boundaries. We know since 2014 that
5511200	5516560	people with dissociative identity disorder, if you put them in a brain scanner, there is something
5516560	5522880	a dissociative process looks like in an fMRI. In other words, dissociative processes have an
5522880	5528000	appearance. They look like something. In the context of nature at large, what dissociation
5528000	5535520	looks like is biology. It's life. Life is the appearance of dissociation. It's what the dissociation
5535520	5541120	in the mind of nature and the field of subjectivity that is nature. It's what it looks like when it
5541120	5545840	forms. And that's why when you look in the mirror, you see a living being. And when you look at other
5545840	5550080	people who can't read your thoughts and don't know what's happening in the galaxy of Andromeda right
5550080	5555920	now, they too are the extrinsic appearance of dissociative processes. And that's why they
5555920	5559440	can't read your thoughts. That's why they don't know what's happening in the galaxy of Andromeda,
5559440	5564400	even though they're all part of the same underlying field of subjectivity, the one mind of nature.
5564960	5568800	They cannot access cognitive content beyond their own dissociative boundary.
5569120	5577120	And because of this dissociative boundary, we lose access to the mental states in the world that
5577120	5583520	surround us, which is itself made of mental states. But evolutionarily speaking, it's very
5583520	5588400	important for our survival that we can collect information about the environment around us,
5589280	5594000	negotiate that environment to perceive threats, to perceive food and water.
5594720	5604000	So it stands to reason that we would have evolved to indirectly represent external states,
5604000	5611360	as these external states impinge on our dissociative boundary. Because even in a person with
5611360	5616160	dissociation, let's not talk about pathological dissociation, let's talk about something that
5616160	5622640	everybody can relate to. We all undergo dissociation all the time. Most of the time, it's not pathological.
5622640	5627120	For instance, if you're having relationship problems with your partner at home,
5628640	5635280	and it's really grieving you, but in the morning, you have to go to work. So what do we do? We park
5635280	5641280	our problems. That's a way to induce a form of dissociation. When you are at work, you're not
5641280	5648640	experiencing your relationship problems. You're experiencing your work. But that dissociated
5648640	5656480	emotion is impinging indirectly on your work life. It is modulating the tone of your thoughts.
5656480	5663600	You may become more negative, less optimistic. It's modulating your reactions to environmental
5663600	5672000	challenges. For instance, you become more brisk, abrupt and rude towards people. All that is happening
5672000	5675840	while you're still dissociated from your relationship problems because you've parked them.
5676480	5682640	But the dissociated process is still impinging on your dissociative boundary and modulating
5682640	5688080	what's happening inside. Now, the same thing in nature. When a living being forms, that's the
5688080	5693040	appearance of a dissociative process. But the mental states around that living being are still
5693040	5698160	impinging on that dissociative boundary. And evolution, of course, leveraged that impingement
5698160	5703040	to collect information about what's happening outside, even though because of dissociation,
5703040	5709120	you are no longer able to directly access external states. And that's what we call perception.
5710080	5716480	Perception is a way to collect the sensory input, the sensor input of the airplane that comes in
5716480	5721680	the form of impingement and then translate it into an experience that gives you a sort of
5721680	5727440	at a glance view of what's around you. And we make all that vision. Now, what would be the
5727440	5732560	alternative? The alternative is that you're not dissociated. So you are a telepath. Now,
5732560	5737920	if you're a perfect telepath, it would be impossible to survive. Imagine a telepath in the middle
5737920	5744720	of a roused political oriented crowd, you become completely dysfunctional. So what you need is to
5744720	5753280	have a sort of not direct at a glance view of what's going on. So you see people agitated,
5753840	5759040	but you don't get overwhelmed by it. You have a dashboard representation of the mental states
5759040	5764400	that are outside, but you're not directly experiencing those mental states or that would
5764400	5770720	be the end of your dissociation. So that's what perception is. Perception is the way evolution
5770720	5778480	has found to allow our inner mental states inside the dissociative boundary to be modulated
5779360	5784800	by external mental states that impinge on our dissociative boundary. And what we call the
5784800	5790320	physical world is basically the contents of the screen of perception. And physical quantities,
5790320	5799200	such as meters, coulombs, seconds, these are descriptions of the representations.
5800480	5806640	So the hierarchy you get is that real states are mental states out there beyond your dissociative
5806640	5812640	boundary. Physical states are inner cognitive representations of these external mental states.
5813600	5819040	And physical quantities are descriptions of these cognitive representations of this inner
5819040	5828480	physical sort of physical state. So life is what dissociation looks like. Death is the end
5828480	5833280	of dissociation. There is still an external world that you cannot change just by doing
5833280	5837600	your morning affirmations. Otherwise, believe me, my world would have changed already long ago.
5837680	5844000	Science is still valid. Science is a way to model and predict the behavior of the
5844000	5849920	external mental states. It says nothing about what those states are. That's not part of the
5849920	5854800	scientific methodology. It's only part of the methodology of people who are very confused
5854800	5860320	about the difference between science and philosophy. And often they are science spokespeople,
5860320	5865600	people who don't do science just talk about it. Yeah, that's it.
5866560	5874320	I mean, that's a wonderfully in-depth summary of it all. Overall, I think that for people who
5874320	5877920	want to listen to this further and find out more about it, they should definitely go watch the
5877920	5882720	essential course because this is definitely a crash course. But I think let's move on to chapter
5882720	5888800	five because you've already dived quite deep into analytical idealism at this point. Chapter five is
5888800	5893040	we're reviewing empirical evidence from the fields of foundations of physics and neuroscience
5893040	5897600	of consciousness, which seems to directly contradict mainstream physicalism and suggest
5897600	5902640	the validity of analytic idealism. So one of these things we already touched upon,
5902640	5909840	which is the physical entities do not have standalone reality. They are produced out of
5909840	5914240	an act of measurement. And this is very easy to understand with the dashboard metaphor.
5915520	5921680	If physicality is what appears on the dashboard, if the airplane sensors don't make a measurement,
5922240	5929680	then the dashboard shows nothing. Is it so complicated to understand? It's not magical,
5929680	5935840	it's not quantum, oh my god, quantum mysterious. No, there are no physical entities unless you
5935840	5941280	measure for exactly the same reason that the dashboard dials show nothing unless they are
5941280	5947680	plane sensors, measure. What we have to abandon is this notion that the external world is the
5947760	5953360	physical world. It isn't. The external world is what's measured. The physical world is the
5953360	5960800	representation of the measurement results on the dashboard. So physical experiments have shown
5960800	5968720	already, unless you believe in egregiously gratuitous and inflationary science fiction,
5968720	5977680	like avaration, multiverses, or the magical undetermined hidden variables of super determinism,
5977680	5984080	unless you're prepared to entertain fantasy, experimental evidence has refuted the standalone
5984080	5991280	existence of physical entities. And neuroscience of consciousness now has a number of examples
5991280	5997440	that show a inverse correlation between brain activity and the richness and intensity of experience.
5997440	6002560	The most famous one is of course psychedelics. You have the richest, most intense experience of
6002560	6010320	your life while the activity of your brain has only reduced with respect to the baseline.
6010320	6018800	But there is more. Pilots undergoing g-force training in centrifuges, they pass out. But when
6018800	6026240	they come round, they report, and I will quote, memorable dreams. In other words, what we take
6026240	6033200	to be unconscious is just unresponsiveness. Those people are not unconscious at all. They are
6033200	6043280	experiencing memorable dreams. Or another example, acquired savant syndrome. People who suffer accidents
6043280	6049840	or are shot in the head or suffer head trauma, they suddenly become capable of incredible
6049840	6057200	mathematical feats, or they start composing music like professional composers, even though
6057200	6062640	they have no training, or they become exquisite artists. So that's another instance of impaired
6062640	6069200	brain function leading to broader consciousness. Or Vietnam war veterans, that's a study from 2016,
6071280	6077600	war veterans, more than 100 of them were studied, damage to specific parts of the brain is correlated
6077600	6085440	with a much higher propensity to so-called spiritual or religious insight. A more prospective study
6085440	6091360	was done in Italy in 2010, in which people who were to undergo operations for the removal of
6091360	6097600	brain tumors, they were studied for an index called self-transcendence, your ability to identify
6097600	6102560	to something bigger than yourself. They were scored for that before and after surgery. And
6102560	6110880	after surgery, which always causes damage in surrounding cerebral tissue, spiritual self-transcendence,
6110880	6117440	the index of self-transcendence is much higher. So people have a broader deeper experience of life,
6117440	6125840	despite impairment of brain function. Or even trivial things, like choking. In Asia,
6125840	6131200	worldwide, have figured out, and this is a very dangerous thing, that partial strangulation
6132000	6136240	can give you a psychedelic trip. You can go to other dimensions, speak to alien beings,
6137120	6143280	fathomable experience, just by partial strangulation. Of course, some of them die because, turned out,
6143280	6151040	they actually get strangulated. But strangulation, which reduces blood flow to the brain and therefore
6151040	6156880	reduces metabolism, a generalized reduction of brain metabolism, leads to much richer and
6156880	6165200	intenser experience. I could go on and on and on, but this shows that experience is not caused by
6165200	6170240	brain activity, because there are cases in which brain activity reduces and experience increases,
6170240	6175280	and both happen in significant amounts, significant degrees. So what this shows us,
6175280	6181200	is that brain activity is what experience, inner experience looks like. And unlike the cause of
6181200	6185760	a phenomenon, the appearance of a phenomenon doesn't need to be complete. It doesn't need to
6185760	6190320	tell everything there is to know about the phenomenon. For instance, I see an appearance
6190320	6195680	of you right now, but I can't see what's underneath your skin. I don't know what's on your back.
6195680	6201440	I can't see the details of your metabolism. Your appearance correlates with what you are,
6201440	6206000	you're conscious in your life, but it doesn't tell me everything there is to know about that.
6206000	6212560	In the exact same way, brain activity correlates with your conscious in your life, but doesn't
6212560	6217040	tell you everything there is to know about conscious in your life. If it were a cause,
6217040	6222320	it would need to. There cannot be anything to a phenomenon, but what you can trace back to its
6222320	6227280	causes. But an appearance doesn't need to be complete, and that's why in all these instances,
6227280	6230720	you have experience that cannot be traced back to brain activity.
6231680	6235920	I mean, you've given so many different neuroscience of consciousness examples there.
6235920	6239680	I mean, I'm definitely not going to say, or be one of those guys is going to say,
6239680	6242960	I'll find each paper and put the link down below. Anyone listening and watching?
6242960	6248880	I have done that already. Although you are not one of those guys, there are many of those guys
6248880	6253280	out there. Yeah, that's fine. Now I'm talking about for the audience, if they want to find those
6253280	6257040	things, they're just going to have to Google it and research it on their own. Oh, if you go to
6257040	6264080	which chapter was it? Chapter five? Chapter five, yes. So if you go to the description of that video,
6264080	6268880	and it's not all because there are just too many, but it's a couple of dozen there. At some point,
6268880	6272960	I thought this should be enough for the worst skeptic at this point. Okay, no, then I'll definitely
6272960	6277280	have that like ready for them. Within that, something I thought about while you were talking,
6277280	6281920	but otherwise, because part of it was the fields of foundations of physics. Well,
6281920	6285920	I don't think we touched on this, but what do you think about Penrose's and Stuart Hameroff's
6287440	6294400	quantum consciousness theory? I don't think it, I think it was a valid attempt,
6294400	6299280	but I don't think it pans out. No, but Penrose's objective collapse,
6302400	6308480	I think it looks at things the wrong way. And now I'm in extremely dangerous territory because
6308480	6316720	I'm about to criticize a physics Nobel Prize winner. But sometimes physicists get sidetracked
6316720	6323280	by wrong or unexamined philosophical assumptions. And for those, I am a bit of an authority.
6323840	6333440	So what I'm about to say, I say with humble humility towards Penrose because I have profound
6333440	6340640	admiration for him more than respect. But we are all humans, nobody gets it perfect.
6340640	6346640	So, and I'm too committed to truth to not say what a few needs to be said just because of my
6347600	6354560	extraordinary respect for Sir Roger. I don't think there is such a thing as collapse.
6355280	6364240	I think collapse is a merely operational concept that allows us to operationalize
6364240	6369520	experiments and talk about them, but it doesn't reflect an actual element of reality.
6370080	6376400	I don't think anything collapses in reality. And therefore objective collapse is an illusion
6376400	6381600	because there isn't collapse to begin with. And I think Sir Roger started from the assumption
6381600	6387920	of collapse because operationally, it's useful. You know, you have a quantum system in a superposition.
6389120	6398240	If you touch it, it will deco here and collapse. So that's what we experience doing science. So I
6398240	6406880	understand the tendency to try to take it for a fact, an objective event. I don't think it is.
6406880	6414000	I don't think, if you have specialist viewers, they will now raise all kinds of questions.
6414000	6418320	So at least continue a little bit more, at least to give an impression to people that
6418320	6422160	I have thought about it. Maybe I didn't give you a complete answer, but I have thought about that.
6422880	6430800	Decoherence is not collapse. What we take to be collapse is merely decoherence.
6432560	6438000	But decoherence is such a marked effect that we think collapse really exists. So what do I
6438000	6443360	think is happening? What is decoherence? Let's start like that. Okay, if you have a microscopic
6443360	6448240	quantum system in a superposition, that superposition has information.
6449040	6456720	When you touch that quantum system with a classical apparatus, the information in the
6456720	6467280	superposition will sort of leak into the classical environment. In other words, you can no longer
6467840	6474480	see the superposition. But the superposition is not lost. That information didn't go away.
6475040	6481600	It just became diluted in the classical environment, the moment you touched the quantum system.
6483200	6488960	So nothing collapses. The superposition still exists in the broader classical environment,
6488960	6494320	but you can't perceive it for the same reason that you cannot perceive a drop of ink in the ocean.
6495440	6502560	When you drop ink in the ocean, the droplet didn't disappear. It didn't collapse out of
6502560	6508640	existence. The information in the droplet and its molecules, properties of its molecules,
6508640	6515120	it's still there. It's just diluted and dispersed in a much broader context. So that's
6515120	6521040	decoherence. You lose your ability to see the information in the superpositions. If you run
6521040	6526000	an interference experiment, you will not see an interference anymore, because it's now diluted
6526000	6532640	in the classical context. What decoherence does not tell you is how the classical context
6532640	6538480	became classical to begin with. Because the whole thing is based on this notion that the
6538480	6543760	laboratory equipment and the laboratory itself is classical. But if everything is quantum,
6543760	6549920	how did that become classical to begin with? That's where we need to review our understanding
6549920	6555920	of foundations of physics. But the point I'm trying to make for now is that what passes for
6555920	6563040	collapse is merely decoherence. Nothing truly collapses. The question we need to answer is how
6563040	6572000	things appear classical to begin with. Okay, interesting. I wanted to ask you about this,
6572000	6575120	but I was considering just moving on to the next one, but I was going to ask about the
6575120	6585280	last one regarding superdeterminism. Oh yeah, I had a debate with Zabine Hossenfalder a while ago.
6591120	6594960	How do I describe that without coming across in a way that I don't want to?
6596000	6599600	I think I read your paper about it already.
6599680	6609520	I can repeat some of the criticisms I made of superdeterminism towards Zabine. If you link
6609520	6614240	the video, then people can go back or I wrote about it as well. You wrote about it. I'll put it
6614240	6624720	in the details. But in a nutshell, what superdeterminism tries to account for is the measurement
6624720	6630160	problem. For instance, the correlations between Bob's measurements and Alice's measurements,
6630160	6635120	even though Alice and Bob cannot communicate and the particles were already in flight for a while,
6635120	6640960	so the particles couldn't communicate with one another either. Superdeterminism tries to address
6640960	6649840	that by saying that the statistical character of an individual quantum measurement, which cannot
6649840	6656240	be determined, when you make a single quantum measurement, the outcome is random, all you can
6656240	6662000	determine is a law of large numbers. If you make enough measurements, then we know the statistic
6662000	6666880	distribution of the results. But for individual results, they are random. In other words, they
6666880	6672640	violate the determinism. What superdeterminism says is that, no, there is no violation of
6672640	6679120	determinism. We just cannot predict the outcome of a single measurement because there are variables
6679120	6686880	involved that we don't measure, that we know nothing about. It's those hidden variables
6687680	6694720	that actually determine everything. That's then extrapolated to account for the whole of quantum
6694720	6700560	mechanics and preserve notions such as physical entities do have standalone existence. The correlations
6700560	6705920	between Alice and Bob's measurements is just because these hidden variables are not spatially
6705920	6712720	located, so they provide a kind of instantaneous transmission of information that causes the
6713440	6723040	correlations. If you go a little bit deeper into this general idea and try to explore
6723040	6728560	what it means in practice, what you get is the following. I will use a metaphor, but the metaphor
6728560	6735040	really corresponds to the technicality of the thing. What is being postulated here is the following.
6736000	6741920	If you were, suppose you are an astronomical photographer and you want to make a picture of
6741920	6747440	the moon at night, so you take your camera out to your backyard, you put it on a tripod,
6747440	6754400	you point it at the moon, and then you program the parameters of the camera, such as exposure,
6754400	6763440	exposure time, and aperture. What superdeterminism says is that what the moon is
6764000	6772160	depends on the settings of your camera. If you change the exposure, you change the aperture,
6773280	6782160	the moon will change. The settings of your experimental apparatus determines what the
6782160	6790080	thing that you measure is. How does it do that? Hidden variables. We don't know,
6791040	6797920	but that's what it does. Why is this interesting in order to preserve materialism? For the following
6797920	6806320	reason. If you believe that your camera settings change the moon itself, then whatever your photo
6806320	6813120	shows will be consistent with your theory, because the photo that comes out is no longer
6813120	6818800	an objective representation of the thing measured. It is now a representation of your
6818880	6824400	experimental settings. Nothing is objective anymore. Everything depends on experimental
6824400	6831040	settings, because your experimental settings will change what things are via these hidden causal
6831040	6838240	chains. Worse yet, even if you postulate a theoretical entity such as hidden variables
6838240	6844960	that have not been shown yet to exist, for which there is no evidence, even in that case, the minimum
6844960	6853040	that is expected from a decent scientist is to specify what it is that you're postulating to
6853040	6861680	exist. Not to just say hidden variables, but tell me something more. More or less, what is
6861680	6869040	it supposed to be? Where am I supposed to find it? What would be the physical parameters under
6869040	6874320	which I could expect to measure them or to find them? Give me something to give you a concrete
6874320	6882240	example. When Higgs predicted the Higgs boson in the 60, Peter Higgs, there was zero evidence for
6882240	6889440	the Higgs boson, but he told us what was the expected energy level. He told us what it was
6889440	6897840	expected to decay into so we could know what to find. He told us the circumstances and parameters
6897840	6903280	and conditions under which we could expect to produce it. He gave us the ranges of different
6903280	6909440	physical properties of the Higgs boson. No evidence for it, but he told us what the Higgs boson was
6909440	6914320	supposed to be if you postulate a theoretical entity. At the very least, you have to specify
6914320	6918880	what it's supposed to be so people can look for it. And sure enough, we went looking for it and we
6918880	6925520	found it. By the way, we found it within the range that Peter Higgs predicted. It was not
6925520	6931920	being in the middle of it. It was a little higher on the energy level, but it was within range.
6932000	6938320	This is science. But Zabine, she doesn't even begin to tell you what it's supposed to be.
6938320	6944880	So how does she define hidden variables? Well, hidden variables are whatever is necessary to be
6944880	6951360	in nature such that I can continue to believe in materialism and determinism. That's not science.
6952000	6957600	And during the debate, she told me now she did determine the hidden variables. She even referred
6957600	6964640	to a paper. And I believed her. I thought, well, then I failed in my homework. She determined it
6964640	6971040	somewhere. Turned out that she just, well, I'll just say it. She just lied to my bloody face.
6971040	6976560	And it was an outright lie because I went to the paper she mentioned. And there is no such a thing
6976560	6982560	down there. The paper was a toy model of hidden variables, which was never meant to apply to
6982560	6988400	reality. It was a mathematical exercise. So they could train about writing the equations.
6990560	6996880	Path integrals. Zabine's path integral for super determinism has a term called
6996880	7004000	quantumness, which is supposed to be minimized. And it's like, come on. I mean, this isn't
7004000	7010320	theory. This isn't science. This is hand waving. And in the very paper she referred to, the first
7010320	7019280	author of, who was not her, he says at the end, this is just a toy exercise. The hidden variables
7019280	7024640	we are specifying here cannot exist in reality because we are violating several things we know
7024640	7032640	to apply in reality. So it is, so far it may change. Somebody may specify coherently some
7032640	7037760	hidden variables and give us ranges and give us something that we can work with. But right now,
7038720	7046000	it's a kind of unfalsifiable religion. It's something that is defined in terms of which
7046960	7053440	what you want, in terms of what you want to believe nature to be or how you want to,
7053440	7058240	how you want nature to behave. So you don't say what the hidden variable is. You just say,
7058240	7062160	there is something that does whatever needs to be done so I can continue to believe what I believe.
7062880	7068320	This isn't science. It borders on the unethical, in my opinion.
7070720	7075280	At least it has a cool name, super determinism. It's a pretty nice name.
7076880	7080720	I think let's move on to chapter six, Bernardo. So in this chapter, we're going to discuss the
7080720	7085600	distinction between phenomenal consciousness and meta consciousness, arguing the so-called
7086320	7090000	unconscious reflects merely a lack of the latter, not the former.
7090640	7098560	So phenomenal consciousness is present when there is experience. I'll give you an example.
7099600	7105600	Right now, everybody listening to this is experiencing their breathing. They are experiencing
7105600	7110960	the air going into the lung, the dilation of the rib cage. They are experienced. They are
7110960	7118960	flowing through their nostrils. But they, right before I said it, they didn't know that they
7118960	7123680	were experiencing their breathing. They were not telling themselves in their minds, oh, I'm now
7123680	7130400	breathing. This can happen also with subtle forms of pain, especially with men. Men can be in pain
7130400	7137200	for days that has happened to me. And only realize after days, oh, I've been feeling this pain for
7137200	7144880	a while. So I was experiencing pain, but I couldn't report on my pain even to myself. I was experiencing
7144960	7150880	my breathing, but I was not reporting on my breathing even to myself. So phenomenal consciousness
7150880	7158640	requires the experience, the pain, the breathing, but not the report of the experience. When an
7158640	7164240	experience is accompanied by the internal report, I am now having this experience that's now meta
7164240	7172160	consciousness or conscious metacognition. That's your ability to introspectively assess the contents
7172240	7178320	of your own mind and then describe them for yourself. Now we know these two things are separate at the
7178320	7184480	very least. I mean, arguably, we have known this forever because it's very reasonable. And in the
7185120	7191600	annals of philosophy, we have people talking about it without using the name. Nietzsche talked
7191600	7196960	explicitly about the distinction between consciousness and metaconsciousness. So did Schopenhauer,
7196960	7205760	so did Kierkegaard. So there's history about that. But technically, we've known since at least 2002
7205760	7213120	that there is this distinction when Jonathan Schuller published a paper in which he showed
7213120	7219280	that not only these two things are separate, they can even differ. You can have one experience
7219280	7223440	and report on something else. There are dissociations between consciousness and meta
7223440	7227440	consciousness, which is the title of the paper, dissociations between consciousness and meta
7227440	7237440	consciousness. What often people talk about when they say consciousness, what they mean is
7237440	7244640	metaconsciousness. The experience is that not only we have stuff that we not only experience, but that
7244640	7250400	we know that we are experiencing them. In other words, it requires this higher level mental function
7250400	7257520	called re-representation. An experience is already a representation. If you see a balloon in the sky,
7257520	7263200	that balloon you perceive is an inner cognitive representation of external states of affairs.
7263200	7269280	But when you tell yourself, I am experiencing a balloon now, you re-represent that inner
7269280	7274800	cognitive representation, such that the re-representation points to the representation
7274800	7282000	and say, that is happening. This re-representation is a higher level mental function that perhaps
7282000	7288320	only humans have, and if other animals have only higher animals, pachyderms, cetaceans,
7288320	7296720	other higher primates. But it's not there in earthworms. Probably it's not there in a cat.
7296720	7303120	A cat's not going around saying, I feel hungry now. I have the experience of hunger. The difference
7303120	7308000	between consciousness and metaconsciousness is the difference between, I am hunger,
7309280	7316560	and I feel hungry. Because when you are not metaconscious, the experience is all there is.
7316560	7321120	There isn't the subject who is having the experience. There is only the experience,
7321120	7325760	so you are the hunger. But when you say, I am experiencing hunger right now, that's
7325760	7333200	metaconsciousness right there. And humans are so big in this metaconsciousness business
7335040	7339040	that we mistake it for raw consciousness itself.
7339760	7344240	Yes. At some point, what are your thoughts? Because I remember the last time we spoke,
7344240	7348880	we spoke about how David Chalmers perfectly framed the hard problem of consciousness for
7348880	7353840	everyone, because that's the first step to getting a solution to a problem, framing it correctly.
7354640	7358080	And then now we obviously started the metaproblem of consciousness.
7358880	7361920	What were your thoughts when you came out with that infamous new line?
7364320	7370880	The metaproblem of consciousness is why about 30% of people do not see the hard problem of
7370880	7377520	consciousness, right? I'll talk about this. Just to conclude my previous thought,
7377520	7381920	because I didn't connect it back to the storyline. The important thing about
7382480	7385680	making this distinction between consciousness and metaconsciousness is that
7386480	7393680	when we talk about unconscious states, we may actually be talking about non-metaconscious states.
7394880	7399440	Under idealism, everything is a conscious state or a mental state. So there is no such a thing
7399440	7408080	as unconsciousness. So how do we, how do we account for this nominally unconscious states?
7408080	7412640	Well, we can account for them in two ways. One is they're not unconscious. They're just not
7412640	7417920	metaconscious. And the other one is they are not unconscious. They're just not accessible to the
7417920	7423680	reporting ego because of internal dissociative processes in inner dissociation. That's why we
7423680	7430320	talk about unconsciousness. It's not that there is actual, there are actual states that are not
7430320	7437200	conscious. It's just that those states are not accessible due to lack of metacognition or lack
7437200	7442400	of associative links. They're not accessible to reportability, even self-reportability.
7442960	7448720	Now the metaproblem of consciousness is the problem of why a certain percentage of people
7450000	7456880	do not see the hard problem of consciousness. Why they do not, they do not recognize its existence.
7457680	7464960	The hard problem of consciousness is the following. There is nothing about physical parameters
7465920	7471360	in terms of which we could in principle deduce the qualities of experience. In other words,
7471360	7476080	there's nothing about the configuration or disposition of subatomic particles and fields
7476080	7481520	in your brain in terms of which we could deduce in principle what it feels like to eat an apple
7482080	7490000	or to have a bellyache or to experience a disappointment. There is no link between the two
7490800	7497040	and I already gave you an explanation for why there is no link between the two. It's physical
7497040	7503440	parameters are descriptions. They are the map. But when you try to put the descriptions prior
7503440	7508800	to the thing described, the lines in the map lose their meaning. They mean nothing. And if they mean
7508800	7513200	nothing, of course you cannot account for the qualities of experience or deduce the qualities
7513200	7521120	of experience from a map that means nothing. It's very clear. Now the problem is why do some
7521120	7526240	people not understand this? Some people think that there is no hard problem of consciousness,
7526880	7534800	that it's perfectly reasonable that the physical parameters of your brain as a material object
7535760	7544160	lead to conscious experience. I have theories about this. There are different reasons why
7544160	7548960	some people don't recognize it. I think the leading reason is that they do not understand
7548960	7555840	what physicalism means or entails. They do not understand physicalism. And that's something
7555840	7563840	that I discovered by personal interactions with friends of mine who are very technically capable,
7563840	7571120	very erudite people, not philosophers, engineers, scientists. They do not understand physicalism.
7572400	7577600	I had a friend a couple of years ago here in my backyard and we were having a beer in my backyard.
7578160	7583600	And at some point I sort of got lost in my own thoughts and I made a comment out loud which
7583600	7588960	was basically an inner thought. I said, look at this garden. I have several trees in my backyard
7588960	7598880	and lots of plants. Under physicalism, all of this is inside your head. Why did I say that?
7598880	7603520	Because under physicalism, the qualities of perception are created by your brain inside your
7603520	7610320	head. The green of my garden is inside your head. Oh yeah, there is stuff out there in my garden,
7610320	7614720	but it has no qualities. It's a set of mathematical equations floating in a vacuum.
7614720	7619760	It's the best way you can visualize that. All the qualities that I associate with my garden,
7619760	7624640	they are supposed to be produced by my brain inside my skull. So they own my garden as I perceive,
7624640	7630000	is supposed to exist inside my head, which is absurd. And I made that comment. And my friend
7630000	7636000	jumped. He has a doctorate in computer science. He jumped and said, what nonsense? Physicalism
7636000	7641440	says no such a thing. Of course, your garden is out there. And then it dawned on me that many
7641440	7647360	people who identify as physicalists do not understand physicalism. They think that the
7647360	7652560	only thing that is inside your head are endogenous experiences like thoughts,
7653200	7660400	fantasies, emotions. But that perceptual experience is really out there. No, that's not
7660400	7666160	physicalism. Physicalism says that perceptual experiences too are inside your head.
7666240	7668400	Is that not naive realism?
7669760	7675840	Yeah, it's a form of naive realism. So I think it's my suspicion that
7675840	7681280	many people who do not recognize the hard problem fail to do so because they do not
7681280	7687200	understand physicalism. If they truly understood physicalism, they would have to acknowledge
7687200	7692000	that there is an impassable bridge between quantities and qualities.
7692960	7696320	Fernando, anything else you want to touch on between that distinction between phenomenal
7696320	7701680	and meta consciousness and the unconscious relation? Good to go. Good to go. Okay. So the
7701680	7707680	closing part of the chat of this crash course on analytic idealism, we respond to any objections
7707680	7714080	that you found most most appealing, most convincing, close to convincing you otherwise.
7714080	7717920	And then obviously you can leave us with some personal reflections about idealism in life.
7718880	7723680	Many of the objections are based on a misunderstanding of idealism. For instance,
7723680	7731760	some time ago, some Harris was at the Lex Friedman podcast, and he was asked a question
7731760	7736080	about idealism. And I will paraphrase his answer. I don't remember the words exactly,
7736080	7742800	but his answer was like, you know, the notion that all of this out there, the cosmos is in my
7742800	7750560	mind is obviously nonsensical. And I was appalled by that because here's someone who brandishes
7750560	7757920	a degree in philosophy from Stanford University. And idealism is part of the ABC 123 canon of
7757920	7766320	philosophy. And he didn't know what idealism is. It's farcical, almost. If that's your
7766320	7771600	misunderstanding of idealism, then as per your misunderstanding, idealism is not true.
7773440	7778240	But the idealism you're talking about is your own delusion about what it means. It's not a real
7778240	7784640	idealism. To most of the criticisms are based on these kinds of misunderstandings, and they can
7784640	7790960	come from people even who brandish a philosophy degree from Stanford University. Now ignorance
7790960	7796240	suffixed by the latter's PhD is the worst form of ignorance because it's plausibly believable.
7796720	7807520	Yes. Other criticisms are based on assumptions that people make without knowing that they are
7807520	7813920	making them. For instance, the criticism that often come that I often hear from very highly
7813920	7820160	educated people is the following. Bernardo, if I have a needle and I stick it in your arm,
7821040	7828880	that physical process of a needle piercing your skin will lead, will cause the mental
7828880	7835520	process called pain, and you will withdraw your arm. So here we go, a direct arrow of causation
7835520	7840720	from a physical process to a mental process. Ergo, mental processes are not fundamental,
7840720	7847520	and idealism is not true. Now, do you see the strawman here? Under idealism, there are no
7848320	7856640	non-mental processes. Under idealism, that needle piercing your skin is a dashboard representation
7856640	7863600	of a mental process, a mental process that impinges so strongly on your dissociative boundary
7864240	7870000	that it directly modulates in inner states within the dissociative boundary. We call that pain,
7870960	7877840	but the whole thing is mental. The needle or the glass of alcohol that you drink,
7877840	7885360	those are dashboard representations of transpersonal mental processes that impinge or even pierce
7885360	7890560	your dissociative boundary. So the arrow of causation is not from physical to mental,
7890560	7896800	it's from mental to mental, and that mental processes causally affect other mental processes
7896800	7902320	of a different type. It's trivial. Your thoughts modulate your emotions every day. You have a
7902320	7907360	bad thought, look how you feel, or if you're feeling bad, pay attention to your thoughts.
7907360	7912800	Your emotions modulate, causally modulate your thoughts every day. Mental processes
7912800	7917840	causally impinge on other mental processes. This is trivial, there is nothing extraordinary about
7917840	7923200	it. So that needle causing pain is just an instance of that, a transpersonal mental process
7924160	7929280	piercing through your dissociative boundary and causally impacting your inner mental processes,
7929280	7933440	we call that pain, or you could call that something positive in the case of a caress,
7934000	7940160	but that hand caressing your skin, that too is the dashboard representation of a mental process
7940160	7947280	that is impinging on your dissociative boundary. Finally, there is a deeper type of criticism
7947440	7956400	that I already talked about, which is based on this notion that under idealism,
7956400	7960720	there is only one field of subjectivity, that's how we avoid the combination problem. We start
7960720	7965600	from something that is already universal, and now all you have to explain is the appearance
7965600	7970720	of separation, which lo and behold is very easy to do because we have an empirically established
7970720	7976240	phenomenon in nature called dissociation that does exactly that. So we escape all of these
7976240	7980800	discussions about the conceivability of a hypothesis, forget conceivability, it's an
7980800	7985280	empirical reality, whether you can coherently conceive of it or not, it's your problem,
7985280	7990640	don't make epistemology with ontology, dissociation exists, whether we understand it or not,
7991760	7997600	but you still have this one field of subjectivity and a frequent criticism against it is this
7997600	8004960	notion that we are compound organisms made of parts, made of cells, therefore our consciousness
8004960	8011200	must be compound, it cannot be just one dissociative process in a big unity, it has to be something
8011200	8018080	that forms from parts, but I already discussed the fallacy here is to think of human beings as
8018080	8024080	assembled as opposed to grown. Tell me, did you touch on, I'm trying to think if you did touch
8024080	8030800	on the difference between solipsism and idealism, did you touch on that? There is a lot of confusion
8030800	8039280	out there with these words, solipsism, so the strict definition of solipsism is the view that you
8039280	8047440	are the only conscious entity that exists and that everything in the world, in the universe,
8047440	8052960	is your own dream, that the other people you see, they are figments of your imagination,
8053840	8059440	there is nothing it's like to be other people, there is only something it's like to be you
8059440	8064640	seeing other people, in other words, other people are just shells with no ghost inside,
8064640	8070320	they don't have their own conscious perspective, they're just images you produce in your own
8070320	8078160	dreamy mind. Solipsism is a non-starter, it's not something that can be discussed because if you
8078160	8082880	are a believer in solipsism and you're consistent with it, you're never going to defend it,
8083440	8086160	you're never going to talk about it because you're just talking to yourself.
8087120	8089760	Do you argue with solipsists often?
8091120	8097760	A true solipsist will not argue, what is his name?
8101600	8108160	Alan Watts, he made a joke once, imagine a conference of solipsists,
8111360	8116000	each one of them thinks that everybody else is an illusion, why would they go to their conference?
8116320	8120560	Why would you defend solipsism to someone else? These other persons are supposed to be a figment
8120560	8126640	of your own imagination, who are you talking to? So there is no, there is no debate around
8126640	8136000	solipsism, Bertrand Russell in the early 20th century he said, people who maintain to believe
8136000	8144080	in solipsism actually act in contradiction to that professed belief, they don't act consistently
8144160	8147120	with that professed belief, in other words they aren't really solipsists.
8148000	8155040	You see, solipsism is unfalsifiable because every evidence pro or against solipsism
8155920	8159920	is construed by the solipsist as a figment of their own imagination,
8162720	8168800	but it is not the most reasonable explanation and I'm not going to get into why, there is a line
8168800	8174800	of argument that shows you that solipsism is not the most reasonable explanation and it has to do
8174800	8181600	with observing other people behavior that is caused by emotions or experiences that you haven't yet
8181600	8188880	had, so therefore you could not have imagined them and therefore solipsism is not the best
8188880	8193680	explanation, but that's strictly speaking solipsism and it's completely different from idealism,
8194480	8199440	a solipsist would say other people are not conscious, they only exist as shells that I imagine,
8199440	8203440	an idealist would say other people are dissociative processes in the mind of nature,
8203440	8207120	there is something that is like to be them, they have their own conscious point of view too,
8207760	8213760	a solipsist would say there are no external states of the world, this is all my personal
8213760	8219920	dream, they are all inner states, an idealist, an objective idealist would say no, no, there is
8219920	8226400	really an external world out there that is not in my mind, but that external world is also mental,
8227120	8232960	it's not in my mind but it's mental, just like your thoughts are mental but they are not in my mind,
8233680	8240880	they are external to me, so yeah these are, there's a glaring spectacular differences
8240880	8246640	between solipsism and idealism, things get confused when people use the term solipsism
8246640	8251840	in a non-rigorous manner, I have a friend for instance who talks about cosmic solipsism,
8252560	8257120	he says no, no, there is really just one mind and it's dreaming this whole thing up
8257760	8263840	and I admit that you are it too and that's non-dualism, that's eastern non-dualism
8264560	8271200	and and this is idealism indeed, but it's not solipsism strictly speaking, cosmic solipsism is
8271200	8277440	idealism, why will we use two words instead of one, just call it idealism and by calling it
8277440	8283360	cosmic solipsism you create confusion with this strict definition of solipsism, so I steer away
8283360	8289440	from it, I disclaim everything that has the word solipsism because acquiescing to it is conducive
8289440	8296240	to confusion, and I do think they're really so closely associated in the sense that people mistake
8296560	8302240	the two views that you should actually do that, it's a good way to avoid that, any other objections
8302240	8307600	Bernardo or do you think you've covered them all? Oh certainly not, oh well all the main ones at least,
8307600	8312720	the ones that are slightly convincing, yeah the ones that came to my mind the quickest I have covered
8312720	8317040	them, okay not great, so then I think the closing parts obviously, I know you're not a mystic, I
8317040	8320160	know you're not someone who's very spiritual, you're not very spiritually inclined, you don't
8320160	8325520	like giving that type of advice or opinions on it, but your closing personal reflections on
8325600	8329520	idealism and life in general, and then we can conclude this crash course on
8334080	8340160	idealism is the most self-evident, obvious, intuitive, natural, and empirically adequate
8340160	8347600	worldview that we could have, and we just took a wrong path because of social political reasons
8347600	8356800	in the early Enlightenment, we started believing our own snake oil, there was a reason for coming
8356800	8362560	up with this fiction of materialism at that time, it was a social political reason, and then we
8362560	8368160	started mistaking our own fantasies, social political tools for realities, and this has
8368160	8373600	brought us where we are, and you might say well it's been a long time, no less than two centuries,
8374160	8381440	it's nothing, it's the blink of an eye in the cultural history of humanity, we will overcome
8382080	8388480	this, we put our foot in the wrong place, we will overcome, we'll bring our feet back to the path,
8388480	8394880	and we'll continue to go forward, and it will be a historical blip, that's all there will be to
8394880	8402240	physicalism in the future, so don't think for a moment that because physicalism is mainstream,
8403200	8411200	that this and of itself makes it extraordinarily plausible, because throughout human history,
8411200	8420080	the mainstream has always been wrong, at least throughout western history, the mainstream has
8420080	8425840	always been wrong, we have absolutely no reason to think that miracle upon miracle right now,
8425920	8433200	for the first time it will be right, it will not, it is not, the plausibility of physicalism
8433200	8441680	is a cultural artifact, it has been manufactured by people who are born and are told that physical
8441680	8446800	is true from their school teachers, their parents, their family doctors, and the eight o'clock news
8446800	8451760	anchor, and they think I don't need to think about these metaphysical questions, because all
8451760	8456800	these people who were alive before I was even born, they already did the thinking for me,
8456800	8461600	they arrived at this conclusion, and this conclusion apparently bases all science,
8461600	8468720	so it must be true, and people like Bernardo Castro, they're just taking too much psychedelics,
8468720	8476720	right, too many drugs, I haven't taken psychedelics in years now, but it's very easy to come at this
8476720	8483760	conclusion, and very tempting, because it's the lazy conclusion, it's the conclusion that doesn't
8483760	8490880	put the responsibility on your shoulder to be critical about your own beliefs, in that sense
8490880	8495680	it's attractive like a religion, it gives you the answers without asking you to do any of the hard
8495680	8501040	work, now in the second half of life this comes back to bite you, because believing in it becomes
8501040	8506720	in a personal habit, and it's very difficult to part from it once it has become a personal habit,
8507280	8512880	and in the second half of life it's a terrible thing to believe in, because it gives you the
8512880	8519040	picture that the universe is dead, and life has absolutely no meaning, that if all of everything
8519040	8524800	you learn, all of your hard-earned lessons, the product of the suffering you had to undergo
8524800	8530240	throughout life, all of those are supposed to be physical brain states that lose their coherence
8530240	8537200	once you die, and therefore it's all for bloody nothing, all for nothing, don't think that when
8537200	8544000	you're 28, but when you're 48 you start, oh shit, now all this shit and it's for nothing,
8545920	8553040	and then the way to get out of this completely unnecessary dilemma that leads to depression
8553040	8559520	and anxiety is to review assumptions, but now those assumptions have become a lifelong habit,
8559520	8565360	and it's very difficult to even see them, let alone revise them, but if you can revise them,
8566160	8575680	if you can value your own individuality, your critical individuality as a worthy opponent to
8576400	8582480	mainstream stories, if you have enough trust in yourself to trust your rationality,
8583280	8591520	to a nico extent, as the story begins outside, you can demolish this artificial source of
8591520	8598480	depression and anxiety, and realize that what there is is mind, and life is a configuration of
8598480	8603920	mind, that configuration ends, your body disappears, you're no longer dissociated, but everything you
8603920	8612000	learn through this terrible rollercoaster that we call life, which is exquisitely prone to suffering
8612640	8618480	and pain, everything you learn, everything, all of your maturation process, all of your
8618480	8624880	edification process as a suffering human being, it doesn't disappear, because at the end of the
8624880	8630640	dissociation, the boundaries over, therefore, the mental contents of that dissociative process
8630640	8635280	are now seeded in a much broader cognitive context, they are now seeded into nature at large,
8635280	8642400	and it wasn't all for nothing, if you can get to this point, it will not suffer a day
8642400	8650000	of existential depression in your life anymore, what you will suffer again from is a kind of death
8650000	8660640	anxiety that our ancestors knew very well, but we don't, what we fear is oblivion, which is a
8660640	8668640	kind of existential anxiety, but we no longer fear what we will experience after the end of life,
8668640	8672960	the great unknown, because we think we are not going to be there to experience it,
8672960	8679280	so we are not fearful at all about the state of consciousness that comes after life,
8679280	8686160	well, that's the bad news, that anxiety comes back, if your listeners have gone through an
8686160	8692480	experience of ego dissolution through psychedelics, that's a sample of what might be coming,
8694000	8702720	and there is some degree of dread about it, you know, you are going to exit the state of
8702720	8708400	consciousness that you've experienced your whole life, which is where you feel comfortable,
8708400	8712720	it's your safety zone, it's that state of consciousness where you can repress
8713440	8718960	this stuff, you don't want to feel, you don't want to know, and with the end of that state of
8718960	8723120	consciousness we call life, you may not be able to repress any of this shit anymore,
8725200	8732800	and then what? Yeah, so your life will be very meaningful again, meaning will be permeating
8732800	8737840	every single aspect of your life, whether you want it or not, whatever you do or don't in your life,
8737840	8744640	it will still be immersed in meaning, and you cannot avoid it, but shit, when the time comes,
8746320	8753840	maybe in your pants again, because yeah, I am afraid of that transition.
8753840	8760400	No, you're making me quite afraid right now, I mean, for someone who claims to not be as
8761200	8765920	so a spiritual storyteller or mystic, that is quite mystical, I must say.
8768560	8771280	Well, if we equate mysticism with
8773600	8780320	human, human, being human with dealing with what it means to be human, such as our sense of meaning
8780320	8784960	and our anxieties, then yeah, then everything is true. That's what I meant, that is what I meant,
8785760	8792400	I didn't mean mystical. Yeah, I'm not spiritually in the sense of some external deity that is
8793440	8799360	interfering with states of affairs in nature according to some premeditated plan, no,
8802000	8806800	I don't think that applies. I think we're both the same in that regard, Bernardo, thank you so
8806800	8812480	much, I mean, this was pretty cool, I was figuring out how we could do this, and I think this was
8812480	8816240	the perfect approach, how are you feeling, anything you want to add to that, anything you
8816240	8822160	want to say, final comment? That passed pretty quickly. Exactly, I mean, I looked at the time
8822160	8826400	and I was actually quite surprised, but how are you feeling, everything you feel like you've got
8826400	8830960	everything off your chest or is a good crash course, you're right. Yeah, I think we covered
8830960	8834720	good ground. Yeah, thank you so much, Bernardo, for joining me again, I mean, I'll try and think
8834720	8840880	outside the box for the next one. Sure, thanks for having me again, it's been a pleasure.
8840880	8844720	It's been an absolute pleasure, cheers, Bernardo, thank you so much, crash course time.
