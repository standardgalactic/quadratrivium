0	16800	Chris, talk to me about how you define consciousness. I think I'm going to use your paper, The
16800	22000	Neutral Basis of Consciousness, as the foundation for how I'm going to approach the questions
22000	27280	for this interview. How would you define consciousness and why is it important to make
27280	33840	certain differentiations, for example, contents of consciousness versus level of consciousness?
35040	42080	Yeah, let's run through that. Well, I follow most people in defining consciousness as
42800	50400	having subjective experiences. And I think that the distinction between level and content is
50400	56800	important because it probably involves different ways of doing the experiments and thinking about
56800	63840	the brain systems involved. So level of consciousness at one extreme, a high level of
63840	71440	consciousness, you are having subjective experiences. And then of course, you can go into a low level,
71440	77680	sometimes, for example, people who are in this minimally conscious state after brain injury,
77680	83440	they will sometimes have contents of consciousness, but maybe not. And then when you're unconscious
83520	90720	or in coma, you're not having any subjective experiences. Now, the contents of consciousness
90720	97680	is, of course, is talking about what are the subjective experiences. And in particular,
98640	107200	I and many others in the brain imaging world have been fascinated by the observation that when we
107200	114400	are conscious, we are aware or conscious of some things that are impinging on us and not aware
115360	122400	and other things that are impinging on us. And perhaps the most famous example of that is the,
123840	131360	which I'm sure you have seen the video of the gorilla. So this is where you're instructed to
131360	135760	watch this video. And there are people playing basketball or something, and they're in red shirts
135840	139920	and white shirts, and you have to count how many times the people in the white shirts pass the
139920	146480	ball to each other. And at the end, you ask them, did you see the gorilla? And they say no.
148720	152160	Even though if you hadn't been given that instruction, I'd been looking for other things,
152160	156080	you would have obviously noticed the gorilla. So there are many situations where you can show that
157120	164400	even though your senses are being stimulated, this doesn't actually reach awareness. It goes into
164400	169200	the brain, but it doesn't become conscious. And that's exciting, because you can then ask the
169200	173280	question, what's the difference between the brain activity associated with things that you're aware
173280	179600	of, and the brain activity associated with things that you respond to, but are not aware of. Now,
179600	184960	in that case, that's not about the level of consciousness, because in both, this is the
184960	191360	level is the same. But then you're aware of some things and not of others. And that's why I think
191360	196000	that's important. I mean, it's also important for us clinically, because you're working,
196000	200400	obviously, from a clinical perspective, I mean, even myself as a doctor, we have to know,
200400	205520	we use the Glasgow Coma Scale or whatever sort of steps you try and differentiate between how
205520	211200	conscious someone is versus how conscious they're not. But it's very different from subjectivity.
211840	217280	When it comes to the neural basis of consciousness, Chris, how often do you get,
217360	223840	let's say, feedback from people in a negative manner, trying to tell you that there's no way to
223840	230800	find a neural basis of something that is subject. The neural correlates of consciousness do not exist,
230800	236320	and nearly correlations. How often do you get this? And what are your responses to that?
238480	244480	Well, I mean, since they are correlations, that's why we call them the neural correlates of
244480	251280	consciousness. So they don't, as on their own, explain how consciousness emerges, or why
251280	258720	consciousness emerges. So one often gets this question. And I guess I would want to say the
258720	265840	way I would try to get around this problem is to start asking questions about what is the function
265840	276240	of consciousness? What is it for? And as I say in the paper, I think that consciousness is a sort
276240	282720	of biological phenomenon. It's rather than something that physicists can tell us about.
283840	291920	And that means that I think it evolved so that in early organisms, we're not conscious.
292880	298880	And it's only more recently, in evolutionary time, that consciousness has emerged. And then
298880	302800	from that point of view, you have to say, it must have had some advantage. It must have given some
302800	310000	advantage in order for it to emerge. And then you can, you can then ask very difficult questions,
310000	315200	like at what point in evolution did it emerge? What sort of creatures of consciousness are
315520	321200	conscious? And what sort of creatures are not conscious? And that's beginning to approach a
321200	327600	sort of mechanistic idea, because if you, if you can work out what consciousness is for,
327600	333040	what advantages it gives you, and then you can look at the neural correlates of that,
333760	339200	you might start to think about how you could actually make something conscious,
340160	343520	which I'm talking about AI now. I mean, what would you have to,
344240	348720	how would you program a computer or a robot so that it actually was conscious?
351040	352400	I say I have no idea, but
353120	357920	I was going to ask you, like, what do you think? Let's, there was something I was going to ask
357920	363520	you about later on. I mean, if this is something that has evolved, it must have other ways of
363520	369280	evolving. I mean, if the virtual selection has done this, possibly artificial selection is going
369280	374480	to do the same with us. Do you think it's possible for us to do this? Considering that the framework
374480	379360	we use today, I mean, you using the Bayesian brain framework, I mean, for the listeners,
379360	383920	just so that I can give them some context, I've quoted you in my dissertation a couple of times,
383920	389440	and I mean, I used your work to help, help my work. And so thank you for that. First of all,
389440	394640	your contributions to the field. But the way you guys approach it, I mean, Friston,
394640	401280	yourself, I've read so many of you guys' papers. It's very much part of this Bayesian framework.
403040	408320	And we'll talk about its implications with schizophrenia, etc. later on. But do you think
408320	419120	we're going to do this with AI? Yes, I think so. I mean, I remember, I mean, this has been
419120	423200	sort of floating around for a long time, even before we got DeepMind and all these people. I
423200	429840	remember about 30 years ago, down to a meeting where an engineer was presenting this computer,
429840	438720	which he had programmed to show attention, it could attend to some things and not to other
438720	442400	things. And then he was saying, isn't this amazing? And this is probably the basis of
442400	448480	consciousness. And then some elderly philosopher in the back of the lecture theater got up and said,
448480	450640	have you got ethical permission to turn it off?
454800	455840	That's a very good question.
458240	463360	So that's sort of been hanging around. But there are all sorts of ethical implications
463360	471520	of this. I think, I mean, I don't know what the timeline is. I suspect not in my lifetime will
471520	479120	we have a conscious robotic type device. But one of the questions that I have asked the
479120	484480	roboticists who are trying to do these sort of things is it's all very well developing this
484480	490000	in this way. But I would the question I would ask, how would you know when you had achieved
492000	497200	your conscious machine? And I think that's one of the most difficult questions to answer.
498080	502000	Because it's so blurry, the lines. I mean, where do we draw these lines? It was the same
502000	508800	with humans. We made the Ian Vitale. What is life? What is not life? I mean, blurry questions.
510640	514160	That's very good. I mean, I'm very interested in that because I think in the olden days,
515840	520800	like in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for example, there was no distinction between life and
520800	525920	consciousness. If you gave it life, you also gave it consciousness. And of course,
525920	531360	the monster in the original is hyper conscious. It doesn't bear any relation to the thing in the
531360	538080	film version. And what's changed as we were indicating is we now have a very good idea of
538640	544800	what life is. And in some sense, can make it without genetic manipulation and so on.
545360	551360	And it's very much become divorced now from consciousness. So we would probably be happy
551360	557520	to say that viruses are not conscious and amoeba are probably not conscious.
558480	564400	So this distinction has now been made. But the big problem now is, as you say, is where does,
565200	567840	at what point does consciousness emerge? And how do we know that?
568480	574480	Exactly. Do you think that every time science makes progress in a certain field,
575200	580240	doubters and skeptics will find another way of adding a layer of importance to us?
581680	588720	Yes, well, I may be responsible for doing that myself, as we will see later on, probably.
588720	596640	I mean, I tend to show thought disorder you'll discover. So there's an example of this, I think,
596640	602880	in psychiatry. There's a very nice book that I had to review for Brain, which is about the
602880	608720	sort of history of psychiatry. And what was fascinating is that as soon as some psychiatric
608720	616880	disorder is resolved, it ceases to be part of psychiatry. So you had what was it tertiary
616880	623200	syphilis, which at one point, most of the mental hospitals had patients with this.
623920	627680	And then it was resolved and it was discovered precisely what it was. And then it ceased to
627680	632400	be psychiatry and also was more or less cured. And the same with epilepsy, that used to be part
632400	636960	of psychiatry, but it's now part of neurology, hunting is career now part of neurology and so on.
637200	641680	So psychiatry is always left with the things that no one can explain.
644240	649040	And I think that's the same phrase as you're suggesting, even if we explain consciousness,
649040	653280	there'll be something else. Or I think what will happen is there are all sorts of different
653280	656960	aspects of consciousness, and it will probably divide up into different things and people who
656960	662240	have already had different definitions of it. And there'll always be parts of it that we
662240	666720	haven't resolved yet. And the ones that we have resolved will say, well, that wasn't really a
666720	671760	part of, that's not what I meant by consciousness. So Chris, what do you think then about those
671760	677760	people who say that, I mean, subjective experience is merely just a form of introspection. I mean,
677760	682800	Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, I mean, this is just something we think we have. And it's just
682800	688560	because we're articulating it to ourselves and self-sufficiency, but what are your thoughts on
688640	690720	illusionism then as a theory of consciousness?
692320	696000	Yeah, I think there are two aspects that I don't really understand the idea that
696000	703280	consciousness is an illusion, because we all experience it. I'm more sympathetic, although
703280	710800	the idea is wrong, the idea is it has no function. And this goes back actually, at least as far as
711520	719280	Thomas Huxley, who had this nice metaphor, he says consciousness is like the whistle of a steam
719280	725680	engine, has absolutely no effect on the functioning of the steam engine. And my response to that is
725680	735600	it has a big effect on the functioning of other steam engines. And that's exactly why at some
735600	741680	point, I mean, when you're talking about other species interacting and humans, how important
741680	745920	it is for social interaction, social interaction, that's where you go about with this.
746480	747520	Yeah, that's right.
747520	750720	You want to touch on that? Let's talk about that. Let's get to that topic for a while.
752080	760640	Well, I'm trying to remember. One of the problems in this neuro-based studying neuro-based
760640	765680	of consciousness, and indeed studying subjective experience in general, is that we know about
765680	771440	our own subjective experience, but we don't know about anybody else's. And we rely on them telling
771440	777600	us about it, which is, as you say, is to do with introspection. And this, in fact, has a long
777600	783440	will, and for psychological terms, has a long history, because this is what Fechner was doing
783440	789360	in 1860, which is called psychophysics, which you basically make a noise and you say how loud
789360	798240	was that, which is a subjective report. And you get very, very robust, reliable results using
798240	804320	this. You can show that loudness, you know, follows an exponential scale in relation to the
804320	811520	actual physical intensity of the stimulus. It's very robust. So it really works. And then it
811520	816560	went into dispute because of behaviorism coming in and saying, you can't trust these reports.
816560	821760	And I think that's because people just didn't do the reporting properly. But certainly in the
821760	826080	studies of the neuro-based of consciousness, you have to say, for example, were you aware of the
826080	834000	gorilla or not, for example. And you rely on, or you can sometimes slightly more sophisticated ones,
834000	839040	where you say how aware of the gorilla, were you on a four point scale or something. And then some
839040	844000	people say, well, this is all very well. But when you see these neural activity, is it because of
844000	851360	making the report rather than just the experience? And my answer to that is that the ability to
851360	856960	make the report is actually a very important part of the experience, because this is this rather
856960	863920	wonderful thing that humans especially can do is we can tell each other about our subjective
863920	872640	experiences. And I think, and we can get onto that, but I think this actually creates all sorts of
872720	882000	advantages, which we can measure. And that gives you one reason why this ability might have evolved.
882800	888480	But I'm, I used to believe, I couldn't really quite understand how you could have conscious
888480	894480	experience without being able to, without knowing about it or being able to report it. But I'm now
894480	901040	persuaded that there is an earlier stage where you have the experience, but in a sense, you're not
901040	906240	aware of it. You're aware of the stimulus, but you're not aware of being aware of the stimulus.
906240	911440	This is this higher level, sometimes called meta consciousness. But I think for the one we're
911440	917520	studying human consciousness, the fact that we can report it is actually a very important aspect
917520	922640	of the experience. But then how important do you think linguistics plays a role here? Because we
922640	929520	obviously can't express ourselves as as great as we think we do. I mean, there's so much more
929520	934400	going on inside here, compared to what I can articulate to you. So do you think that's actually
934400	938160	could be a hindrance to the way we try and express ourselves to each other?
941600	949520	Well, I know, I think, in a sense, there's too much. If we try to express everything, we collapse.
949600	958960	And there's some work called coarse grainy or something you can actually, by reducing,
959840	965280	by using these clever ways of reducing what we're talking about to some simplified system,
965280	970400	we can actually get a better account of it than if we tried to put the whole thing across. So
970400	975440	there is that aspect of it. But I think also by talking to each other, we can discover first
975520	980960	what are the important things to tell each other about. And secondly, we can discover ways of
981520	987760	talking about them. In a sense, that's what art is all about, this new ways of
988480	994320	approaching experience and talking about experience and demonstrating experience.
994320	998720	And we're getting better and better at that. And this has become as complicated, because this is
998720	1006160	all very cultural. And we would, there's, I don't know whether people really believe this,
1006160	1013200	but there's some idea that in ancient Greece, there was a big switch between the Iliad and the
1013200	1018960	Odyssey. And this was to do with the way they thought. So there's an earlier stage where
1020000	1027280	introspection consisted of hearing the gods telling you what to do. And it's only later on that this
1028240	1035600	became awareness of this is what you wanted to do. So there was actually a fundamental change in how
1035600	1042160	you understood yourself, which would obviously influence very much how you explained your
1042160	1046880	behavior to other people. So we, and you have this with children, for example,
1048000	1053840	when my grandson hits his twin sister, he says, you know, that was a mistake, I didn't intend to do it.
1054400	1058560	Whereas presuming an ancient Greek child would have said Zeus told me to or something.
1060560	1065520	So there are these very interesting cultural changes, which mean although our brains are
1065520	1071600	essentially the same as they were, whether it was 100, I can't remember the numbers 100,000
1071600	1076960	years ago, the way we use them and the way we talk to each other are dramatically different.
1078320	1082800	That's because of consciousness. What are the differences between the self and consciousness?
1083520	1088320	Or do you think that it was just one thing? Self consciousness is just its own thing?
1092880	1097520	No, I'm not sure about that. I mean, I think the self is a very important aspect of consciousness,
1097520	1103280	but there are all sorts of things that I am aware of that are not just about me, by hope.
1103680	1113840	Yeah. And certainly when we interact with other people, we become aware of what they are like.
1115440	1119120	So I think there's more to, I mean, I think the self is an important aspect of consciousness,
1119120	1122240	but it's not the whole of consciousness. Do you think it's just a model we've built?
1122960	1127760	Do you think? Yes. I mean, this is getting back around slowly to the Bayesian idea. Yes,
1127760	1133840	there are all these models, and we have a model of ourselves, which is very much determined,
1134640	1140480	in fact, by other people. So my model of myself is probably largely what I think other people think
1140480	1151200	of me. With this Bayesian idea, I know that when you look at, let's say, for example,
1151200	1155440	schizophrenia, it shows such a wide variety of experience of conscious experience. You can see
1155440	1160720	it as sort of a spectrum. I know Fletcher also does work on this, where he shows you how inherently
1160720	1169360	all perception can be seen as hallucination or all belief can be seen as delusion. And it's based
1169360	1174640	on these prior expectations and how we experience that. What are your thoughts on that? I mean,
1174640	1179840	because clearly, then everything is technically hallucinatory or delusional.
1180000	1188000	Well, yes, I partly imagine how I use the words, but this goes back along at least to Helmholtz,
1188640	1195200	is the idea that perception is not like being a camera. It's not the world coming into my eye,
1195200	1200160	and then I somehow make sense of it. I can only make sense of it if I have some prior expectation
1200880	1206800	of what is out there. This is what Bayesians call the prize, but it's really past experience,
1206800	1217120	prior expectations. An example of this is that story, I think it's maybe from India, I'm not
1217120	1224720	sure. It's about the five blind men who come across an elephant. And one of them feels it's
1224720	1228880	trunk and says this is a snake, and then another one feels its leg and says this is a tree, and
1228880	1237920	another one feels its tail and says this is a lion or something. So because in every case,
1237920	1242560	they're using their past experience, what this ought to be given what I'm experiencing now.
1246320	1252240	And similar to the whole bunny duck situation, if you've grown up in a place where you've never
1252240	1258080	really seen that rabbit duck illusion, where it's one of you duck, if you grew up in a place where
1258080	1262560	you've never seen a rabbit before, you're automatically going to see the duck. Yes, exactly.
1263920	1268880	And there's this very strong illusion that you must know about the inverse mask illusion. Yes.
1270240	1274800	So if you have a mask of a face and you see it from the inside, where it's effectively an inside
1274800	1280240	out face, you cannot see it as an inside out face, because inside out faces don't exist.
1280320	1286000	So yes, that's an example of the prior experience taking over.
1289440	1293840	And there's lots of data supporting this idea, I think.
1296640	1304320	I mean, basically, our sensations are extremely crude and minimal. I mean, vision,
1304960	1309600	we have this, we don't realize this, but there's a very small area in the middle of our field of
1309600	1315360	view where we see things in detail. And beyond that is all blurred, but we're not aware of that.
1315360	1322000	And we fill things in. And there's the famous example of the, what's it called, the blind spot.
1322960	1327280	So there's this bizarre situation that the retina is the wrong way around. So the blood vessels
1327280	1332800	are in front of the receptors. And then they all have to go through a small hole to get back to the
1332800	1338800	rest of the body. But we're not aware of this hole. We fill it in on the basis of what's immediately
1338880	1344240	around it. And you can fool the system to fill it in wrong and so on like that.
1344240	1348640	With that blind spot, even if you do, because there's that experiment, I mean, you close an eye
1348640	1351680	and you slowly move your thumb away and then suddenly your thumb disappears.
1352480	1358400	And still we know it's there and yet your brain, it's gone, can't help.
1359840	1363680	And there are many, many optical illusions like that. I mean, there's the Muller-Lauer
1363680	1369520	illusion where you see these two lines of different lengths, even though you know they're not different.
1370480	1373760	With the arrows at the edges, once you're close.
1375760	1379600	And the neck of cube, because it's in two dimensions, it can have three,
1380320	1384960	in three dimensions, it has two possible versions and you just switch between them.
1386080	1392240	But then how do we meet our beliefs and our perceptions, Chris? How do we, as scientists,
1392240	1396720	as people trying to figure out this neural basis, how can we trust anything we see?
1398320	1404160	Well, I mean, I think I would say one version of it, which is what Arnold said, I think, is that
1404960	1412560	our perception is a hallucination constrained by reality, which I also said in my book.
1415200	1418080	And as long as the constraints are good enough,
1418480	1424880	we're fine. I mean, that's the sense that we have a model of the world. What we perceive is our model
1424880	1430320	of the world, not the world. And as long as our model is good enough for what we're trying to do,
1431440	1437120	that is sufficient. And science operates the same way. So a nuclear model of how the world
1437120	1443840	works, which marks it works incredibly well. And then Einstein came along and showed us a little
1443840	1450160	bit at the edge of this model, didn't actually work and produced general relativity or whatever it was.
1450720	1456800	It was like Mercury. It was like one of the few things that Newton's theory just couldn't solve.
1460160	1464880	And so I think our perception is very much the same. It works most of the time. And occasionally
1464880	1470880	with these optical illusions, you find where it's gone wrong. And we can now understand them.
1471440	1476960	And what I mean, of course, my being so interested in the social aspect is that, say, we have our
1476960	1484240	own models of the world. And not only can we test it by seeing what happens, making predictions and
1484240	1491600	so on, but we can also test it by comparing it with other people's models. And there's a nice
1491600	1496480	cartoon I found somewhere, you know, which says that reality is a shared hallucination.
1497440	1504560	And that's interesting, because, in a sense, what goes wrong, perhaps in schizophrenia,
1504560	1510960	is they stop sharing. And then they can go off in these weird directions, because they're no
1510960	1519440	longer constrained by how other people see things. Yes, that's a very speculative idea.
1520400	1528080	Yeah. But so in other words, we're all having these hallucinations. And the only reason why
1528080	1532960	they work is because we're all sharing the same hallucination. And it's once someone diverges
1532960	1538160	on the spectrum, that they're no longer in touch with reality. And that's what obviously
1538160	1545120	something like schizophrenia or psychosis is. Yeah. And occasionally, we discover that we're
1545120	1552720	not sharing it. So, for example, people who are colorblind often don't discover that they're
1552720	1559280	colorblind until they're adults. So a friend of ours didn't discover he was colorblind until he was
1559280	1563600	a doctor and they complained that he was feeling the form was wrong. And that's because he didn't
1563600	1571040	realize they were different colors for different things. And perhaps the most famous example of
1571040	1576240	this is the dress. Yes. Where suddenly people wear that some were seeing it this way and other
1576240	1582000	people were seeing it the other way. Yeah, the blue and black and white and gold. Yeah. And it
1582000	1587600	turned out blue and black because they then went to Photoshop, right clicked on it, checked exactly
1587600	1592320	what color was in the dress is actually blue and black. When I told some of my friends that
1592320	1596800	they still they still think I'm lying to them. And this is not a story. And yet,
1596800	1603680	you know that we perceived it differently. One theory is I'm sure you know this is to do with,
1604720	1613520	of course, our perception of color is very depends on what we think is illuminating the scene.
1615680	1619680	And one theory about the dress is if you think it's being illuminated in daylight,
1619680	1623280	it looks one color if you think it's being illuminated in artificial light, it's another color.
1623920	1630640	So I mean, and again, this is an example. That's nice for me because of course, that's the prior.
1630640	1634640	Your prior is what you think it's been illuminating in which you have to take into account to
1636000	1640640	actually work out what the colors really are. Basically like the checkerboard illusion where
1640640	1645040	you see the shadow and the two grays. Oh, yes. And they look completely different. Yeah,
1645040	1649440	I think we think the different color. And it's not people tend to think that we're lying to them
1649440	1653680	when you show them that this is actually the same color. You have to legitimately prove it.
1657120	1661200	What did you think about a fixed firm belief? Because that's obviously what some of us have
1661200	1665600	and there's this cognitive dissonance when you show them that our perceptions are not really
1666560	1671920	always that accurate. Well, that's it. I mean, I would follow Carl
1671920	1680080	Friston here and say there's a sort of hierarchy. And at the bottom of the hierarchy, you have what
1680080	1688240	is the real color of this square. And you have priors and about what is being illuminated and
1688240	1692160	you could be persuaded that actually it's a different kind of illumination. But at the
1692160	1699360	top of the hierarchy, you have belief like perception is accurate. And that's very,
1699360	1705040	that could be very firmly fixed. And in the sense in schizophrenia, I think you have
1707200	1713280	something eventually goes wrong at the top. So the idea that everybody is trying to deceive me
1713280	1718560	because this high level prior that cannot really be changed. And it's very difficult to come up
1718560	1723040	with evidence against that idea that everybody is trying to deceive you, because of course,
1723040	1728880	you're one of the people who's trying to deceive them anyway. And it's funny because in those
1728880	1734080	schizophrenic patients, some of the psychotic patients, these optical, these perceptual illusions
1734080	1739920	don't work on them. Yes, that's right. Which shows that their priors have changed.
1743520	1749440	But that's very confusing. And I think that's more research is needed, as they say, because
1750160	1754720	in some cases, their priors are too strong. In other cases, their priors are too weak.
1755280	1760720	So there has to be some solution to this observation has to be made.
1761600	1766640	So Chris, tell me, what do you think then about because part of when I worked, I mean,
1766640	1770960	we did the philosophy and ethics of mental health, you see how we've had three biological sort of
1770960	1776080	revolutions in psychiatry, for example, when Prozac was invented. I mean, that was one of them.
1776080	1783440	People went crazy. This was the new craze. And it's functional MRIs, better neuroimaging.
1784320	1791200	When is psychiatry going to actually get a hold of you that they really want to do?
1792000	1796480	Is this going to happen in your opinion? Or do you think we're going to continuously fail at this?
1796480	1804560	Because I guess like what I was saying earlier, I think, for example, there's these very rare,
1804560	1809760	I can't remember what is it, 1% of people who get a diagnosis of schizophrenia actually have an
1809760	1818640	autoimmune disease. Okay, I didn't know that. There's a book. Someday there's a journalist who
1818640	1827760	this happened to. And she describes it very well. And I think what will happen is that there are
1827760	1836480	multiple causes of schizophrenia and psychosis. And they will gradually be discovered. But not all
1836480	1841600	of them. I was a bit like in the olden days, I think there used to be something called mental
1841600	1852320	deficiency. And currently, you know, every week, another 1% is explained by some unique genetic
1853600	1861840	alteration, which is gradually explaining all these things. And I think something analogous
1861840	1867360	might happen with schizophrenia, though, they'll be found, you know, there'll be a genetic version
1867360	1874480	and there'll be an autoimmune version and there'll be various other versions. And each time that will
1874480	1879680	then become part of the neurology and what's left will be unexplained and left to the psychiatry
1879680	1886160	so somehow. I want to try to figure out the sort of evolutionary basis for psychosis and
1886880	1891520	schizophrenia. And I remember, I think I was reading something in evolutionary psychiatry,
1891520	1895760	it was a journal, I can't remember the name, but we were talking about how a lot of foreigners,
1895760	1900640	people who move from one country to another, into develop schizophrenia at a higher rate
1900640	1906080	than those who stay in their own place. And if you have to think about the evolutionary advantage
1906080	1910720	of that, it would be trust people around you a little less, because you don't know them and
1910720	1914880	they might not have your best interest at heart. So it's fascinating to think that there might be a
1914880	1921200	lot of evolutionary basis behind some of these mental illnesses. That's right. I mean, I'm very
1921200	1928720	interested in this game, that's the Bayesian story. There's this idea of volatility. So if you, if
1928720	1935040	you're, so this is a new way of looking at learning. So you can have fast learning and have slow
1935040	1941520	learning. Normally we think of slow learning surely bad, but this is, it entirely depends on
1941600	1949760	the environment you're in. If you're in a stable environment, then it pays to learn slowly,
1949760	1954240	because what you've learned in the past probably still applies. So you don't need to change very
1954240	1961760	much. But if you're in a volatile environment, you have to learn quickly, because the situation
1961760	1967520	keeps changing. And I guess if you move to a foreign country, you're precisely in a more volatile
1967520	1972480	environment. And it's interesting that this does seem to have an effect on the dopamine system.
1973760	1981120	So that in the, yes, I think as you increase the amount of dopamine, the learning rate will
1981120	1986160	increase or learning faster, which is good for a volatile environment. And of course, if you have
1986160	1992240	a high level prior that says I'm an involuntary environment, when you're not, this could be
1992240	1999360	produced all sorts of peculiarities. While we're on the on neuro anatomy, I mean, when you talk
1999360	2004480	about how we might have emerged or evolved consciousness, and which parts of the brain
2004480	2011840	do you think are most responsible for this? This is very controversial, as you probably know.
2013440	2020480	I think there are two aspects to this. I think first of all, I think it's pretty well agreed
2021200	2027680	that consciousness requires long range connectivity between different brain regions.
2027680	2035360	And if this breaks down, you become unconscious. Now, certainly in the case of self conscious or
2035360	2043440	meta consciousness, I think the frontal cortex is critical. Because in a sense, it's at the top
2043440	2052000	of this hierarchy. And it is where we don't know much about it yet, where you're modeling how the
2052000	2058480	rest of the brain works. And I think that's necessary for this, say this high level of
2058480	2065600	consciousness for sentience, which is what I like to call this lower level of consciousness,
2065600	2074480	which we probably share with many, many animals. That probably doesn't involve the frontal cortex
2074480	2080960	to the same degree and is probably much more dependent on the long range connectivity.
2081840	2088720	So one of the things, if we think about sentience, for example, one of the things that has fascinated
2088720	2097200	me for a long time is what's it called corollary discharge and the reafference principle.
2098320	2105680	So when we move, and again, Helmholtz was involved in this as part of the reason, when we move our eyes,
2108640	2112400	obviously the image on our retina is jumping about all over the place.
2112720	2118800	But we don't see the world jumping about we perceive it stable. And this goes right back to the very
2118800	2125760	beginning of evolution, when organisms were able for the first time to move under their own power.
2128320	2133120	Almost immediately, they had to be a mechanism which enabled them to recognize the difference
2133120	2137840	between movement out there due to something else moving and movement out there due to them moving.
2138000	2142160	And this is where the reafference or corollary discharge comes in, because you basically,
2142160	2148000	when you move yourself, you have to say in the signal to the receptive parts of the brain to say,
2148000	2155360	this is not the world moving, this is me moving. And I think that's perhaps that sort of interaction
2155360	2160720	between brain areas is the start of something like sentience. And if that's the case,
2161520	2166800	and if that's the case, it's certainly present in fish and insects and
2168960	2177120	all sorts of much lower organisms and us. I was speaking to Ian McGillchrist, I'm not sure if
2177120	2180880	you're familiar with him. We were speaking just the other day, and we're talking about like
2180880	2187120	Kazanica's work, for example, his work, how important that copus callosum is in terms of
2187120	2192480	that long range connection you're talking about, because you split that and a lot can happen.
2192480	2196160	Well, what comes to your mind when you think about split brain patients?
2196160	2199360	How does it affect anything in terms of your view of consciousness?
2201120	2203840	Well, I'm a little bit dubious about this.
2211040	2214000	I mean, one problem is that they don't do the operation anymore.
2214960	2222800	So we can't sort of replicate the results. The other problem is that occasionally people
2222800	2228640	turn up who never had a copus callosum, and they seem to be remarkably normal,
2231280	2239280	compared to the late cases where they are split. So I mean, clearly,
2239680	2246800	so I guess I'm not really sure what I would predict ought to happen. I mean, a lot of the
2246800	2254720	brain imaging work, in a sense, went against this idea of distinct properties for the left
2254720	2260560	and the right brain. So for example, language was always used to be very much in the left brain,
2260560	2264880	but the brain imaging show there's all sorts of aspects of languages in the right brain as well.
2265120	2274160	There's this interesting phenomenon of left sided neglect, where there does seem to be some
2274800	2279440	lateralities of attention so that one side of the brain seems to attention to both fields
2279440	2288560	and the other side to any one, which is slightly odd. So I'm very confused about the role of
2288560	2297280	laterality. In terms of that, that it's sort of a hemispatial neglect, Professor Michael
2297280	2303920	Graziano at Princeton, he has ancient schema theory. So he sort of says that it's more about what
2303920	2309600	we're attending to, and then we build models to tell us what we're attending to, and that's what
2309600	2316320	we sort of call consciousness. It's more of a caricature. We're not really seeing reality as it
2316320	2322400	is. We're just everything we see. Yes, I mean, that's another version of what we were talking
2322400	2326240	about earlier. We have a model of the world, and that's what we see, not the world itself.
2327200	2331600	But I think, yes, his ideas are very interesting in relation to how attention works, and particularly
2331600	2337120	the idea that we, once we, you know, we can model our own attention, we can perhaps model
2337120	2341280	other people's attention, and I would even go as far as to say, maybe it's the other way around,
2342160	2346720	that we start off by having to note, it's very important to us to work out where other people
2346720	2353200	are attending to. I mean, this is not just for us. I mean, there's always nice work with Thomas
2353200	2359840	Sello on chimpanzee. So the low ranking chimpanzee has to make sure the high ranking chimpanzee
2359840	2367120	can't see the food, so they can then go and get it. So knowing where other people are attending to
2367120	2371520	is very important. And maybe once we have worked out how to do that, we suddenly realize we can
2371520	2378960	apply it to ourselves. There's a similar version in relation to theory of mind. So the sort of
2379520	2383920	standard idea was we first of all learn how to think about our own minds, our intentions,
2383920	2388320	our beliefs and desires, and then we apply it to other people. But some people have suggested
2388320	2393600	it's actually the other way around. We find it so useful to work out what other people are wanting
2393600	2399200	and knowing and desiring that there's a pressure to find that out. And then we find we can apply it
2399200	2405680	to ourselves as well. Fascinating. So what I'm going to do is, Chris, the podcast is obviously
2405680	2411440	called Mind Body Solutions. So we're trying to figure out the infamous mind body problem. So
2411440	2415920	I'm going to run through a couple theories with you or a couple of philosophical views. And I just
2415920	2419520	want to hear your thoughts on them. Let's start off with panpsychism. What are your thoughts on
2419520	2426320	panpsychism? Yes, I don't really understand this. I mean, as I said at the beginning, I think
2426320	2432480	consciousness is a biological thing. So I expect to find it in biological entities or
2434240	2440720	machines that are built to represent sort of copies of biological entities. So it could
2440720	2447120	be in silicon. And I don't really, I mean, the philosophers say that this doesn't solve the
2447120	2454320	hard problem of how you get subjected to experience out of a physical entity. And I guess I would say
2455840	2461040	I don't really worry about that at this stage. But the idea that spoons are conscious in some
2461040	2467280	sense doesn't really help me with what I'm trying to do. Do you think it's a problem with semantics
2467280	2472720	here? We're just all just saying the same word in a very different way? I think that's partly,
2472720	2479280	yes, I mean, what it depends on. I mean, does it make any sense to say that spoons are having
2479280	2485680	subjective experience? But if you then think about something like IIT integrated information theory,
2486480	2491520	do you think that's following a similar path? Or because they're also trying to search for a neural
2491520	2497040	basis of consciousness, of course. I mean, they're clearly searching for a neural basis of consciousness.
2497120	2502960	And I think I would agree that long range connectivity in the brain is very important.
2504080	2509520	What I don't quite get with integrated information theory is that they start from,
2510240	2515520	I can't remember five principles of how what consciousness is. And I don't agree with them.
2517680	2522000	I can't at this moment, because I don't agree with them, of course, I can't remember what they are.
2522000	2528720	But I think, for example, that it's integrated. And for example, semi-executive was always saying
2528720	2535360	that consciousness wasn't integrated at all. And it was very messy and so on. So I think their starting
2535360	2543200	point of what consciousness is, is not the same as mine. Do you think global workspace theory
2543200	2548880	does a better job at explaining it? Yes, I think that's one of the best ones around at the moment.
2549840	2551440	Why do you think that?
2552480	2560560	Why do I? I mean, lots of partly because I stand the heart of a friend of mine. But I think
2562480	2569760	but it also I think it fits the data very well. In my paper, I point that out so that
2570800	2574400	if you think it's to do with working, it goes back to the idea of working memory.
2575360	2581120	Working memory very much involves Prato and frontal cortex. You find that Prato and frontal cortex
2581120	2588080	are the bits of the brain that are less active and disconnected in coma and vegetative state and
2588080	2592960	things like that. In the experiments, I actually did when I was still doing brain imaging, where we
2592960	2598800	were showing looking at the difference between things that you were conscious of and things
2598800	2603760	that were affecting the brain that you were not conscious of. When you were not conscious of a
2603760	2609680	face, for example, the face area lit up. But when you were conscious of that face, then Prato
2609680	2616880	and frontal cortex lit up as well. So that sort of fits with this sort of story. I guess my
2617680	2623680	worry about global workspace theory is that I don't really quite understand the
2624320	2630000	ignition story. And of course, it doesn't bring in other people, which
2630320	2637200	is a question. And how the reporting works and all that sort of thing. But I think it's the best
2637200	2648000	one around at the moment. Though I also like, of course, Hakuenlau and David Rosenthal's
2648000	2654800	higher order theory. Can you give me some reasons for that one as well?
2655760	2660320	Well, that one, I think what is that may be talking about a different thing. So I think
2660320	2665360	higher order thought theory, I think, is actually talking about this metaconsciousness,
2665360	2670640	which is this higher level where you're aware that you're aware. And there's lots of evidence that,
2671600	2679040	for example, we talk about explicit metacognition, which metacognition being means thinking about
2679120	2684640	thinking. So I'm particularly interested in our ability. When we make decisions,
2685680	2691840	we can actually think about how likely is this decision to be right? How much confidence do I
2691840	2697440	have in this decision? And we have this feeling of confidence, we can actually describe how confident
2697440	2703280	we are to other people. This is actually useful in when we work with other people
2704240	2709440	to compare our levels of confidence. And again, there's lots of brain imaging work,
2709440	2715440	particularly from Stephen Fleming, showing that when people have to use confidence,
2715440	2720640	they're actually using a particular part of the frontal cortex, that is the frontal polar area,
2720640	2727360	BA10, which seems to have a special role in thinking about thinking. And it seems to be
2727360	2733520	thinking about thinking is very closely related to this higher order thought theory of consciousness.
2736080	2742480	So I like that idea. Yeah, I think it seems like a lot of these theories have so many good
2742480	2748480	ideas that somehow just going to accumulate and provide us with one at some point. It's almost
2748480	2753680	like they all kind of need each other a little bit. Yes, I think that's right. And then, of course,
2753760	2759200	there's an interesting paper recently, which looked at all these different theories of consciousness
2759200	2763360	and the way that they test themselves. I mean, the experiments they do to test them,
2763920	2769360	which quite nicely showed, as you might expect, that they test their own theory, but it has no
2769360	2773760	impact whatever on any of the other theories. So the tests that you use for global workspace
2773760	2779520	theories, Jolly Good for global workspace theory, but has no relevance for IIT or higher
2779520	2784400	order thought. So in a sense, they have to somehow come together, which is beginning to happen.
2784960	2789120	I remember when I was chatting to Michael Graziano, he was telling me how you can take
2789120	2794800	attention schema theory and actually plunk it onto global workspace theory. And then you have
2794800	2800880	a much better theory of consciousness as a global workspace theory is one of the better ones in
2800880	2809040	terms of explaining. I think that's right. But I'm reminded, I don't know whether you read these
2809040	2815440	novels by Sebastian folks. But one of them, I can't remember what it was called, but it's in fact,
2815440	2822640	it's a series of five different stories. And one of them is about this neuroscientist in Italy who
2822640	2829200	discovers the basis of neural basis of consciousness. And I was involved because he asked me to comment
2829200	2834640	on this before everyone knew whether it was plausible and so on. And the hippocampus had a
2835440	2841200	major role. But what I found quite nice about this story was that when she does define in the
2841200	2844960	story, she finds the neural basis of consciousness and everybody agrees it's neural basis of
2844960	2855680	consciousness. And then everybody loses interest. This podcast becomes completely relevant. Let's
2855680	2863760	hope no one can forget it. That's exactly what happened with the Yarn Vettel. I mean, going back
2863840	2872080	to what you said earlier. Once it's done, once we figure it out, it's like magic. Nicholas Humphrey
2872080	2878160	and I were chatting about it, because he calls it phenomenal surrealism. No longer considers it
2878160	2884800	an illusion. He thinks it's more real than real, like red, even redder than red, because we perceive
2884800	2892800	it as red. But yeah, he sees it as magic. That's a good point. Actually, it says consciousness is
2892800	2899440	more real. I think his paper is redder than red. I can't remember exactly the name.
2900080	2907120	Yes, but just on the same topic, though, once the magician tells you the trick, I mean, you're
2907120	2915120	done. The search is over this whole magical experience. It's finished. Yes, I think so. Some
2915120	2920240	people, I won't name names, like to keep their theories, has a little bit of magic. It has a
2920240	2927920	little bit that no one can quite understand. Do you think when people make these definitions,
2927920	2933680	let's say, like when we claim that it's a hard problem of consciousness, that we're adding the
2933680	2938320	element that we don't need? I mean, Daniel Dennis is trying to quine qualia, a quining qualia or
2938320	2942960	a way to make it easier for us to actually find a neural basis of consciousness. You think that's
2942960	2948400	a better approach? Not necessarily an illusion, but to at least make... I think it is a better
2948400	2953920	approach. Yes, I mean, the other extreme is, is it McGinn? Is it the people who call themselves
2953920	2965520	mysterious, who say we won't ever solve it? And I think that that's clearly a, what's the word,
2965520	2968880	a challenge. If you say it's impossible to solve, then it's like, right, we're going to do it.
2970320	2974160	You think this is a way for philosophers just to keep their jobs in certain...
2978720	2984400	Tell me, Chris, when it comes to theory of mind, I mean, you and I, if you've done such great work
2984400	2992000	in terms of working together, humans, why are we meant to work together? Over time, how do you think
2992000	2998400	that this has led to such crazy amounts of technological revolutions? I mean, in terms of
2998400	3003600	what we've done as a species, why do you think humans have done so much more than, let's say,
3003600	3012080	our cousins, chimpanzees, bonobos, etc.? Well, I think, yes, I think the basic reason is that,
3012080	3016880	as we were saying earlier, that we are able actually to share our subjective experiences.
3018560	3023440	We can, as a result of this, we can actually alter our subjective experiences and make them,
3023440	3029040	in some sense, more accurate, better models of what the world is like, because we can talk to
3029040	3033360	each other about what the world is like, and we can get better theories. I mean, this is what
3033360	3038000	science is all about. You have the better and better model of the world. It never gets there,
3038000	3048560	but it gets better each time. And we can... I mean, there's this lovely book by Celia Hayes,
3048560	3054960	which is all about cognitive gadgets, which is about cultural, has given us ways of...
3055920	3064960	new ways of thinking. And these may be more important than... these cognitive tools may
3064960	3071440	be more important than, say, stone tools or iron tools or whatever. I mean, mathematics is an example
3071440	3079840	of a tool which has been created by humans interacting together. So, I mean, and writing
3079840	3087920	is another example. So, I mean, universal literacy has only been around for the last
3089440	3094240	hundred years or so. So, these are the things that have made us...
3097280	3101120	given us all these advantages, which means that we're now dominating the world and probably
3101120	3107280	about to destroy it, but that's another matter. And the other thing, it's very frightening,
3107280	3113440	it could all be lost. Exactly. I mean, that's the... I mean, I often ask this, I mean,
3114080	3119120	I don't believe there is any sort of teleology. I don't... I'm very agnostic regarding anything
3119120	3124960	regarding the origins of the universe or why we hear what we are to do. But do you think,
3124960	3130640	for example, AI would be the next evolutionary step? And do you think it's meant to be? Do you
3130640	3136480	think that's what humans are actually here to do, in a sense? Well, in some sense, yes. I mean,
3137120	3142480	you could... Yes, we wouldn't want to say it was meant to happen, but we would say the way the
3142480	3148960	system works means it will happen. It's the next logical step. That's obviously something that will
3148960	3155600	survive, let's say something a bit more catastrophic on the planet. Should we send it into space or
3156720	3164800	whatever with it? I mean, that's very interesting. And I'm sad that I probably won't live to see this
3164880	3172160	happening. But I'm certainly very interested in, yes, what's happening in AI and DeepMind and all
3172160	3177120	this sort of thing. Sort of quantum computing. I mean, they're doing a lot of intriguing stuff,
3177120	3182480	but I also don't think I'll be alive, to be honest. But I still don't think most of us would be alive
3182480	3188480	at that point. Things are going down south very quickly. But I think even DeepMind, the amazing
3188480	3195280	things they're doing is all happening at this lowest level from a biological point of view.
3195280	3200720	I mean, in my paper, I show this diagram at three levels. And the bottom level, we have
3202000	3206240	model-free learning, as it's called, which depends on having huge amounts of evidence
3206240	3212320	and doing statistical learning. And I think that's what AI can do at the moment.
3213200	3218080	So, sorry, continue, Chris, what were you saying?
3218640	3222800	No, I was just going to say the next step up is to start making models and they're beginning
3222800	3226640	to do that. But I'm not sure whether that's how far that's gone yet.
3228720	3234560	Michael was telling me that they are applying that theory to certain AI. And it's starting to
3234560	3240880	work quite well. I mean, they're making some progress, but they're just very far away to
3241120	3245840	do it with obviously to the complexity that we've reached over billions of years. It takes a long
3245840	3251760	time. But I think we'll get there. I don't know. I mean, certainly, in relation to theory of mind,
3251760	3257680	there are, I mean, my worries about our ideas about how theory of mind works is we don't really
3257680	3264080	have a good computational account of how that works. And people are beginning to develop it
3264080	3272480	like, what's his name, 10 and down? But the, I think it's not quite there yet. And they typically
3272480	3275920	say, yes, we've solved this with that. Well, that's not what I meant by theory of mind.
3277840	3283040	Do you feel that, I mean, we're obviously following this computational approach right now, but
3283040	3286880	it's because this is the current framework we live in. I mean, people often have this argument
3286880	3292000	that when we understood the way pumps work, that's how we thought the brain worked when the train
3292000	3296800	station, we thought it works the same way. Do you feel that perhaps there might be something
3296800	3300160	we'll figure out in the future that we'll go beyond this computational model? Or you think
3300160	3306880	we got it this time that we're almost there? No, I was thinking that there were certainly
3306880	3310800	better things. I guess that's very interesting point, because that's absolutely right. I mean,
3310800	3314880	what was wrong with Freud's approach? Because he started off by having this model of the mind
3314880	3320640	that it was basically hydraulic. And he didn't know about information flow and such like, so I
3320640	3327280	think that was a big step forward is to go. So he was just talking about energy. And the switch
3327280	3334560	to be able to talk about information, I think was a crucial step in this direction. And there may
3334560	3338800	well be another crucial step, of course, because we haven't made it yet, we have absolutely no idea
3340240	3346240	what it is. But in some sense, I mean, this is a sort of Turing story that you can model anything
3346240	3352400	on a general computer. So you could model your hydraulic system, you could model your steam
3352400	3360240	engine type system. What we don't know is what we should be modeling, I guess. But I mean,
3360240	3366640	I agree entirely that we're always using the technology we currently have. But I think we're
3366640	3373680	beginning to get a sort of meta technology. So we have a technology of technology, which may be
3373680	3385600	the critical step to the next stage on idealism. Idealism. I guess I'm not quite sure what that
3385600	3391760	means. Do you mean in the sort of platonic sense? So basically that it's all mind, because there's
3391760	3397280	a lot of theories now. I mean, for example, Donald Hoffman, Bernardo Kerstrup, there's a lot of people
3397280	3404400	who are saying that it's all in the mind, everything is mind. And making some very good
3404400	3409040	physical theories like physics, using a lot of physics to actually prove that space time, for
3409040	3414320	example, isn't as real as we thought it was, according to the mathematics, and then trying
3414320	3420400	to figure out how consciousness could be fundamental to that. Yes, I haven't really thought about that.
3420400	3425600	Is this a bit solipsistic in the sense that say we are creating the world out there?
3427040	3433440	I think, yes, I'm not so happy with that. I mean, I'm very keen to believe that there is a real world
3433440	3444640	out there that we're trying to find out about. But I agree that the way what we impose upon it is
3444640	3450960	obviously must be, to some extent, created by our minds. I mean, this is almost a sort of Bayesian
3450960	3458560	thing that we, the priors come from within. So in that sense. A sort of naive realism. We know
3458560	3463200	that there's something there, but we're just not seeing it as accurately as we might. Yes, I'm a
3463200	3467520	naive realist, I think. So I think, yes, we're getting more accurate. But I believe that there is,
3468160	3472480	I mean, if we don't believe there's anything out there, there's no way we can improve our accuracy.
3472480	3478080	We have to be something, I mean, I'm very keen on prediction errors. I mean, that's a sort of
3478080	3483360	Bayesian story. Errors are a very good thing because they tell us about what we don't know.
3485600	3490720	So I'm keen on the idea that there are things that we don't know that we will be able to find out
3490720	3497840	a bit about. Tell me, Chris, when you started out with this, because there's a book by John
3497840	3507120	Hogan or Hogan or Hogan called Mind Body Problems. And what the author does is look at different
3507120	3513120	scientists, philosophers, Christoph Koch, for example, each one, and it almost goes into a
3513120	3519040	personal deep dive into their life and how their personal experiences might have led them to their
3519040	3525280	current belief in consciousness. So for example, if someone was very spiritual or very religious,
3525840	3531040	somehow things consciousness will be fundamental. Someone who's not, grows up very atheist,
3531920	3537840	tends to think consciousness is an illusion. So how do you think your spiritual views and beliefs
3537840	3545120	have shaped the way you think about consciousness today? Well, I was certainly brought up in a
3545120	3557840	very religious family, Anglican, of course. But I still get a great deal of pleasure from
3558880	3568160	services and singing psalms and peculiar rituals of this sort. So I quite like to be an Anglican
3568160	3571760	on the grounds that these are the Christians who don't actually believe in God. So that's
3572560	3580800	so from that, I mean, so there's that side of it. I guess my main interesting consciousness
3580800	3588160	probably was because I very early on trained as a clinical psychologist. And I actually
3588160	3594480	interacted with people with psychosis, who had hallucinations and delusions. And I became
3594480	3600400	completely fascinated by what an earth hallucination, what it meant to be having a hallucination.
3601360	3606960	And of course, I was also reading Philip K. Dick, which is a very strong experience.
3608320	3612480	And his theme, of course, is that, you know, reality is not what we think it is.
3613600	3619360	And what we, you know, we have been, it's an illusion that's been created by evil
3620560	3626000	capitalists of some kind to keep us down. So I mean, so those two sides may be extremely
3626000	3631120	interesting hallucinations. Why should my belief, my beliefs about the world be any better than
3631120	3637600	these patients that I was interacting with? And I guess that was my start in thinking about.
3638640	3643840	So I was thinking about hallucinations. And I realized very rapidly that this is actually
3643840	3649920	all about consciousness. So hallucination is the extreme subjective experience, because it
3649920	3657120	doesn't actually, it's not based on what's coming into the senses. So it's almost subjective
3657120	3662640	experience without reality. So that was, and I guess that was my main starting point.
3663920	3668400	And then at some point, I mean, in your book, Making at the Mind, I remember reading it a
3668400	3674560	long time ago, for the first time. And I mean, it blew my mind as well. I mean, you talk about
3674560	3677920	various different things in your papers, in your books, altered states of consciousness,
3678000	3682720	so one of them. How do you think altered states of consciousness give us a better idea of
3682720	3689680	understanding of consciousness in itself? Well, there's some very interesting, I mean,
3689680	3696480	I talk about this a bit in my paper. But I think the altered states of consciousness make us realize
3696480	3707120	that, you know, there's more to it than we typically experience. And I mean, that certainly
3707120	3711120	it's a very basis for studying levels of consciousness when you're talking about altered
3711120	3719840	states due to lack of various things. But also the use of psychedelic drugs reveal that you can
3719840	3724880	have states of consciousness that are not like what we are used to. And again, I think that's
3724880	3730800	very important. It's rather like the dress to realize that there's more to consciousness than
3730880	3740160	perhaps we realize. I'm not quite sure in what direction this is going to go in. But one of the
3740160	3745520	things it's maybe important is going right back to us why and how we started talking about how do
3745520	3752880	you study subjective experience. And there is always this problem of psychology that introspection
3752880	3760400	is difficult. And we need better tools for doing introspection. And I think studying altered
3760480	3767760	states is one of the ways of improving the tools because it in a sense, defines different dimensions
3767760	3773520	within which we might describe our conscious experience. So it's giving us a better sort of
3773520	3777440	framework for beginning to talk about our subjective experience, which is what we
3778080	3779920	desperately need. So that's
3781120	3785280	There are a lot of universities nowadays studying like the effects of psilocybin,
3786240	3792320	as the certain drugs on patients with depression, etc. And it seems to be very promising.
3794320	3802320	Yes, I'm still a little bit suspicious. But it's certainly worth looking at further.
3802960	3808400	I think the one I read, I remember there was a five or six month follow up on patients who
3808400	3817680	had taken a high dose psilocybin trip programs at very high dose. And most of the patients'
3817680	3822960	experiences seem to be back to normal at their baseline, which obviously needs to still be peer
3822960	3828560	reviewed a lot more and tested. But that does seem to be quite promising. Because currently,
3828560	3833360	if you look at our current approach, treating depression, I mean, anti-depressants are not
3834240	3838240	not up to standard. It's a point, actually, how effective they are.
3839600	3844400	Well, no, that's a big problem. I mean, also in the study of psychosis, because
3845200	3850160	basically, big pharma has stopped doing any research. Because there's no
3851520	3857440	there's no obvious direction to take. So we certainly need to somehow get back into that.
3858400	3864880	Although, I'm not quite sure where that would take us. But no, I think this is interesting. But
3864880	3871360	as I say, bigger trials are needed. And there's also the work on ketamine.
3874480	3876160	Yes, there's been a lot of studies on that as well.
3878320	3886240	I think it's Joanna Moncriff, who wrote a book on big pharma and how a lot of these drugs are
3886240	3891760	just completely controlled by the pharmaceutical industry. And now it's taken over, it's taken
3891760	3896240	a life on its own that the way the science no longer really matters at this point.
3898800	3902320	Do you feel the same way as a clinical psychologist that look in psychiatry? I mean,
3902320	3907760	these patients are all no longer sorting out the psychological elements and the social elements.
3909360	3912880	I mean, it's partly to do with a matter of expense. But I mean, the drugs,
3913520	3918800	they're still giving the same drugs that were discovered based in the 50s. And as I said,
3918800	3923120	the sum of useful companies are no longer interested in trying to develop better drugs,
3923120	3929920	because they don't know how to. There's a lot of work with what's it called cognitive
3929920	3936640	behavior therapy. Although this is not quite as good as we were hoping.
3937120	3946080	Sorry, that was something I was going to say. But it's partly,
3948080	3953760	when I was studying schizophrenia a long ago, there were these huge mental hospitals,
3954400	3959680	which were full of patients and they were all closed down. And it was believed that this would
3959680	3964640	help them and they would no longer be institutionalized. Now, this has not worked. It was effectively
3964640	3973600	a money saving enterprise. And they're now treated in the community, which is a euphemism for not
3973600	3984960	being treated at all. I'm sure that much better procedures could be applied if there was the money
3984960	3992560	to do so. But we still don't, I mean, whether this is not about cure, this is about management.
3993280	4000640	And apart from these odd things like the very rare cases that have autoimmune
4000640	4005200	problems, which can actually be cured, the rest of it, we still don't know.
4008320	4012720	When you look at autistic patients, I mean, mines are clearly better than one. I mean,
4014560	4019520	you speak about this, you've got a graphic novel, you've got, you've done a lot of lectures on it.
4020400	4024640	Yeah. How do you think that patients with on the autistic spectrum
4026160	4032000	differ from the average person in terms of how they perceive the world from a theory of mind
4032000	4035280	perspective? Well,
4038720	4044960	certainly at the more extreme ends of the spectrum, I think they generally have difficulty in
4045920	4055760	recognising that behaviour is driven by beliefs, rather than reality. And therefore,
4055760	4061760	the difficulty in understanding that people can have false beliefs, difficulty in understanding
4061760	4067360	that people can, I mean, this is the dangerous part, people can be deliberately deceiving you
4067680	4073840	by trying to impart a false belief in you. So they can be over trusting.
4076640	4083680	So there are these sorts of problems. They, the other area where they may have difficulty
4083680	4088880	is recognising, you know, which is part of the same thing. Things like white lies that you
4088880	4095760	can deceive people for good reasons. And you don't always have to obey the rules. So they
4095760	4101360	tend to be very ruled down because of not recognising these sort of grey areas, which
4101360	4108320	can make them difficult to work with because they object to people doing minor infringements,
4108320	4116480	which I'm sure our Prime Minister would suffer from. I think that's one of the things that I
4116480	4122720	do like most about the Bayesian brain approach is that you try and explain these with using
4122720	4128000	Bayes theorem and using these priors. I mean, it does explain quite a lot of psychiatric disorders.
4128000	4135440	I mean, too many incorrect priors fix more. Yes, I think the dangerous it may be explains too much.
4137520	4141680	And I mean, I think it explains things on a low level, but we need much more
4144080	4150640	testable predictions. So it's perhaps too good at explaining things, but we need to actually have
4150640	4158640	some new hypotheses that we can demonstrate. And if you okay, so we've done we've spoken about
4158640	4165040	panpsychism, idealism, so people just thinking all in the mind. What about those who believe in
4165040	4169120	quantum consciousness? I mean, this isn't the microtubules you've got to hammer off.
4171440	4179040	This is something more. I don't think we need it. I mean, I think the microtubules
4179040	4185120	is largely discounted as far as I understand it. But I'm not convinced that we need
4188400	4193840	a special as yet, we don't need to bring in these rather
4194320	4200640	abstruse physical mechanisms to explain
4202560	4210560	how the brain works. I had I'm what I had once had an interaction with Penfield about
4211760	4219920	I mean, and one of his arguments is that the brain cannot be a computer because
4220880	4227360	you know, people can solve non computable problems or some other details. And I was objecting to
4227360	4232960	this because I was saying was, I mean, in fact, when you look at the computation involved,
4234000	4238400	at an unconscious level, we do actually much better than we do at the conscious level. Our
4238400	4244000	conscious processing is actually much more primitive than the unconscious processing. So
4244640	4251120	if we really need quantum type explanations, it may apply at the unconscious level of how
4251120	4255920	well the brain works, but we don't really need it for the conscious level. It seems to me that's
4255920	4261520	a different problem. In a few weeks, I'm chatting to Mark Swalms. I'm not sure if you're familiar
4261520	4269920	with his work. Mark Swalms. Oh, yes, psychoanalysis. Yes. So he sort of thinks it's a bit more
4270480	4277680	a lot more primitive, actually, that it's not so much to do with the prefrontal cortex and that
4277680	4283120	sort of communication out downward, it's more from the bottom up that we consciousness sort of
4283120	4288640	evolves. Do you have thoughts on that? Yes, I mean, I think that goes back to this idea that the
4288640	4294000	frontal cortex is particularly involved with self consciousness and meta consciousness, and that
4294000	4301360	sentence may well be much more bottom up. I'm not myself too keen on psychoanalytic approaches
4301360	4308080	to this, because I don't quite know how they fit, or what it's all about. But I would certainly
4308080	4315200	agree that there's a lot of, I mean, the bottom end of sentence, which as I say, is probably
4315200	4322800	shared with fish and bumblebees and so on. The frontal cortex may not be so relevant, and this
4322800	4331600	is certainly, in that sense, very primitive. When you think of other species like, let's say dolphins,
4333440	4338720	what else, let's just octopi, I mean, is it octopuses or octopi? I'm not sure what the correct
4338720	4343840	term there is, but a lot of people have done studies now with octopuses, and they seem to think
4343840	4350720	that they're a lot more complicated than we thought. Yes, I think that's absolutely true.
4350720	4356880	I mean, one task, which I mean, there's this chapter on the virtues written a great deal about
4356880	4362720	consciousness is a philosopher about invertible consciousness, and I think makes a very good
4362720	4371200	case for octopuses, which I think, anyway, to the extent that the, it's now, I think the government
4371200	4380400	has recognized that octopuses and squids should be protected in certain ways. But there's a very
4380400	4388080	interesting task, which I talk about in my paper, which I, which is this reversal learning, you know
4388080	4397840	about this, this is, so it's a very simple task. For example, you can have two food wells, which
4397840	4404320	have, you know, one's red and one's blue, and food is hidden under one of them. And most creatures
4404320	4412240	can learn with trial and error that it's hidden under the red one. And so they do that for some
4412240	4418720	time, and then you switch without telling them you switch the reward to the blue one. And then
4418720	4422560	after a few trials, they realize they were wrong, and they realize it's down to the blue one, and
4422560	4429840	you can go on doing this, this is very boring, and a very simple model free learning device
4429840	4435440	can learn this. But every time you switch, it takes a certain number of trials until it gets
4435440	4442800	the right answer. But most creatures show something which is called learning to learn. So after a few
4442800	4450400	switches, they can switch much more quickly. And this involves actually a higher level,
4450400	4455680	you now have to go up to a level which recognizes that the world has two states, it's either the
4456320	4462720	the red's good or the blue's good. And you have to recognize when the state changes.
4464160	4467680	And this is also very interesting from a Bayesian point of view, because when it's in the,
4467680	4472960	this is all probabilistic. So even when it's, when it's usually under the red one,
4473680	4479520	it's only under the red one, say 80% of the time. So very occasionally you'll find it's
4479520	4485120	under the other one, you'll be wrong. But because you realize it's a state, you say this
4485680	4490400	I know this is just noise. So I ignore these prediction errors. This is very becoming very
4490400	4498560	sophisticated. You say prediction errors are not, not always important. I can, in some situations,
4498560	4503680	I ignore them. But you've also learned that after a certain amount of time, it's going to switch.
4506000	4509520	And therefore we start saying, well, I'm reaching the point where I suspect that these
4509520	4514720	prediction errors are becoming important. Because they may be telling me there's going to be a
4514720	4519440	switch in the state of the world. So I'll start attending to them. And that's how you can switch
4519440	4523520	very rapidly, because you roughly know where it's going to be. And as soon as their prediction
4523520	4529120	error, at this point, then you say, I'm going to switch to the other one. So this is highly
4529120	4535360	sophisticated and enables you to switch quickly. Now, what is interesting is that
4537680	4539360	most creatures can do this.
4540000	4547840	This is what Jonathan Birch points out, this rapid learning to learn this
4549200	4555600	reversal learning switch can be found in many animals, you know, go fish, probably I haven't
4555600	4561920	done bumble bees yet, but they probably will. And I think this is a marker of sentence. You
4561920	4567600	now have a model of the world that it can be in two different states, rather than just learning
4567600	4573600	this response is good, or this response is good. That's the difference between the model free learner
4573600	4577840	who just knows whether the response is good or not, and has to learn it. And the model
4579200	4583200	determined learner who realizes there are two different states of the world. And this is what
4583200	4588000	I have to learn about. And I think that's where sentence is. And if this really is a marker
4588000	4593840	of sentence, then many creatures have it. That's quite intriguing. So even goldfish are able to
4593840	4601200	do this. That's pretty cool. And let's see, that's fascinating. When you think about
4603200	4608160	virtual realities, I mean, we're reaching a point where meta, we're talking about things like meta
4608160	4614000	and metaverse, people are thinking about how we're all at some point going to be computerized,
4614000	4619760	we're going to plug ourselves in, become part of a virtual world. Do you think that it's possible
4619760	4626400	that this is actually a virtual? Do you ever have those sort of philosophical thoughts as a
4627520	4631040	very prominent figure in the neuroscience and psychology field?
4631840	4635840	No, I have to say, I mean, I've certainly been interested in the idea of a brain and a fat.
4637680	4641040	And this really goes right back to Descartes, who was worried about, you know,
4641040	4644800	there's an evil demon that's determining what I'm perceiving.
4644960	4653680	And I guess, but I've never really taken that on board. And I guess it's, again, it's to do with
4654640	4661600	interacting with other people who have slightly different views of the world, who have slightly,
4661600	4667360	you know, they have different past experiences. And it doesn't, if we were all brains in vats,
4667360	4673200	I just thought that similarity would be much greater. Or maybe it depends on how
4673840	4681920	sophisticated the programmer is. But I think, so I'm not really taken with that. I mean,
4681920	4686720	so I'm certainly very interested in the idea that, you know, with virtual reality, we do become
4686720	4692800	brains in vats. But interestingly, we can choose which that we're in, which is quite
4694880	4700400	interesting. But so far, I have not been very impressed with the virtual reality.
4700400	4707040	I have tried, but I'm not very good at it. I mean, who was once asked to be on the jury of the,
4708400	4714000	you know, every year they have some competition for the best new game or something. And so we got
4714000	4718000	lots of these games to play. And we found that we were completely incompetent at playing them.
4722080	4724880	So that was probably the reason why I'm not impressed by the
4725920	4729600	virtual world, because I'm just not very good at getting into them properly.
4729920	4730960	If you had to...
4730960	4736080	Trinity, Chris, to actually put your brain, download your consciousness and keep it alive
4736080	4737440	and keep it going, would you do that?
4738800	4740160	That's a very interesting question.
4743760	4749520	Probably not. Unless the virtual worlds are much better than they are now.
4750720	4755360	And I'm very, I'm very mystified about this idea that we'll soon be able to download our brain
4755360	4759680	into a computer or something, because I am becoming more and more complicated. I mean,
4759680	4763680	the recent work says that you would have to take into account, you know, every synapse,
4763680	4764960	not just every neuron.
4766800	4767280	Exactly.
4767920	4770160	And I think that's not enough.
4770160	4775360	And you lose a lot of competition in the sense that we are very much embodied beings functioning.
4775360	4779120	I mean, a lot of our perceptual experiences come from the fact that we have hands,
4780000	4782560	and we can't have 10s because we've got these 10 fingers.
4783440	4783920	Yeah.
4783920	4787440	So there's a lot that we'd lose out in terms of information.
4787440	4791680	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's very important. I mean, the other thing I've been very fascinated
4791680	4798400	by is that the people have started working on theirs. Occasionally, people have six fingers
4798400	4804400	instead of five. And it's to some extent genetic. And I think there's a family in Brazil where
4804400	4808400	they all have six fingers or something. And there's some very interesting work on what they do with
4808400	4811360	their mobile phones, and they're actually able to do more things.
4815200	4816720	I'm going to read up on that after this.
4818080	4822080	And that's another that's called augmented reality, I think. But I mean, we're going to get
4824320	4830320	things, I mean, machines or whatever, extra bits so that we can actually have more fingers or
4830960	4835920	more arms or whatever it is. So that would be quite, I mean, I guess I'm more interested in
4835920	4841200	that aspect of interacting with reality than the virtual reality.
4841920	4845600	It's fine because now David Chalmers has completely left consciousness. Well,
4845600	4851200	he hasn't left it, but he's now very much focused on virtual reality and the philosophy of virtual.
4852560	4856960	How do we behave? What are the moral, what are the ethical principles here, etc.
4856960	4861200	But I think that's interesting because I would be more interested in what he thinks about, you know,
4861200	4869440	having more hands on. And there's also work on having new senses. So for example, you can wear a
4869440	4875440	belt through which you can feel where Magnetic North is. Is that useful?
4877920	4883040	It's quite interesting because if you grow up learning how to use it, it definitely takes your
4883040	4887120	priors. Yeah. And that's again, goes back to consciousness because
4889440	4895280	and our subjective experience depends a great deal on what sensory inputs we have.
4896480	4900080	And presumably someone who is blind from birth has a very different
4900720	4906240	conscious experience from other people. And likewise, if we can have these extra senses,
4907200	4913520	what will that do to us? I mean, again, I've jumped around a bit, but you know,
4913520	4917680	this recent discovery that some women have four color receptors rather than three.
4921040	4930480	Does it make any difference? Can you make use of it? So I guess I'm more interested in these
4930480	4937360	developments. David Eagleman does a lot of work on sensory substitution. And how you like,
4937360	4943120	he can wear a you can wear a sort of vest that will vibrate in a certain way. If you are blind,
4943120	4948400	then you've got glasses and I need to like take in information via a camera and then
4948400	4953120	vibrate in a certain way on your vest and then you know what reality is. You paint a new picture
4953120	4958960	for yourself. But then that leads to the question, how much more could we augment this real experience?
4959920	4963200	I agree, which is a lot more intriguing to think about.
4965120	4973920	Do you believe in free will, Chris? Yes, I've been, I've took a long time. But again,
4973920	4978880	it's very social thing. I think the experience of having free will is to some extent a social
4978880	4983760	phenomenon. I mean, like I was talking about the ancient Greeks, perhaps didn't have,
4983760	4986800	didn't think they had free will because the gods were telling them what to do.
4986800	4993360	But if you then re-attribute that to me telling me yourself what to do, then
4994000	4998640	you do have free will. But I'm very interested in, I mean, there's this interesting relationship
4998640	5004400	between free will and responsibility. And we're all brought up to feel responsible for our actions.
5004400	5013120	And this is why I was said very early on, my grandson would, if he hits his twin sister will say,
5014000	5018480	I'm not responsible because it was an accident. So he's learned very early on to make the distinction
5018480	5023120	between things you do deliberately and things that you do by accident. And this has become very
5023120	5029200	important, at least in Western cultures, about, you know, it's a basis of legal things. You have to
5029200	5037920	be, you have to have the intention to do something, not just, that didn't just happen. And I think
5037920	5042640	this is something we learn on very early on. And we have this feeling that we're responsible for our
5042640	5049920	actions. We have particularly a strong feeling of regret. And the mere fact that we can feel
5049920	5053760	regret that I should have done something else implies that at the time we could have done
5053760	5059520	something else. Otherwise, this doesn't make any sense. So I think, again, the feeling of regret,
5059520	5063600	the feeling of being in control of our actions, these are very important aspects of our conscious
5063600	5070320	experience. And they are the basis of our belief in free will. And they're very important for
5070320	5076800	social cohesion and the rule of law, and understanding people, because we believe that people do
5076800	5084560	things for reasons. And in that sense, we expect people to have, to some extent, free will.
5086000	5090480	So I think that's very important. It's a cultural phenomena, but to some extent,
5090480	5094800	is created by culture. And it's also very important for making culture work.
5095280	5101120	So even though we have these experiments by Benjamin Libet, let's say, or
5102000	5107920	Uri Maus does certain work on it as well, you still believe just because it's because of
5107920	5111600	this fundamental link with moral responsibility, you have to take it into account.
5112800	5118960	Patrick Haggard has followed up the Libet experiments in many studies. And what he has
5118960	5124320	shown is that the experience of action is just like other perceptions. It's very Bayesian. So
5124400	5129760	you have a prior, and you have an outcome. So your experience of performing an act is you have a prior
5129760	5135600	intention, and you have the outcome, and they're bound together to give the experience of the action.
5136240	5143600	And I think what Libet, the reason that Libet finds that, you know, say when I had the decision
5143600	5150640	to do the action is later, is because of this binding phenomena. And you can move it around.
5150880	5155040	That's what Patrick Haggard has shown. You can move the timing around by what happens afterwards.
5155760	5158560	So in a sense, what happens afterwards is bound into your
5162480	5169040	subjective experience of the act. So I think the timing is not the fact that it happens after
5169040	5174400	the brain starts working, is not relevant to the problem of whether we have free will or not.
5174400	5177520	It's part of it. It's the way the experience is created.
5179920	5187360	To close, Chris, there's listeners they often love to when some of their favorite neuroscientists,
5187360	5192720	psychologists, philosophers tell us some book recommendations or author recommendations in
5192720	5195760	general with your favorite philosophers. If you had to give me five, at least.
5196080	5205760	Within the field with two, I mean, relevant books. I mean, the most the book on consciousness
5205760	5212880	that people should now read is Hacquan Lau's new book. In consciousness, we trust is that I think
5212880	5218720	it's called it. Who's it? Sorry, repeat the author's name. Hacquan Lau. I haven't read it.
5219520	5224400	Oh, I mean, he's worked with. Yes, it's very new. It only came out a month ago.
5225520	5234320	So that tells you great. It's tough. It's not like analysis. It goes into the nitty gritty of
5234320	5239200	how you do experiments and so on. Okay, so it's not like being you. I think Anil's is being you.
5240080	5251680	Yeah, yeah. I'm basically recommending all my friends. Nick Shea wrote a few years and what's
5251680	5258960	good about this Hacquan's book is it's I think it's often in the university press, but it's free.
5258960	5265600	You can download it for free. Nick Shea is the philosopher who wrote a couple of years ago a
5265600	5273440	book about representation, which is very important in neuroscience. And I can't remember what it's
5273440	5284000	called, but that's also you can download it for free. Of course, the best, best philosophy book,
5285200	5290320	if you're interested in Wittgenstein and people like that is Lodgy Comics.
5290560	5296080	Have you, you know that one, which is the graphic novel on the life of Bertrand Russell?
5301120	5304560	And obviously you have to read a Philip K. Dick book if you want to understand.
5305840	5309200	I've got a really cool Philip K. Dick box set from Folius.
5311200	5315600	But yes, do do androids dream of electric sheep is the sort of classic.
5316320	5321120	But there's another one which has the lovely title of the penultimate truth.
5326080	5331120	Gosh, it's very difficult stuff. I put you in the spot there. I know a lot of my guests
5331120	5334000	can't get caught in the spot at that moment when I asked them that question.
5336320	5339280	But I haven't, I'm not very good on books.
5340240	5344880	If you think about the philosophers who or psychologists who really influenced your view
5344880	5348080	and made made you the person you are today in terms of the thinker you are,
5348640	5351040	would you think played some big roles?
5351040	5353600	Well, I mean, there's Tim Shannis's book,
5357200	5361040	which is called Neuropsychology and Mental Structure. I mean, that's quite an old book,
5361040	5369120	but that that was very influential on my work. And obviously, I read, I mean,
5369120	5374240	I read all the old stuff like Donald Hibbs, what was it called?
5375360	5378400	Principles of behavior? I'm not sure.
5384400	5387120	And going by even further, because I had to give the
5387440	5392560	Bartlett Lecture recently, I read Frederick Bartlett's book called Remembering,
5393760	5398640	which is from 1932. But that has all this sort of Bayesian approach
5399440	5405840	that the memory is constructive and so on, and has a second section on social psychology,
5405840	5407680	even the effects of culture.
5412000	5413920	Probably anything on Helmholtz as well.
5414720	5419120	Oh, yes. Well, Helmholtz is very difficult. There is a little book on Helmholtz,
5419840	5425040	where I have to confess my German is not good enough to have read the original.
5426480	5432960	I mean, the book that very much influenced me in early stages was this one,
5432960	5437760	or his. Oh, nice. Okay.
5439520	5447680	And what is it? He has labyrinths, it's called. But he has, I mean, they're all very short stories,
5447680	5453920	but one of them is called Funes the Memorias, which is about someone who has some sort of brain
5453920	5459200	damage, which means they can, their memory is completely altered, and they can remember everything,
5459680	5464800	their episodic memory is perfect as a result of which they abandon concepts.
5469360	5473040	Because they don't need to simplify. That's fascinating.
5475120	5480720	Chris, thanks. I mean, everybody, when people look, read it, when people read your work,
5480720	5483920	when people read like people like Friston's work, I mean, they're always curious,
5483920	5487840	like, how do you guys get to the point where you are? Who are the thinkers who make you,
5487920	5492880	who you are? It's fascinating to see the journey you guys take to get, to get to that point.
5494640	5496000	Well, it's random, basically.
5498000	5501520	You guys are there for us. I mean, like one day, if somebody asks me these questions,
5501520	5508800	I'm going to say, like Chris, I mean, so it's great to know who influenced you and who played
5508800	5515760	that big role for you guys. Do you think so, Chris? I mean, of course, it's mind, body, solution.
5516720	5519280	Do you think we're going to find the mind, body, solution?
5520480	5522960	We're going to solve this mind, body, problem anytime soon?
5524720	5525440	I hope not.
5526960	5528080	Is it the magic is gone?
5528800	5529840	Where's the magic is gone?
5529840	5530320	Yeah.
5530320	5535360	But honestly, thanks to you at least listeners. I've taken one step closer to the mind, body,
5535360	5540960	solution. And I really appreciate you accommodating me, knowing that we're having some
5540960	5543360	horrible weather conditions here in South Africa.
5543360	5544400	I gather, yeah.
5544400	5549520	It's been crazy, like lots of flooding, lots of death. It's been quite intense.
5550800	5554560	Right. But you're getting, it's getting back to normal.
5555760	5560800	Guys, I appreciate your time and for rescheduling the meeting with me.
5561760	5565600	Yeah, that was fine. Yeah. No, thanks. I enjoyed this chat very much.
5566560	5567120	Thanks, Chris.
