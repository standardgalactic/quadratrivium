0	18640	No, if I had to ask you to give me a philosophical history of the mind-body problem, what story
18640	22360	would you tell me?
22360	32000	This has a long history back to the classical era, but in the modern period, the basic mind-body
32000	39720	problem that has entered and persisted in modern philosophy is basically the Cartesian
39720	40720	formula.
40720	49760	The Cartesian formula was based on the fundamental principle that initiated modern science, so
49760	56000	called mechanical philosophy, philosophy of course, meant science.
56000	66080	So Galileo and his contemporaries sharply reacted against the neo-scholastic reigning
66080	75760	doctrine's version of Aristotelianism, which were based on what they called occult properties.
75760	83240	So two things, two material bodies attract each other because they have sympathies, an
83240	91080	object move because of its internal energy agency, it moves to the place where it belongs.
91080	92480	It's a natural place.
92480	100160	The natural place of a material object is the earth, and so it falls, and other occult
100160	101920	properties of this kind.
101920	109400	They wanted actual explanations, and the explanations had to be, assume, had to show that the world
109400	116080	was intelligible, and there was a criterion for intelligibility, namely, could what you
116080	122640	describe be constructed by a skilled artisan, that's the mechanical philosophy.
122640	130680	I have to remember that at this time, Europe was flooded with complex intricate artifacts
130680	138880	made by skilled artisans, which model humans, played puppeteers, Gordon's inversa, you
138880	140880	know, seemed semi-human.
140880	146080	In fact, it was kind of like today, mostly misleading.
146080	154600	The idea was a true explanation would be a mechanical model, that's the mechanical philosophy.
155320	163080	Descartes, it was believed by essentially everyone, Galileo, Descartes, Isaac Newton,
163080	170720	Leibniz, Christian Huygens, it was simply the reigning doctrine of modern science.
170720	173040	Descartes tried to work it out.
173040	181680	He thought he had shown that there is a mechanical explanation for all phenomena of the world,
181680	183920	with one exception, the human mind.
183920	192160	He said the human mind has properties that cannot be accommodated by a mechanical object.
192160	200000	One of them, properties incidentally was language, said the capacity of humans to create new
200000	207840	expressions, indefinitely expressing new thoughts, and to do so in ways that are appropriate
207840	213880	to situations, but not caused by them, is a property that goes beyond the capacity of
213880	214880	mechanism.
214880	221560	Well, that was the, so therefore, serious scientist, he established a new principle,
221560	228440	race cogitance, and his metaphysics, a substance, thinking substance, and that's in addition
228440	231320	to race extensa, matter.
231320	237440	So there are two substances, matter and mind, and then of course he seek to link them and
237440	243760	he argued that there's maybe a connection through the pineal gland, which is not duplicated
243760	245760	in the brain, just one place.
245760	251200	So that's basically the classical mind-body problem, didn't last very long.
251200	256320	Newton showed much to his distress that there are no bodies.
256320	265920	One of the two elements of the picture disappeared, contrary to what's claimed by many modern
265920	272160	philosophers, Gilbert Ryle and others, that Newton didn't exercise the ghost in the machine.
272160	276040	He exercised the machine, the ghost was left intact.
276040	280240	He showed there are no bodies in the sense of the mechanical philosophy.
280240	285480	And Newton regarded this as a total absurdity, so that it's so absurd that no person with
285480	292520	any scientific understanding can possibly believe it, and in fact his main work is called,
292520	299760	not called physics, or in those days philosophy, it's called mathematics, because as he said,
299760	302280	he has only a mathematical account.
302280	309480	He cannot give a physical explanation because what he's postulating makes no sense in physical
309480	310480	terms.
310480	317800	For the rest of his life, in fact, he showed in fact that Descartes' model didn't work,
317800	320080	and in fact no model would work.
320080	322240	That's Newton's great discovery.
322240	324360	He thought it was ridiculous.
324360	327240	His contemporaries thought it was ridiculous.
327240	333600	For the rest of his life, Newton tried to find some kind of answer to this.
333600	340560	But total equipment, I do not make hypotheses, was in the context of explaining that he has
340560	345320	no physical explanation, so he can only give a mathematical model.
345320	349080	Well, there were various reactions to this.
349080	353600	One reaction, connection with the mind-body problem, was John Locke's.
353600	358480	This is not in his major work, but in a letter to Stilling Fleet.
358480	366120	He discussed this, and his conclusion was basically, quote him, that the judicious Mr.
366120	377320	Newton has demonstrated that God attributed to matter properties that we cannot conceive
377320	379480	that are inconceivable to us.
379480	386160	And similar, he said, God may have super-added to matter the property of thought, meaning
386160	390240	some organized form of matter yields thought.
390240	396840	That idea was picked up through the 18th century by just about every major figure who tried
396840	404920	to show how, as some put it, the brain secretes thought the way the liver secretes vile.
404920	415520	This reached its abagy with Pristly, the chemist philosopher, in the late 18th century, developed
415520	417520	these ideas extensively.
417520	423560	In the 19th century, they were pursued, but not intensively, then they were forgotten.
423560	430840	When the revolution took place in the 20th century, all of this was totally forgotten.
430840	437560	In fact, it's still mostly unknown to philosophers and cognitive scientists and others.
437560	440160	It was rediscovered in the 20th century.
440160	446720	The last decade, it was by mid-20th century, essentially rediscovered in the study of language.
446720	449440	That's what generative grammar is.
449440	455920	But in the world of philosophy, cognitive science, it was not rediscovered until the
455920	458160	last decade of the 20th century.
458160	464560	It was called the decade of the brain, a decade devoted to the brain.
464560	472680	At the conclusion of it, the neuroscientists, too, gave the concluding summary of it, Vernon
472680	480320	Mount Gossel, described what he called the thesis of the new biology, that the thought
480320	483000	is simply a property of the brain.
483000	488920	This was considered what Francis Krip called an astonishing hypothesis, a radical new idea
488920	492160	and philosophy of mind, very exciting.
492160	497840	It's repeated in almost the same words, what was commonplace in the 18th century as a result
497840	500040	of block suggestion.
500040	503080	And that's basically where it stands, I think.
503080	509320	There was another consequence of Newton's demolition of the mechanical philosophy.
509320	511080	Science changed its course.
511080	518120	The early modern science, Galileo through Newton, sought to discover an intelligible
518120	521160	world that was given up.
521160	527560	Scientists recognized tacitly, nobody actually said it, that you can't find an intelligible
527560	528560	world.
528560	538800	As John Locke said in his theological framework, God has added to matter properties that are
538800	542400	inconceivable to us, but it's just a fact.
542400	548320	And in fact, science proceeded with that fact, not forgetting the theological framework.
548320	552000	It just sought intelligible theories.
552000	553160	That's very different.
553160	556320	So Newton's theories were intelligible.
556320	560680	Leibniz, Huygens could understand Newton's theories.
560680	566400	It was the world that they described that was unintelligible, and Newton agreed.
566400	575000	But over time, science just lowered its aspirations to developing theories that were intelligible,
575000	579880	however inconceivable of the world that they described.
579880	581560	Just abandoned that hope.
581560	589120	By the time you get to 20th century Bertrand Russell, the science is very well, he simply
589120	591920	said it's ridiculous to seek intelligibility.
591920	593720	Who cares?
593720	595680	We just want theories that work.
595680	601680	That's a big difference from the early modern science, which had much higher aspirations.
601680	604920	This is often not understood.
604920	607520	I should say there's more to it than that.
607520	613840	Newton recognized that the world seemed to have inconceivable properties, and he speculated
613840	620040	that as far as we know, all matter might be alive, all matter, including the coffee
620040	621320	cup in front of it.
621320	625760	We know so little of matter that we can't show that it's not alive.
625760	630200	In the 20th century, this was picked up independently.
630200	635880	Sir Arthur Eddington, great astrophysicist, said we know so little of matter that for
635880	641720	all, we know all matter is conscious, can't show that atoms aren't conscious, because
641720	643640	we just don't know anything about matter.
643640	647480	Bertrand Russell had similar position.
647480	654720	In fact, it's kind of interesting if you look at today's philosophy, what's exciting
654720	660840	topic in philosophy today is what's called the hard problem of consciousness.
660840	663680	The 17th century also had a hard problem.
663680	666080	The hard problem was motion.
666080	668080	How can you account for motion?
668080	669880	Answer, you can't.
669880	676400	But the hard problem of the 17th century was quite different from today's hard problem.
676720	681600	If you look at the hard problem of motion, the problem was formulated.
681600	683800	You could state properties of motion.
683800	686120	Say here are the properties of motion.
686120	688840	How can we find an explanation for them?
688840	692640	That was the hard problem in the 17th century.
692640	697240	And Newton's discovery was there's no explanation in what we consider physical.
697240	699120	It's quite different.
699120	701080	It's not formulated.
701480	706400	The problem is what is it like to see the sunrise in the morning?
706400	710280	Well, nobody can say what it's like to see the sunrise in the morning.
710280	715360	You can write a poem about it, maybe, but you can't say here are the properties of it.
715360	717200	And what does it like to be a bet?
717200	719920	Nobody can say, what does it like to be me?
719920	723960	I could write a book about it, maybe, but I can't say here are the properties.
723960	729480	Well, this is an elementary thing, unless you state what you want an explanation for.
729480	735720	So the hard problem of today's philosophy is formulated in a way which is unanswerable.
735720	737280	So it's not a problem at all.
737280	740880	It's just I'm confused.
740880	742480	It's not a problem.
742480	748080	It's quite different from the 17th, 18th century, when the problem was quite real
748080	750120	and explicit and not answered.
750120	756600	So I think we should be very cautious about paying attention to what's the hot topic
756600	758960	in the philosophical literature.
758960	761520	It's not a formulated problem.
761520	764200	It's just an expression of confusion.
764200	770600	And as far as the radical new idea in philosophy, that's luck.
770600	777040	And I think we should recognize the antecedents, the history, the context,
777040	783240	and what is not conceivable to us, though apparently true.
783240	789520	So, no, there are so many different takes on consciousness at this point.
789520	792720	So many people have different theories of consciousness.
792720	796760	There's panpsychism, there's illusionism, there's idealism,
796760	800400	reductive physicalism, materialism.
800400	802080	Where do you think we stand today?
802080	806000	What do you think is the most prominent thought process behind theories of consciousness?
806000	810800	Would you say it is reductive materialism?
810800	813440	There is no such thing as materialism.
813440	820800	Materialism, if it exists, has to give some account of what matter is.
820800	824760	You can't have a theory of materialism if you don't tell us what matter is.
824760	826520	And nobody knows what matter is.
826520	828320	So there's no materialism.
828320	836720	That's why, as Arthur Eddington, Russell, actually Newton pointed out,
836720	838680	we have no concept of matter.
838680	844240	So if you look at the problem of what's so-called the problem of consciousness,
844240	846480	we know a great deal about consciousness.
846480	849520	In fact, we know more about consciousness than anything else.
849520	854440	It's something that both Russell and most more recently,
854440	856360	Gell and Strossen have emphasized.
856360	860520	I can tell you a ton of things about my current consciousness.
860520	864120	I could describe in detail everything I'm seeing and so on.
864120	866520	What we don't know is what matter is.
866520	869560	Consciousness and matter, because we're ignorant of matter.
869560	874520	That's why Eddington said, for all we know, all matter is conscious,
874520	876320	because we know nothing about matter.
876320	881640	As Newton said, maybe all matter is alive, because we don't know anything about matter.
881640	885720	So these questions are not formulated in a coherent fashion.
885720	890520	As far as panpsychism is concerned, it's basically Eddington's speculation.
890520	894960	But actually Gell and Strossen is one who has argued for it.
894960	901600	Interesting arguments, I'm personally not convinced, but coherent arguments, at least.
901600	907320	But until what we can try to do is what was done by science,
907320	912520	after Newton showed that we cannot find an intelligible universe,
912520	916120	try to find intelligible theories.
916120	923920	So let's construct the best theories we can to account for the properties of consciousness.
923920	925840	That's all we can do.
925840	929040	Can't reduce it to matter, because we don't know what matter is.
929040	932360	Can't say, I don't think you can say anything about panpsychism,
932360	936560	that we cannot show that all matter is not conscious,
936560	939440	but that's because we don't understand anything about matter.
939440	942400	In fact, if you think about it, what is matter?
942400	948840	I mean, there's a great physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, John Wheeler,
948880	956080	who suggested that maybe all there is in the universe is answers to the questions we pose.
956080	960560	It's a theory called it from bit, all that exists as bits.
960560	964240	We pose a question, get an answer, that's the universe.
964240	965360	There's nothing else.
965360	970320	I mean, I'm not confident to say whether this is a plausible theory or not,
970320	975400	but suppose it is, then that's matter, answers to your questions.
975440	981600	Right now, physicists are in the strange position of not being able to find,
981600	984400	I think it's the universe.
984400	987640	Okay, that's where we are.
987640	991520	You can read articles in quantum theory journals.
991520	997680	Someone sent me one recently, or a group of leading quantum theorists debate,
997680	1001120	what is a particle, most fundamental question.
1001120	1003360	I can't reach any conclusion.
1003360	1007520	Well, that's where we are with regard to matter.
1007520	1010720	I'm not sure, Naomi, if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman's work
1010720	1013480	and his theory of consciousness.
1013480	1014520	Whose theory?
1014520	1018400	Donald Hoffman.
1018400	1022880	It's a description of properties of consciousness.
1022880	1029720	I don't see a theory in the sense of explanation of anything.
1029720	1034280	Because he's basically one of those physicists who have concluded that
1034280	1037280	space and time, in essence, don't really exist.
1037280	1041160	So what he's trying to do is build a theory where conscious agents
1041160	1045040	are the fundamental entity of reality, and then he moves on from there.
1045040	1048720	But where do you think the problem lies with starting from there?
1048720	1051320	What is explained?
1051320	1054800	A theory provides explanations.
1054800	1056520	That's what a theory is.
1056520	1058560	What is explained?
1058560	1062040	Yeah, that's a good question.
1062040	1063760	What about that?
1063760	1065840	And sorry, did you want to add to that?
1065840	1069600	I just want to express my own ignorance.
1069600	1076320	With respect to the conclusions about space and time, I'm not competent to comment.
1076320	1081240	I know physicists are exercised about this and have no real answers.
1081240	1082760	I don't.
1082760	1086560	There seems to be a shift in physics at the moment where a lot of the theories
1086560	1092560	are starting to expose that space and time, the way we think about space-time,
1092560	1096640	does not seem to be what even Einstein and physics has shown us.
1096640	1099240	So Newtonian physics, both Einstein and Newton,
1099240	1102200	it all seems to be being thrown out the window at this point,
1102200	1106920	which is making some physicists question the fundamental edge of reality completely.
1106920	1110760	And because of that, it's opening up the doors to a new form of idealism
1110760	1114640	where now consciousness is fundamental, and then we move on from there.
1114760	1119480	What do you think about that approach of the idealistic view of seeing consciousness?
1119480	1126320	I don't think any of these discussions in physics, which I'm not competent to have a judgment about,
1126320	1129760	I don't think any of them bear unconsciousness in the least.
1129760	1136960	They don't tell us about the fact that I see a red spot, what I feel like when I see the red spot.
1136960	1138520	I don't see anything about that.
1138520	1141440	That's consciousness.
1141520	1146640	Furthermore, I don't really understand the preoccupation with consciousness.
1146640	1149360	It's a pretty new preoccupation.
1149360	1151520	It's not true in the history of philosophy.
1151520	1157320	One of the probably the major scholarly study of this is by Uru Thiel,
1157320	1163800	who points out that consciousness became an issue in philosophy
1163800	1172960	pretty much with the Neoplatonist 17th century Cartesian's Ralph Cudworth.
1172960	1177160	He says it was the first to discuss consciousness seriously.
1177160	1181720	But they were talking about self-consciousness, awareness of ourselves.
1181720	1187240	And that was the topic of consciousness right up to the 20th century.
1187240	1195560	20th century, for some reason, there was a sudden great concern with consciousness in recent years.
1195560	1199360	It's been, as I said, the problem, the hard problem.
1199360	1202400	Only trouble is it's not formulated, so it's not a problem.
1202400	1203800	But why consciousness?
1203800	1210040	I mean, it turns out, to the extent that we understand anything, limited, take language,
1210040	1215360	almost everything that's going on in our minds when you and I are conversing
1215440	1218680	is completely beyond the reach of consciousness.
1218680	1220840	There are mental processes taking place.
1220840	1226120	We have a fair grasp about what many of them are, but we have no more awareness of them
1226120	1229800	than we have of what's going on in our second nervous system.
1229800	1234680	We have another huge nervous system called the enteric nervous system.
1234680	1236560	Sometimes called the gut brain.
1236560	1242200	It's a huge nervous system, controls everything that's going on in the body.
1242200	1251320	Mid-billions of neurons can have all the properties of simers, Parkinson's, and a huge nervous system.
1251320	1251960	We know nothing.
1251960	1257880	We know a lot about it, but from the outside, the way we study the planetary motion,
1257880	1259800	you have no introspection into it.
1259800	1262000	And the same is true of this nervous system.
1262000	1265880	We have almost no introspective evidence about it.
1265880	1267920	Very superficial phenomenon.
1267920	1272040	But we can learn a lot about it the way you learn other things in science.
1273000	1278280	And the mental acts that are taking place beyond the level of consciousness
1278280	1283720	interact indissolubly from the few fragments that we're conscious of.
1283720	1287400	So you're not going to fonts that happen to be conscious.
1287400	1289320	You want a real theory of what's going on.
1289320	1297080	You're going to have to integrate whatever we know about or can discover about the internal unconscious,
1297080	1300680	not in a Freudian sense, inaccessible to consciousness,
1302680	1308360	operations that are more important than the fragments that reach consciousness.
1308360	1309800	I think it's more important.
1309800	1316440	So it seems to me the emphasis is misplaced, plus the fact that the problem is not formulated
1316440	1320200	till the problem is formulated, you're not going to have an answer to it.
1320200	1325320	So I think philosophy is going off into a very dubious directions.
1325320	1329480	I should say that Galen Strauss and one of the best young philosophers
1329480	1332280	has put this a little more strongly than I have.
1332280	1334920	He more strongly than I would, in fact.
1334920	1341560	What he said is that 20th century philosophy is the silliest period in the history of philosophy.
1341560	1343400	That's too strong, I think.
1343400	1349880	But I do think there are real questions about including the unwillingness
1349880	1354600	to understand the history of the topic, which is revealing I think.
1354680	1360200	It's worth understanding how these problems developed kind of thing we were talking about.
1360200	1363080	Sheds a lot of light on what we should be doing, I think.
1363080	1369800	But the crucial issue is that the hard problem in the 20th century is not formulated
1369800	1375160	as distinct from the hard problem in the 17th century, which was formulated
1375160	1377640	and led to very interesting results.
1377640	1383000	So until today's hard problem is formulated, it will just be wandering in the wilderness.
1383400	1389800	Hmm. Do you think we have focused so much energy into this hard problem of consciousness?
1389800	1396200	Because science has exposed so much about reality in terms of spirituality.
1396200	1400200	God Copernicus taking us out of the center of the universe.
1400200	1403480	You've got Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain.
1403480	1409560	And now we have this last that allows us to at least maintain some sort of spirituality
1409560	1411800	and maybe meaning value purpose.
1411800	1414520	Do you think that's why we're so obsessed with this topic right now?
1416360	1419720	This frankly just seems to me empty talk.
1421000	1422520	Yes, we have consciousness.
1423560	1425240	I have a dog at my feet.
1425240	1427560	She have consciousness, I assume.
1427560	1435160	So can't prove it or disprove it as the microphone in front of me have consciousness.
1435720	1440920	Well, as Arthur Eddington pointed out, we know so little about matter
1440920	1445400	that we can't say that it doesn't have consciousness because we don't know anything about matter.
1445400	1449720	So there's nothing to do with idealism, nothing to do with spirituality,
1449720	1452200	nothing to do with our place in the universe.
1452200	1455000	These are just things that we're confused about.
1455000	1461000	And my own view is a much more interesting question is what's inaccessible to consciousness?
1461000	1465000	I don't try to convince other people of what's interesting.
1465000	1467960	I'm just saying to me that looks much more interesting.
1467960	1469400	We can learn a lot about it.
1469400	1477400	We can discover how it is closely integrated with the tiny fragments that reach consciousness.
1477400	1479960	Our brain is doing all kinds of things.
1479960	1484760	Occasionally it's throwing off little bits and pieces that we're conscious of.
1484760	1490280	Well, those fragments are some interest, but I don't think they're the main interest
1490280	1493240	in finding out what our mental processes are.
1493240	1497240	As far as the distinctiveness of human beings, we don't have to worry about
1498200	1500360	the kinds of questions you raise.
1500360	1502520	First of all, we don't have to worry about a role.
1502520	1507080	But there are distinctive properties of humans, totally distinct.
1507080	1508040	And that's interesting.
1508680	1513000	One distinctive property of humans is what you and I are now doing.
1513000	1517800	There's no other organisms that can have discussions about these or any other questions.
1517800	1524440	That means language and thought in any sense we understand thought appear to be unique human
1524440	1525720	characteristics.
1525720	1530600	There's no analog to them anywhere in the world, maybe universe.
1530600	1533000	And they seem to be common to all humans.
1533000	1535560	So it looks like a species property.
1536120	1540200	We don't know of any differences among humans in these capacities.
1540200	1548040	So we can speak and grow up in any community and pick up easily the language and its thought system.
1548040	1550760	So it seems to be just common human.
1550760	1557960	It's a pretty good reason to suspect that these capacities emerged along with modern humans.
1557960	1562600	So if you look at the archaeological record, skimpy, but there's something,
1562600	1568520	there's no evidence for any meaningful symbolic activity before humans appear.
1568520	1570920	You may get a scratch on a bone or something.
1571480	1574840	But there's essentially nothing before humans appear.
1574840	1578600	Not long after humans appear in evolutionary time,
1578600	1583240	you start getting very rich and complex symbolic activity.
1583240	1588760	All of which suggests that along with modern humans came these capacities.
1588760	1594840	Language, thought, which are probably the same thing as was assumed incidentally by
1594840	1598600	Aristotle, classical Indian philosophy and so on.
1598600	1604200	Didn't really distinguish language and thought that runs through pretty much until the modern period.
1604200	1608600	But I think it's a plausible assumption.
1608600	1610200	I think we're coming back to it.
1610200	1613800	The language is just the system for generating thought.
1613800	1618200	Thought is what's generated by language, internal thought, internal language,
1618200	1621400	not the noises that we speak, which is superficial.
1622600	1627640	If that's anywhere near true, then the interesting questions are what are the
1627640	1631160	properties of this internal thought language system?
1631240	1636120	I think that's much more interesting than the fragments that reach consciousness,
1636120	1639640	which are fragments, so we're probably not going to learn much about them.
1640840	1646280	I mean, a good example, an illustration of this is what's called inner speech.
1647480	1653000	When you think to yourself in language, if you pay attention to it, it's not language.
1653640	1654920	It's the sounds.
1655480	1659640	So when you think about a sentence, you can ask, how long is it?
1660280	1661960	Does it rhyme with another one?
1661960	1663240	That's not language.
1663240	1668200	That's the externalization of language in one or another sensory motor medium.
1668200	1671320	And the sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.
1671320	1674200	They were there millions of years before language emerged.
1674200	1675640	They've never changed.
1675640	1680600	So they're non-linguistic systems that we use to externalize what's
1680600	1683720	like you could use gesture sign just the same.
1683720	1685080	It doesn't even have to do sound.
1685880	1687960	So we don't want to be misled by that.
1687960	1690920	What we call inner speech is not inner.
1690920	1691800	It's outer.
1691800	1693640	What's inner, we have no access to.
1695880	1699640	Do you think the fact that we speak English, for example?
1699640	1703400	I mean, as someone who's obviously a master of linguistics, and I mean,
1703400	1706280	you're pretty much known as the father of cognitive science,
1706280	1710200	do you think that our limitations in terms of the language we use most often,
1710200	1713160	which is English, well, for the most part in this case,
1713720	1717560	limits our ability to discuss certain philosophical questions,
1717560	1718760	like this mind-body problem?
1718760	1721080	Do you think if we had a different language that portrayed more meaning,
1721080	1724680	perhaps ancient Chinese Sanskrit, that we'd be better off today?
1726360	1729080	There is a hypothesis.
1729080	1731400	It's called the superior wharf hypothesis.
1731960	1735160	Edward Superior, Benjamin Lee Wharf, about a century ago,
1735960	1743000	arguing that the way we think is shaped in some significant way by the language that we speak.
1743960	1750200	This hypothesis has been investigated empirically for about 75 years,
1751400	1755480	almost nothing, and a few superficial things.
1755480	1760200	So, for example, the first person to study it, Eric Leneberg,
1760200	1763720	who went on to found the biology of language, great scientist.
1764360	1765000	He studied it.
1765000	1766840	He was a friend of mine at graduate school.
1768200	1772680	He studied this back in the early 50s, and he found a few things.
1773160	1776600	So he found that there are some languages that have,
1776600	1781080	languages differ in where they put the boundaries of the color words.
1781080	1785080	Like some languages don't have color words, just black and white.
1785080	1789000	Other languages like us have distinguished, say, red and orange.
1789560	1791800	Other languages don't distinguish red and orange.
1792440	1793800	Hopi, for example.
1793800	1796840	And you get some effects of that, but they're meaningless.
1796840	1800760	So if you take a language which doesn't distinguish red and orange,
1801320	1804280	and you ask people, you give them a patch of color,
1804280	1806040	and then you show that patch of color.
1806040	1810040	Again, if it's on the red-orange border, if you speak English,
1810040	1811800	you'll remember that I called it red.
1811800	1813080	So you say it's red.
1813080	1815240	If you have a language read, you don't have a label for that.
1815240	1816280	You won't remember.
1816280	1817320	So you won't call it.
1817320	1818920	You won't remember what it was.
1818920	1822520	I mean, very superficial things like that have been discovered,
1822520	1824360	but nothing of any significance.
1824360	1828840	It's still widely debated, but I think the pickings are very thin.
1828840	1834600	So it looks as if every language has ways of talking about everything.
1834600	1836840	Of course, you may not have the words.
1836840	1839960	Like 100 years ago, you didn't have the word computer.
1841000	1842200	So you couldn't talk about them.
1842200	1844040	You could, but not in our sense.
1845800	1850360	You didn't have the word elementary.
1853880	1855320	Talk about quarks.
1855320	1856840	But that's any language.
1856840	1858360	You can pick them up the same way.
1860360	1863000	You mentioned these unconscious processes.
1863000	1864680	And I mean, the more intriguing question is,
1864680	1868680	how do those unconscious processes sort of come into these conscious ones?
1869480	1871800	What do you then think about people like Daniel Dennett,
1871800	1876600	Keith Frankish, who sort of used the argument that because most of what we
1876600	1880520	experience happens unconsciously, we merely, via introspection,
1880520	1884040	tend to make a conclusion that we have some sort of ethereal entity.
1884040	1886600	So in essence, there is no such thing as qualia.
1886600	1891000	Rather, there is a memory of an experience that felt qualitative.
1891000	1893640	But in essence, everything is in fact quantitative.
1893640	1894600	What do you think about that?
1894600	1899080	We draw that conclusion about the enteric nervous system, the gut brain.
1899080	1900200	It's all unconscious.
1900920	1906280	Do we assume there's some ethereal spiritual thing going on in our gut?
1906920	1908440	Not as far as I know.
1908440	1910600	So why should we do it for this brain?
1910600	1911640	Why do we have to be?
1912600	1917000	It's interesting that traditional dualism, Cartesian dualism,
1917000	1921560	metaphysical dualism, was a real, serious scientific theory.
1921560	1927320	Descartes had serious scientific arguments for postulating two substances.
1928360	1931960	Metaphysical dualism was shown to be incorrect,
1931960	1935080	but lots of scientific theories are shown science.
1935640	1940840	It's been replaced by something else, what I sometimes called methodological dualism.
1941320	1945480	A methodological dual, nobody will say I'm a methodological dualist,
1945480	1949240	but a lot of people act that way, including the ones you're describing.
1949240	1955000	They say, when we discuss something sort of below the neck, metaphorically speaking,
1955000	1956600	we're allowed to be rational.
1956600	1960680	When we discuss things up here, we have to become totally irrational.
1960680	1962840	That's methodological dualism.
1962840	1966840	As I say, nobody says, professes it, but you just said,
1967480	1973800	why should we treat the unconscious processes here differently than the unconscious processes
1973800	1974840	down here?
1974840	1976360	I don't see any reason.
1976360	1983000	I think Locke-John Locke was basically correct for getting the theological framework.
1984520	1985880	However, the world works.
1986520	1991960	There are facts about motion that are inconceivable to us,
1991960	1995640	and there are facts about thought that are inconceivable to us,
1995640	1999000	but they're there, and we can study them and learn about them
1999000	2006600	and assume that whatever thought is some property of organized forms of matter,
2006600	2008760	where matter is just whatever there is.
2008760	2013720	When Locke used the word matter or body, he didn't mean anything specific.
2013720	2017240	He said, whatever the world is constituted of, we don't know.
2017240	2018760	Newton showed that we don't know.
2019320	2024200	I think that's a sense of latitude, and I don't think we've progressed beyond it.
2026600	2030760	No, when you think about, I mentioned earlier that a lot of people
2030760	2033320	are pretty much obsessed with this mind-body problem because
2034040	2038040	it's a replacement for sort of agnosticism and atheism today.
2038760	2041320	What advice do you give these people growing up today in a world
2041320	2045880	where science has proven so much and taken away so much in terms of their spirituality
2045880	2048520	and their purpose in life?
2049720	2053880	What can you tell them in order to keep going, keep moving forward and keep focusing?
2054840	2059240	Just as some sort of inspirational advice from your side.
2060840	2068520	I can't speak for others, but I find inspiration enough in what Galileo, for example,
2069160	2073320	regarded as one of the most awesome features of the universe.
2074120	2079400	For Galileo and his contemporaries, one of the most amazing things in the universe
2079480	2082040	awe-inspiring was what you and I are now doing.
2082600	2089400	How can humans be capable of constructing from a finite number of symbols,
2089400	2097240	constructing an infinite number of thoughts, and even using these thoughts to convey to others
2097800	2102360	who have no access to our minds, the innermost workings of our minds.
2102360	2109080	So you have no access to my mind, but I can convey to you with a finite number of symbols
2109480	2111800	the innermost workings of my mind.
2112360	2117560	Galileo thought this is the most amazing phenomenon in the universe.
2118360	2124200	Galileo himself regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions
2124200	2129560	because it was able to implement this comparable to Michelangelo or Titian.
2129560	2132200	Well, to me, that seems inspiring enough.
2132200	2135480	I've sometimes called it the Galilean challenge.
2135480	2137320	How is this conceivable?
2137320	2142360	It's Cartier-Cartes problem, which led him to postulate a second substance.
2142360	2150040	Well, as Newton showed, we're left with only one substance, mind, the other one, disappeared body.
2150760	2153800	But I don't see why we need...
2155320	2162280	I find it inspiring enough that physicists cannot discover 95%.
2163160	2166520	I think that's the number of what constitutes the universe.
2166520	2167960	It seems to me exciting enough.
2170280	2172600	The more we discover, the more we realize how much we don't know.
2173480	2176840	For example, I mean, the Liberty experiments, a lot of the experiments on free will.
2176840	2179480	A lot of people believe now that we have no free will.
2179480	2182040	What are your thoughts on the relationship between mind and free will?
2183320	2184680	That's an interesting question.
2186600	2191800	Every one of us acts as though we believe in freedom of will.
2192280	2196120	100% of us, including those who deny that there is free will.
2196760	2201800	They all act as if they believe in free will.
2201800	2203240	Point number one.
2203240	2204360	Point number two.
2204360	2206760	The science tells us anything about it.
2206760	2208360	Answer, no.
2208360	2209800	Science tells us.
2209800	2210760	Can't determine it.
