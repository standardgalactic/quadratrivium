1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
No, if I had to ask you to give me a philosophical history of the mind-body problem, what story

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,360
would you tell me?

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:32,000
This has a long history back to the classical era, but in the modern period, the basic mind-body

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,720
problem that has entered and persisted in modern philosophy is basically the Cartesian

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
formula.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:49,760
The Cartesian formula was based on the fundamental principle that initiated modern science, so

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,000
called mechanical philosophy, philosophy of course, meant science.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,080
So Galileo and his contemporaries sharply reacted against the neo-scholastic reigning

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:15,760
doctrine's version of Aristotelianism, which were based on what they called occult properties.

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,240
So two things, two material bodies attract each other because they have sympathies, an

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,080
object move because of its internal energy agency, it moves to the place where it belongs.

12
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,480
It's a natural place.

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:40,160
The natural place of a material object is the earth, and so it falls, and other occult

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,920
properties of this kind.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,400
They wanted actual explanations, and the explanations had to be, assume, had to show that the world

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,080
was intelligible, and there was a criterion for intelligibility, namely, could what you

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,640
describe be constructed by a skilled artisan, that's the mechanical philosophy.

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,680
I have to remember that at this time, Europe was flooded with complex intricate artifacts

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,880
made by skilled artisans, which model humans, played puppeteers, Gordon's inversa, you

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
know, seemed semi-human.

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,080
In fact, it was kind of like today, mostly misleading.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,600
The idea was a true explanation would be a mechanical model, that's the mechanical philosophy.

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:43,080
Descartes, it was believed by essentially everyone, Galileo, Descartes, Isaac Newton,

24
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,720
Leibniz, Christian Huygens, it was simply the reigning doctrine of modern science.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Descartes tried to work it out.

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,680
He thought he had shown that there is a mechanical explanation for all phenomena of the world,

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
with one exception, the human mind.

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,160
He said the human mind has properties that cannot be accommodated by a mechanical object.

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:20,000
One of them, properties incidentally was language, said the capacity of humans to create new

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,840
expressions, indefinitely expressing new thoughts, and to do so in ways that are appropriate

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,880
to situations, but not caused by them, is a property that goes beyond the capacity of

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
mechanism.

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,560
Well, that was the, so therefore, serious scientist, he established a new principle,

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,440
race cogitance, and his metaphysics, a substance, thinking substance, and that's in addition

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,320
to race extensa, matter.

36
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,440
So there are two substances, matter and mind, and then of course he seek to link them and

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,760
he argued that there's maybe a connection through the pineal gland, which is not duplicated

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,760
in the brain, just one place.

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,200
So that's basically the classical mind-body problem, didn't last very long.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,320
Newton showed much to his distress that there are no bodies.

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:25,920
One of the two elements of the picture disappeared, contrary to what's claimed by many modern

42
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,160
philosophers, Gilbert Ryle and others, that Newton didn't exercise the ghost in the machine.

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,040
He exercised the machine, the ghost was left intact.

44
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,240
He showed there are no bodies in the sense of the mechanical philosophy.

45
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,480
And Newton regarded this as a total absurdity, so that it's so absurd that no person with

46
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,520
any scientific understanding can possibly believe it, and in fact his main work is called,

47
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,760
not called physics, or in those days philosophy, it's called mathematics, because as he said,

48
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,280
he has only a mathematical account.

49
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,480
He cannot give a physical explanation because what he's postulating makes no sense in physical

50
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
terms.

51
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,800
For the rest of his life, in fact, he showed in fact that Descartes' model didn't work,

52
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,080
and in fact no model would work.

53
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
That's Newton's great discovery.

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,360
He thought it was ridiculous.

55
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,240
His contemporaries thought it was ridiculous.

56
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,600
For the rest of his life, Newton tried to find some kind of answer to this.

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,560
But total equipment, I do not make hypotheses, was in the context of explaining that he has

58
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,320
no physical explanation, so he can only give a mathematical model.

59
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,080
Well, there were various reactions to this.

60
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,600
One reaction, connection with the mind-body problem, was John Locke's.

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,480
This is not in his major work, but in a letter to Stilling Fleet.

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,120
He discussed this, and his conclusion was basically, quote him, that the judicious Mr.

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:17,320
Newton has demonstrated that God attributed to matter properties that we cannot conceive

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,480
that are inconceivable to us.

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,160
And similar, he said, God may have super-added to matter the property of thought, meaning

66
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
some organized form of matter yields thought.

67
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,840
That idea was picked up through the 18th century by just about every major figure who tried

68
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,920
to show how, as some put it, the brain secretes thought the way the liver secretes vile.

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:55,520
This reached its abagy with Pristly, the chemist philosopher, in the late 18th century, developed

70
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
these ideas extensively.

71
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,560
In the 19th century, they were pursued, but not intensively, then they were forgotten.

72
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,840
When the revolution took place in the 20th century, all of this was totally forgotten.

73
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,560
In fact, it's still mostly unknown to philosophers and cognitive scientists and others.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,160
It was rediscovered in the 20th century.

75
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,720
The last decade, it was by mid-20th century, essentially rediscovered in the study of language.

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
That's what generative grammar is.

77
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,920
But in the world of philosophy, cognitive science, it was not rediscovered until the

78
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,160
last decade of the 20th century.

79
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,560
It was called the decade of the brain, a decade devoted to the brain.

80
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,680
At the conclusion of it, the neuroscientists, too, gave the concluding summary of it, Vernon

81
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,320
Mount Gossel, described what he called the thesis of the new biology, that the thought

82
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,000
is simply a property of the brain.

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,920
This was considered what Francis Krip called an astonishing hypothesis, a radical new idea

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,160
and philosophy of mind, very exciting.

85
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,840
It's repeated in almost the same words, what was commonplace in the 18th century as a result

86
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,040
of block suggestion.

87
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,080
And that's basically where it stands, I think.

88
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,320
There was another consequence of Newton's demolition of the mechanical philosophy.

89
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,080
Science changed its course.

90
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,120
The early modern science, Galileo through Newton, sought to discover an intelligible

91
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,160
world that was given up.

92
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,560
Scientists recognized tacitly, nobody actually said it, that you can't find an intelligible

93
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
world.

94
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:58,800
As John Locke said in his theological framework, God has added to matter properties that are

95
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,400
inconceivable to us, but it's just a fact.

96
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,320
And in fact, science proceeded with that fact, not forgetting the theological framework.

97
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
It just sought intelligible theories.

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,160
That's very different.

99
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,320
So Newton's theories were intelligible.

100
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,680
Leibniz, Huygens could understand Newton's theories.

101
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,400
It was the world that they described that was unintelligible, and Newton agreed.

102
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:35,000
But over time, science just lowered its aspirations to developing theories that were intelligible,

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,880
however inconceivable of the world that they described.

104
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,560
Just abandoned that hope.

105
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:49,120
By the time you get to 20th century Bertrand Russell, the science is very well, he simply

106
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,920
said it's ridiculous to seek intelligibility.

107
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,720
Who cares?

108
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,680
We just want theories that work.

109
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,680
That's a big difference from the early modern science, which had much higher aspirations.

110
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,920
This is often not understood.

111
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,520
I should say there's more to it than that.

112
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,840
Newton recognized that the world seemed to have inconceivable properties, and he speculated

113
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,040
that as far as we know, all matter might be alive, all matter, including the coffee

114
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,320
cup in front of it.

115
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,760
We know so little of matter that we can't show that it's not alive.

116
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,200
In the 20th century, this was picked up independently.

117
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,880
Sir Arthur Eddington, great astrophysicist, said we know so little of matter that for

118
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,720
all, we know all matter is conscious, can't show that atoms aren't conscious, because

119
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,640
we just don't know anything about matter.

120
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,480
Bertrand Russell had similar position.

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,720
In fact, it's kind of interesting if you look at today's philosophy, what's exciting

122
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,840
topic in philosophy today is what's called the hard problem of consciousness.

123
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,680
The 17th century also had a hard problem.

124
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,080
The hard problem was motion.

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
How can you account for motion?

126
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,880
Answer, you can't.

127
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,400
But the hard problem of the 17th century was quite different from today's hard problem.

128
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,600
If you look at the hard problem of motion, the problem was formulated.

129
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
You could state properties of motion.

130
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,120
Say here are the properties of motion.

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,840
How can we find an explanation for them?

132
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,640
That was the hard problem in the 17th century.

133
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,240
And Newton's discovery was there's no explanation in what we consider physical.

134
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,120
It's quite different.

135
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,080
It's not formulated.

136
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,400
The problem is what is it like to see the sunrise in the morning?

137
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,280
Well, nobody can say what it's like to see the sunrise in the morning.

138
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,360
You can write a poem about it, maybe, but you can't say here are the properties of it.

139
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
And what does it like to be a bet?

140
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
Nobody can say, what does it like to be me?

141
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,960
I could write a book about it, maybe, but I can't say here are the properties.

142
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,480
Well, this is an elementary thing, unless you state what you want an explanation for.

143
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,720
So the hard problem of today's philosophy is formulated in a way which is unanswerable.

144
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,280
So it's not a problem at all.

145
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,880
It's just I'm confused.

146
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
It's not a problem.

147
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,080
It's quite different from the 17th, 18th century, when the problem was quite real

148
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,120
and explicit and not answered.

149
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,600
So I think we should be very cautious about paying attention to what's the hot topic

150
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
in the philosophical literature.

151
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,520
It's not a formulated problem.

152
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,200
It's just an expression of confusion.

153
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,600
And as far as the radical new idea in philosophy, that's luck.

154
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,040
And I think we should recognize the antecedents, the history, the context,

155
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,240
and what is not conceivable to us, though apparently true.

156
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,520
So, no, there are so many different takes on consciousness at this point.

157
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,720
So many people have different theories of consciousness.

158
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,760
There's panpsychism, there's illusionism, there's idealism,

159
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,400
reductive physicalism, materialism.

160
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,080
Where do you think we stand today?

161
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you think is the most prominent thought process behind theories of consciousness?

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Would you say it is reductive materialism?

163
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
There is no such thing as materialism.

164
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,800
Materialism, if it exists, has to give some account of what matter is.

165
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,760
You can't have a theory of materialism if you don't tell us what matter is.

166
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,520
And nobody knows what matter is.

167
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,320
So there's no materialism.

168
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,720
That's why, as Arthur Eddington, Russell, actually Newton pointed out,

169
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,680
we have no concept of matter.

170
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,240
So if you look at the problem of what's so-called the problem of consciousness,

171
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
we know a great deal about consciousness.

172
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,520
In fact, we know more about consciousness than anything else.

173
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,440
It's something that both Russell and most more recently,

174
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,360
Gell and Strossen have emphasized.

175
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,520
I can tell you a ton of things about my current consciousness.

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,120
I could describe in detail everything I'm seeing and so on.

177
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,520
What we don't know is what matter is.

178
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,560
Consciousness and matter, because we're ignorant of matter.

179
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,520
That's why Eddington said, for all we know, all matter is conscious,

180
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,320
because we know nothing about matter.

181
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,640
As Newton said, maybe all matter is alive, because we don't know anything about matter.

182
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,720
So these questions are not formulated in a coherent fashion.

183
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,520
As far as panpsychism is concerned, it's basically Eddington's speculation.

184
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,960
But actually Gell and Strossen is one who has argued for it.

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Interesting arguments, I'm personally not convinced, but coherent arguments, at least.

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,320
But until what we can try to do is what was done by science,

187
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,520
after Newton showed that we cannot find an intelligible universe,

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,120
try to find intelligible theories.

189
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,920
So let's construct the best theories we can to account for the properties of consciousness.

190
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
That's all we can do.

191
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,040
Can't reduce it to matter, because we don't know what matter is.

192
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,360
Can't say, I don't think you can say anything about panpsychism,

193
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,560
that we cannot show that all matter is not conscious,

194
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
but that's because we don't understand anything about matter.

195
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,400
In fact, if you think about it, what is matter?

196
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,840
I mean, there's a great physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, John Wheeler,

197
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,080
who suggested that maybe all there is in the universe is answers to the questions we pose.

198
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,560
It's a theory called it from bit, all that exists as bits.

199
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,240
We pose a question, get an answer, that's the universe.

200
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,360
There's nothing else.

201
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,320
I mean, I'm not confident to say whether this is a plausible theory or not,

202
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,400
but suppose it is, then that's matter, answers to your questions.

203
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,600
Right now, physicists are in the strange position of not being able to find,

204
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
I think it's the universe.

205
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,640
Okay, that's where we are.

206
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,520
You can read articles in quantum theory journals.

207
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,680
Someone sent me one recently, or a group of leading quantum theorists debate,

208
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,120
what is a particle, most fundamental question.

209
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
I can't reach any conclusion.

210
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,520
Well, that's where we are with regard to matter.

211
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm not sure, Naomi, if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman's work

212
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,480
and his theory of consciousness.

213
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,520
Whose theory?

214
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,400
Donald Hoffman.

215
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,880
It's a description of properties of consciousness.

216
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,720
I don't see a theory in the sense of explanation of anything.

217
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,280
Because he's basically one of those physicists who have concluded that

218
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,280
space and time, in essence, don't really exist.

219
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,160
So what he's trying to do is build a theory where conscious agents

220
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,040
are the fundamental entity of reality, and then he moves on from there.

221
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,720
But where do you think the problem lies with starting from there?

222
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,320
What is explained?

223
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,800
A theory provides explanations.

224
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
That's what a theory is.

225
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,560
What is explained?

226
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,040
Yeah, that's a good question.

227
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,760
What about that?

228
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
And sorry, did you want to add to that?

229
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,600
I just want to express my own ignorance.

230
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,320
With respect to the conclusions about space and time, I'm not competent to comment.

231
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,240
I know physicists are exercised about this and have no real answers.

232
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,760
I don't.

233
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,560
There seems to be a shift in physics at the moment where a lot of the theories

234
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,560
are starting to expose that space and time, the way we think about space-time,

235
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,640
does not seem to be what even Einstein and physics has shown us.

236
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,240
So Newtonian physics, both Einstein and Newton,

237
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,200
it all seems to be being thrown out the window at this point,

238
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,920
which is making some physicists question the fundamental edge of reality completely.

239
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,760
And because of that, it's opening up the doors to a new form of idealism

240
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,640
where now consciousness is fundamental, and then we move on from there.

241
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,480
What do you think about that approach of the idealistic view of seeing consciousness?

242
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,320
I don't think any of these discussions in physics, which I'm not competent to have a judgment about,

243
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,760
I don't think any of them bear unconsciousness in the least.

244
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,960
They don't tell us about the fact that I see a red spot, what I feel like when I see the red spot.

245
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,520
I don't see anything about that.

246
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,440
That's consciousness.

247
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,640
Furthermore, I don't really understand the preoccupation with consciousness.

248
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
It's a pretty new preoccupation.

249
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,520
It's not true in the history of philosophy.

250
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,320
One of the probably the major scholarly study of this is by Uru Thiel,

251
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,800
who points out that consciousness became an issue in philosophy

252
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:32,960
pretty much with the Neoplatonist 17th century Cartesian's Ralph Cudworth.

253
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,160
He says it was the first to discuss consciousness seriously.

254
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,720
But they were talking about self-consciousness, awareness of ourselves.

255
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,240
And that was the topic of consciousness right up to the 20th century.

256
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,560
20th century, for some reason, there was a sudden great concern with consciousness in recent years.

257
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,360
It's been, as I said, the problem, the hard problem.

258
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
Only trouble is it's not formulated, so it's not a problem.

259
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
But why consciousness?

260
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:10,040
I mean, it turns out, to the extent that we understand anything, limited, take language,

261
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,360
almost everything that's going on in our minds when you and I are conversing

262
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,680
is completely beyond the reach of consciousness.

263
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,840
There are mental processes taking place.

264
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,120
We have a fair grasp about what many of them are, but we have no more awareness of them

265
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,800
than we have of what's going on in our second nervous system.

266
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,680
We have another huge nervous system called the enteric nervous system.

267
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,560
Sometimes called the gut brain.

268
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,200
It's a huge nervous system, controls everything that's going on in the body.

269
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:51,320
Mid-billions of neurons can have all the properties of simers, Parkinson's, and a huge nervous system.

270
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,960
We know nothing.

271
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,880
We know a lot about it, but from the outside, the way we study the planetary motion,

272
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,800
you have no introspection into it.

273
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
And the same is true of this nervous system.

274
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,880
We have almost no introspective evidence about it.

275
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,920
Very superficial phenomenon.

276
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,040
But we can learn a lot about it the way you learn other things in science.

277
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,280
And the mental acts that are taking place beyond the level of consciousness

278
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,720
interact indissolubly from the few fragments that we're conscious of.

279
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,400
So you're not going to fonts that happen to be conscious.

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,320
You want a real theory of what's going on.

281
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:37,080
You're going to have to integrate whatever we know about or can discover about the internal unconscious,

282
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,680
not in a Freudian sense, inaccessible to consciousness,

283
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,360
operations that are more important than the fragments that reach consciousness.

284
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,800
I think it's more important.

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,440
So it seems to me the emphasis is misplaced, plus the fact that the problem is not formulated

286
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,200
till the problem is formulated, you're not going to have an answer to it.

287
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,320
So I think philosophy is going off into a very dubious directions.

288
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,480
I should say that Galen Strauss and one of the best young philosophers

289
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,280
has put this a little more strongly than I have.

290
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,920
He more strongly than I would, in fact.

291
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,560
What he said is that 20th century philosophy is the silliest period in the history of philosophy.

292
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,400
That's too strong, I think.

293
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,880
But I do think there are real questions about including the unwillingness

294
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,600
to understand the history of the topic, which is revealing I think.

295
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,200
It's worth understanding how these problems developed kind of thing we were talking about.

296
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,080
Sheds a lot of light on what we should be doing, I think.

297
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,800
But the crucial issue is that the hard problem in the 20th century is not formulated

298
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,160
as distinct from the hard problem in the 17th century, which was formulated

299
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,640
and led to very interesting results.

300
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,000
So until today's hard problem is formulated, it will just be wandering in the wilderness.

301
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,800
Hmm. Do you think we have focused so much energy into this hard problem of consciousness?

302
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Because science has exposed so much about reality in terms of spirituality.

303
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,200
God Copernicus taking us out of the center of the universe.

304
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,480
You've got Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain.

305
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,560
And now we have this last that allows us to at least maintain some sort of spirituality

306
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,800
and maybe meaning value purpose.

307
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,520
Do you think that's why we're so obsessed with this topic right now?

308
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,720
This frankly just seems to me empty talk.

309
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,520
Yes, we have consciousness.

310
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,240
I have a dog at my feet.

311
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,560
She have consciousness, I assume.

312
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:55,160
So can't prove it or disprove it as the microphone in front of me have consciousness.

313
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,920
Well, as Arthur Eddington pointed out, we know so little about matter

314
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,400
that we can't say that it doesn't have consciousness because we don't know anything about matter.

315
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,720
So there's nothing to do with idealism, nothing to do with spirituality,

316
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,200
nothing to do with our place in the universe.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,000
These are just things that we're confused about.

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And my own view is a much more interesting question is what's inaccessible to consciousness?

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't try to convince other people of what's interesting.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm just saying to me that looks much more interesting.

321
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,400
We can learn a lot about it.

322
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,400
We can discover how it is closely integrated with the tiny fragments that reach consciousness.

323
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,960
Our brain is doing all kinds of things.

324
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,760
Occasionally it's throwing off little bits and pieces that we're conscious of.

325
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,280
Well, those fragments are some interest, but I don't think they're the main interest

326
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,240
in finding out what our mental processes are.

327
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,240
As far as the distinctiveness of human beings, we don't have to worry about

328
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,360
the kinds of questions you raise.

329
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,520
First of all, we don't have to worry about a role.

330
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,080
But there are distinctive properties of humans, totally distinct.

331
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
And that's interesting.

332
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,000
One distinctive property of humans is what you and I are now doing.

333
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,800
There's no other organisms that can have discussions about these or any other questions.

334
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,440
That means language and thought in any sense we understand thought appear to be unique human

335
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,720
characteristics.

336
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,600
There's no analog to them anywhere in the world, maybe universe.

337
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
And they seem to be common to all humans.

338
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,560
So it looks like a species property.

339
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,200
We don't know of any differences among humans in these capacities.

340
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,040
So we can speak and grow up in any community and pick up easily the language and its thought system.

341
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,760
So it seems to be just common human.

342
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:57,960
It's a pretty good reason to suspect that these capacities emerged along with modern humans.

343
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,600
So if you look at the archaeological record, skimpy, but there's something,

344
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,520
there's no evidence for any meaningful symbolic activity before humans appear.

345
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,920
You may get a scratch on a bone or something.

346
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,840
But there's essentially nothing before humans appear.

347
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,600
Not long after humans appear in evolutionary time,

348
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,240
you start getting very rich and complex symbolic activity.

349
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,760
All of which suggests that along with modern humans came these capacities.

350
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,840
Language, thought, which are probably the same thing as was assumed incidentally by

351
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,600
Aristotle, classical Indian philosophy and so on.

352
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,200
Didn't really distinguish language and thought that runs through pretty much until the modern period.

353
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,600
But I think it's a plausible assumption.

354
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
I think we're coming back to it.

355
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,800
The language is just the system for generating thought.

356
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Thought is what's generated by language, internal thought, internal language,

357
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,400
not the noises that we speak, which is superficial.

358
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,640
If that's anywhere near true, then the interesting questions are what are the

359
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,160
properties of this internal thought language system?

360
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,120
I think that's much more interesting than the fragments that reach consciousness,

361
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,640
which are fragments, so we're probably not going to learn much about them.

362
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,280
I mean, a good example, an illustration of this is what's called inner speech.

363
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,000
When you think to yourself in language, if you pay attention to it, it's not language.

364
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
It's the sounds.

365
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,640
So when you think about a sentence, you can ask, how long is it?

366
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
Does it rhyme with another one?

367
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,240
That's not language.

368
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,200
That's the externalization of language in one or another sensory motor medium.

369
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,320
And the sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.

370
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,200
They were there millions of years before language emerged.

371
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,640
They've never changed.

372
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,600
So they're non-linguistic systems that we use to externalize what's

373
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,720
like you could use gesture sign just the same.

374
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,080
It doesn't even have to do sound.

375
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,960
So we don't want to be misled by that.

376
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,920
What we call inner speech is not inner.

377
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,800
It's outer.

378
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,640
What's inner, we have no access to.

379
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,640
Do you think the fact that we speak English, for example?

380
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,400
I mean, as someone who's obviously a master of linguistics, and I mean,

381
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,280
you're pretty much known as the father of cognitive science,

382
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,200
do you think that our limitations in terms of the language we use most often,

383
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,160
which is English, well, for the most part in this case,

384
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,560
limits our ability to discuss certain philosophical questions,

385
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,760
like this mind-body problem?

386
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,080
Do you think if we had a different language that portrayed more meaning,

387
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,680
perhaps ancient Chinese Sanskrit, that we'd be better off today?

388
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,080
There is a hypothesis.

389
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,400
It's called the superior wharf hypothesis.

390
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,160
Edward Superior, Benjamin Lee Wharf, about a century ago,

391
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,000
arguing that the way we think is shaped in some significant way by the language that we speak.

392
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,200
This hypothesis has been investigated empirically for about 75 years,

393
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,480
almost nothing, and a few superficial things.

394
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,200
So, for example, the first person to study it, Eric Leneberg,

395
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,720
who went on to found the biology of language, great scientist.

396
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,000
He studied it.

397
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,840
He was a friend of mine at graduate school.

398
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,680
He studied this back in the early 50s, and he found a few things.

399
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,600
So he found that there are some languages that have,

400
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,080
languages differ in where they put the boundaries of the color words.

401
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Like some languages don't have color words, just black and white.

402
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,000
Other languages like us have distinguished, say, red and orange.

403
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,800
Other languages don't distinguish red and orange.

404
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,800
Hopi, for example.

405
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,840
And you get some effects of that, but they're meaningless.

406
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,760
So if you take a language which doesn't distinguish red and orange,

407
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,280
and you ask people, you give them a patch of color,

408
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,040
and then you show that patch of color.

409
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Again, if it's on the red-orange border, if you speak English,

410
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,800
you'll remember that I called it red.

411
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,080
So you say it's red.

412
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,240
If you have a language read, you don't have a label for that.

413
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,280
You won't remember.

414
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,320
So you won't call it.

415
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,920
You won't remember what it was.

416
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,520
I mean, very superficial things like that have been discovered,

417
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,360
but nothing of any significance.

418
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,840
It's still widely debated, but I think the pickings are very thin.

419
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,600
So it looks as if every language has ways of talking about everything.

420
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,840
Of course, you may not have the words.

421
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,960
Like 100 years ago, you didn't have the word computer.

422
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
So you couldn't talk about them.

423
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,040
You could, but not in our sense.

424
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,360
You didn't have the word elementary.

425
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
Talk about quarks.

426
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,840
But that's any language.

427
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,360
You can pick them up the same way.

428
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,000
You mentioned these unconscious processes.

429
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
And I mean, the more intriguing question is,

430
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,680
how do those unconscious processes sort of come into these conscious ones?

431
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,800
What do you then think about people like Daniel Dennett,

432
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,600
Keith Frankish, who sort of used the argument that because most of what we

433
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,520
experience happens unconsciously, we merely, via introspection,

434
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,040
tend to make a conclusion that we have some sort of ethereal entity.

435
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,600
So in essence, there is no such thing as qualia.

436
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,000
Rather, there is a memory of an experience that felt qualitative.

437
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,640
But in essence, everything is in fact quantitative.

438
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,600
What do you think about that?

439
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,080
We draw that conclusion about the enteric nervous system, the gut brain.

440
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,200
It's all unconscious.

441
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,280
Do we assume there's some ethereal spiritual thing going on in our gut?

442
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,440
Not as far as I know.

443
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,600
So why should we do it for this brain?

444
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,640
Why do we have to be?

445
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,000
It's interesting that traditional dualism, Cartesian dualism,

446
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,560
metaphysical dualism, was a real, serious scientific theory.

447
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,320
Descartes had serious scientific arguments for postulating two substances.

448
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,960
Metaphysical dualism was shown to be incorrect,

449
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,080
but lots of scientific theories are shown science.

450
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,840
It's been replaced by something else, what I sometimes called methodological dualism.

451
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,480
A methodological dual, nobody will say I'm a methodological dualist,

452
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,240
but a lot of people act that way, including the ones you're describing.

453
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,000
They say, when we discuss something sort of below the neck, metaphorically speaking,

454
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,600
we're allowed to be rational.

455
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,680
When we discuss things up here, we have to become totally irrational.

456
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,840
That's methodological dualism.

457
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,840
As I say, nobody says, professes it, but you just said,

458
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,800
why should we treat the unconscious processes here differently than the unconscious processes

459
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,840
down here?

460
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,360
I don't see any reason.

461
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:03,000
I think Locke-John Locke was basically correct for getting the theological framework.

462
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,880
However, the world works.

463
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,960
There are facts about motion that are inconceivable to us,

464
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,640
and there are facts about thought that are inconceivable to us,

465
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,000
but they're there, and we can study them and learn about them

466
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,600
and assume that whatever thought is some property of organized forms of matter,

467
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,760
where matter is just whatever there is.

468
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,720
When Locke used the word matter or body, he didn't mean anything specific.

469
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,240
He said, whatever the world is constituted of, we don't know.

470
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,760
Newton showed that we don't know.

471
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,200
I think that's a sense of latitude, and I don't think we've progressed beyond it.

472
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,760
No, when you think about, I mentioned earlier that a lot of people

473
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
are pretty much obsessed with this mind-body problem because

474
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,040
it's a replacement for sort of agnosticism and atheism today.

475
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,320
What advice do you give these people growing up today in a world

476
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,880
where science has proven so much and taken away so much in terms of their spirituality

477
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,520
and their purpose in life?

478
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,880
What can you tell them in order to keep going, keep moving forward and keep focusing?

479
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,240
Just as some sort of inspirational advice from your side.

480
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,520
I can't speak for others, but I find inspiration enough in what Galileo, for example,

481
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,320
regarded as one of the most awesome features of the universe.

482
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,400
For Galileo and his contemporaries, one of the most amazing things in the universe

483
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,040
awe-inspiring was what you and I are now doing.

484
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:49,400
How can humans be capable of constructing from a finite number of symbols,

485
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:57,240
constructing an infinite number of thoughts, and even using these thoughts to convey to others

486
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,360
who have no access to our minds, the innermost workings of our minds.

487
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:09,080
So you have no access to my mind, but I can convey to you with a finite number of symbols

488
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,800
the innermost workings of my mind.

489
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,560
Galileo thought this is the most amazing phenomenon in the universe.

490
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,200
Galileo himself regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions

491
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,560
because it was able to implement this comparable to Michelangelo or Titian.

492
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,200
Well, to me, that seems inspiring enough.

493
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,480
I've sometimes called it the Galilean challenge.

494
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,320
How is this conceivable?

495
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,360
It's Cartier-Cartes problem, which led him to postulate a second substance.

496
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:50,040
Well, as Newton showed, we're left with only one substance, mind, the other one, disappeared body.

497
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,800
But I don't see why we need...

498
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:02,280
I find it inspiring enough that physicists cannot discover 95%.

499
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,520
I think that's the number of what constitutes the universe.

500
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,960
It seems to me exciting enough.

501
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,600
The more we discover, the more we realize how much we don't know.

502
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,840
For example, I mean, the Liberty experiments, a lot of the experiments on free will.

503
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,480
A lot of people believe now that we have no free will.

504
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,040
What are your thoughts on the relationship between mind and free will?

505
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,680
That's an interesting question.

506
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Every one of us acts as though we believe in freedom of will.

507
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,120
100% of us, including those who deny that there is free will.

508
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,800
They all act as if they believe in free will.

509
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,240
Point number one.

510
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,360
Point number two.

511
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,760
The science tells us anything about it.

512
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,360
Answer, no.

513
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,800
Science tells us.

514
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,760
Can't determine it.
