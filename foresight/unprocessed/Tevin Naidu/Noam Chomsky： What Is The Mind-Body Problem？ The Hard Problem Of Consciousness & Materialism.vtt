00:00.000 --> 00:18.640
No, if I had to ask you to give me a philosophical history of the mind-body problem, what story

00:18.640 --> 00:22.360
would you tell me?

00:22.360 --> 00:32.000
This has a long history back to the classical era, but in the modern period, the basic mind-body

00:32.000 --> 00:39.720
problem that has entered and persisted in modern philosophy is basically the Cartesian

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
formula.

00:40.720 --> 00:49.760
The Cartesian formula was based on the fundamental principle that initiated modern science, so

00:49.760 --> 00:56.000
called mechanical philosophy, philosophy of course, meant science.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.080
So Galileo and his contemporaries sharply reacted against the neo-scholastic reigning

01:06.080 --> 01:15.760
doctrine's version of Aristotelianism, which were based on what they called occult properties.

01:15.760 --> 01:23.240
So two things, two material bodies attract each other because they have sympathies, an

01:23.240 --> 01:31.080
object move because of its internal energy agency, it moves to the place where it belongs.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.480
It's a natural place.

01:32.480 --> 01:40.160
The natural place of a material object is the earth, and so it falls, and other occult

01:40.160 --> 01:41.920
properties of this kind.

01:41.920 --> 01:49.400
They wanted actual explanations, and the explanations had to be, assume, had to show that the world

01:49.400 --> 01:56.080
was intelligible, and there was a criterion for intelligibility, namely, could what you

01:56.080 --> 02:02.640
describe be constructed by a skilled artisan, that's the mechanical philosophy.

02:02.640 --> 02:10.680
I have to remember that at this time, Europe was flooded with complex intricate artifacts

02:10.680 --> 02:18.880
made by skilled artisans, which model humans, played puppeteers, Gordon's inversa, you

02:18.880 --> 02:20.880
know, seemed semi-human.

02:20.880 --> 02:26.080
In fact, it was kind of like today, mostly misleading.

02:26.080 --> 02:34.600
The idea was a true explanation would be a mechanical model, that's the mechanical philosophy.

02:35.320 --> 02:43.080
Descartes, it was believed by essentially everyone, Galileo, Descartes, Isaac Newton,

02:43.080 --> 02:50.720
Leibniz, Christian Huygens, it was simply the reigning doctrine of modern science.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.040
Descartes tried to work it out.

02:53.040 --> 03:01.680
He thought he had shown that there is a mechanical explanation for all phenomena of the world,

03:01.680 --> 03:03.920
with one exception, the human mind.

03:03.920 --> 03:12.160
He said the human mind has properties that cannot be accommodated by a mechanical object.

03:12.160 --> 03:20.000
One of them, properties incidentally was language, said the capacity of humans to create new

03:20.000 --> 03:27.840
expressions, indefinitely expressing new thoughts, and to do so in ways that are appropriate

03:27.840 --> 03:33.880
to situations, but not caused by them, is a property that goes beyond the capacity of

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
mechanism.

03:34.880 --> 03:41.560
Well, that was the, so therefore, serious scientist, he established a new principle,

03:41.560 --> 03:48.440
race cogitance, and his metaphysics, a substance, thinking substance, and that's in addition

03:48.440 --> 03:51.320
to race extensa, matter.

03:51.320 --> 03:57.440
So there are two substances, matter and mind, and then of course he seek to link them and

03:57.440 --> 04:03.760
he argued that there's maybe a connection through the pineal gland, which is not duplicated

04:03.760 --> 04:05.760
in the brain, just one place.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.200
So that's basically the classical mind-body problem, didn't last very long.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.320
Newton showed much to his distress that there are no bodies.

04:16.320 --> 04:25.920
One of the two elements of the picture disappeared, contrary to what's claimed by many modern

04:25.920 --> 04:32.160
philosophers, Gilbert Ryle and others, that Newton didn't exercise the ghost in the machine.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.040
He exercised the machine, the ghost was left intact.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.240
He showed there are no bodies in the sense of the mechanical philosophy.

04:40.240 --> 04:45.480
And Newton regarded this as a total absurdity, so that it's so absurd that no person with

04:45.480 --> 04:52.520
any scientific understanding can possibly believe it, and in fact his main work is called,

04:52.520 --> 04:59.760
not called physics, or in those days philosophy, it's called mathematics, because as he said,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.280
he has only a mathematical account.

05:02.280 --> 05:09.480
He cannot give a physical explanation because what he's postulating makes no sense in physical

05:09.480 --> 05:10.480
terms.

05:10.480 --> 05:17.800
For the rest of his life, in fact, he showed in fact that Descartes' model didn't work,

05:17.800 --> 05:20.080
and in fact no model would work.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.240
That's Newton's great discovery.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.360
He thought it was ridiculous.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.240
His contemporaries thought it was ridiculous.

05:27.240 --> 05:33.600
For the rest of his life, Newton tried to find some kind of answer to this.

05:33.600 --> 05:40.560
But total equipment, I do not make hypotheses, was in the context of explaining that he has

05:40.560 --> 05:45.320
no physical explanation, so he can only give a mathematical model.

05:45.320 --> 05:49.080
Well, there were various reactions to this.

05:49.080 --> 05:53.600
One reaction, connection with the mind-body problem, was John Locke's.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.480
This is not in his major work, but in a letter to Stilling Fleet.

05:58.480 --> 06:06.120
He discussed this, and his conclusion was basically, quote him, that the judicious Mr.

06:06.120 --> 06:17.320
Newton has demonstrated that God attributed to matter properties that we cannot conceive

06:17.320 --> 06:19.480
that are inconceivable to us.

06:19.480 --> 06:26.160
And similar, he said, God may have super-added to matter the property of thought, meaning

06:26.160 --> 06:30.240
some organized form of matter yields thought.

06:30.240 --> 06:36.840
That idea was picked up through the 18th century by just about every major figure who tried

06:36.840 --> 06:44.920
to show how, as some put it, the brain secretes thought the way the liver secretes vile.

06:44.920 --> 06:55.520
This reached its abagy with Pristly, the chemist philosopher, in the late 18th century, developed

06:55.520 --> 06:57.520
these ideas extensively.

06:57.520 --> 07:03.560
In the 19th century, they were pursued, but not intensively, then they were forgotten.

07:03.560 --> 07:10.840
When the revolution took place in the 20th century, all of this was totally forgotten.

07:10.840 --> 07:17.560
In fact, it's still mostly unknown to philosophers and cognitive scientists and others.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.160
It was rediscovered in the 20th century.

07:20.160 --> 07:26.720
The last decade, it was by mid-20th century, essentially rediscovered in the study of language.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.440
That's what generative grammar is.

07:29.440 --> 07:35.920
But in the world of philosophy, cognitive science, it was not rediscovered until the

07:35.920 --> 07:38.160
last decade of the 20th century.

07:38.160 --> 07:44.560
It was called the decade of the brain, a decade devoted to the brain.

07:44.560 --> 07:52.680
At the conclusion of it, the neuroscientists, too, gave the concluding summary of it, Vernon

07:52.680 --> 08:00.320
Mount Gossel, described what he called the thesis of the new biology, that the thought

08:00.320 --> 08:03.000
is simply a property of the brain.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.920
This was considered what Francis Krip called an astonishing hypothesis, a radical new idea

08:08.920 --> 08:12.160
and philosophy of mind, very exciting.

08:12.160 --> 08:17.840
It's repeated in almost the same words, what was commonplace in the 18th century as a result

08:17.840 --> 08:20.040
of block suggestion.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.080
And that's basically where it stands, I think.

08:23.080 --> 08:29.320
There was another consequence of Newton's demolition of the mechanical philosophy.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.080
Science changed its course.

08:31.080 --> 08:38.120
The early modern science, Galileo through Newton, sought to discover an intelligible

08:38.120 --> 08:41.160
world that was given up.

08:41.160 --> 08:47.560
Scientists recognized tacitly, nobody actually said it, that you can't find an intelligible

08:47.560 --> 08:48.560
world.

08:48.560 --> 08:58.800
As John Locke said in his theological framework, God has added to matter properties that are

08:58.800 --> 09:02.400
inconceivable to us, but it's just a fact.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.320
And in fact, science proceeded with that fact, not forgetting the theological framework.

09:08.320 --> 09:12.000
It just sought intelligible theories.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.160
That's very different.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.320
So Newton's theories were intelligible.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.680
Leibniz, Huygens could understand Newton's theories.

09:20.680 --> 09:26.400
It was the world that they described that was unintelligible, and Newton agreed.

09:26.400 --> 09:35.000
But over time, science just lowered its aspirations to developing theories that were intelligible,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.880
however inconceivable of the world that they described.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.560
Just abandoned that hope.

09:41.560 --> 09:49.120
By the time you get to 20th century Bertrand Russell, the science is very well, he simply

09:49.120 --> 09:51.920
said it's ridiculous to seek intelligibility.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.720
Who cares?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.680
We just want theories that work.

09:55.680 --> 10:01.680
That's a big difference from the early modern science, which had much higher aspirations.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.920
This is often not understood.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.520
I should say there's more to it than that.

10:07.520 --> 10:13.840
Newton recognized that the world seemed to have inconceivable properties, and he speculated

10:13.840 --> 10:20.040
that as far as we know, all matter might be alive, all matter, including the coffee

10:20.040 --> 10:21.320
cup in front of it.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.760
We know so little of matter that we can't show that it's not alive.

10:25.760 --> 10:30.200
In the 20th century, this was picked up independently.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.880
Sir Arthur Eddington, great astrophysicist, said we know so little of matter that for

10:35.880 --> 10:41.720
all, we know all matter is conscious, can't show that atoms aren't conscious, because

10:41.720 --> 10:43.640
we just don't know anything about matter.

10:43.640 --> 10:47.480
Bertrand Russell had similar position.

10:47.480 --> 10:54.720
In fact, it's kind of interesting if you look at today's philosophy, what's exciting

10:54.720 --> 11:00.840
topic in philosophy today is what's called the hard problem of consciousness.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.680
The 17th century also had a hard problem.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.080
The hard problem was motion.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.080
How can you account for motion?

11:08.080 --> 11:09.880
Answer, you can't.

11:09.880 --> 11:16.400
But the hard problem of the 17th century was quite different from today's hard problem.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.600
If you look at the hard problem of motion, the problem was formulated.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.800
You could state properties of motion.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.120
Say here are the properties of motion.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.840
How can we find an explanation for them?

11:28.840 --> 11:32.640
That was the hard problem in the 17th century.

11:32.640 --> 11:37.240
And Newton's discovery was there's no explanation in what we consider physical.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.120
It's quite different.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.080
It's not formulated.

11:41.480 --> 11:46.400
The problem is what is it like to see the sunrise in the morning?

11:46.400 --> 11:50.280
Well, nobody can say what it's like to see the sunrise in the morning.

11:50.280 --> 11:55.360
You can write a poem about it, maybe, but you can't say here are the properties of it.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.200
And what does it like to be a bet?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.920
Nobody can say, what does it like to be me?

11:59.920 --> 12:03.960
I could write a book about it, maybe, but I can't say here are the properties.

12:03.960 --> 12:09.480
Well, this is an elementary thing, unless you state what you want an explanation for.

12:09.480 --> 12:15.720
So the hard problem of today's philosophy is formulated in a way which is unanswerable.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.280
So it's not a problem at all.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.880
It's just I'm confused.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.480
It's not a problem.

12:22.480 --> 12:28.080
It's quite different from the 17th, 18th century, when the problem was quite real

12:28.080 --> 12:30.120
and explicit and not answered.

12:30.120 --> 12:36.600
So I think we should be very cautious about paying attention to what's the hot topic

12:36.600 --> 12:38.960
in the philosophical literature.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.520
It's not a formulated problem.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.200
It's just an expression of confusion.

12:44.200 --> 12:50.600
And as far as the radical new idea in philosophy, that's luck.

12:50.600 --> 12:57.040
And I think we should recognize the antecedents, the history, the context,

12:57.040 --> 13:03.240
and what is not conceivable to us, though apparently true.

13:03.240 --> 13:09.520
So, no, there are so many different takes on consciousness at this point.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.720
So many people have different theories of consciousness.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.760
There's panpsychism, there's illusionism, there's idealism,

13:16.760 --> 13:20.400
reductive physicalism, materialism.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.080
Where do you think we stand today?

13:22.080 --> 13:26.000
What do you think is the most prominent thought process behind theories of consciousness?

13:26.000 --> 13:30.800
Would you say it is reductive materialism?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.440
There is no such thing as materialism.

13:33.440 --> 13:40.800
Materialism, if it exists, has to give some account of what matter is.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.760
You can't have a theory of materialism if you don't tell us what matter is.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.520
And nobody knows what matter is.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.320
So there's no materialism.

13:48.320 --> 13:56.720
That's why, as Arthur Eddington, Russell, actually Newton pointed out,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.680
we have no concept of matter.

13:58.680 --> 14:04.240
So if you look at the problem of what's so-called the problem of consciousness,

14:04.240 --> 14:06.480
we know a great deal about consciousness.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.520
In fact, we know more about consciousness than anything else.

14:09.520 --> 14:14.440
It's something that both Russell and most more recently,

14:14.440 --> 14:16.360
Gell and Strossen have emphasized.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.520
I can tell you a ton of things about my current consciousness.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.120
I could describe in detail everything I'm seeing and so on.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.520
What we don't know is what matter is.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.560
Consciousness and matter, because we're ignorant of matter.

14:29.560 --> 14:34.520
That's why Eddington said, for all we know, all matter is conscious,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.320
because we know nothing about matter.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.640
As Newton said, maybe all matter is alive, because we don't know anything about matter.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.720
So these questions are not formulated in a coherent fashion.

14:45.720 --> 14:50.520
As far as panpsychism is concerned, it's basically Eddington's speculation.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.960
But actually Gell and Strossen is one who has argued for it.

14:54.960 --> 15:01.600
Interesting arguments, I'm personally not convinced, but coherent arguments, at least.

15:01.600 --> 15:07.320
But until what we can try to do is what was done by science,

15:07.320 --> 15:12.520
after Newton showed that we cannot find an intelligible universe,

15:12.520 --> 15:16.120
try to find intelligible theories.

15:16.120 --> 15:23.920
So let's construct the best theories we can to account for the properties of consciousness.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.840
That's all we can do.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.040
Can't reduce it to matter, because we don't know what matter is.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.360
Can't say, I don't think you can say anything about panpsychism,

15:32.360 --> 15:36.560
that we cannot show that all matter is not conscious,

15:36.560 --> 15:39.440
but that's because we don't understand anything about matter.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.400
In fact, if you think about it, what is matter?

15:42.400 --> 15:48.840
I mean, there's a great physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study, John Wheeler,

15:48.880 --> 15:56.080
who suggested that maybe all there is in the universe is answers to the questions we pose.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.560
It's a theory called it from bit, all that exists as bits.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.240
We pose a question, get an answer, that's the universe.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.360
There's nothing else.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.320
I mean, I'm not confident to say whether this is a plausible theory or not,

16:10.320 --> 16:15.400
but suppose it is, then that's matter, answers to your questions.

16:15.440 --> 16:21.600
Right now, physicists are in the strange position of not being able to find,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.400
I think it's the universe.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.640
Okay, that's where we are.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.520
You can read articles in quantum theory journals.

16:31.520 --> 16:37.680
Someone sent me one recently, or a group of leading quantum theorists debate,

16:37.680 --> 16:41.120
what is a particle, most fundamental question.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.360
I can't reach any conclusion.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.520
Well, that's where we are with regard to matter.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.720
I'm not sure, Naomi, if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman's work

16:50.720 --> 16:53.480
and his theory of consciousness.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.520
Whose theory?

16:54.520 --> 16:58.400
Donald Hoffman.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.880
It's a description of properties of consciousness.

17:02.880 --> 17:09.720
I don't see a theory in the sense of explanation of anything.

17:09.720 --> 17:14.280
Because he's basically one of those physicists who have concluded that

17:14.280 --> 17:17.280
space and time, in essence, don't really exist.

17:17.280 --> 17:21.160
So what he's trying to do is build a theory where conscious agents

17:21.160 --> 17:25.040
are the fundamental entity of reality, and then he moves on from there.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.720
But where do you think the problem lies with starting from there?

17:28.720 --> 17:31.320
What is explained?

17:31.320 --> 17:34.800
A theory provides explanations.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.520
That's what a theory is.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.560
What is explained?

17:38.560 --> 17:42.040
Yeah, that's a good question.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.760
What about that?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.840
And sorry, did you want to add to that?

17:45.840 --> 17:49.600
I just want to express my own ignorance.

17:49.600 --> 17:56.320
With respect to the conclusions about space and time, I'm not competent to comment.

17:56.320 --> 18:01.240
I know physicists are exercised about this and have no real answers.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.760
I don't.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.560
There seems to be a shift in physics at the moment where a lot of the theories

18:06.560 --> 18:12.560
are starting to expose that space and time, the way we think about space-time,

18:12.560 --> 18:16.640
does not seem to be what even Einstein and physics has shown us.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.240
So Newtonian physics, both Einstein and Newton,

18:19.240 --> 18:22.200
it all seems to be being thrown out the window at this point,

18:22.200 --> 18:26.920
which is making some physicists question the fundamental edge of reality completely.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.760
And because of that, it's opening up the doors to a new form of idealism

18:30.760 --> 18:34.640
where now consciousness is fundamental, and then we move on from there.

18:34.760 --> 18:39.480
What do you think about that approach of the idealistic view of seeing consciousness?

18:39.480 --> 18:46.320
I don't think any of these discussions in physics, which I'm not competent to have a judgment about,

18:46.320 --> 18:49.760
I don't think any of them bear unconsciousness in the least.

18:49.760 --> 18:56.960
They don't tell us about the fact that I see a red spot, what I feel like when I see the red spot.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.520
I don't see anything about that.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.440
That's consciousness.

19:01.520 --> 19:06.640
Furthermore, I don't really understand the preoccupation with consciousness.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.360
It's a pretty new preoccupation.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.520
It's not true in the history of philosophy.

19:11.520 --> 19:17.320
One of the probably the major scholarly study of this is by Uru Thiel,

19:17.320 --> 19:23.800
who points out that consciousness became an issue in philosophy

19:23.800 --> 19:32.960
pretty much with the Neoplatonist 17th century Cartesian's Ralph Cudworth.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.160
He says it was the first to discuss consciousness seriously.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.720
But they were talking about self-consciousness, awareness of ourselves.

19:41.720 --> 19:47.240
And that was the topic of consciousness right up to the 20th century.

19:47.240 --> 19:55.560
20th century, for some reason, there was a sudden great concern with consciousness in recent years.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.360
It's been, as I said, the problem, the hard problem.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.400
Only trouble is it's not formulated, so it's not a problem.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.800
But why consciousness?

20:03.800 --> 20:10.040
I mean, it turns out, to the extent that we understand anything, limited, take language,

20:10.040 --> 20:15.360
almost everything that's going on in our minds when you and I are conversing

20:15.440 --> 20:18.680
is completely beyond the reach of consciousness.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.840
There are mental processes taking place.

20:20.840 --> 20:26.120
We have a fair grasp about what many of them are, but we have no more awareness of them

20:26.120 --> 20:29.800
than we have of what's going on in our second nervous system.

20:29.800 --> 20:34.680
We have another huge nervous system called the enteric nervous system.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.560
Sometimes called the gut brain.

20:36.560 --> 20:42.200
It's a huge nervous system, controls everything that's going on in the body.

20:42.200 --> 20:51.320
Mid-billions of neurons can have all the properties of simers, Parkinson's, and a huge nervous system.

20:51.320 --> 20:51.960
We know nothing.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.880
We know a lot about it, but from the outside, the way we study the planetary motion,

20:57.880 --> 20:59.800
you have no introspection into it.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.000
And the same is true of this nervous system.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.880
We have almost no introspective evidence about it.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.920
Very superficial phenomenon.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.040
But we can learn a lot about it the way you learn other things in science.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.280
And the mental acts that are taking place beyond the level of consciousness

21:18.280 --> 21:23.720
interact indissolubly from the few fragments that we're conscious of.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.400
So you're not going to fonts that happen to be conscious.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.320
You want a real theory of what's going on.

21:29.320 --> 21:37.080
You're going to have to integrate whatever we know about or can discover about the internal unconscious,

21:37.080 --> 21:40.680
not in a Freudian sense, inaccessible to consciousness,

21:42.680 --> 21:48.360
operations that are more important than the fragments that reach consciousness.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.800
I think it's more important.

21:49.800 --> 21:56.440
So it seems to me the emphasis is misplaced, plus the fact that the problem is not formulated

21:56.440 --> 22:00.200
till the problem is formulated, you're not going to have an answer to it.

22:00.200 --> 22:05.320
So I think philosophy is going off into a very dubious directions.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.480
I should say that Galen Strauss and one of the best young philosophers

22:09.480 --> 22:12.280
has put this a little more strongly than I have.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.920
He more strongly than I would, in fact.

22:14.920 --> 22:21.560
What he said is that 20th century philosophy is the silliest period in the history of philosophy.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.400
That's too strong, I think.

22:23.400 --> 22:29.880
But I do think there are real questions about including the unwillingness

22:29.880 --> 22:34.600
to understand the history of the topic, which is revealing I think.

22:34.680 --> 22:40.200
It's worth understanding how these problems developed kind of thing we were talking about.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.080
Sheds a lot of light on what we should be doing, I think.

22:43.080 --> 22:49.800
But the crucial issue is that the hard problem in the 20th century is not formulated

22:49.800 --> 22:55.160
as distinct from the hard problem in the 17th century, which was formulated

22:55.160 --> 22:57.640
and led to very interesting results.

22:57.640 --> 23:03.000
So until today's hard problem is formulated, it will just be wandering in the wilderness.

23:03.400 --> 23:09.800
Hmm. Do you think we have focused so much energy into this hard problem of consciousness?

23:09.800 --> 23:16.200
Because science has exposed so much about reality in terms of spirituality.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.200
God Copernicus taking us out of the center of the universe.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.480
You've got Darwin taking us off the top of the food chain.

23:23.480 --> 23:29.560
And now we have this last that allows us to at least maintain some sort of spirituality

23:29.560 --> 23:31.800
and maybe meaning value purpose.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.520
Do you think that's why we're so obsessed with this topic right now?

23:36.360 --> 23:39.720
This frankly just seems to me empty talk.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.520
Yes, we have consciousness.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.240
I have a dog at my feet.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.560
She have consciousness, I assume.

23:47.560 --> 23:55.160
So can't prove it or disprove it as the microphone in front of me have consciousness.

23:55.720 --> 24:00.920
Well, as Arthur Eddington pointed out, we know so little about matter

24:00.920 --> 24:05.400
that we can't say that it doesn't have consciousness because we don't know anything about matter.

24:05.400 --> 24:09.720
So there's nothing to do with idealism, nothing to do with spirituality,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.200
nothing to do with our place in the universe.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.000
These are just things that we're confused about.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
And my own view is a much more interesting question is what's inaccessible to consciousness?

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
I don't try to convince other people of what's interesting.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.960
I'm just saying to me that looks much more interesting.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.400
We can learn a lot about it.

24:29.400 --> 24:37.400
We can discover how it is closely integrated with the tiny fragments that reach consciousness.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.960
Our brain is doing all kinds of things.

24:39.960 --> 24:44.760
Occasionally it's throwing off little bits and pieces that we're conscious of.

24:44.760 --> 24:50.280
Well, those fragments are some interest, but I don't think they're the main interest

24:50.280 --> 24:53.240
in finding out what our mental processes are.

24:53.240 --> 24:57.240
As far as the distinctiveness of human beings, we don't have to worry about

24:58.200 --> 25:00.360
the kinds of questions you raise.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.520
First of all, we don't have to worry about a role.

25:02.520 --> 25:07.080
But there are distinctive properties of humans, totally distinct.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.040
And that's interesting.

25:08.680 --> 25:13.000
One distinctive property of humans is what you and I are now doing.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.800
There's no other organisms that can have discussions about these or any other questions.

25:17.800 --> 25:24.440
That means language and thought in any sense we understand thought appear to be unique human

25:24.440 --> 25:25.720
characteristics.

25:25.720 --> 25:30.600
There's no analog to them anywhere in the world, maybe universe.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.000
And they seem to be common to all humans.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.560
So it looks like a species property.

25:36.120 --> 25:40.200
We don't know of any differences among humans in these capacities.

25:40.200 --> 25:48.040
So we can speak and grow up in any community and pick up easily the language and its thought system.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.760
So it seems to be just common human.

25:50.760 --> 25:57.960
It's a pretty good reason to suspect that these capacities emerged along with modern humans.

25:57.960 --> 26:02.600
So if you look at the archaeological record, skimpy, but there's something,

26:02.600 --> 26:08.520
there's no evidence for any meaningful symbolic activity before humans appear.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.920
You may get a scratch on a bone or something.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.840
But there's essentially nothing before humans appear.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.600
Not long after humans appear in evolutionary time,

26:18.600 --> 26:23.240
you start getting very rich and complex symbolic activity.

26:23.240 --> 26:28.760
All of which suggests that along with modern humans came these capacities.

26:28.760 --> 26:34.840
Language, thought, which are probably the same thing as was assumed incidentally by

26:34.840 --> 26:38.600
Aristotle, classical Indian philosophy and so on.

26:38.600 --> 26:44.200
Didn't really distinguish language and thought that runs through pretty much until the modern period.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.600
But I think it's a plausible assumption.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.200
I think we're coming back to it.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.800
The language is just the system for generating thought.

26:53.800 --> 26:58.200
Thought is what's generated by language, internal thought, internal language,

26:58.200 --> 27:01.400
not the noises that we speak, which is superficial.

27:02.600 --> 27:07.640
If that's anywhere near true, then the interesting questions are what are the

27:07.640 --> 27:11.160
properties of this internal thought language system?

27:11.240 --> 27:16.120
I think that's much more interesting than the fragments that reach consciousness,

27:16.120 --> 27:19.640
which are fragments, so we're probably not going to learn much about them.

27:20.840 --> 27:26.280
I mean, a good example, an illustration of this is what's called inner speech.

27:27.480 --> 27:33.000
When you think to yourself in language, if you pay attention to it, it's not language.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.920
It's the sounds.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.640
So when you think about a sentence, you can ask, how long is it?

27:40.280 --> 27:41.960
Does it rhyme with another one?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.240
That's not language.

27:43.240 --> 27:48.200
That's the externalization of language in one or another sensory motor medium.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.320
And the sensory motor systems have nothing to do with language.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.200
They were there millions of years before language emerged.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.640
They've never changed.

27:55.640 --> 28:00.600
So they're non-linguistic systems that we use to externalize what's

28:00.600 --> 28:03.720
like you could use gesture sign just the same.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.080
It doesn't even have to do sound.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.960
So we don't want to be misled by that.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.920
What we call inner speech is not inner.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.800
It's outer.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.640
What's inner, we have no access to.

28:15.880 --> 28:19.640
Do you think the fact that we speak English, for example?

28:19.640 --> 28:23.400
I mean, as someone who's obviously a master of linguistics, and I mean,

28:23.400 --> 28:26.280
you're pretty much known as the father of cognitive science,

28:26.280 --> 28:30.200
do you think that our limitations in terms of the language we use most often,

28:30.200 --> 28:33.160
which is English, well, for the most part in this case,

28:33.720 --> 28:37.560
limits our ability to discuss certain philosophical questions,

28:37.560 --> 28:38.760
like this mind-body problem?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.080
Do you think if we had a different language that portrayed more meaning,

28:41.080 --> 28:44.680
perhaps ancient Chinese Sanskrit, that we'd be better off today?

28:46.360 --> 28:49.080
There is a hypothesis.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.400
It's called the superior wharf hypothesis.

28:51.960 --> 28:55.160
Edward Superior, Benjamin Lee Wharf, about a century ago,

28:55.960 --> 29:03.000
arguing that the way we think is shaped in some significant way by the language that we speak.

29:03.960 --> 29:10.200
This hypothesis has been investigated empirically for about 75 years,

29:11.400 --> 29:15.480
almost nothing, and a few superficial things.

29:15.480 --> 29:20.200
So, for example, the first person to study it, Eric Leneberg,

29:20.200 --> 29:23.720
who went on to found the biology of language, great scientist.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.000
He studied it.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.840
He was a friend of mine at graduate school.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.680
He studied this back in the early 50s, and he found a few things.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.600
So he found that there are some languages that have,

29:36.600 --> 29:41.080
languages differ in where they put the boundaries of the color words.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.080
Like some languages don't have color words, just black and white.

29:45.080 --> 29:49.000
Other languages like us have distinguished, say, red and orange.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.800
Other languages don't distinguish red and orange.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.800
Hopi, for example.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.840
And you get some effects of that, but they're meaningless.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.760
So if you take a language which doesn't distinguish red and orange,

30:01.320 --> 30:04.280
and you ask people, you give them a patch of color,

30:04.280 --> 30:06.040
and then you show that patch of color.

30:06.040 --> 30:10.040
Again, if it's on the red-orange border, if you speak English,

30:10.040 --> 30:11.800
you'll remember that I called it red.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.080
So you say it's red.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.240
If you have a language read, you don't have a label for that.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.280
You won't remember.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.320
So you won't call it.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.920
You won't remember what it was.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.520
I mean, very superficial things like that have been discovered,

30:22.520 --> 30:24.360
but nothing of any significance.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.840
It's still widely debated, but I think the pickings are very thin.

30:28.840 --> 30:34.600
So it looks as if every language has ways of talking about everything.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.840
Of course, you may not have the words.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.960
Like 100 years ago, you didn't have the word computer.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.200
So you couldn't talk about them.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.040
You could, but not in our sense.

30:45.800 --> 30:50.360
You didn't have the word elementary.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.320
Talk about quarks.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.840
But that's any language.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.360
You can pick them up the same way.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.000
You mentioned these unconscious processes.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.680
And I mean, the more intriguing question is,

31:04.680 --> 31:08.680
how do those unconscious processes sort of come into these conscious ones?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.800
What do you then think about people like Daniel Dennett,

31:11.800 --> 31:16.600
Keith Frankish, who sort of used the argument that because most of what we

31:16.600 --> 31:20.520
experience happens unconsciously, we merely, via introspection,

31:20.520 --> 31:24.040
tend to make a conclusion that we have some sort of ethereal entity.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.600
So in essence, there is no such thing as qualia.

31:26.600 --> 31:31.000
Rather, there is a memory of an experience that felt qualitative.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.640
But in essence, everything is in fact quantitative.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.600
What do you think about that?

31:34.600 --> 31:39.080
We draw that conclusion about the enteric nervous system, the gut brain.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.200
It's all unconscious.

31:40.920 --> 31:46.280
Do we assume there's some ethereal spiritual thing going on in our gut?

31:46.920 --> 31:48.440
Not as far as I know.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.600
So why should we do it for this brain?

31:50.600 --> 31:51.640
Why do we have to be?

31:52.600 --> 31:57.000
It's interesting that traditional dualism, Cartesian dualism,

31:57.000 --> 32:01.560
metaphysical dualism, was a real, serious scientific theory.

32:01.560 --> 32:07.320
Descartes had serious scientific arguments for postulating two substances.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.960
Metaphysical dualism was shown to be incorrect,

32:11.960 --> 32:15.080
but lots of scientific theories are shown science.

32:15.640 --> 32:20.840
It's been replaced by something else, what I sometimes called methodological dualism.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.480
A methodological dual, nobody will say I'm a methodological dualist,

32:25.480 --> 32:29.240
but a lot of people act that way, including the ones you're describing.

32:29.240 --> 32:35.000
They say, when we discuss something sort of below the neck, metaphorically speaking,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.600
we're allowed to be rational.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.680
When we discuss things up here, we have to become totally irrational.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.840
That's methodological dualism.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.840
As I say, nobody says, professes it, but you just said,

32:47.480 --> 32:53.800
why should we treat the unconscious processes here differently than the unconscious processes

32:53.800 --> 32:54.840
down here?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.360
I don't see any reason.

32:56.360 --> 33:03.000
I think Locke-John Locke was basically correct for getting the theological framework.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.880
However, the world works.

33:06.520 --> 33:11.960
There are facts about motion that are inconceivable to us,

33:11.960 --> 33:15.640
and there are facts about thought that are inconceivable to us,

33:15.640 --> 33:19.000
but they're there, and we can study them and learn about them

33:19.000 --> 33:26.600
and assume that whatever thought is some property of organized forms of matter,

33:26.600 --> 33:28.760
where matter is just whatever there is.

33:28.760 --> 33:33.720
When Locke used the word matter or body, he didn't mean anything specific.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.240
He said, whatever the world is constituted of, we don't know.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.760
Newton showed that we don't know.

33:39.320 --> 33:44.200
I think that's a sense of latitude, and I don't think we've progressed beyond it.

33:46.600 --> 33:50.760
No, when you think about, I mentioned earlier that a lot of people

33:50.760 --> 33:53.320
are pretty much obsessed with this mind-body problem because

33:54.040 --> 33:58.040
it's a replacement for sort of agnosticism and atheism today.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.320
What advice do you give these people growing up today in a world

34:01.320 --> 34:05.880
where science has proven so much and taken away so much in terms of their spirituality

34:05.880 --> 34:08.520
and their purpose in life?

34:09.720 --> 34:13.880
What can you tell them in order to keep going, keep moving forward and keep focusing?

34:14.840 --> 34:19.240
Just as some sort of inspirational advice from your side.

34:20.840 --> 34:28.520
I can't speak for others, but I find inspiration enough in what Galileo, for example,

34:29.160 --> 34:33.320
regarded as one of the most awesome features of the universe.

34:34.120 --> 34:39.400
For Galileo and his contemporaries, one of the most amazing things in the universe

34:39.480 --> 34:42.040
awe-inspiring was what you and I are now doing.

34:42.600 --> 34:49.400
How can humans be capable of constructing from a finite number of symbols,

34:49.400 --> 34:57.240
constructing an infinite number of thoughts, and even using these thoughts to convey to others

34:57.800 --> 35:02.360
who have no access to our minds, the innermost workings of our minds.

35:02.360 --> 35:09.080
So you have no access to my mind, but I can convey to you with a finite number of symbols

35:09.480 --> 35:11.800
the innermost workings of my mind.

35:12.360 --> 35:17.560
Galileo thought this is the most amazing phenomenon in the universe.

35:18.360 --> 35:24.200
Galileo himself regarded the alphabet as the most spectacular of human inventions

35:24.200 --> 35:29.560
because it was able to implement this comparable to Michelangelo or Titian.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.200
Well, to me, that seems inspiring enough.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.480
I've sometimes called it the Galilean challenge.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.320
How is this conceivable?

35:37.320 --> 35:42.360
It's Cartier-Cartes problem, which led him to postulate a second substance.

35:42.360 --> 35:50.040
Well, as Newton showed, we're left with only one substance, mind, the other one, disappeared body.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.800
But I don't see why we need...

35:55.320 --> 36:02.280
I find it inspiring enough that physicists cannot discover 95%.

36:03.160 --> 36:06.520
I think that's the number of what constitutes the universe.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.960
It seems to me exciting enough.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.600
The more we discover, the more we realize how much we don't know.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.840
For example, I mean, the Liberty experiments, a lot of the experiments on free will.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.480
A lot of people believe now that we have no free will.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.040
What are your thoughts on the relationship between mind and free will?

36:23.320 --> 36:24.680
That's an interesting question.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.800
Every one of us acts as though we believe in freedom of will.

36:32.280 --> 36:36.120
100% of us, including those who deny that there is free will.

36:36.760 --> 36:41.800
They all act as if they believe in free will.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.240
Point number one.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.360
Point number two.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.760
The science tells us anything about it.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.360
Answer, no.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.800
Science tells us.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.760
Can't determine it.
