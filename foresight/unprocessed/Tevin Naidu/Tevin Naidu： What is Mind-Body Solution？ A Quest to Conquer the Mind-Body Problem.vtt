WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
So it's a weird world we live in. It's a strange universe.

00:02.720 --> 00:08.400
I call ourselves a conscious conglomerate of cells assembled by atoms, manufactured by molecules

00:08.400 --> 00:12.640
designed by DNA, forged by fusion via stellar supernovae.

00:12.640 --> 00:17.760
I mean, this is a crazy story, but every night you have to go to a tribal council to sacrifice

00:17.760 --> 00:23.920
and legitimately think about who you would kill, who you would you be willing to actively kill

00:23.920 --> 00:28.720
a tribal council. It's like basically sitting in heaven looking at all the people you killed

00:28.720 --> 00:33.360
and then asking them for forgiveness and then to still give you a million dollars or a million

00:33.360 --> 00:37.680
rent. It did spark a memory for me, though. I've only actually shared this with two other people

00:37.680 --> 00:42.000
in my life, so this is opening up a bit. If you think that there's somebody else or something

00:42.000 --> 00:47.600
else controlling it, it is very eye-opening. I remember feeling so free. That day when I

00:47.600 --> 00:51.920
left the temple, I remember just thinking, this is the most free of ever felt amount,

00:51.920 --> 00:57.760
just pure ecstasy of freedom. Any decision I make from here on out is my own decision.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.800
And I will bear the responsibility, whether it's praise or blame,

01:02.800 --> 01:08.720
I take it. It's ultimately my fault. There's no one to blame for this. There's no one to praise for

01:08.720 --> 01:15.600
this except, and I think it's quite a freeing and yet terrifying. Possibly, I can't call it a

01:15.600 --> 01:20.320
quarter-life crisis or whatever, but it's a very young life crisis. Dr. Tevin Naidu is a medical

01:20.320 --> 01:25.200
doctor, philosopher and ethicist, born in South Africa of Indian descent. He attained his bachelor

01:25.200 --> 01:29.520
of medicine and bachelor of surgery degree from Stellenbosch University and his master of philosophy

01:29.520 --> 01:35.120
degree cum laude from the University of Pretoria. His academic work focuses on theories of consciousness,

01:35.120 --> 01:40.400
computational psychiatry, phenomenological, psychopathology, value space, practice, moral

01:40.400 --> 01:45.600
luck, addiction, and the philosophy and ethics of science, mind, and mental health. He has a

01:45.600 --> 01:50.480
television background as the host of two popular South African shows as a castaway on Survivor

01:50.480 --> 01:55.040
South Africa. He is currently the host of the Mind, Body, Solution podcast. Tevin, thank you so much

01:55.040 --> 01:59.280
for coming on. Thank you so much for having me. It's an absolute honor to be here. Thanks for that

01:59.280 --> 02:04.480
wonderful introduction. I mean, you did it yourself, my friend. That's your background.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.240
We got it together quite well. They make me sound better than I think I.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.600
I've done a lot of research. I'm a big fan of your channel. Yeah, I mean, I've loved it. I

02:13.600 --> 02:18.480
discovered it a little over a month ago, I think, and I've, I mean, over half of your episodes I've

02:18.480 --> 02:24.400
listened to and I plan to just absorb the whole library soon. I'd love to start off kind of early

02:24.400 --> 02:30.240
because one of the one of the really core pieces of content was actually someone else's interview

02:30.240 --> 02:37.920
of you, Dr. Tony Nader's interview with you, which I loved. And one piece that really piqued my interest

02:38.800 --> 02:45.200
was when you're talking about how early you started questioning things, asking the big questions,

02:45.200 --> 02:51.280
metaphysics, etc. And you said this around the age of nine or so, I believe you said. And I love

02:51.280 --> 02:56.000
if you could just give us some context around that and what that was like. Yeah, no, I mean, it's,

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
it's, it's such a strange world. I think it's, I mean, I was just discussing this with my girlfriend

03:02.000 --> 03:08.160
and one of my friends today. The universe is such an intriguing place. There's so much going on.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.440
I mean, someone always comes to mind is Charles Darwin. I think about the years he spent on the

03:13.440 --> 03:20.240
Galapagos Islands just traveling and inflicting views with his own theory and his religious beliefs

03:20.240 --> 03:23.840
and how he spent so many years trying to convince himself, not others, but himself,

03:24.720 --> 03:32.240
that what he believed religiously just did not correspond to the data. And for me, when I was

03:32.240 --> 03:37.200
a kid growing up in South Africa, it's very, very multicultural, very diverse. We've got 11 official

03:37.200 --> 03:42.160
languages. There are so many different cultures and backgrounds. And I mean, people often say

03:42.160 --> 03:46.720
Cape Town, when you're in Cape Town, you feel like you're in the rest of the world is, is just

03:46.720 --> 03:53.440
so many different people all coming together. And me personally, part of my family, very much

03:53.440 --> 03:59.040
Muslim, traditional Indians, the other half in the traditional Indians, then you've also got

03:59.040 --> 04:04.720
Christian, traditional Indians, but still South African at heart. So I consider myself more South

04:04.720 --> 04:10.720
African than I do in India, because we've been here for around seven, eight generations. Oh,

04:10.720 --> 04:16.800
wow. Westport is endangered laborers by Brits. And then at some point, obviously,

04:16.800 --> 04:23.520
off post-apartheid sort of built their way up and made their way into society. But so the cultural

04:23.520 --> 04:28.240
dynamic is very intriguing at that point, because I have my Muslim best friends and cousins on the

04:28.240 --> 04:33.040
one side of my Christians, best friends and cousins on the one side of my Tamil, Hindu, everybody is

04:33.040 --> 04:38.800
all just integrating so well. And none of the ideas corresponded. And I found that very frustrating.

04:39.120 --> 04:44.800
I felt that when I went to school, when I read books, when I went to science, for example, class,

04:46.160 --> 04:50.240
was always some sort of a consistency with the story. And if something did change, which it often

04:50.240 --> 04:57.200
does, science consistently replaces older science with new data sciences. These stories sort of

04:57.200 --> 05:02.480
set in stone. And I didn't like that. I didn't like the fact that whatever the person said was

05:02.480 --> 05:07.200
the gospel of the truth. I felt that, I mean, channels call the truth. I felt like if I had to

05:07.200 --> 05:12.960
look for radicality and truth, this is probably not where I'm going to look, because I had this

05:12.960 --> 05:19.360
bad tendency of asking questions and I would often get kicked out of temple while I get kicked out of

05:19.360 --> 05:26.480
the mosque. So when that happens, you start to question, I mean, is this really the story you

05:26.480 --> 05:31.280
want to be told? Are you being told the story or taught the story? What's the difference? And

05:32.080 --> 05:40.400
at that point, I stopped. I became completely atheist. I was nine. I remember I left the

05:40.400 --> 05:44.160
temple. I remember being so frustrated at that point, I actually became quite anti-theist. I

05:44.160 --> 05:49.440
became very much anti-religion. I remember being so irritated by this whole story,

05:49.440 --> 05:54.640
like that people are so convinced by these ideas. And as the time went by, I became a lot more

05:55.600 --> 06:01.760
conservative with that view. I'm no longer anti-religion, anti-theist. I think everyone's

06:01.760 --> 06:06.880
entitled to their own views. I respect them all. I think that at the time it was more my own

06:08.480 --> 06:14.000
hatred towards the person who spoke to down to me at the time that caused this almost

06:14.880 --> 06:22.240
neo-Atheistic view. You know, the sort of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens,

06:22.320 --> 06:27.760
type of Sam Harris annual dinner type of hatred. And that's slowly changed. I mean, I have huge

06:27.760 --> 06:35.840
respect for Christian scholars, theologians, and even gurus, priests alike. I mean, to me,

06:35.840 --> 06:40.800
it's changed over time. It's an interesting dynamic. It started when I was nine, which was very

06:40.800 --> 06:46.000
young because many of my friends thought I was crazy. Of course. Yeah, that's so young to be

06:46.000 --> 06:51.760
questioning. You must have been a curious kid. Do you remember, was it a gradual thing?

06:52.240 --> 06:58.720
Was there a moment in time where something snapped? I think it was always brewing. I think my dad

06:59.920 --> 07:05.040
always told me to watch Discovery Channel, National Geographic. I mean, he forced me to

07:05.040 --> 07:10.240
sort of watch this when I'm watching Cartoon Network. He changed the channel. That's good.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.280
In hindsight, I mean, at the time, I obviously didn't like it. But when I look back, I think,

07:15.280 --> 07:20.000
I mean, those are the stepping stones. Sort of those curiosity builders that started asking

07:20.000 --> 07:24.480
the deeper questions within because often growing up, I wanted to be an astrophysicist and

07:25.280 --> 07:30.960
I've always wanted to be an astrophysicist. I remember just getting 100% for mathematics

07:30.960 --> 07:35.280
every year, all the time, just thinking it's going to happen. And then as you get older,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.040
you make the more conservative choice. And at the time for me, it was to look after my family,

07:39.040 --> 07:48.720
my peers, and Indian cultures. I mean, becoming a doctor is sort of pretty much an expectation.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.680
And I think I sort of fell into the trap. But very great. I enjoy it. I love it very much.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.560
I went for the conservative choice, but astrophysics in space, just trying to understand

07:58.560 --> 08:04.640
the nature of this universe. It's an incredibly complex system. How does it all function? What

08:04.640 --> 08:08.800
is the purpose of all of this? What is the meaning behind all of this? I think it intrigues a lot

08:08.800 --> 08:13.760
of people. And I think religion does provide people with those, it provides us with those answers.

08:13.760 --> 08:19.120
But for me, it wasn't enough. I wanted to find out for myself. And that's what sort of stirred me

08:19.120 --> 08:24.560
towards that. My parents were never that religious anyway. They were very cultural. We often celebrated

08:24.560 --> 08:31.840
Diwali or the Hindu festivals. We went to prayers. I still go to many of them. But yeah,

08:31.840 --> 08:38.000
they never really ingrained the religious doctrine within. So they often allowed me to do whatever

08:38.000 --> 08:44.480
I wanted. When I was nine, I told them I'm done. They were fine. It was like wow. That was just like

08:47.040 --> 08:54.400
my goodness. That's so cool. Well, it did spark a memory for me though. If I may, I know I'm

08:54.400 --> 08:59.600
interviewing you, but if I may share something, I've only actually shared this with two other

08:59.600 --> 09:05.440
people in my life. So this is opening up a bit. It's not like crazy big, but I remember because

09:05.440 --> 09:09.360
you said around nine and I was around eight or nine years old. I remember I was definitely in

09:09.360 --> 09:14.560
the third grade. So whenever that's around them. And I remember the moment when

09:17.200 --> 09:22.400
I was in my childhood bedroom, a lit bedroom, I was looking through the doorway into the hallway

09:22.400 --> 09:30.720
that was dark. And all of a sudden it was like something changed. It's like the top down control

09:30.720 --> 09:37.040
became apparent. If that makes any sense. I didn't know the word agency at the time, but

09:38.000 --> 09:46.800
it was like oh, I have control over this. It wasn't solely the ether of my childhood, let's say.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.080
But it was like a moment. And from then on, I remember going to school the next day and being

09:52.080 --> 09:59.520
like oh my goodness. Everything just clicked at a critical time. It gives you that power,

09:59.600 --> 10:03.600
that sort of autonomy you've been looking for. Waiting for the autonomy. I mean,

10:03.600 --> 10:08.320
everybody just craves it. Everybody wants it, but he really gets it. If you think that there's

10:08.320 --> 10:13.280
somebody else or something else controlling it, it is very eye-opening. I remember feeling so free.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.960
That day when I left the temple, I remember just thinking this is the most free I've ever felt

10:18.960 --> 10:27.200
about. Just pure ecstasy of freedom. Any decision I make from here on out is my own decision.

10:27.680 --> 10:34.640
And I will bear the responsibility, whether it's praise or blame, I take it. It's ultimately

10:34.640 --> 10:39.360
my fault. There's no one to blame for this. There's no one to praise for this. Except me.

10:40.240 --> 10:45.440
And I think it's quite a freeing and yet terrifying. Possibly, I can't call it a

10:45.440 --> 10:48.800
quarter-life crisis or whatever, but it's a very young life crisis.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.040
A one-tenth life, a one-twentieth life crisis. Hope you live to go into it a long time.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.280
Huh, that's so interesting. So then from there, the progression,

10:59.200 --> 11:04.160
you said astrophysics was a big passion of yours. You got through high school,

11:04.160 --> 11:08.080
you obviously, I'm assuming you were a great student, you know, never causing any trouble in

11:08.080 --> 11:13.280
the classroom. It's on top, and then I had archaeology as one of the others. Oh, interesting.

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
Qing is one of the others. What was the other one? Teaching, just general teaching. Most likely

11:18.880 --> 11:25.360
mathematics or physics. Oh, wow. Very cool. I mean, archaeology, I mean, I loved it so much.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.760
I speak very highly. I mean, Darwin's one of my favorite scientists of all time.

11:31.200 --> 11:36.080
Just going back, I mean, Stephen Jay Gould, when I think about the work they did back in the day,

11:36.080 --> 11:40.640
I mean, it's some of the best things I've seen. Absolutely. It's incredible.

11:40.640 --> 11:45.440
Cool. So that's a good point. I was very much in the sciences, very, very science-oriented.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.000
And then as you get older, you start becoming more philosophical. You're scientific.

11:50.720 --> 11:55.600
Start to question those as well. So at nine-year-old, then she had to change when he turned 19,

11:56.240 --> 12:02.720
now 29. I'm currently 29, but over time, things have changed every sort of decade or so.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.360
Sure. And what made, like, when did you decide you wanted to become a doctor?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.720
It was always one of the choices. It was something I've always loved. But the main reason,

12:12.720 --> 12:18.880
a lot of people find this completely absurd and ridiculous is I was watching House and I love House.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.360
Yeah, great show. I remember I watched it as a kid, too. Yeah, sure.

12:22.240 --> 12:26.640
Probably my favorite series of all time, because I've watched it so many times.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.960
There's eight seasons. I've watched all of them back to front, possibly like around eight times.

12:33.760 --> 12:34.960
And I know it's a lot of...

12:35.920 --> 12:37.200
Holy shit.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.960
It was before mid-school days.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.600
Yeah, yeah, a lot of time. A lot more time back then.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.480
I sort of made the excuse in mid-school that this is me studying.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.040
As if.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.680
Always, whenever someone asks, it's always Lupus. It's always the first.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.480
Lupus or Sacoidosis, the other one.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.400
Oh, Sacoidosis. I forgot that. Yeah, okay.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.200
Those are the... So I was watching House. I remember my mom running down the stairs when I was at home.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.640
And I was like, you got in for mid-school. And at the time I'm watching House,

13:10.480 --> 13:14.320
I look at the TV and I look at her and I just think, and I just say, let's go. Let's just do it.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.360
It was one of those... There's both the moment thoughts where I just didn't even think about astrophysics.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.840
I didn't think about anything else. I just... Let's just do it.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.440
And when I got to mid-school, I realized it's nothing like House.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.600
Very different. Yes.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.200
And how would you describe your experience in mid-school?

13:34.080 --> 13:41.600
Super difficult. School was very well. I got to mid-school. And I think this is where cultural

13:41.600 --> 13:47.440
dynamics in South Africa play a big role because when from a school where school had a majority,

13:47.440 --> 13:53.200
800 black students, in South Africa, we refer to mixed-race people as colored. And this is

13:53.200 --> 13:57.760
not politically incorrect within this country. So we refer to mixed-race people as colored.

13:57.760 --> 14:03.520
So there were about 800 blacks, 200 colors, about 200 Indian people, no white people at all.

14:03.520 --> 14:08.880
And then I went from that school to Stellenbosch University, which is a majority Afrikaans white

14:08.880 --> 14:15.440
university. It was a complete cultural shock for something I never anticipated. I mean,

14:15.440 --> 14:20.080
I did Afrikaans as a language in high school and primary school, but always sort of learned it

14:20.080 --> 14:23.280
with a pitch of salt, like thinking I'd never use this. It's not going to be something I'm going

14:23.280 --> 14:28.720
to be using. And I get to Stellenbosch where it kept on 75% of the population speak Afrikaans

14:28.720 --> 14:33.600
and I was completely shocked. I couldn't believe it. And this is the first language. So it was very

14:33.600 --> 14:39.840
surprising. I immediately felt homesick. Just when into sort of a depression, I would say very

14:39.840 --> 14:46.240
dark. I would go to lectures to fall asleep and go home and self-study because I just couldn't,

14:46.240 --> 14:49.520
they were speaking Afrikaans. I couldn't understand what they were saying. What they were

14:49.520 --> 14:54.320
saying, I couldn't understand the lecture. So I just, it was very, very difficult. But over time,

14:54.320 --> 14:58.880
you get used to it. It's not that bad. You start to fall in love with it slowly. Trauma starts to

14:58.880 --> 15:04.800
become like a, it's almost like a toxic relationship. You hate it, but you love it. You keep going back.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.640
So I kept going back. He's got better. I slowly fell in love with it.

15:09.520 --> 15:15.840
Cool. But it was difficult, I'm sure. And then you, I mean, you can imagine yourself being in a

15:15.840 --> 15:21.200
war-drowned and guys just talking to you in a different language, sort of talking down to you

15:21.200 --> 15:26.720
as well, because he sort of assumes I don't understand the language. And then you don't

15:26.720 --> 15:33.280
realize he's asking you the question he's asking. And this is you in a war-drowned,

15:33.280 --> 15:37.920
academic war-drowned for Marx. You're getting graded on this. And then you put a mark because

15:37.920 --> 15:43.440
you just don't really know. It was very, very frustrating. I sort of built up a little bit

15:43.440 --> 15:50.000
of anger within me. I remember not wanting to learn Afrikaans just to spite them. But I learned

15:50.000 --> 15:55.040
it eventually anyway. Yeah, you had to. You had to. I had to pass. I had to figure this

15:55.040 --> 16:03.760
word thing out. But Africa is so politically complex. You can imagine, I mean, 11 official

16:03.760 --> 16:07.920
languages. Afrikaans is one of them. English is one of them. That means there's, I and other

16:08.000 --> 16:13.040
official languages left. I used to speak Zulu quite a lot back when I was a kid.

16:14.560 --> 16:20.800
And then in Cape Town we have what's known as Isikosa. So there's so many different languages.

16:22.880 --> 16:28.400
Difficult to learn them all. Sure, yeah. You have to just cover what you can and move forward

16:28.400 --> 16:35.280
from there. So you could with some of them. Yeah, right. Yeah, gesture and get by that way.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.160
You get sort of the vernacular, you get the gist of it. And you can get through a conversation.

16:40.160 --> 16:48.400
Sure, sure. So you're in med school. And how did you get into this television media space?

16:48.400 --> 16:53.440
Like what was, what was that path? This is my first time actually, just by the way,

16:53.440 --> 16:57.040
because it's just doing an interview where I'm integrating all these lives together.

16:57.040 --> 17:02.400
Because I've either done specifically television stuff, and then I've either done academic medical

17:02.400 --> 17:06.240
or mind body solution content. It's kind of intriguing to have this discussion. It's my

17:06.240 --> 17:13.440
first time. So for me, it was, I was in high school, I remember. I think I was about six foot

17:13.440 --> 17:20.960
one at a time, height. And I met this model agent who told me I should try and just do some modeling

17:20.960 --> 17:26.160
to earn some extra cash. And obviously, I didn't grow up in a very rich area. It wasn't very wealthy.

17:26.160 --> 17:33.120
And I thought, this is a great way to make money. And it was. Awesome. Great.

17:34.720 --> 17:43.600
And then at some point, I entered this into the state of South Africa. I was, I think about 17.

17:45.200 --> 17:49.760
The agent said, enter the competition, do this, you might win it. You do go on to bigger things.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.120
And I did. And then I ended up winning it. And I went on to

17:53.360 --> 17:58.240
then host a television show in South Africa. And it's one of South Africa's most popular

17:58.240 --> 18:02.640
Asian lifestyle television shows. So millions of views every week. And I was fortunate enough,

18:02.640 --> 18:07.760
it's called Eastern Mosaic. They contacted me because they saw me when they saw the competition,

18:07.760 --> 18:13.360
which is pretty cool. And asked me to join team and I did. And at that point, I think

18:13.360 --> 18:19.680
was 17 when I won the competition, 18 sorry, when I won. And when I won it, and then afterwards,

18:19.760 --> 18:23.520
I went on to TV show and I was in my first to second year of med school.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.200
So around then I've been living, I've started living this double life. It's like

18:28.080 --> 18:33.280
entering two different realms. I mean, you mentioned in your emails, Joseph Campbell,

18:34.480 --> 18:37.680
I mean, a hero's journey type of thing, you know, that call to adventure. This is,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.960
this was it, you know, because I really started this medical journey. And

18:41.920 --> 18:44.640
then I got approached by this other world that was completely different.

18:45.040 --> 18:49.840
Yeah. For a guy who's homesick, really irritated with the way things are going and not really

18:49.840 --> 18:56.880
happy with where he is. This was like a blessing. This is completely, this was fun to travel. I got

18:56.880 --> 19:01.680
to teach because I wanted to be a teacher this whole time. So presenting to me became this platform

19:01.680 --> 19:06.880
where I could teach people, speak to an audience. And I think I really enjoyed that. And I loved

19:06.880 --> 19:11.120
lecturing. I loved giving talks. So it was, it was pretty cool because it got to then

19:11.120 --> 19:16.400
use a lot of these hobbies to get to sort of something that made money and help pay med school

19:16.400 --> 19:22.160
fees and help do a lot of things for my own lifestyle in general. And then at that point,

19:22.160 --> 19:26.160
the show was doing very well. We ended up getting another show and it all just rippled from there.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.440
I mean, I kept doing TV shows, but then I was sort of living this double life.

19:30.960 --> 19:36.640
And it started becoming a little difficult. I mean, I'd go from a 36 hour shift at the hospital

19:36.640 --> 19:41.360
and then I have to film an entire event the next day, the television show. And so I'd be

19:41.360 --> 19:46.800
exhausted. I remember I liked it. It was completely dark and like sunk and I'd look

19:46.800 --> 19:51.280
tired all the time. So it was like a chronic fatigue. I loved it. It was too exciting to stop.

19:51.280 --> 19:58.480
It was almost like being on drugs. I love this energy that you just keep wanting to get addicted

19:58.480 --> 20:04.800
to the dope bike. And and back then I had a lot of social media. I was using, I was actively

20:04.800 --> 20:10.720
engaging with the community. So that constant feedback started really feeding the ego, I would

20:10.720 --> 20:16.400
say. And I mean, I enjoyed it at the time. But then at some point I decided there's got to be a

20:16.400 --> 20:24.240
limit. I have to either continue with one or continue with the other. And I chose the medical

20:24.240 --> 20:31.040
and science background. How did you make that choice? It was difficult. I mean, I always would

20:31.040 --> 20:36.640
have. It was it was never and it was never me actually thinking of giving that. But it was more

20:36.640 --> 20:46.160
that you get tired of the, I don't want to son, you get tired of it. So it's almost like a fake

20:46.160 --> 20:51.440
world. It's kind of like a curated world that you start getting a bit but frustrated. You're

20:51.440 --> 20:56.400
tired of the fact that everybody has this facade. They're not showing the true colors. They're not

20:56.400 --> 21:02.720
being themselves. Whereas in medicine, people are being, lack of better terms, I'm assholes to you.

21:04.880 --> 21:10.640
Which was nailing you, just telling you how bad you are at this thing. No filter, absolutely no

21:10.640 --> 21:16.080
concern of whether he hurts me or not. And and I found that a little bit better for somebody.

21:16.080 --> 21:22.000
Felt like I'd rather know exactly where I stand with you versus going into this big event with

21:22.000 --> 21:26.560
everyone just being fake the whole time, pretending like they love you, pretending like

21:26.560 --> 21:31.920
they care constantly in this environment. You don't really know how to read people. You,

21:31.920 --> 21:36.320
for someone who loves psychology, philosophy, you want to know how people are thinking. You want

21:36.320 --> 21:40.880
to know why they think a certain way. I mean, in this act, it's sort of like it's constantly

21:40.880 --> 21:47.040
acting. And I didn't really like it. And then the politically correct, started growing over time.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.080
I had my own views on that. And I, it's, it's sort of becoming too much. I felt that

21:52.960 --> 21:56.720
being, being online, not being able to speak your mind, not being able to talk and openly

21:56.720 --> 22:00.400
and have discourse, which is the main reason why I started MindBodySolution was

22:00.400 --> 22:04.560
having a platform to provide a lot of these people, have theories they're afraid to actually

22:04.560 --> 22:11.360
share sometimes, because of the repercussions. So I was always a fan of having that freedom of

22:11.360 --> 22:16.000
speech, trying to be able to say what you want to say, and without offending people with intent.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.440
I mean, context is always important. Content is not relevant without considering the context it's in.

22:24.480 --> 22:29.920
If you, if you just take content for what it is, that's, that just doesn't work. Someone can say

22:29.920 --> 22:34.320
something. It can mean a completely different thing in a different contextual situation. So

22:34.320 --> 22:41.040
I found that very, very frustrating about the television slash online world where context

22:41.040 --> 22:48.720
is completely eliminated and possibly eradicated on the scenario. And yeah, it became easier at

22:48.720 --> 22:53.520
that point. Had it not become that way, I think I might have stayed longer. But the more I watched

22:53.520 --> 23:00.800
the way it started to go that route, I decided to take a step back. I put my mouth too much. So I

23:00.800 --> 23:07.440
think context is very important. Sure. And it's funny because this is part of the reason why these

23:07.440 --> 23:11.520
long form discussions I think are so popular and has become, have become popular in less,

23:11.520 --> 23:17.520
you know, 10 years or so, is that we get the time to have the whole, the context is,

23:18.880 --> 23:24.640
you know, it's built in there. And on TV, it's like, give me your sound bite, give me 30 seconds,

23:25.280 --> 23:30.720
make it quick, because we got a mistake. What's that? I missed it. Like a 10 second clip of

23:30.720 --> 23:39.040
making a mistake and just wait a lot more to say they stopped it just not a fan of that.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.960
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I agree. I think it is. I'm personally, I'm just getting into it. You know,

23:46.960 --> 23:53.120
this is sort of the beginning of a new chapter for my channel. I want to do some more long form

23:53.120 --> 24:01.360
stuff like this. And because I think it's fascinating. Oh, thank you. Oh, geez, stop.

24:02.080 --> 24:08.640
Flatir really got you very far. So I appreciate that. I mean, you are, but I mean, I can tell

24:08.640 --> 24:13.120
one of the things that comes through on your channel, which I will get to in a little bit,

24:13.120 --> 24:19.200
because I think I'll be the main focus of the discussion, is how polished you are. I mean,

24:19.200 --> 24:24.240
how clearly, how clearly you have your what, five, six years of TV experience? I mean,

24:24.800 --> 24:31.440
yeah, but more than that, I think like, yeah, about, I started in 2012 or so, and I ended in around

24:32.560 --> 24:38.720
18, 19. And what I did, but then I did, obviously, I mean, as you know, Survivor and the other shows.

24:38.720 --> 24:46.080
Oh, yeah. Different reasons and different circumstances around that. Well, since you brought

24:46.160 --> 24:54.080
it up, let's talk some Survivor. Survivor, one of my favorites. If not house, it's going to be Survivor.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.800
Yeah, if you have to choose, your on a deserted island, which one do you go with?

25:02.480 --> 25:06.080
I think I'll go with, if I'm on a deserted island, I think I'll go with Survivor at that point.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.640
So I would say the same thing, but then you're also, you're in this vicious loop where you're

25:10.640 --> 25:14.320
on an island watching a show about an island. You might want to escape from that.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.000
Especially if I'm watching a season where I'm on, because then it's going to feel very much like

25:18.000 --> 25:24.720
inception. Oh, absolutely. Were you on two seasons or one season? Two. So we recently just,

25:25.440 --> 25:30.640
this year, had our first South African return season. So it was pretty much an all-star season.

25:30.640 --> 25:34.560
And that was very, very cool. Went home too soon again.

25:36.640 --> 25:41.840
Yeah, that is so cool. And what made you apply for Survivor? Or did they reach out to you?

25:41.840 --> 25:47.360
Did they see you? Like, how did that work? So no, no, no. So I love Survivor. I've been a fan

25:48.080 --> 25:52.560
since I was probably around nine as well. I mean, I think there's one climate in 2000.

25:54.160 --> 25:59.120
Oh, yes. The original one. Richard Hatch, that season? Yes. I think it was 2000 or 2001,

26:00.320 --> 26:06.480
which meant I was around seven, actually, seven or eight. And I started watching from then. And

26:06.480 --> 26:11.280
it's a family show. My mom loves it. My sister loves it. We've been watching it as a family

26:11.280 --> 26:17.120
since then. And I often save, I used to save seasons, come in a different city to watch it when

26:17.120 --> 26:23.440
I get back. I download and get back to the other city to watch it with them. And I've been a fan

26:23.440 --> 26:29.120
for such a long time. I love the psychosocial behavioral dynamics of it all. For me, it's very

26:29.120 --> 26:35.680
much a biopsychosocial game. Medicine, we focus on a biopsychosocial model. It's extended itself to

26:35.680 --> 26:41.760
biopsychosocial spiritual, biopsychosocial cultural. But when you think of Survivor, it's not just

26:43.040 --> 26:47.840
a television show to me. To me, it's more for pretty much what Jeff Probst says. It's a social

26:47.840 --> 26:53.600
experiment, except I think it's a lot more complex than I think. I think there's a lot of dynamics

26:53.600 --> 26:59.920
behind the game that they can dictate how people behave in real life and how people perceive themselves

26:59.920 --> 27:05.840
within the game dictates a lot about what they don't know they're doing real life. Because

27:06.720 --> 27:13.040
people have this image of almost when you enter this game, it's not reality. You're almost taken

27:13.040 --> 27:18.480
away from reality because they build this box where you can behave a certain way based on the rules

27:18.480 --> 27:24.720
that they've set out. This box just so happens to be within the real world that you've always been

27:24.720 --> 27:30.000
apart of. So you can never really escape reality. So a lot of people who have this perception that

27:30.000 --> 27:34.240
when you leave the real world and enter Survivor, you can be an asshole, you can be a dick, you can

27:34.240 --> 27:39.680
be these people. I don't think that's true. I think the way you behave, yes, if you want to play a

27:39.680 --> 27:44.960
character, entertainment purposes, very enough, I'm all about that. I did that my first season.

27:44.960 --> 27:52.080
Very mischievous, very much the naughty guy trying to put people against each other. The second time

27:52.080 --> 27:57.760
I played, I was a lot more mature. I was a bit four years older. But then I wanted to play more

27:57.760 --> 28:02.080
like the doctor that I am. And it comes across on the show. You see myself in the first season,

28:02.080 --> 28:09.120
very naughty. She was lying, making up stories. And I went through this intention. I told them,

28:09.120 --> 28:13.360
like, listen, I come from a television background. I'm here because I love the show and I want to

28:13.360 --> 28:17.760
make the show better. Mangle here is not just about me. It's about less make South African

28:17.760 --> 28:23.200
Survivor as cool as it can be. At this point, Survivor had just finished season five, and season

28:23.200 --> 28:28.720
six got taken over by a new production company called Afrocons. And this production company is

28:28.720 --> 28:34.960
filled with massive fans, just huge, like big Survivor fans. One of the producers, he's like

28:34.960 --> 28:40.160
one of the, he's got a tattoo of the Survivor staff on his arm. His name is LB. One of the

28:40.160 --> 28:44.960
biggest fans out there. So I got onto the show at the right time because this group of people

28:44.960 --> 28:50.320
decided to make it just like the US version. And it became one of the best seasons internationally.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.040
I mean, at some point, people didn't know of international ranking. And it comes out second,

28:55.040 --> 28:59.920
season six of South Africa. So it's Philippine. I think one of the US seasons was first and

29:00.800 --> 29:04.880
second was Survivor South Africa Philippines. And then thereafter is an Australian season.

29:05.520 --> 29:10.560
I can't remember which US season it was. But yeah, at the time, it was because of how good

29:10.640 --> 29:17.680
the production crew managed to edit the show and make it so realistic. It stayed true to everyone's

29:17.680 --> 29:24.160
characters. It gave enough content, of context, which is also quite cool. Not just those snippets

29:24.160 --> 29:30.160
to create characters. We sort of had the freedom to make our own characters. And nobody comes there

29:30.160 --> 29:34.960
to act. Nobody's there. It's not scripted. It's not an act. It's not a play. We do everything's

29:34.960 --> 29:40.880
legit. So the big thing is, is though, if you want to play a character as a fan, we'll do it.

29:41.520 --> 29:47.600
So if I if I love Richard Hatch, for example, I'm more likely to then play a little bit villainous

29:47.600 --> 29:53.680
and I'll be a little bit more than someone else. It's quite a fascinating scenario.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.960
Absolutely. What was it? I mean, what was the most surprising thing about it? What

29:59.760 --> 30:04.960
what didn't you expect or what was when you actually got there? You know, day one,

30:05.840 --> 30:11.440
everyone must just be here on the moon or it's just a panoply of emotions. But what was different

30:11.440 --> 30:16.160
about the experience? What surprised you, I guess? I mean, just for some context, I mean,

30:16.160 --> 30:20.400
I don't think I answered your question. When I saw that Survivor South Africa season six,

30:20.400 --> 30:24.160
because this has been years in our sense, he's in fine. We haven't heard about it for a while.

30:24.160 --> 30:28.560
So then they announced that season six happening. And the day before the auditions were finished,

30:29.200 --> 30:33.920
one of my best friends at the time, she sent me a message to say that survivors happening again

30:33.920 --> 30:38.720
and how much you love it. Don't you want to enter? But I just finished a 26 hour shift at the hospital

30:39.280 --> 30:44.720
and I sent a video of myself in scrubs. I think it quickly got home. I made a quick

30:44.720 --> 30:48.880
recording on my cell phone just saying, listen, I love this game. I'm going to be a villain.

30:49.440 --> 30:54.160
Just point blank. I'm going to be a villain. It's hell of a background. I'm going to entertain

30:54.160 --> 30:58.000
and just lie sheets, steal, do whatever it takes to make sure the audience

30:58.000 --> 31:01.840
and the tribe mates are eating out of the palm of my hands. I had this whole thing prepped.

31:04.320 --> 31:09.440
It worked. They called me back and they said, okay, they knew that I was from television,

31:09.440 --> 31:12.960
obviously, but they actually asked me, am I going to come as the television presenter?

31:12.960 --> 31:18.720
Or am I going to come as Dr. Naidu? And I said, I'm coming as Dr. Naidu. So let's forget about

31:18.720 --> 31:22.400
the fact that I've ever done anything on television, coming as someone who has a background in

31:23.280 --> 31:29.600
psychology, neuroscience, medicine, and I'm going to play mind games. This was my character. I was

31:29.600 --> 31:34.880
a really curated character. And so you get to Philippines, fast forward a couple months later,

31:34.880 --> 31:41.680
and you have to isolate in a room for about 10 days. It's so crazy. You start losing

31:41.680 --> 31:45.760
a bit of yourself during that period. Why do you isolate? What do you mean, like before the game

31:45.760 --> 31:52.160
starts? Yeah, yeah. And this is pre-COVID as well. So it's a good way to get everyone onto the

31:52.720 --> 31:57.440
same country without seeing each other. So you get one contention at a time, because you might,

31:57.440 --> 32:01.280
because especially in a place like South Africa, let's say you're in Durban or Cape Town, you might

32:01.280 --> 32:06.240
know the person who comes across at the airport. So you'd rather avoid that scenario. Let's let them

32:06.240 --> 32:12.560
go through one to many and not allow them to actually leave the hotel room. So you have to stay

32:12.560 --> 32:18.960
inside. It's horrible. That's probably one of the worst experiences. Have you ever watched

32:18.960 --> 32:26.880
Mindfield with his name? He's a YouTuber. He's got this show called Vsauce, Michael.

32:27.920 --> 32:32.720
Yes, it's been a while, but yeah, yeah, of course. He's got this YouTube show called Mindfield,

32:32.720 --> 32:37.360
where he sits in a room for about, in a black room with nothing to do for about 10 days. I can't

32:37.360 --> 32:43.440
remember exactly. But that's what it felt like. You're stuck in this room. No clocks, no watches,

32:43.600 --> 32:49.600
cell phones, nothing. So no, my room specifically had no window as well, because it was covered by

32:49.600 --> 32:54.480
some sort of a dark alley that had a roof over it. So I couldn't tell whether it was night or day.

32:55.600 --> 33:01.120
I had no inkling of what time it was ever. The only thing that can be sort of on track was each

33:01.120 --> 33:07.840
time a meal came to me. And it messed me up. I remember getting off because I had all these

33:07.840 --> 33:12.080
notes for all the cool things I was going to do on the island. And day one, I completely

33:12.080 --> 33:18.640
forgot about it all. I went there just, I hadn't slept for like three days before coming onto the

33:18.640 --> 33:26.000
game. And I think it was seven days. I spent seven days in the hotel, not 10, but seven days of just

33:26.000 --> 33:31.440
not knowing what time it is, not knowing what's going on. It's quite rough. Weird. Weird setup for...

33:32.880 --> 33:36.240
It gets to you. And I think in the second time, because of COVID, it was another, it was just

33:36.240 --> 33:40.080
the same. You had to stay in the hotel room. At least it was light. There was sunlight in this

33:40.080 --> 33:45.520
hotel room. So much better experience. But still, it gets to you because you then play

33:45.520 --> 33:51.200
the game within your head too much. And you can be your own worst enemy, especially in a game like

33:51.200 --> 33:56.320
Survival, where you're completely paranoid all the time. You don't trust anyone. You really don't

33:56.320 --> 34:01.760
know what to expect. You get out there and you realize that they're all doing the same thing

34:01.760 --> 34:06.960
you're trying to do, which is lie to you. And you realize you're not that good at it. You think

34:06.960 --> 34:12.560
you are. You think you are. Yeah, right. But you're not that good at it. Because you're a good

34:12.560 --> 34:17.680
guy. You're not doing that in the real, you're not getting practice in your real life. You know.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.160
I'm going, they're trying to put on a show. That's what the second time I tried to be a bit more

34:22.160 --> 34:26.960
like myself, which then became bad thing anyway, because then I got to seeing this guy who's in

34:26.960 --> 34:32.000
charge of the truck, who look up to me, people are constantly asking me for advice, who want to

34:32.000 --> 34:37.200
know what to do. And then you get labeled with a different label, which is he's winning material,

34:37.200 --> 34:45.200
someone who's going to possibly with it. It's a crazy, it's a, it's a wonderful, I agree. It's

34:45.200 --> 34:51.760
a wonderful game. I think I mentioned to you in our correspondence before that it's funny because

34:51.760 --> 34:57.520
I might not be here. We might be having this conversation unless I applied for a survivor

34:57.520 --> 35:01.680
like five years ago. And I got, I got to the final stages. I did the whole thing, you know,

35:01.680 --> 35:05.360
you're in the hotel room, you can't talk to the other contestants there, but you know,

35:05.360 --> 35:09.760
there, everyone else is around, you know, you know who the people are. And I mean,

35:09.760 --> 35:13.360
it's a while, it is for a week, you know, you're, you're, it's, yeah, it's kind of messing with

35:13.360 --> 35:19.600
your head. And I did a bunch of crazy stuff. I would show up to breakfast and a robe and a crazy

35:19.600 --> 35:24.880
outfit and stuff like that. And just like trying to create attention for myself, you know, trying

35:24.880 --> 35:32.640
to create like some intrigue around me. And I get to the interviews with like the casting person

35:32.640 --> 35:38.560
and Jeff Probst, you know, which is like, whoa, holy shit, it's Jeff. And they'd be like, hey,

35:38.560 --> 35:42.320
everyone's talking about you, you know, you're causing a stir. Like, and I was like, yeah,

35:43.040 --> 35:49.040
I was like, that's what I will do on the show. Put me on and I will do, I will do stuff, you know,

35:49.120 --> 35:55.200
to be interesting. But yeah, and I had, oh my God, I was so into it. I like had,

35:55.200 --> 35:59.680
I have an 80 page Google doc of like survivor strategies, you know, all this stuff to do.

36:00.320 --> 36:04.000
I completely agree. I did the same thing. I had this huge with a whole bunch of notes.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.840
I also put on like, because I was thinking, I went into it and

36:13.600 --> 36:18.640
at the end of the whole process, I thought to myself, that's the best I could possibly do.

36:18.640 --> 36:23.120
I was like, I have no, I left it all in the field, you know, I was like, that's all I got.

36:23.120 --> 36:28.640
And I thought I did, I did as good as I could. And so I was like, the turnaround between when

36:28.640 --> 36:33.680
they tell you you're going to go on and when you go is a month, I don't know, it's quick. So I,

36:33.680 --> 36:38.640
my thought process was like, okay, you're going to lose a lot of weight when you're on the island.

36:38.640 --> 36:43.920
But you don't want to, you don't want to like, eat a ton. You don't want to put on like,

36:43.920 --> 36:47.520
10 pounds right before you go. Because your body is used to that. So when you're

36:48.080 --> 36:54.000
fasting, it's going to be way worse. So I thought, what I'll do is I'll put on like 20 pounds a few

36:54.000 --> 37:00.240
months before, get my body accustomed to that weight, and then fast as I approach the date.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.120
But I didn't get it. So I just put on a bunch of weight.

37:05.120 --> 37:09.440
That's, that's almost exactly what happened to me. Because when I, I first, I remember for the

37:09.440 --> 37:16.560
second time, I got so ripped. I exercise and train every day and got covered. Then I got the flu.

37:17.120 --> 37:23.360
Then I got covered again. So I ended up eating and just laying in bed for the next two months

37:23.360 --> 37:28.720
before I got into survival. And all I remember seeing on TV was me just with this huge tummy

37:28.720 --> 37:34.800
to all unfit. And I thought like, I was, I was hoping I'd be a bit more fit for this tribe.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.600
Luckily, I was still manageable.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.480
Whatever. I mean, you can always frame it. What's funny is,

37:42.720 --> 37:47.040
if you are the ripped guy, then you have like, you know, a target sort of, you know, survivor,

37:47.040 --> 37:51.760
you know, challenge threat or whatever. So you can always kind of work it in a way.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.920
That's exactly what I did. I used it to my advantage. I was like, they aren't all more ripped guys,

37:56.880 --> 37:57.360
let's go.

37:59.360 --> 38:06.080
And it's so interesting too, like the, I love it for like the game, the game theory behind it,

38:06.080 --> 38:10.080
you know, all this kind of stuff. But what it always, what it ends up coming down to, it's,

38:10.960 --> 38:17.520
you know, the emotional, you know, you're at the mercy of the jury at the end. And their decisions

38:17.520 --> 38:22.800
are, in my opinion, from what I've seen, it's like 95% emotional, you know, did they like you

38:22.800 --> 38:26.400
or not? You know, it's what it always comes down to.

38:26.400 --> 38:31.120
It's so difficult to remove your emotions from the game. In fact, that plays the biggest role.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.680
You're correct. You're 100% right. Because I remember when, when I got voted out, when I got

38:35.680 --> 38:39.040
home, I thought to myself, the person, like one of the people who voted me out, I thought I'd

38:39.040 --> 38:44.560
never vote for that person. Even though I knew that person was playing the best game. Wow.

38:45.760 --> 38:50.640
When I thought about it, I was that person, I was that guy who always said, I'd never do that.

38:50.640 --> 38:57.280
I would never allow my emotional judgment to hurt the rational thinking behind my

38:57.280 --> 39:03.520
mind. And it happened. That's how strong the game gets you. You're broken down to core. Literally

39:03.520 --> 39:12.720
just dirty, hungry, tired, burnt, scarred, bruised, bleeding, starving. There's no food,

39:12.720 --> 39:17.280
you're losing weight at a rapid pace. The first time I lost eight kilograms in 18 days.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.400
And that's too much weight so fast. It's not healthy. Sure. It's absurd. But I still remember

39:24.400 --> 39:29.120
thinking when I often, one of the things I said when I interviewed for, when I tried to audition

39:29.120 --> 39:34.160
for the game was think of survivor as real life and actually think about it philosophically.

39:34.800 --> 39:40.560
You are placed in the scenario where you're forced to lie, cheat, steal, whatever, make an

39:40.560 --> 39:46.960
environment, create a social structure, try and create society. And thereafter, think of it as

39:47.040 --> 39:51.920
a tribe, because we are a tribe. And every night you have to go to a tribal council to sacrifice

39:52.480 --> 39:58.240
person. So think of it that way and legitimately think about who you would kill, who you would

39:58.240 --> 40:04.720
be willing to actively kill. Tribal council that way. Really give that some thought because that's

40:04.720 --> 40:09.360
primarily what's happening every night. We're actively going to kill someone. So you have to,

40:09.360 --> 40:13.440
so I even approach a lot of people that next, the second time I played with this argument,

40:13.440 --> 40:18.960
I was like, if you are willing to kill me versus this person, really, that's what you're doing at

40:18.960 --> 40:24.480
this point. Really give it some thought philosophically. Take the game for its core meaning. Because I

40:24.480 --> 40:30.800
know when, I think it was Mark Burnett, who took over from Charlie Parsons, author rights. Charlie

40:30.800 --> 40:36.480
Parsons was a Brit, I think is Brit. And he started off with this shot. I think it was in Sweden,

40:36.480 --> 40:40.240
of Switzerland, where he got this bunch of guys together and he put them on this island and he

40:40.240 --> 40:44.080
sort of realized that this has potential to be something intriguing. Because fundamentally,

40:44.080 --> 40:50.400
that's the core of the game. It's this whole psychosocial element where you have to get people to

40:50.400 --> 40:57.040
forgive you for putting them on the other side. And that's so difficult. Unless you're a really,

40:57.040 --> 41:01.680
really nice person, you're never going to get forgiveness. It's going to be ancient.

41:03.280 --> 41:09.360
Wow. I haven't heard these kinds of framings before around, or maybe it's been a while,

41:09.520 --> 41:16.000
around your sacrifice, human sacrifice. And then at the end, you're asking for forgiveness from

41:16.000 --> 41:21.200
the tribe. It's like basically sitting in heaven, looking at all the people you killed,

41:22.320 --> 41:27.600
and then asking them for forgiveness. And then to still give you a million dollars or a million

41:27.600 --> 41:37.920
rent. Sure. It's amazing. Crazy stuff. I mean, I was crazy talking about this. I just seem like

41:37.920 --> 41:43.760
the psychophilosopher. No, it's cool. It was way too hard and it was too much for some.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so interesting.

41:48.560 --> 41:53.360
Dance of overthinking. Yeah, that can happen. Yeah, pretty easily. I feel like we could talk

41:53.360 --> 41:59.440
about Survivor for a long time. But let's, I mean, there's a lot that we could talk about there,

41:59.440 --> 42:02.240
but I'm sure that you have lots of like little stories and stuff like that. But

42:02.960 --> 42:08.320
I'd love to get about another time. Yeah, yeah. No, I'd be very interested for sure.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
So Survivor happens. You're coming out of that. You decide. And I think you may mention even on

42:16.000 --> 42:20.240
an interview that you had to like turn down a position to do Survivor even get to like.

42:20.240 --> 42:28.240
Yeah, I mean, was that my second time on I got accepted to do a specialist program

42:28.720 --> 42:35.360
or microbiology at the time? Because this was in COVID was at its ripe. It was super ripe.

42:36.480 --> 42:40.000
Everybody was talking about microorganisms. I was like, this is fascinating. Let me read

42:40.000 --> 42:43.840
more about it. I was doing lectures. I was in the military at the time working for the

42:43.840 --> 42:49.440
military. And I remember just going out giving public lectures on virology, microbiology,

42:49.440 --> 42:54.960
just discussing how organisms work, how COVID's nothing more than just a virus,

42:54.960 --> 42:59.120
just like every other virus. In fact, I just read a Lancet paper just today

43:00.160 --> 43:05.440
that shows that September 2022, which is now, well, we're in October, but last month.

43:06.880 --> 43:12.000
The most common respiratory viruses in South Africa have been rhinovirus, adenovirus,

43:12.720 --> 43:16.720
and influenza virus was third. The COVID's not even in the top 10 at the moment.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.680
I was trying to give this lecture to put some context into the situation because a lot of people

43:21.680 --> 43:27.440
get very, very hyped when they hear something new. Novelty really creates chaos. And that's

43:27.440 --> 43:34.160
exactly what happened with COVID. We really lost the idea that there are other viruses out there,

43:34.160 --> 43:39.600
or high blood pressure and diabetes still exist. You can't sit at home and hide from the world and

43:39.600 --> 43:46.640
then eat a bunch of cakes for the rest of your life. There are other killers out there. My

43:46.640 --> 43:50.640
lectures were focused on that. And then I wanted to do microbiology, but then got this second

43:50.640 --> 43:58.400
opportunity. I'll take survival. Sure. Yeah. When you're that big a fan, it's an easy choice.

43:58.400 --> 44:05.520
A lot of doctors literally despise me. So not okay. Yeah. Who cares about that?

44:10.160 --> 44:14.160
Yeah, right, right. Survivors only got, I mean, but if they came back to you now, would you do it

44:14.160 --> 44:21.120
again? Yeah, 100 days. Are you just always in? Third time's the charm. I think. Yeah, right.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.000
Third time's the one. I have to just play my card.

44:25.040 --> 44:31.120
If we get a bit wiser, I need some wisdom. Wisdom helps. It's always useful. And then

44:31.120 --> 44:35.440
at that point I came back and, well, it was often my first time on SurvivorWay, I started to

44:36.160 --> 44:40.320
think about maybe starting a podcast. And I think that's where the journey started to take.

44:41.040 --> 44:47.760
Okay. How'd that start? Yeah, I mean, I was in Otsun, which is a small town outside of Cape Town.

44:47.760 --> 44:53.120
So it's about five hours away from Cape Town in South Africa. And I was doing my master's degree

44:53.120 --> 44:58.080
at the time. And I started doing it in philosophy and ethics of mental health. And this took me

44:58.080 --> 45:05.440
into a hugely different domain. As a doctor who's focused primarily on physical sciences, biology,

45:05.520 --> 45:11.120
chemistry. When you do a philosophical degree and you write dissertations and you try and actively

45:11.120 --> 45:15.280
argue certain points, you start to really realize how flawed a lot of your thinking was

45:16.480 --> 45:20.080
while studying the topic you were studying. And that's exactly what happened to me,

45:20.080 --> 45:25.280
because I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I wanted to be perhaps a neurologist or a psychiatrist. And

45:26.160 --> 45:30.480
when I started this degree, I started to listen to the arguments or the counter-arguments of

45:30.480 --> 45:36.480
physicalist theories or how we just make the assumption that the brain is merely a correlation

45:36.480 --> 45:39.760
of this, I mean, the mind, sorry, is merely a correlation of this part of the brain. And I

45:39.760 --> 45:45.920
started to really dissect this philosophically within the degree. Still very much physicalist at

45:45.920 --> 45:52.880
heart, even currently. But I remember really thinking about it, thinking, right, I mean,

45:52.880 --> 45:58.240
we can't just make these assumptions and assume it's correct. We can't, we barely know anything

45:58.240 --> 46:02.800
about physics. I mean, we'll discuss metaphysical things. I'm sure I'm sure we're going to discuss

46:02.800 --> 46:07.040
at this point. But when you think about the metaphysical reality and the fact that 99

46:07.040 --> 46:11.200
points, whatever percent of the universe is dark matter, and we can't really even tell you what

46:11.200 --> 46:16.800
that is, you have to really question your physicalist view. You can't make the assumption that the

46:16.800 --> 46:22.720
physical reality is verticality or vertical truth. When you're asking yourself what is the truth

46:22.720 --> 46:27.280
of your podcast and your YouTube channel, I mean, what is the truth? When you look, I mean,

46:27.280 --> 46:30.160
when I look at you right now, I'm seeing photons of light hitting my retina,

46:31.520 --> 46:35.760
trying to getting transduced, I mean, converting processing information, and then I'm getting

46:35.760 --> 46:41.200
that back. That's not even happening right now. So when we think of temporality, we think this is

46:41.200 --> 46:46.480
that right now. That's not this time that takes for the light to come by. It takes time to get

46:47.280 --> 46:52.240
cortex, come back, get processed, memories come back in, flood in the last time I chatted to you.

46:53.200 --> 46:59.200
And then I bring up this sort of vision of you. And that takes a long time.

47:00.000 --> 47:07.280
Joshua Bach talks about that temporality and the ontology of reality is very blurry.

47:08.960 --> 47:17.760
I call myself epistemologically, I call myself ontologically agnostic, but epistemologically,

47:18.400 --> 47:21.200
I can tell you that certain things I know to not be true.

47:23.440 --> 47:29.200
So if I had to say, one of the things would be, when it comes to my views on religion or God,

47:29.200 --> 47:34.160
I'm ontologically agnostic regarding the origins of the universe, what's out there,

47:34.160 --> 47:39.120
and what could be. I don't know fundamentally. I can tell you what I don't think is there.

47:39.120 --> 47:43.600
I don't think that there's a man in the sky. I don't think that somebody can

47:44.160 --> 47:48.720
tell you what to do, tweak it here or there. I actually don't even think that

47:48.720 --> 47:53.360
deistic views are possibly true. You're always going to fall into that

47:54.720 --> 48:01.920
infinite regress of who made the deist, who made that, and just keep going and going.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.680
I think it's so much more complicated. I think that whatever the truth actually is,

48:06.320 --> 48:11.280
is not something we're ever going to be able to understand. I don't think we have,

48:11.840 --> 48:20.400
and I find it very, very arrogant that a lot of us think that we will gain access to this knowledge.

48:22.160 --> 48:26.400
I think that the truth is not something to ever see.

48:28.240 --> 48:31.120
You think the truth is something we'll never see, we'll never experience, you think?

48:31.120 --> 48:35.920
Yeah, we'll never really, I mean, we barely experience reality. If you think of the optical

48:35.920 --> 48:40.960
window on Earth, it's called the optical window because it's all we can actually see. It's all that

48:41.040 --> 48:46.400
electromagnetic radiation that the light passes through, and it's all from ultraviolet to infrared.

48:47.280 --> 48:51.280
We don't get anything more than that, anything less than that, and then some species can see

48:51.280 --> 48:57.120
the ultraviolet rays, for example birds, and some can see infrared like snakes. We see everything

48:57.120 --> 49:05.920
in between. We'll never see gamma rays. We never, ever see radio waves. I mean, they're always here,

49:06.880 --> 49:14.240
but we don't see it. We see almost nothing, but we do experience something.

49:15.600 --> 49:21.120
Why is that, and what is the case? That's primarily the reason for my podcast is

49:22.000 --> 49:29.760
my views changed so much over the last five to ten years regarding my own beliefs. I was very much

49:30.720 --> 49:36.320
a physicalist, hardcore materialist, not materialist in the sense that I like to buy fancy things,

49:36.320 --> 49:41.200
in case anyone's watching this. The philosophical sphere, I mean, I'm not

49:41.200 --> 49:45.600
materialist in the sense that I don't think everything's material. I mean, I thought everything

49:45.600 --> 49:50.640
was material, sorry, and that the physical world was the objective reality and the

49:50.640 --> 49:56.480
objective truth, but that changed completely. It slowly became very much emergentist. I thought,

49:56.560 --> 50:02.640
okay, consciousness probably merges over time, and with my body solution, the podcast that I have,

50:03.440 --> 50:10.400
the goal was to see if that's true at the time, and during that period, while doing my mental,

50:10.400 --> 50:15.600
my master's in philosophy and ethics of mental health, I slowly became an illusionist. I started

50:15.600 --> 50:20.880
to really question whether we really see reality for what it is, and illusionism became very

50:20.960 --> 50:27.360
convincing, and that's Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, Michael Graziano, Joshua Bach. They're

50:27.360 --> 50:33.600
very much illusionists at heart, and I found myself very convinced on the argument to be

50:33.600 --> 50:38.640
very convincing. Galen Strossen calls it one of the stupid, one of the most idiotic or stupid

50:38.640 --> 50:45.360
theories he's ever had in his life. No phrasing, but Galen's, I mean, I'm scheduled to chat to

50:45.360 --> 50:49.440
Galen at some point. I mean, he's very, very prominent in the philosophy of my sphere, and

50:50.400 --> 50:56.480
I mean, he's a mysterious, I mean, and I think at this point, I'm closer to that. I just don't

50:56.480 --> 51:03.440
know, and I don't claim to know. It's too complex, it's too complicated.

51:04.320 --> 51:09.920
Sure, but you still want to get close. That's the goal of this podcast, is explore this, and I often

51:09.920 --> 51:14.560
close the podcast, I'm not sure if you noticed, but I often say thanks for taking us one step closer

51:14.880 --> 51:20.080
to the mind of the solution. I never said thanks for providing me with a mind-body solution.

51:20.080 --> 51:25.360
Yes. Because I don't think we're gonna get it. I think that this podcast is merely a stepping

51:25.360 --> 51:31.680
stone to what could have been. That's interesting. But you still, I mean, we still enjoy the

51:31.680 --> 51:37.280
investigation. We enjoy it. I love it so much. I mean, knowing isn't disheartening to me.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.320
It makes it even more intriguing. I would love for someone to give me a theory that I cannot

51:42.320 --> 51:50.560
refute, or that other philosophers or scientists cannot refute. Just completely construct information.

51:50.560 --> 51:57.120
I mean, it's concrete info that I cannot dispute. And I think that's impossible. I don't think,

51:57.120 --> 52:00.720
not me personally, but I think it's possible for someone to give that information where

52:00.720 --> 52:05.680
someone else is not going to counter it with something else. Sure, yeah. And I agree, I mean.

52:05.680 --> 52:10.160
There's so good theories out there. Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, there's so many

52:10.240 --> 52:14.800
interesting theories, interesting people to talk to. And even sometimes, I feel like

52:15.840 --> 52:21.520
even if a theory is wrong, the process of going through and thinking through it

52:21.520 --> 52:25.600
can lead you to some insights that you'll apply somewhere else. You know, it's not like all or

52:25.600 --> 52:35.040
nothing. And just thinking back, my channel is called The Truth. I think the closer to truth

52:35.040 --> 52:39.360
is already taken. I don't know if you've ever seen that. So I was like, ah, shit, I can't, I can't.

52:40.320 --> 52:44.240
Lawrence Kuhn took that from you. Yeah, he's great. And he's lovely. I mean, his interviews are

52:44.240 --> 52:51.920
awesome. One of the people that I wanted to curate by content and sort of align it with his size,

52:51.920 --> 52:57.520
he sort of show. That was why she got into television was I try wanted to actually host

52:57.520 --> 53:02.960
something like that. That was the main reason I went down down the route. Okay. Oh, now I'm

53:03.280 --> 53:08.640
we're pulling stuff out here. We're like, okay. So when I started thinking, okay, if I start here,

53:09.280 --> 53:15.840
I could end up doing a closer to the truth type. So cool. One day I might be able to do this. And

53:15.840 --> 53:19.760
it never happened. Unfortunately, I tried to approach the South African Broadcasting Commission

53:21.120 --> 53:24.480
with many ideas about this, but they felt that the niche audience

53:24.960 --> 53:33.520
is. Yeah, it's a real, the audience size. I don't know, I feel like there's a hunger for it.

53:35.840 --> 53:36.800
I mean, clearly, you know,

53:38.960 --> 53:42.800
but it is tough, you know, it's like how accessible can you make it to people like

53:43.680 --> 53:47.600
some folks have an interest in it and they don't maybe perhaps they don't have the

53:47.600 --> 53:53.600
educational background to sort of like get there, you know, there's one of the things I try to do

53:53.600 --> 53:59.760
with some like explainer videos is provide a lot of visualizations to the point where like,

53:59.760 --> 54:05.360
if someone is interested but can't quite get there, the visuals can kind of get them closer,

54:05.360 --> 54:10.800
you know, it can kind of be like, okay, it's kind of building and maybe, you know, they return to

54:10.800 --> 54:16.560
the video a year later or the topic a year later, and their mind has had time to think it, you know,

54:16.560 --> 54:20.720
think it through in the back of their head, they return, oh, I kind of get that a little bit closer,

54:20.720 --> 54:26.480
right. So there's like a lot of different ways that we can help teach people and get them.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.080
And I was watching your videos and I think that that you do a great job of doing that because

54:31.200 --> 54:35.520
I mean, you say you're starting out, but I mean, the way you're able to edit your videos and get

54:35.520 --> 54:41.680
them all into such as succinct and detailed manner, it's pretty it's pretty epic. I find it quite

54:41.680 --> 54:47.360
enjoyable to watch. Thanks, man. I will never tire here in that. Thank you so much. That's really

54:48.320 --> 54:54.960
quite a nice binge. Oh, nice. That's why I want that session time, baby. Get it up there. I will

54:54.960 --> 55:02.960
say too, though, I haven't considering a rebrand and maybe like true enough, instead of the truth,

55:02.960 --> 55:10.400
you know, but then I feel like the association might be that it's not good that people are like,

55:10.400 --> 55:17.040
it's close, not really good. Really? Yeah, but I do think, well, that's something that we can talk

55:17.040 --> 55:23.440
about, maybe jump into Hoffman a little bit, which is your most popular video so far. And I've

55:23.440 --> 55:31.280
covered him. Well, just to spin a speed truth there on my channel, this idea of like, satisfying,

55:31.280 --> 55:36.880
this idea of like, good enough, true enough, right? I can't remember which philosopher it was,

55:36.880 --> 55:41.600
Schopenhauer maybe, who said like, the truth is just what's true enough, you know, you have to just

55:42.320 --> 55:49.040
accept the limits and move on with your life. And you know, you can't, because otherwise, I mean,

55:49.040 --> 55:55.440
you can really easily, and I know I've been there in my life at times, where you get into this like

55:55.440 --> 56:04.480
existential nihilism about it, where the weight of it, the fact that you can't get there, weighs you

56:04.480 --> 56:08.800
down so much. And I've even had friends over the years who have been in that situation as well.

56:09.600 --> 56:15.600
And it's a tough spot to be in. Like, it sounds like, yeah,

56:15.600 --> 56:21.360
I've been as well. I think that when you question too much, you can take you down the rabbit hole,

56:22.560 --> 56:25.600
right down there to a point where you just think there's no way out.

56:27.120 --> 56:33.520
What is the purpose of this? Why am I here? It's like, you're not even a speck of dust

56:33.520 --> 56:39.680
on a stage. This place is just not about you. That's what it can take you towards. When you

56:39.680 --> 56:45.680
really start digging deep, what is this universe? Where are you? That existential nihilism is very,

56:45.680 --> 56:53.200
very easy to fall into. And I've been there. But then you find things that can bring you back up.

56:53.200 --> 56:56.560
I don't know how you managed to do it. Do you want to share that with me?

56:57.200 --> 57:01.200
I would. Yeah, if you'd like to hear, I want to hear what you kind of touched on,

57:01.200 --> 57:05.600
and I think quite a bit at the beginning. I had that kind of period during college

57:06.240 --> 57:12.160
between my junior and senior years for about a year where in hindsight, I didn't realize it was

57:12.160 --> 57:17.840
like my first oppressive period where every day I woke up and all I could think about was,

57:19.520 --> 57:24.320
does God exist? Like, what is going on here? Metaphysical questions, right? Like, what do I do?

57:25.200 --> 57:35.040
And I was a very religious person growing up, and it was partly due to my folks and my family,

57:35.680 --> 57:42.080
Catholic, go to Mass every Sunday. So I was kind of instituted, but I took the ball in high school

57:42.080 --> 57:50.640
and went running on my own too. It was something that was very significant to my life and my identity,

57:50.640 --> 57:55.520
and I believed in it wholeheartedly. I mean, you know, all the way through, and I led retreats,

57:55.520 --> 58:04.960
and I was very religious, and then I got to college, and I went to Brown University, which is,

58:04.960 --> 58:10.160
you know, a very liberal place, super different than what I was used to going to Catholic school my

58:10.160 --> 58:16.320
whole life growing up, and that just, you know, that religious tendency, that conservative tendency

58:17.120 --> 58:21.600
crashed into that world, and it was very difficult, especially at the beginning,

58:21.600 --> 58:26.080
but then slowly I started to open my mind to other ways of thinking, and then,

58:27.520 --> 58:35.520
yes, at some point I thought, how can I ration my way to the, yeah, to the core, right, to the truth?

58:36.720 --> 58:42.000
And I wrestled with it for like a year, I mean, every day. It was like really weighing me down,

58:42.080 --> 58:47.920
and at the end of that period or so, between my fall and spring semesters at college,

58:48.880 --> 58:53.280
I just threw my hands up, and I was like, I don't know, I can't, I have to be agnostic,

58:53.280 --> 59:00.320
I can't choose, because what I was also finding was I was like getting to my, I was kind of

59:00.320 --> 59:04.880
like logically trying to get to where I already was, you know, I was like, oh, let me, because

59:04.880 --> 59:09.120
it's comfortable, and there's a lot of good reasons to, I'm not anti-religious, by the way,

59:09.680 --> 59:17.280
I'm very, you know, whatever works for people, you know, very open to it, but I just had to

59:17.280 --> 59:23.040
let that go, and you hinted at it before too, it's scary to be like, you thought you had,

59:23.040 --> 59:29.680
you had this feeling like you had the support that everything was going to work out, that,

59:29.680 --> 59:35.040
you know, a guiding principle, and then you're in the void, you know, you're by yourself,

59:35.360 --> 59:39.520
you have only yourself to rely on, and your relationships with other people, of course,

59:39.520 --> 59:45.920
in the world, but yeah, that was the period of, yeah, the darkness, and then I just,

59:46.560 --> 59:51.760
a certain amount of acceptance that just wasn't going to get there by rationality alone.

59:53.600 --> 59:57.840
Yeah, it's one of those strange feelings you feel, like I said, I felt super free at the time,

59:58.560 --> 01:00:05.040
and I mean, that didn't last very long, it was, it quickly deteriorated into this

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.400
downward spiral of trying to search, I mean, what is the point of this,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.040
what, doing this, I mean, you start asking yourself some dark questions,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.280
but then you slowly fall in love with certain things again, and you start to,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.160
and you start enjoying the chase, I mean, that's pretty much what you're doing now with the truth,

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.840
you're trying to find it, and you might not think you will, you might think you get close enough,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.680
true enough, but same goes for me, I mean, I'm all about the journey at this point,

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.600
it's not about finding the mind-body solution, I mean, the mind-body problem is, to me,

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.120
my favorite problem, philosophically, it is what I live for at this point,

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:52.000
I mean, it's become pretty much my identity at this point, but the mind-body solution is something

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.440
I don't think we will find, not at least in my lifetime, but I think that trying to find the

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.080
solution or getting people to discuss it and have this discourse and communicate, I mean,

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.160
the fact that we're discussing it right now, I mean, it's pretty cool, it's so cool to know

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.800
that there's so many people out there who want to talk about this, and when I started the podcast,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.720
I was so surprised because I initially intended on not doing any sort of active

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:21.040
marketing or trying to promote the podcast or doing anything, and I haven't, it's just grown

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.600
very, very naturally, a lot of people have been coming to messaging me, emailing me,

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.400
making contact very naturally, and it's pretty cool because it seems like people are longing for

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:38.000
this information, they want to see this or listen to this discourse, and I think that time has come,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.280
and podcasting has given us this opportunity where finally the deeper questions can be

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.160
spoken about without sounding like your biggest psychotic episode.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.320
Sure, absolutely, and I want to touch on one thing that interests me, and it brings me to

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:00.560
your interview with Chomsky, because you asked him about, I think, the mind-body problem or

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.280
something or consciousness in general, and he said something to the degree that it didn't really

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.160
interest him that much. He wasn't that interested in consciousness, and I actually, oh sorry, go

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.880
right ahead. Can I continue, I'll touch on that. I was going to say, when he said that,

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.920
I don't want to say I agree with him, but it interests me, it's like an interest of mine,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.200
of course, I mean, it's like a core question, right? Like, what we have access to is this experience,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.000
that's what we have, that's, you know, the big problem, but I do think it's interesting that,

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.840
like, to me, the question is like, what is reality? You know, what is every, you know,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:44.240
everything, and including consciousness, right? And so, I want to hear, I don't hear why it's

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.720
the most interesting problem to you, like, yeah, if you could. I think, so I agree with you, I think

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.520
that fundamentally, I actually care more about what reality is than consciousness. So, the essence,

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:05.200
I'm on the same page, but for me, the issue comes with the fact that you can have a theory of

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:12.240
consciousness that does incorporate reality within it. So, Donald Hoffman, for example,

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.360
a lot of panpsychist theories and certain idealist theories, reality can become part of consciousness.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:25.440
So, because it's the only thing except for reality that you can sort of bring into the topic,

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.120
and the fact that I studied medicine and did a master's in mental health and did psychiatry,

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:35.440
obviously, I came towards it with a bias towards the mind. But overall, I still came more about

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.520
what reality is. And I agree with Om Chomsky, because what he said was that the more important

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.840
question is what is reality? And I agree, because the issue is that we don't know what reality is.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.640
So, physicalist views don't really hold much weight, particularly today when people are showing

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.880
that you don't know what physics really is. I mean, quantum physics says one thing,

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.760
general relativity says another thing. We're struggling to coincide these two theories,

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.880
and then there are physicists out there that are showing that spacetime. I mean, Donald Hoffman

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.080
says this all the time, and it says time is doomed, and then you have to start wondering,

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:21.680
why are they saying it? It's such a weird statement to hear a physicist say spacetime.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.160
That would freak someone out who doesn't take, I mean, if you take physics seriously,

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.160
you take predictions and mathematical calculations seriously, you have to start pondering why would

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.720
someone with such a vast intellect and knowledge base say something so absurd, maybe because it's

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:46.400
true, maybe because it's the truth. Maybe. So, for me, that was a big part of this whole thing.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.960
I started to wonder, okay, if we're not seeing reality for what it is, that's why I went down

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.600
this illusionist route. I was like, okay, why are we so obsessed with this question in the first

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:05.440
place? Because I know David Chalmers calls it the metaproblem of consciousness. The fact that

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.760
we're so obsessed with this problem of understanding consciousness in the first place is the hard

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.080
problem. He first labels it the hard problem, and then he labels it the metaproblem. Why do

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:20.080
you want to know this? What's the problem here? And I started to realize it's because human beings

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.320
have the tendency to put themselves in a slightly higher pedestal than every other species. We've

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.080
done so for many years. In my dissertation, I have one line where I said the same way that Copernicus

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.880
took us out of the center of the solar system, the same way that Darwin took us out of the top of the

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:41.520
food chain, illusionism will do the same for consciousness. It'll take us out of this idea

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:50.720
where we think we have this essence or this Ion Vitale-like soul, for example, that only we have,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.120
only human beings tend to possess. For some reason, we love to put ourselves up there.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.120
And then over time, I did the podcast, and I started to question illusionism, so I couldn't

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.800
say how that happened. It all just keeps changing. I'm so agnostic at this point. I have absolutely

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.760
no idea what I think. It actually can cause mental distress, to be honest.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.520
Still. And I spoke to, I mean, Kurt, Jay Mungle from Theories of Everything, we were discussing

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:24.640
how, I mean, our podcasts are very similar. And we were talking about how the more we investigate

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.760
these topics and these phenomena, the more you start questioning your own mind, reality,

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.400
and it really can get to you. It can drain you. It can almost put you into, it can either make

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.840
someone very schizophrenic, psychotic, in the sense that they start to lose touch with reality.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.440
Psychothermia, for example, is not really a split mind. It's more of a split reality.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:58.000
You start to misinterpret information a lot. So let's say, give you an example, if Donald

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.600
Hoffman comes to me and tells me that spacetime is doomed, and he shows me the physics, teaches me

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.920
why, I mean, I could, at some point, just lose touch with reality altogether. I could, at some

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.800
point, just not care anymore. And what's the point in waking up and going to work anymore, if this

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:20.320
is not, that's a poor example. I feel like I've given you a better one. But the fact is, if someone

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.440
gives you something like that, if someone tells you, look, the sun doesn't really exist. And what

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:32.800
if the sun was my favorite thing to wake up to? It can affect your mind. So we were talking about

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.000
how these theories of everything and these theories of consciousness, in my case, the more you dig

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.920
deep, the more you delve into it, and the more confused you get, the more you lose touch with

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.200
reality. And that's what it's like to be schizophrenic, in a sense, is losing touch with

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.600
reality. The sensory stimulation versus your interpretation of what's going on starts to

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.640
change. And I know Kurt spoke to Carl Friston about this, and I want to ask Carl Friston about

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.880
this as well. He's one of the most cited neuroscientists on the planet, if not the most cited

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.720
neuroscientists on the planet. And he often talks about it as well. I mean, we take in prior

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.200
information and make posterior conclusions regarding what's going to happen. So for example,

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.960
if you're a musician and I'm a painter, you and I both enter a lecture at Brown one day.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.240
The first thing you might notice in the lecture theater is a lecturer's guitar, whereas I might

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.760
notice the artwork on the walls. So the fact that we both enter the same room discussing the same

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.440
thing while heading there with the same intention, the moment we enter, sensory stimulation enters

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.720
our listeners, completely changes the way we'll experience this lecture from the beginning to the

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.640
end, because the prior information dictates the posterior conclusions. So a lot of neuroscience

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.840
is very intriguing in that regard, and starting to show a lot about how we really think. And we

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:58.400
have heuristic adaptations to the world. So we take shortcuts a lot of the time. We don't really

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.320
see anything for what it really is. And the brain has to make assumptions. So we have to guess

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:11.280
estimates, basically, of what's really happening out there, caricatures of the reality. And to me,

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.560
that's a big problem, because that means trying to find the truth in a world that is a caricature

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.080
or a cartoonish version of what reality might be. It's going to be a very difficult task.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.600
Yes, absolutely. Shoot, that's so much done back. I want to,

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.160
well, let's talk, we want to talk about Donald Hoffman a little bit, because you spoke with him.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.480
We actually just chatted the other day, and we're scheduling around two.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.480
We're discussing one of his new papers as well. And he's here to publish it, so I can't chat about

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:57.200
the paper. But ideally, Donald is such a great guy, such a kind. Yeah, I mean, he's so, so

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.120
misinterpreted. And that's something I love about this podcast that I'm doing, is that I get a guy

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:09.280
whose theory is so perhaps outrageous to so many other people, and then try to incorporate that

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.400
theory into and make it understandable to an audience that might have misinterpreted it from

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:21.600
the get go. And so my goal is never to actually debate. The goal is to always try and understand

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:27.840
their point of view. And even if I disagree with it, try my best to actually defend their view

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.680
during the podcast and play the devil's advocate every now and then, but then slowly try and portray

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.920
their view in a way I think I would have liked them to have articulated it to me, and the way I

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.720
can tell that the viewers from their comments want to hear it, because obviously read the comments

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.240
and try and determine, okay, what are people saying when they do an interview with someone else?

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.760
What are they asking? And I try and incorporate those questions as well. So it's very well

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:57.200
researched and refined, and I try and ask very informed questions, not always the best. And

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:03.040
so I mean, we're all learning, we're all trying our best. But with Donald, it was so easy. I mean,

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.720
he's so courteous, he's so kind. He really liked the fact that I did do that, but I took the time

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.640
to try and understand his theory, because he told me after the interview was done, that he'll be

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.880
willing to come on the show whenever he wants, whenever I ask him, which is a really great thing

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:24.800
to know. So his theory is so incredible. So he speaks about how he was doing the calculations,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:31.680
and he decided to calculate what are the odds that if fitness payoffs or trying to determine how

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.360
we would have to survive within the reality we live in, based on the information we receive

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:42.080
by the retina, by the auditory system, proprioception, knowing where we are, etc.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.280
What are the odds that we would see reality for what it is? And he did the calculation, he sat on

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.440
with a bunch of other physicists and mathematicians, and they came up to the amazing, astonishing

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.520
number of zero. Probability of seeing reality for what it is would be zero. And he said,

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.600
he had to sit down, paraphrasing, but he had to sit down and just take a breather. And when he

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:13.920
told me that, I remember also, it's crazy, it's zero. Not even one. Not even point zero one,

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.120
yeah. Well, I think it's the, it approaches zero at the limit or something. It's like,

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.560
if it goes to infinity, if you have an infinite number, it's like zero. It's just a zero point

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.200
zero zero something. And yeah, really, really concerning. I was like, wow. He's not the only

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.320
one. Firstly, I asked one of my friends, who's a physicist, and he heard in South Africa, I asked

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:43.200
him, what are your thoughts on space time? And do you think universe is real? I remember him just

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:50.160
saying, no. And he said it's so, he was just kind of like, no. What do you mean? He said, no, if you

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.680
do the calculations, you sit down, you actually think about it, reality is nothing like what we

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.000
think it is. Then you have to really ask yourself, okay, physicists are really starting to take

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.520
this idea seriously. Here comes a guy who's doing that and then adding another theory to it.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.560
So he's done two things. One is he's sort of shown us that space time is not fundamental

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.880
the way we see it. But he takes it further, which is where a lot of people then disagree with Don.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.800
And a lot of other neuroscientists and philosophers of consciousness disagree with Don,

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.640
is where Don decides to make conscious agents a fundamental aspect of consciousness. And this

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:33.200
is the issue where he has to not fight a battle. The introduction of conscious agents is always

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.120
an assumption that we have to make. I mean, anyone who makes a theory has to start off with a basic

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.960
assumption. And if you introduce conscious agents as the basic assumption, one problem is you

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.520
introduce conscious agents, which is not necessary, but the second problem is you always need two

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.560
conscious agents, according to Don's theory. And that makes it a lot more difficult because now

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:59.840
you've basically doubled the problem. And a lot of even idealists, because Don fundamentally

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.200
conscious realism, which is the name of his theory, is a form of idealism. And a lot of idealists

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.240
disagree fundamentally with the fact that he introduces conscious agents. Yeah, I mean, Don's

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.320
theory, I mean, I'm never going to do justice to it by discussing it. But I can tell you one thing,

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.280
it's far more complicated than what I just said. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I've gone down the rabbit

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.680
hole. I've read most of, I mean, most of his paper, like, yeah, a lot of his papers. I mean,

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.920
I've read his book, and I think about 20 different papers of him and his colleagues,

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.640
Singh, but the others. But she's so it's very intricate. These guys have spent time, years,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:42.720
effort, reducing the wonderful mathematics they have. Yeah. And I did, I mean, I've done a three

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.880
part series on just fitness beats truth. So not even getting yet to I mean, interface theory

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:55.520
perception builds out of that pretty, I think, intuitively, but the conscious agents, what I

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.640
what how I describe it to people sometimes is like, and I'm not sure if Don would say it this way,

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:10.240
but most people assume that consciousness is like a bottom up process that like it forms from the

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.520
neuronal activity in the brain, right? Don's is like top down. Like it starts with consciousness

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.840
and works its way, you know, that way. That's, that's how I think about it. And I'm like, okay,

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:31.440
maybe yeah, I'm, I think I'm super interested in that idea. I'm most, I think I'm most convinced

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.640
by fitness beats truth, because there's a layer, there's something intuitive about it that just

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:44.160
when I first heard that his TED talk, six years, however long ago it was, I was blown away. All

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.480
they could think about for, you know, weeks, telling people about telling my friends, telling

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.160
family, oh my God, this is crazy. You got it. You got to get this. No one was interested.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.880
Especially funny. One of the reasons why I started this channel was that I couldn't find

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.000
anyone in my social circles that cared about this stuff. Same. Same. You too. Okay, cool. We have

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.480
a related thing. It's like, how do you not think this is interesting? Come on, wake up. But

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.840
watch that TED talk. You're talking about the one with the blue shirt. Oh yeah, absolutely. I've

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.840
cut that one up quite a bit for my videos. I've like thrown in a lot of hero shots of him from

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:25.120
like below where it's him in the background. And I think it's incredible. Maybe this is really

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:33.040
first. I think it was, was he called again? I guess, I think he has two books, I think.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.600
The Case Against Reality. Yes, Case Against Reality was the one. Oh yes, I had the hard cover

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:45.360
version. I think it's got a white cover instead of the colorful flower on the paperback version.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.280
But I remember reading that and then I went straight into the rabbit hole. I watched the

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.520
TED talk. I started reading all his publications and just went in depth. So I was super excited

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.240
to chat to him. Yeah, I got to reach out to him. I mean, I will, at some point, reach out to him

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:06.640
and see if he wouldn't mind doing maybe. Yeah, I'll definitely do that. I'll actually direct him to

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:12.320
your three-part series. I'm sure he'll enjoy that. Oh, yes, please do. I would, I mean, dude, that

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:20.160
would be, that would be like a dream. I mean, to chat with him and let him know that I had a chat

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.040
yesterday and I want you to watch something. Tev. Oh my goodness. Thank you so much. That's

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.120
you're kind. I appreciate that a lot. I really do. I really, really do. Because I also, it's so

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.080
clear. I've listened to so many hours of his interviews. So clear. He's a nice guy. You can

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:43.360
tell, like, kind soul, like, yeah. So he emailed me. Yes. I think it was two days ago. He just,

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.680
I mean, this is like months after we last spoke. Well, a couple, probably weeks,

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.280
but it was just out of nowhere email. We just said, Hey, Tev, I've got a guest that I'd like

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.880
for you to possibly speak to. I mean, and he introduced me so much. So amazing. I'm super

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.280
keen to introduce to the audience of MindBodySolution. But I mean, it's one of those small

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.600
things that he does. I mean, just randomly thinking of me, sends me an email and says,

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.840
I think you do a great job at getting her views out. And I was like, yeah, thanks. Thanks, Don. This

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.680
is amazing. Awesome. That's great. So he's really, he's really cool. Yeah, yeah, it's great.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.040
What was that? Very smart. Oh, I'm very intelligent. Absolutely.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.280
Super kind. Yeah. Super kind. Yeah. Very misunderstood as well. Very misunderstood.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.160
That's interesting. I guess whenever I've listened to him, he's in the context of like

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.920
an interviewer who's open to the idea. So I haven't heard, I guess I haven't like

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.800
come up against a lot of the criticisms, but I'm sure there are. I mean, it's an, it's,

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.400
you know, counter to what I also find kind of meta interesting about that, about him doing his career

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:55.200
is like, he kind of found the most potentially the most fit option for his career in terms of like

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.520
going against the grain, you know, broadly, that like everyone was approaching the idea

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.640
of the concept this way, the question this way. Why not go over here where there's a lot of space

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.480
to like grapple with these things. And maybe there's, there's like something really substantial

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:16.160
here. I think that there is. Yeah. I mean, he has that way of thinking because he never really

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.600
wanted, he never really took serious the idea that we could understand everything with the

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.760
perception we currently have. Yeah. And I think it's stuck with him throughout life. And I think

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:30.240
he wanted to figure out why he would think that. But I don't think he was ever prepared for the

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:37.520
outcome when he's maths told him it's zero. Well, it goes to zero. Apparently, he sat down and felt

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.560
faint. He felt, he felt ill. Like it's one of those feelings when you know that gut-wrenching

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.200
feeling when you know someone's in danger, or someone's about to break up with you. It's sort

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:52.880
of that deep sensation that he felt. He describes it very perfectly. And I think, yes, I can imagine

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.920
if you are someone who understands the maths and physics, and you get, and you literally figure

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.000
out for yourself that spacetime is not what you think it is. It's both got to be pretty, pretty

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.600
horrific. Absolutely. And you've gone down the rabbit hole of, because usually when he refers

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.400
to spacetime, Izumi talks about Nima Arkani-Hamed's Amplitahedron. Yeah, that's something I have to

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.880
say. It's very confusing. I mean, it seems like a mapping.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.480
It's the Harvard lectures. I think it's Harvard lectures that he has out online. It's super

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:33.280
difficult to understand. I've tried. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you've got to give it a go every

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.800
few months, space repetition, and then slowly figure it out. Yeah, I think that's a good, I

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.120
agree. It's sort of like you take what you can handle, go to your, go to the edge of your understanding.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.640
And when it's just too incomprehensible, you're just kind of like, I'll return back to it. And

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:55.440
that's the great, great thing about doing that. I'd love to hear too, just a touch on one of my

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:02.000
favorite interviews that you did with Lisa Feldman Barrett. Yeah. Fantastic. I never, I had not come

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.560
across her before. And lovely. I mean, fantastic interview. I really loved it. Yeah, it's really

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:14.080
cool. She's so fun. And we actually, I'm scheduling a lot of round twos at some point.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.840
And because there's so many things we could discuss, and we just don't have the time a

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.840
couple of times. And she's, I remember reading her book as well. And I thought, this woman is so

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.680
intelligent. It's, this is such a great book. And I couldn't, I had to have her. And she was one of

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.360
the first people I thought of putting onto the show. She might have been number one, but Michael

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:42.400
Graziano helped me out during my dissertation. So kind. And he came to me, I mean, he replied

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.280
instantly and helped me out to formulate my theory of consciousness and what I was defending in my

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.280
dissertation and all the things I was doing. So I wanted my first kiss to be someone familiar

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:56.000
to me. Sure. And but she was the second, she was my next option. And right there. And I mean,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.600
we had such a cool chat. She knows so much about particularly the emotional brain and hierarchical

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.480
Bayesian brains. She knows the same thing. Friston works on where you look at the brain as sort of

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:12.400
this Bayesian like organ functioning like a statistical organ is taking in prior information

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:19.120
and constantly producing posterior outcomes. It's very much like that. Then we also have to take

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.400
into account that we've always thought that the brain is similar to the current zeitgeist. So pumps

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.600
back in the day, you think the pump like system, you think that brain is sort of a hydraulic system

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.200
at some point. Every time the science changed or the industrial revolutions changed or the

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:44.000
electrical revolution changed, we slowly changed our theory. So very different. So that's interesting.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.520
Because we do and you can't blame people for using like the most advanced technology to explain

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:58.240
the thing, right? And now, of course, it's algorithmic simulation, computational.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.600
So it makes me think, oh, well, we're not even close, because we're just going to go the next

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.480
thing will be the next thing. And we're just going to keep using that. But what else can you do? I

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.080
mean, you can only do the best you can with the tools that you're disposable. So I don't blame

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:19.760
people for thinking that way either. That's the same reason why I say that it's, it's closer to

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.040
the mind body. So never go together. But too wordy. That's too wordy, closer to yeah.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.520
And who knows, maybe sometimes we're taking a step further away.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:38.400
So difficult to tell. Sure. Sometimes we've had like spirals of revolutions where we thought

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.600
something and then we've come back to it and then we've thought it again and we've come back to it.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:47.360
You know, I mean, there was a time where people considered consciousness to be fundamental. And

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.760
over time it lost its edge. Now it's back. But panpsychists, idealists who think consciousness

01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.240
is the primary reality. So we're going to go through these cycles quite a lot, I think. And

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.520
I think it's cool. I think it keeps the conversation flowing, keeps it going.

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.400
Hopefully we're alive long enough to see some progress being made. But neuroscience is doing a

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:17.200
lot. But it still doesn't help us figure out what reality is. Right. Do you have a

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.480
I know you're agnostic about this stuff, but do you have I know you're at least open to the idea,

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:29.280
but panpsychism, are you you're open to more open than perhaps most doctors, I would assume. But

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.840
do you think it's wrong? Do you think it's wrong?

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.600
Certainly people's arguments very convincing. You've got someone like Philip Goff who can

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.840
can articulate an argument very well. And very difficult to counter argue. It was several points.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:48.640
But I do have certain points where I don't agree. I don't know. I would be less likely to call

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.920
myself a panpsychist. Even though I'm not even though I say I'm agnostic, I'm very much still

01:24:53.920 --> 01:25:05.440
firmly more materialist slash physicalist than I am idealist slash panpsychist. But I'm also not

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:13.280
convinced by the physicalist materialist argument either. Yes, like this is this is where I was

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.560
talking about you start losing your mind. Because I mean, I believe this. And I think this, I think

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:28.400
my phone is real. And I know it's real. Then you think about what is an atom in 99.9% empty space.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.960
And then I'm like, how is this even possible? Right. I'm not really touching the phone.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.360
But I am touching the phone. Yeah. So it's a weird world we live in. It's a strange universe.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:46.560
And I mean, I said this, I mean, you spoke about Tony, there's talk and I mean, I call ourselves

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:53.760
a conscious conglomerate of cells assembled by atoms manufactured by molecules designed by DNA

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:01.040
forged by fusion via stellar supernovae. I mean, this is a crazy story. I've got a couple lines

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.400
there as well. I mean, this was part of my dissertation, organized by organelles,

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:11.440
said this cool alliteration of lines. The story of how we were made is so much more complicated

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.600
than any story we've ever told so far. I mean, when you think about every religious text and the

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:24.400
story of how we were made, I mean, 6,000 years or the Boomba people in Congo, I mean, we Boomba

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:31.200
spits out the earth. I mean, we've got so many different stories. Krishna, my own cultural

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.840
stories, my religious stories. Sure. Then you think about the actual one that science has told us.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:44.400
I mean, stars had to die in order for us, in order for atoms to forge into hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.960
that provide to form helium, really carbon, oxygen, everything nitrogen, and it just goes on.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.640
And slowly they all come back together at some point. And then you find these single-celled

01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:01.280
organisms, I mean, about 4.8 billion years earth, 13.8 billion year light years across universe.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:08.800
I mean, it's quite crazy. It's an incredible story. It is, yeah. And it's so convincing. And yet,

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:15.440
we don't know what dark matter is. We don't know what 99% of this amazing story is. So it's amazing

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.920
and still so incomplete. In fact, it's just incomplete. It's not even, the story is so,

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:28.320
probably so untrue. And but yet to me, it is the story I go with. It is the story I'm most convinced

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:35.520
by. And if I give a lecture on what is reality, it's the story I will tell. So yeah, if you had to

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:41.680
give, put me in a box, I would still be very much physicalist, yet with very counter-intuitive

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:49.920
intuitions about my own intuition. Sure. Open, always open to... It's very, very

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:56.720
agnostic. Yeah. I think that's the way to be. Why be stuck with one model when you, you know, you

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:04.640
have to, you have to accept things at a certain point to live your life, you know, to get by and

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:09.520
do the things you want to do. But then, yeah, just keep your mind open and keep exploring while we

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.480
can. Can I ask what, which guest of yours has been the most surprising?

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:23.360
Oh, that's a very good question. Well, I've had some guests who, I mean, I've been idols of mine.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.520
And I mean, I've loved neuroscience for such a long time. If, like astrophysics, archaeology,

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:35.840
I mean, medicine mostly because I wanted to somehow go into some sort of a neuropsychological

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.520
route. And when I was doing that, I mean, I had all these idols. Lisa was one of them.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:49.760
Noam Chomsky, I've been such a huge fan. Of course, yeah. That's right. It was, to me, that was,

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.520
I felt like I'm interviewing a god. Yeah, he's a legend. I mean, yeah. This is a living legend.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:01.360
He's 93 when I spoke to him. I have another interview I've just done with him that's going

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.880
to come out soon. There'll probably be 94 when it's out. I don't know. It's surreal to know this

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:17.920
guy is 93 and still cognitively engages with as an equal. I mean, it's phenomenal. As someone who

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:23.920
treats geriatric patients all the time, he has such a sharp mind. It's incredible because it shows

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.480
how well he's done over the years to consistently keep his mind up to date and active. And that's

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.680
what happens when you read and learn as much as you do as he's done over the years. I mean,

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:42.880
it's so easy to talk to him. So I think he surprised me the most for sure. I figured it would be

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:48.720
difficult, but it wasn't just floated. I would say the only thing that was was obviously, I mean,

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.480
Noam's getting a little older. So hearing you have to sort of speak a little louder into the

01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:03.040
mic. That makes sense. If I thought more Patricia Churchland or someone I really enjoyed interviewing

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:09.600
as well, because when I was doing my dissertation, I came across a limited materialism and

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.880
her husband Paul Churchland is someone I also really admire. So the two of them are very cool

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:22.880
people who I've also looked up to for a while. There's also Rebecca Goldstein. I mean,

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:29.120
she's really cool. Steven Pink and his wife. I mean, the two of them are living legends.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.560
Both of them. I mean, I'm going to chat to Pinker at some point as well. But it was so cool to have

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.040
her as well, because I'm a huge fan of the both of them separately and together as a couple. I

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:46.080
think they're pretty awesome. And a dynamic duo. Yeah, I mean, there's been so many. There's been

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:50.960
too many of them. And it's growing. I mean, I've got a lot lined up as well. So more is going to come

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:56.800
out. But I've taken a break. I was just on vacation. So if anyone's wondering why I've been

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:01.600
taking a little bit of a break, you deserve it, man. Where'd you go? Now, I just went on holiday

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:08.160
back home to the city of Durban, where my family's from. And yeah, just relaxed for a bit. It wasn't

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:15.440
like a full on trip overseas or anything. It was just, you know, that's great. That's lovely.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.560
And what do you have? I mean, what do you have in store for the next, you know,

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.640
a few months next year for the channel? Like what kind of how often do you come out? Like,

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:28.320
what's your plan for it? Usually, it used to be around two weeks, every two weeks. But because

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.400
of I mean, I mentioned to you while we chatted before coming on the show, I mean, there's so much

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:40.640
political race in South Africa at the moment. They randomly cut the power. You cannot prepare

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.040
yourself. So we could be chatting right now. And they could change the stage of what's called

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.080
low chatting. That means they'll switch off the electricity in the entire country at a random

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:55.200
moment at any point of the day. And that's making it very difficult for me to schedule any interviews

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.680
with guests overseas, because obviously, I don't want to waste their time. And when the day comes,

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.600
because this has happened about five times already, we're about to cancel an interview.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.880
It's very embarrassing, because you've got this guest, you've been looking up to your entire life,

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.560
and you finally have them. And then they just leave the fingertips of your palm and you're like,

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.440
oh, I almost interviewed so and so. I can't believe it. I mean, that happened to Noam and I the

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.320
first time. So Noam and I scheduled an interview, no chatting hit. Noam is so generous, because

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.920
he obviously knows a lot about South African politics. He said, don't worry, I completely

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.960
understand. I know exactly what's going on. And then we just rescheduled. So I mean, we've had our

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.640
number two. So I mean, Noam, you can expect Noam Chomsky one more time. You can expect Donald

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:44.560
Hoffman again. All the guests I've had on, you can possibly expect back. I'm going to try and

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.440
change the format a little at some point. I'm going to try and just update it. Perhaps, I mean,

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:53.120
I've been doing everything on my own at this point. It's my hobby, host, something I've been writing.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:00.640
And I think I need to get together because it is a bit overwhelming. It does, it does get a bit

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:06.560
hard. I think I need to at some point invest more energy and time into building this. Because I

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.080
can tell that there is an audience that wants to engage and want this content. And I think I'm

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.720
going to do my best to provide it. I love it. I live for it at this point. It is my favorite thing to

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.400
do. When I talk to some of these years, I feel like I'm talking to childhood heroes, some of them

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:31.680
are current active heroes. And it's a real, it's actually pretty cool to speak to them as a peer.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.920
I remember watching Noam Chomsky as a child, like legitimately a baby. I feel like I was a three

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.680
year old. Watching an old, huge, you know, the box TV sets, just watching him before it starts

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.960
to cut to that black and white fuzz. I remember he had this one chat with Michel Foucault,

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.280
just a sort of debate. He had one that it was televised here in South Africa. This was the

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:06.080
coolest thing I've ever seen. Foucault versus Chomsky just having a fun debate. And they both

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.000
understand each other. One speaking French, the other one speaking English, and there's no need

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.320
for a translator. They're just, I'm watching the subtitles just thinking, how are these guys so

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:22.880
intelligent? That's like upper, upper class. It's crazy. It's so cool. And you get to talk to them

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:30.880
and engage with them in this modern world. It's amazing. It is. It's so epic. I can only describe

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:36.720
it as awesome. It's just epic. Yeah, very fortunate. Yeah, I mean, even chatting to you right now,

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:41.280
I mean, this is like the content you've curated and created at this point. I mean, one of your

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:47.360
videos has over 300,000 views. That's that's pretty cool. Oh, yeah, the fourth dimension. Yeah. That's

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.320
thank you. Yeah, it does feel good that something kind of clicked, I guess. You can never know what

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:59.360
it's a funny thing is you don't know what's going to what's going to work. That's the nice thing.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.520
You're having such a diverse and different part because it's that you can experiment. I mean,

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.720
your YouTube channel is able to actually do that, which is pretty cool. Yeah,

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.640
topic and go with it. Give some what they want. And I mean, I mean, that's the beauty behind

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:19.200
this platform is we get to showcase content that we love and that hopefully other people love

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.840
because clearly 300,000 views later, thousands of people have to have loved it too.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:30.080
Yeah, it does feel good. It's cool. Yeah, it's hard to wrap your head around just like reality.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:38.560
That is a lot. It is a lot. If you could, I mean, talking about Tesseract and a fourth dimension,

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:43.360
I mean, it is something people want. I mean, I mean, you've it's such a cool topic. It's one of

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.520
those things you want to hear about. It is a cool price. I mean, we're into it nowadays.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.640
Yeah, me too. I mean, I did that one because I wanted to figure it out for myself. I didn't get it.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:00.080
And I just kept on going back to it. And I think it only took me three or four days to put that

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.840
together from soup and nuts. Yeah, it wasn't too long. I mean, I was like, early on, I was like,

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:14.000
really hitting it hard and trying to pump those out quickly. But so that was cool that it just

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.280
kind of resonated with some folks. If you could talk to yourself at the beginning of you making

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.840
the podcast, you know, go back a year or so. I mean, if you give yourself one piece of advice,

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.640
what would it what would it be? Take your time. Don't edit it too much, which I

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.560
beginning I did. And then I stopped. Not very much unfiltered. It's almost just raw. I just

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.880
cut the beginning, cut the end and upload it as it is. I've learned to be less harsh on myself.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.880
Just I don't like the way I've responded. If I go too much, I don't care.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.560
It's more about getting their views out there. It's more about the guests at this point.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:03.120
My best advice would be, take your time. Don't be too greedy for views or likes. It'll grow.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.200
Start low, go slow. And it'll flow. I guess I want to keep going. Love it. Yeah.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.000
But I mean, you're talking about a year ago. So what had happened was I started,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.280
I uploaded four within, I think, a month or two. Sure. And then I completely quit.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.000
And the first four were, I think it was Michael Graziano, Lisa

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:34.240
Feldman and Nicholas Humphrey and Keith Frankish. And then I stopped for months. So I think it was,

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.920
I think I stopped for about six to eight months. I gave up on the podcast.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.600
Why? Because of that impatience. I thought like, is this actually going to get dark? What am I

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:47.600
going to do? I want to do this. And then I came across, I actually sent Kurt a message about this.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.080
I came across Kurt's channel and I remember thinking, this is exactly what I want to talk

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:57.520
about and do. And he seems to be growing this very well. I might as well just continue.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.800
And then so he actually inspired me to continue doing it. And then we've chatted since then.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.160
He even made a video, I remember, where he mentioned me in his podcast.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.120
He said that this is a very, so you made a video about underrated podcasts.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:17.200
Yes, I think that's how I found it. Okay, great. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's how

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.360
I came out. I remember the day he posted that I got a lot of new subscribers and a lot of engaging

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.560
subscribers. It wasn't just subscribers if you subscribe and don't interact. I was getting

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:31.760
engagement, you know, those real comments that people arguing, having full on debates in the

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.640
comments that I started loving that I was like, this is great. So glad I continued because this

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.720
is exactly what I wanted to have. The people not talk about me, but rather talk about the theories

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:48.880
that I'm allowing these people to portray and discuss. So the goal is for them to portray them.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:56.000
So yeah, by the way, Nicholas Humphrey is one of the guests I've had on the show. He's someone I've

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.280
read a lot of his books. I mean, one of his heroes was, I mean, Richard Dawkins, I mean,

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.240
he really loved these people that I loved growing up. And he was one of those people because he was

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:13.280
part of that group of biologists who sort of combined biology with psychology. And so he was

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.840
also someone who I really considered an idol. I have so many of his books on my shelf. I swear

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:24.240
about 10 different titles, 10 different books. I know I've got about 15 to 20 books, I think.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.160
Yeah, I mean, I'm chatting to these people. I mean, Steven Pink, when we have our chat,

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.920
it'll be like me chatting to another hero. I've got about also about 10 plus.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:43.600
So yeah, I mean, advice, just take your time and enjoy the process. And I am at this point. I mean,

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:49.120
I don't rush. If I don't post in a month, I mean, I haven't posted in time a month, and I'm okay.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.520
I'm not really that stressed. I've got videos waiting. I'm not really panicking.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.760
Sure. That's a great thing. I am worried about the viewers and the fact that they might be waiting

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.960
for the next video. And I take that into consideration. So I will post it based on that. But

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.480
pressure to post is no longer. But I think if you can afford getting a team to get

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:18.560
then you probably should take off some of that stress. Because it's a lot of work, editing,

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:23.760
post production, pre production, preparation, getting a logo, getting the podcast together,

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:29.040
trying to find a song, a theme, everything. It's such a it's so much. Yeah, I get it. Yeah,

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.480
you're talking pretty little choir over here. I mean, what would you give me? What's that?

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:41.600
Do you have to give me advice? What would you give me? Make my advice now? Oh, my goodness.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.440
You're a content creator, call us. I mean, at this point, you've done

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.040
an extraordinary work. You can give me advice.

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.000
That's what's so kind of you to say. I think very highly of your work, too.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.080
Huh. I have to think about I don't have anything off the top of my head. Honestly, I mean, if I had

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.560
Hmm. No, I have nothing. Wish if I think I promise if I think of anything, I will email you. I

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.440
promise. I promise if I didn't think comes to mind. Oh, yeah, please do. The bangle is

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.720
grow. We can't. I love when people give me constructive feedback because I mean,

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:23.360
there are times we have noticed things that you notice things you do. You sort of, you might

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:31.200
out loud go. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. That's fine. I think that's okay. Fine. Until you find like five comments

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.360
in the video where you're like, why does this? Why does the host keep humming? And then I'm like,

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.680
guys, you need to relax. It's a conversation. Yeah, calm down. Yeah, yeah, it's totally fine.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:48.320
Calm down and just enjoy the content. Not perfect. Neither are my guests and they don't

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:53.760
claim to be either. So a lot of my effort actually goes into her making sure that the guest

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.320
is taken care of because the last thing I want is for them to say something politically incorrect

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.240
that might get them into trouble, which I think a lot of people try to get for click bait. And

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.240
I think that's something my guests have noticed. And that's why they want to come back is

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.160
you make them feel comfortable, which you've done so very, very well so far. And

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.560
I'm sure you'll continue to. We're going off the rails, baby. We're taking this to crazy town.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.800
Not a good start, but I think one of the things he told me at the end was, I mean,

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.320
where he comes from, it's good to actually go in detail and dissect me. He wants me to. So for

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.400
round two, he actually wants me to play devil's advocate as much as I possibly can. And I said,

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:39.680
okay, I can do that. I choose the peaceful route. Yeah. Yeah. If you want the devil, we can bring

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:46.160
him out. I mean, it's always good to make sure the guest feels comfortable. So my advice would be

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.520
take your time, go slow and make sure the guest is always comfortable. I mean, in this type of

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.080
podcast setting. Yeah, sure. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's as well as what I was trying

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:02.320
to do. So I'm glad that that it came through. So if we can, and also just to like, just reminded

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.960
me something about, I'm so glad you didn't, you came back and that you didn't abandon the channel.

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.800
I mean, yeah, because I get it. I mean, it's probably so many creators go through the same

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.400
thing where you try and you put all of yourself into the work and you see nobody watching it.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.960
And you're like, what is this? But it was, Joseph Campbell said something to the degree of like

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.040
when you found your passion, you find the thing that you want to do.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:37.280
He's like, be willing to suffer for about a decade at least in pursuit of it. Like if you're not

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.560
willing to give yourself over, that's a lot of time. I mean, obviously not everyone has the

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.960
resources at the time, you know, you have to make these trade offs, you know, for your passion,

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:52.400
sometimes with the demands of life and the things that come at you. But on the side, if you just

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.600
keep on going and you love the process, you know, like you were mentioning before,

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.560
all the things that it takes to do this well. And I was talking to somebody last night about this,

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.720
like a content creator, and he said to like, you know, as soon as you can, as you can offload

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:16.160
this stuff, certain parts of this you have to, because you know, you need to be able to focus

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:21.360
your time and attention on other stuff. But I mean, I'm so curious, I like learning all these

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:27.600
things. Like, and I would like, I think it's interesting. It's like, let's go into it, right?

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:34.080
Maybe not now editing stuff as precisely after a while, you're kind of like, God, I wish this was

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:39.360
over. But initially getting in there in the project, like, I get into Final Cut, and I'm moving

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:45.840
stuff around, I get into flow, I lose hours of time, flow right by. And it's like, that's why,

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:51.040
you know, that's one of the reasons why I got into this is to lose yourself in the process. So

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:55.680
I completely agree. I mean, I also came back because that is something I missed, actually,

01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.160
at the point I was thinking about it. I mean, I loved doing it. And why am I letting the fact

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.560
that people aren't enjoying it as much as I thought they would affect the fact that I love

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.760
doing it. So I just came back because I enjoyed so much. I mean, even just just having the

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.080
conversations, even editing it, I love listening to it, because I'm obviously relearning it.

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.960
Reabsorbing the answers the person has given me. And you're right, you get into that flow state

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.280
and you start editing, you can quickly chop, paste. I've made my life so much easier by just

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.480
starting it, cutting the beginning, cutting it and just uploading it raw. So I've taken a lot

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.080
of hassles. Yes, there's something the guest has said that they really didn't like, perhaps

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:41.440
wanted to be cut out, I will go through and cut it out. Other than that, it's very much raw uncut

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:46.720
footage. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll probably do something. I mean, after this, I'll probably do

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.640
something similar in terms of because this is such an enjoyable conversation from my end.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.560
And I hope you hope you enjoyed it as well. And you and I mean, your story too.

01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:01.920
It's just so perfect because you really and you're you're young guy, you're 29 years old,

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:07.120
right? I think you mentioned so and you've come around already, you had this call to adventure,

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:13.200
you, you know, this interest, this passion that's always been there. And then you went into the

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:22.560
chaos of, you know, med school and 30 hour shifts to then doing the TV media hosting stuff,

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:29.360
survivor, you've got, and now you're integrating so much of your different experiences.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:36.000
You know, it's like two or three dimensions of, of things that you're bringing together

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.680
with this podcast. On top of your, you're still practicing medical doctor, right? I mean, on top

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.240
of that, you know, you have, and that's, I think, I think something beautiful too is that your day

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:54.960
to day practice, you know, that work that you do informs the podcast in an angle that you don't

01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:03.440
really get that perspective from so many people. So it's just, you made it so easy for me because

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:07.600
it's a perfect journey, you know, it's coming through. And yet there's still more to come,

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.280
you know, I mean, you're going to go through that process again and again in terms of

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.840
that call, you know, to do even more and integrate even more of your experiences.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.400
You know, thanks so much. I really appreciate it. It's, you're right. It's, it's this podcast is

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.080
pretty much me putting them all together into one part now, finally, being able to put everything

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.440
into one thing that I love so much. And it truly is that one, that place I go to zone out, this is

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.520
my hobby. This is something I love to do. And it, it feels like I'm reading because my favorite

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.160
thing to do is reading books. So when I'm doing a podcast with the guest, I know I've read all

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.440
their books, it feels like I'm reading a book again. And that's pretty, it's pretty cool.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.520
It's the best feeling I can, I can't even explain it. It's just, it's real.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.480
I'm sure it is because yeah, you take that written experience,

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.400
which is like in their psyche, it's like a part of them, you know, it's the patterns that you're

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.200
getting through. And then you can actually engage mind melds, have the discussion.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.920
It's pretty, it's pretty surreal. I must say. It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal.

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:20.320
What a time. What a time to be alive. Do you have anything else you want to say to the audience?

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.720
Anything else you want to ask me? Good luck to you, man. This is going to be a crazy adventure.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.720
This is going to be something you're going to look back and think, I'm so glad I continued.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.280
I'm so glad I changed the format now and then. I said, you said you're planning to do that.

01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:38.880
More you engage and experiment, the better it's going to get. So I just want to say thank you

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.920
for continuing what you're doing. Thanks for the opportunity for chatting to me and finding my

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:49.040
story so compelling, compelling enough for you to interview me. I appreciate it. I had such a great

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.120
time firstly, but more importantly, I think you're going to do a great job. This is going to be,

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.280
this is going to be something I'm going to keep my eye on. Definitely going to probably have you

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:06.000
on the show at some point. Yes, I need time. Absolutely. I think we need to have a nice

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.720
discussion on the mind and why you think reality, why you think we're going to find the truth.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.240
I didn't say that. Did I? I mean, I think we might get close.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.560
True enough, at least. Yeah, just like a. Are you going to change the name? Are you

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.040
actually going to do this? You know what? I've done like a little bit of a the last few weeks,

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.360
kind of a restructure, figuring out the future of the channel. Like obviously this is one step in

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.520
that direction doing. I want to do like one interview a week. It's kind of something I'd

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:41.120
like to do it going into 2023, possibly like one live stream per week where I'm doing like a lecture,

01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:44.800
kind of educational stuff on the fly, but pre-prepared, obviously to a degree.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.440
So I think I'd be like a nice, you know, because you got to get the stuff out, you know,

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.280
you have to create a lot of stuff and put it out there and see what happens. So that's kind of

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:59.120
vaguely what I'm thinking about. And I have a lot of ideas for, yeah, a rebrand new structure,

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:03.120
sort of a new title, sort of, but it's up in the air. I don't know. And one of the cool things about

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.160
YouTube in particular, but also all the social media platforms really is that you can rebrand

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.320
on the fly. You know, you can like really change stuff. You don't want to do it too often. Obviously,

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:18.000
you confuse your audience, but. I've done that. So I, when I started this podcast, it was before

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:25.280
the four episodes uploaded right to that. I started the podcast, I think almost four months or so

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.440
before that, but it was a mental health podcast. I started it where I just did episodes talking

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.840
about mental health in general, just me speaking, no guests. I found myself slowly not really enjoying

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.640
it. I didn't like it. I didn't like what I was doing, was not enjoying the content. I stopped

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:46.960
completely revamped it, brought on guests and decided to make this a two way street

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.560
and have a look back. So I think if you're feeling that urge to change it up, change it up.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:51:00.080
I am. Yeah. This, and this I think is good because very, I mean, I think it's honest criticism of

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.640
my own stuff. So myself in front of the camera, like I had like a teleprompter prescripted, you know,

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:12.400
every word exactly how I wanted, which I wanted for quality control, but obviously scale,

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:17.040
scale wise, it just really reduces your output. And then I watch myself now and it's, I'm so

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.920
stilted and stiff on camera. And I mean, I do think it's tough to read off a teleprompter, like

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:28.080
to do that with like, you know, fun energy, you know, you have years and years of experience

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:34.560
doing stuff like that. We got some training in that. Yeah. Yeah. You got some training. I did

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:40.080
that. So I look back and I'm like, Oh no, I look terrible, but whatever. You know, you got to just

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:46.400
accept it and say, you need to make stuff and mess up. And then you kind of,

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.520
I mean, as you said, it's Joseph Campbell says it all. It's the hero's journey. You were just

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:55.120
starting out. Yeah. It's just still, it's still happening. It's still, you're still figuring

01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.560
it all out. Yeah, we all are. Yeah, absolutely. We're all on this journey and it's going to take

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:06.480
us all to very unique places. And I'm looking forward to see what yours is going to be. Likewise.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.200
Yeah, absolutely. And just for anyone watching, you can find all, I'll link to all your stuff

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:17.040
to have in the description. So please go to his channel, subscribe, engage. It's a great

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.320
audience as well that you have built up and just from the bottom of my heart. I love it when you

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:27.680
guys, I'm saying engage to all the people who are going to watch this. I love it when you have your

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:33.520
debate in the comment section. I read it also. Yeah, me too. Yes. So for you to show us love,

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.400
I mean, whatever you want. Sure. Yeah, especially, you know, at our size, I read every comment. I

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.560
looked through them all. And I think sometimes, yeah, one time, some guy posted like, you got to

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.440
read this, like to everyone else, read the short story about the fourth dimension. And I read it

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:51.840
and it was awesome. He's like, I can't believe you read it. I was like, yeah, I'm a person. I'm

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:56.800
interested in this stuff. We're curious. We want to see what you guys have to say. Yeah, we really,

01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.880
yeah, we really care. And we want to know what you want to hear going forward.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:06.720
Stuctive critiques from the comment section. I mean, you'll have some loyal supporters who will

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.920
give you good feedback. And as your channel grows, I mean, I mean, we're both still growing. I mean,

01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:17.040
as it grows, we're going to find people who are going to support the channel, eventually grow into

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.240
people who will become a part of the channel, because that's what happens with these channels.

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:26.880
They eventually get patrons, they get supporters, loyal customers who come here for a service.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:30.640
And if you do them a disservice, they will let you know.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.360
Yeah, absolutely. But I can tell that you're going to give them a good service. So keep up the

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:44.080
content. I can't wait to keep, continue following your journey. Absolutely.

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:48.080
I mean, I'm going to look forward to watching yours very attentive.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:50.800
Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time.

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:54.640
I had such a great time. Thanks so much for the opportunity and I can't wait to see how this

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.920
comes out. See, me too. Thanks.
