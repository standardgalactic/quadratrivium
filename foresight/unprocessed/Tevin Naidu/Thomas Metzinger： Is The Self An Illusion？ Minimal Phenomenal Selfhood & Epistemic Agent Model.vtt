00:00.000 --> 00:14.560
Thomas, I've been looking forward to interviewing you for such a long time. I mean, it's an

00:14.560 --> 00:18.480
absolute honor and privilege, first of all. And I think the best way to start a podcast with you

00:18.480 --> 00:24.720
would be to just go straight into the deep end. Let's start with two definitions. And maybe we

00:24.720 --> 00:29.280
can differentiate between these two concepts, talk about the similarities. But let's define

00:29.360 --> 00:37.840
what consciousness is to you and what the self is. Right. So consciousness is a folk

00:37.840 --> 00:45.520
psychological umbrella term. Nobody knows what it means. You can always tell when neuroscientists

00:45.520 --> 00:49.440
start their papers and they want to make some bold claims and they don't know what to say in

00:49.440 --> 00:55.600
the opening paragraph. They always mumble something about what it is like and Tom Nagel.

00:56.320 --> 01:02.720
And nobody knows what that actually means, what it is like, what that is,

01:03.840 --> 01:15.360
what is to be explained there. A lot of people like to talk about qualia and 95% of them wouldn't

01:15.360 --> 01:25.120
be able to say what that is, where it comes from. I think qualia don't exist. So one part,

01:25.120 --> 01:31.920
as you know, I've been in that consciousness community for three, four decades of my academic

01:31.920 --> 01:37.920
life. I'm one of the people who founded the association for the scientific study of consciousness.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.480
And there's a persisting problem. There are naturalist philosophers like myself

01:45.600 --> 01:53.280
who think that naturalism is not an ideology, but a research program. And that research program

01:53.280 --> 02:01.040
consists in reformulating classical philosophical questions about consciousness in a way so that

02:01.040 --> 02:07.680
they become tractable for the empirical sciences. So there's a continuity. It's not an ideology

02:07.680 --> 02:13.680
because naturalist philosophers would be completely open if exactly empirical research

02:13.680 --> 02:21.200
shows there is something that cannot be explained. So if you're an anti-reductionist, if you believe

02:21.200 --> 02:27.360
there is something that is mysterious about consciousness and unexplainable in principle,

02:29.360 --> 02:36.000
then you will have to become a naturalist because it's your goal to describe that

02:36.880 --> 02:43.200
or can't be explained as precisely as possible. And you want to make progress. You want to

02:43.200 --> 02:48.720
describe that, what is unexplainable, more precisely than it has ever been described

02:49.440 --> 02:54.240
in the history before. So if you're an anti-reductionist, you have to become a

02:54.240 --> 03:01.360
neuro-computational modeler, a neuroscientist, and you have to follow the naturalist program.

03:02.720 --> 03:09.120
The persisting problem is we don't know what the explanation is. If you think about it

03:09.920 --> 03:19.120
more carefully, nobody can really say what it is that needs to be explained. Here's an example

03:19.120 --> 03:29.600
from our own life. So like 24 years ago, I spent a wonderful year at UC San Diego with the Church

03:29.680 --> 03:39.600
Learns. And on a few occasions, I went to lunch in the faculty club with Francis Crick,

03:40.480 --> 03:47.200
one of the most famous Nobel laureates we ever had. And he wanted to crack the problem of

03:47.200 --> 03:53.440
consciousness after having cracked a problem of life. And I still remember one conversation

03:53.440 --> 04:00.000
which got out of hand where I basically said, yes, but Francis, what is it that you want to

04:00.000 --> 04:06.640
explain? And then he said, in the forthcoming book, I've described that conversation. You know,

04:06.640 --> 04:12.640
you philosophers, you've had more than 2000 years time. I'll tell you what, if you want to make a

04:12.640 --> 04:19.760
contribution, the best thing would be you just shut up. We're going to kill this thing in neuroscience

04:19.840 --> 04:25.040
in the next two decades. And I said, yeah, that's great. I'm all for it. I'm a naturalist,

04:25.600 --> 04:30.960
founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness. What is it that you're trying to

04:30.960 --> 04:39.520
explain? Then he mumbled something about that for strategic reasons. In the early phases of a

04:39.520 --> 04:47.360
research program, it's not advisable to have two narrow definitions of your explanandum. I said,

04:47.360 --> 04:52.960
yeah, of course, I understand you don't want to have overfitting philosophical models of

04:52.960 --> 04:59.680
consciousness and all that nonsense. But it just, tell me, what is it that you want to explain?

04:59.680 --> 05:08.960
And then he got really angry at me. You have this to this very day, whole people, whole groups of

05:08.960 --> 05:15.760
neuroscientists have made a career in the neuroscience of consciousness. And there has been great

05:15.840 --> 05:23.280
programs. But nobody can say what exactly it is they're trying to explain. And so that's,

05:23.840 --> 05:32.400
we have an ill-defined folk psychological term consciousness, which has a long history.

05:33.200 --> 05:41.200
For instance, it has a Latin history over centuries, conscientia. It has Greek precursors,

05:41.200 --> 05:47.200
zenedesis. There are a lot of connotations in different cultures and contexts, and it's

05:48.000 --> 05:54.480
not quite clear what we mean. So there's a job for philosophers in this research community,

05:55.360 --> 06:02.800
still laying conceptual foundations. Now you asked about the self? That was your second question?

06:03.280 --> 06:11.920
No such thing. You know me. I just had, you have to cut this out.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.880
I got two messengers telling me I have a recording with you in 10 minutes.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.360
Let me just. I was wondering what that sound was actually. I thought it was a frog.

06:27.600 --> 06:37.280
Everything now. Okay. So what's the self? You don't have one. You couldn't have one.

06:38.080 --> 06:46.080
The most naive way of approaching it is that people talk about their self. But this couldn't

06:46.080 --> 06:53.760
be the case, because then it would be something that you own. You have an ownership relationship

06:53.760 --> 06:59.840
to that self. This couldn't be the case. And that already shows how confused things get.

07:00.560 --> 07:09.520
If there is a self in a certain way, you are it, there must be an identity. And I'm all okay

07:10.240 --> 07:16.960
with people saying, for instance, okay, then let's call what you call the phenomenal self model

07:16.960 --> 07:27.280
in the brain, the self in future, in the future. And if you want to change our rules for speaking

07:27.280 --> 07:35.360
about the self in that way, in a scientifically grounded way, you can do this. But then it means

07:35.360 --> 07:41.680
that is something that is highly intermittent, that is super unstable during REM sleep,

07:42.240 --> 07:51.520
dreaming phases, that doesn't exist during non REM sleep. It is something that has multiple layers,

07:51.520 --> 07:59.760
is highly incoherent over time. And most of all, not something that, as German philosophers would

07:59.760 --> 08:08.880
say, hold itself in existence by itself. I think the proper English term would be ontological

08:08.880 --> 08:17.840
self subsistence. So selves are not elementary building blocks, I think, of the universe,

08:18.480 --> 08:26.480
or substances in the classical metaphysical sense of a substance, or some intrinsic essence or something.

08:27.920 --> 08:34.480
They are high level phenomena. If you want to treat whole biological organisms as selves,

08:35.440 --> 08:42.400
then they are pretty impermanent high level phenomena. If you want to just speak of the

08:42.400 --> 08:51.520
experience of self consciousness, which as I think locally supervenes on brain properties,

08:52.240 --> 08:59.600
at one and the same moment, then it is an even more abstract high level features some

08:59.680 --> 09:06.800
computational property of a biological nervous system. If we want to talk like that, that's

09:06.800 --> 09:15.360
fine with me. But that's of course, never what we meant by self. Yeah, when I read ego tunnel and

09:15.360 --> 09:20.960
being no one, I remember just thinking that this is pretty much where my work was aligning to. At

09:20.960 --> 09:24.880
that point, I remember thinking this is perfect for my dissertation. I remember thinking there's

09:24.880 --> 09:29.920
so many chunks, I could possibly quote out of this out of these books. And I did, I remember

09:30.800 --> 09:36.240
referencing you and taking a lot of your work in, I mean, you specifically you delved right into the

09:36.240 --> 09:41.120
psychiatric phenomenon, and you spoke about every aspect of consciousness, the unity,

09:41.120 --> 09:47.280
transparency, self-perspectivalness, temporality, first person and third person experience.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.400
When you think about these concepts and how philosophers have debated this over time,

09:52.480 --> 09:58.240
the story of the mind body problem. What would your story, if you had to tell someone the story

09:58.240 --> 10:02.640
of the mind body problem, what story would you tell people? The reason why I'm asking this Thomas

10:02.640 --> 10:06.720
is because I find that it's interesting to see how somebody has come to understand this problem

10:06.720 --> 10:11.680
over the years, and how it evolved their own view of what consciousness is today.

10:12.080 --> 10:19.600
Well, first of all, I think, and that is something that is

10:20.320 --> 10:26.400
frequently overlooked, is that there is a pre-theoretical mind body problem,

10:26.400 --> 10:35.920
and a pre-philosophical mind body problem in which all of us can feel, which people have

10:35.920 --> 10:43.360
held over the centuries in different cultures. Usually one would say the modern history of

10:43.360 --> 10:48.960
the mind body debate starts 350 years ago with Descartes and substance dualism,

10:49.680 --> 10:58.160
but of course there are deep historical roots also in other cultures. But what makes Descartes'

10:58.240 --> 11:06.080
view so very appealing to beings like us is actually, I think, a feature of our naturally

11:06.080 --> 11:15.600
evolved self-model in the brain. And I'll tell you an anecdote to illustrate this,

11:16.480 --> 11:24.400
the history of the mind body problem in my own life. I thought in about the fifth semester,

11:24.400 --> 11:29.920
I thought philosophy was absurd. I thought these professors should be different than professors

11:29.920 --> 11:40.160
of chemistry, so they should be wise and impressive. And I found them very narcissistic and pretentious

11:40.160 --> 11:49.040
as a young guy, and I thought this was a very absurd academic enterprise. And then I participated

11:49.120 --> 11:59.920
in a seminar where we looked at two lesser-known works by Descartes, The Treatise on Men, Lom,

12:01.280 --> 12:08.160
and The Passions of the Soul. And there was a young lecturer at that time who made me see

12:08.160 --> 12:15.200
something for the first time. So we looked very carefully at the passages where Descartes says,

12:16.080 --> 12:26.960
in the pineal gland, that's where the soul interacts with the brain. And then he pointed

12:26.960 --> 12:35.200
something out. He said, if mental entities have no spatial properties, as Descartes says, and only

12:35.200 --> 12:43.520
bodies, corporeal entities, are divisible in space and have spatial properties, then it follows

12:43.600 --> 12:52.720
that there cannot be a place in the brain where the soul interacts with the physical body. That

12:53.440 --> 13:02.960
is a completely wrong question, a wrong research program. Where is the locus of interaction between

13:02.960 --> 13:11.040
mind and matter? It cannot be like this. If one of the two principles only has properties in time,

13:11.680 --> 13:17.440
the mind unfolds in time, but no spatial properties. And that's when I got hope.

13:18.720 --> 13:25.840
That's when I had the feeling as a young man, that is a theoretical problem that is worth of my

13:25.840 --> 13:32.640
attention. Because at the same time, 1977, there was Popper and Eklis, the self and its brain,

13:33.280 --> 13:40.640
and they do exactly the same thing with their theory of three worlds. And they have this

13:40.640 --> 13:47.760
speculative Nobel laureate, John Eklis, the speculative model of the liaison brain.

13:49.120 --> 13:54.800
Today, this would be the minimally sufficient neural correlate of consciousness. And the idea is

13:54.800 --> 14:05.040
that is where it is. Now, if it's really non-spatial, this could be the case. But then I started thinking

14:05.040 --> 14:13.120
about the human self. And I realized that for all of us, there are some parts in my phenomenology,

14:14.080 --> 14:23.200
my robust sense of selfhood, which are spatial, my limb movements, my gut feelings, my visor

14:23.200 --> 14:34.320
spatial perspective, and everything. And other things are really not located in the body image.

14:35.120 --> 14:42.800
My thoughts, emotions are very interesting. Moods are very interesting. I'll just start,

14:42.800 --> 14:50.400
if one takes one's own conscious experience, seriously, I make the following claim, if one

14:50.400 --> 14:58.480
really doesn't talk like one has learned to talk, if you see, say, a top down psychophysical interaction,

14:58.480 --> 15:07.360
I decide to lift my hand and I lift my hand. I can observe something I could call the decision.

15:08.480 --> 15:14.960
And I feel my arm moving. But what I do not observe is the actual causal link.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.760
We talk like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know my decisions, my intentions cause my behavior.

15:22.320 --> 15:28.560
We have grown up in this language game. But is our phenomenology really like this?

15:29.840 --> 15:39.920
Or if somebody pinches my arm and I feel a pain? Is there a phenomenology of upward causation,

15:39.920 --> 15:48.720
really? I think there's a gap. And I have, as you know, a long story to tell that the human

15:48.720 --> 15:55.120
self model evolved because we had to jump from branch to branch and run away from predators.

15:55.920 --> 16:02.800
And in the beginning, it was important to navigate and control a body as a whole to integrate

16:02.800 --> 16:10.640
our sensory perceptions, all spatial things. Then we evolved social properties, language,

16:10.640 --> 16:17.200
abstract representations, which were not really grounded in that body image anymore.

16:18.720 --> 16:27.520
And that is why what I mean by the pre philosophical mind body problem, before we start even to think

16:27.520 --> 16:36.240
about it, we can feel it beings like us beings on another planet with another evolutionary history

16:36.240 --> 16:44.320
might not have that kind of intuitive dissonance, that intuitive mind body problem. But what is

16:44.320 --> 16:55.920
happening? Other beings might not be able to imagine their mind as independently flying away,

16:55.920 --> 17:02.800
floating in somewhere after their body has died. But for us, we have these

17:04.320 --> 17:10.960
philosophers also say modal intuitions, intuitions about what is possible and what is necessary.

17:11.760 --> 17:18.320
And for us, it seems to come necessary that my mental processes could somehow

17:20.320 --> 17:25.760
go on without body perception of any kind of space spatial or sensory perception.

17:27.280 --> 17:35.040
And these, these intuitions are grounded, I say, in our biological evolution in computational

17:35.040 --> 17:42.880
properties in our brain, and they make Cartesian intuitions. There is something that doesn't belong

17:42.880 --> 17:51.840
to that animal machine body. They're so plausible. And if I read Descartes, now, I mean, I don't

17:51.840 --> 18:00.160
believe it. But Descartes still has a strong appeal to me. And that is because it directly

18:01.120 --> 18:07.840
plays to a representational divide in my phenomenal self model. That's would be my terminology to explain

18:07.840 --> 18:15.680
it. If that is true, many philosophical problems might actually have phenomenological anchors,

18:16.800 --> 18:26.320
might actually look like a deep and important problem to beings like us, because they are anchored

18:26.560 --> 18:31.760
in the model of reality that we have evolved on the history of this on the surface of this

18:31.760 --> 18:38.160
planet with these brains. So that's the pre philosophical mind body problem. And then

18:39.200 --> 18:48.240
we have, of course, a century long history, as you know too well. And I think one important

18:49.040 --> 18:57.920
thing to understand the problem of consciousness is not one problem. It's a bundle of theoretical

18:57.920 --> 19:05.840
issues and a bundle of more empirical relations. The mind body problem equally is not one. Okay,

19:05.840 --> 19:12.480
you can say what is the causal and interaction or what is the metaphysical interpretation of

19:12.480 --> 19:17.440
correlation data between brain and mind or something like that. But there's a whole

19:18.560 --> 19:27.360
how do you say a spectrum of theoretical issues. Some are very old. Like, what is the mechanism

19:27.360 --> 19:35.440
of interaction? Some are very young. For instance, Daniel Dennett, I think has done us all a great

19:35.440 --> 19:43.280
service in his today rather unknown 1969 book content and consciousness to introduce this

19:43.280 --> 19:50.800
distinction between sub personal properties and personal properties beings like us can have. And

19:50.800 --> 19:59.280
then there's this whole Donald Davidson story and so on. In the old debate, that personal level

19:59.280 --> 20:06.800
properties like the having of beliefs, the having of intentions and desires can in principle,

20:06.880 --> 20:13.760
in principle, for conceptual reasons, never be translated down, reduced to sub personal

20:14.640 --> 20:22.000
theoretical entities in the brain or so. So you have multiple distinctions sub personal personal.

20:23.840 --> 20:30.160
What what is causal? What is the most rational metaphysical interpretation of the empirical

20:30.160 --> 20:39.200
data we have. And now to come back to you and psychiatry and being no one as you know, I mean,

20:39.200 --> 20:43.440
for me, it's a strange experience that you ask about this because this was another guy.

20:44.320 --> 20:49.200
This was a quarter century ago, right? And then at some point the difference in how it's changed

20:49.200 --> 20:57.920
over time. Yeah, you know, now I it is a very many authors know this, you know, now I will get

20:58.720 --> 21:06.240
a very substantial and angry email from some Chinese PhD student. But it was

21:07.520 --> 21:16.080
25 years ago, when I sat in the eighth floor of the humanities building in at UC San Diego,

21:16.080 --> 21:20.720
opposite to the office of Paul Churchlet and wrote this. And now I get all the heat

21:21.680 --> 21:24.880
because because people

21:27.760 --> 21:33.680
actually can work with it. And one of my goals was I think philosophers should do that

21:35.520 --> 21:42.960
is to develop conceptual instruments and tools that people in other disciplines can use.

21:43.920 --> 21:49.600
So if a psychiatrist and just like you, I have interacted with psychiatrists a lot during

21:49.600 --> 21:57.600
certain phases of my career comes and says, that is really useful. I can use that in my own research

21:57.600 --> 22:03.520
that I don't understand that that's nonsensical. But this idea is really helpful.

22:04.720 --> 22:10.880
Then I've made a contribution, you know, in interdisciplinary research. And the

22:10.880 --> 22:18.240
psychiatric case studies in being no one, which I used, which are of course now outdated and one

22:18.240 --> 22:25.360
could do many much more precise stuff there than I did 25 years ago. There's also now

22:25.360 --> 22:36.160
computational psychiatry, for instance. So I wanted just to show what is not necessary.

22:37.360 --> 22:44.480
So, you know, to have the more fine grained representational architecture of the conscious

22:44.480 --> 22:53.280
self. Because I realized many philosophers at that time, excellent analytical armchair

22:53.280 --> 23:00.880
philosophers, just didn't know what is possible for a human mind, like, I don't know,

23:00.880 --> 23:07.280
quotas in Rome or something like that. How does it play a role in your own work?

23:07.600 --> 23:17.360
So here, are you a psychiatrically informed philosopher or a philosophically informed doctor?

23:17.840 --> 23:23.920
So I was, there was a time where I was, I thought of being a psychiatrist. So I'm currently just a

23:23.920 --> 23:28.960
medical doctor with a master's in philosophy. But the focus of the masters was in the philosophy

23:28.960 --> 23:35.360
and ethics of mental health. So it was primarily while I was working in psychiatry and doing this

23:35.360 --> 23:41.760
masters. And it was interesting because the textbook was the Oxford textbook and handbook

23:41.760 --> 23:48.640
of philosophy of psychiatry. And that's a very important thing. So it was philosophers of mind

23:48.640 --> 23:53.440
should be uniquely intrigued by psychiatry, the same way psychiatrists should be uniquely intrigued

23:53.440 --> 23:58.240
for what philosophers of mind have to say. And I think that's what drew me to your work in the

23:58.240 --> 24:02.560
first place was because you, you were not just taking philosophical arguments and discussing

24:02.560 --> 24:08.720
these concepts, but you were trying to practically apply these to the real world. And, and I think

24:08.720 --> 24:12.000
that's what you're currently doing with your latest book as well. You're trying to find ways

24:12.000 --> 24:17.920
to apply these, which we'll definitely touch on. But for me personally, I think I love both. I love

24:17.920 --> 24:22.880
the, I love the search for these answers, the philosophical journey, I would say, as well as

24:22.880 --> 24:28.160
the way this would impact my own clinical decision making, because, yeah, because all these first

24:28.160 --> 24:32.960
person's subjective experiences matter when it comes to treating patients who are telling me

24:32.960 --> 24:38.800
third person objective stories. And I think that's very fundamental. And you touch on that

24:38.800 --> 24:43.200
beautifully. I mean, the, oh, just by the way, Thomas, I just wanted to ask, because you spoke

24:43.200 --> 24:48.160
about Francis Crick before I forget about this. And the big discussion you guys had, what did you

24:48.160 --> 24:54.160
think of David Chalmers and Christoph Cox final end to the, to the whole debate?

24:54.480 --> 25:03.840
So I didn't go there this year, because I sensed this might be turned into a big self marketing

25:03.840 --> 25:15.200
show there. But I was of course, the guy who organized ASSC two, this was ASSC 26, and firmly

25:15.200 --> 25:22.320
put the society on a map with a huge conference in Bremen. And that is where Christoph and Dave

25:22.400 --> 25:30.240
actually created that wager that bet they made over a beer. And that was where it was actually

25:30.240 --> 25:37.840
made. I still remember it was a horrible experience. I worked practically a whole year of my life on

25:37.840 --> 25:46.080
that conference with 400 people. And then the computer science department had the famous Easter

25:46.080 --> 25:52.720
crash. And everything was down for three weeks. And we had lost all registration data. So we didn't

25:52.720 --> 26:00.480
know who had paid. We didn't know who had reserved a room for what time. So there were large groups

26:00.480 --> 26:06.880
of students standing when people were streaming into town and faking it and saying, Oh, what's your

26:06.960 --> 26:17.520
name, Dr. Naidu? You had tell me again, because we just didn't know how many bookings we had,

26:17.520 --> 26:26.880
and payments and everything. And I also know that I had 60,000 marks at the time to organize the

26:26.880 --> 26:39.120
conference. And it cost me 110,000. And if that was not a famous, now deceased old neuroscientist

26:39.120 --> 26:47.120
who came to my rescue afterwards, I would have been in big trouble. So this was when Dave and

26:47.120 --> 26:55.440
Christoph were still young guys, and I'm making this. Yeah, so I haven't been there.

26:58.880 --> 27:06.960
Many people think, you know, I have edited this 2000 book with the MIT Press Nora correlates of

27:06.960 --> 27:15.120
consciousness, which reflects some contributions to that conference. And many people today think,

27:15.200 --> 27:21.120
I've heard Julia Tononi tell me this the last time that the NCC approach is basically

27:22.400 --> 27:28.640
failed now. And that we have an enormous amount of data, of course, about neural correlates.

27:29.280 --> 27:36.800
But it hasn't generated the theoretical breakthrough. And now, of course, a lot of the smartest young

27:36.800 --> 27:44.720
people are giving a lot of work and effort into computational modeling, using cough,

27:44.720 --> 27:54.480
resistance, mathematical instruments. And I think this is where we might go in the future,

27:54.480 --> 28:04.480
which, by the way, changes things for young philosophers. When I grew up, I got a lot of

28:04.480 --> 28:10.880
trouble with the philosophical establishment, because I said, and I created young people like

28:10.880 --> 28:16.720
this, you have to be good in one area in philosophy, and you need an interdisciplinary

28:16.720 --> 28:23.360
photo, just as you have psychiatry. There must be one area in neuroscience, like color vision or

28:23.360 --> 28:30.160
dreaming. That's your second hobby. And where you're absolutely up to speed in the empirical

28:30.160 --> 28:38.160
literature, then it gets interesting. Or you go have something in AI, or in evolutionary biology,

28:38.160 --> 28:46.160
or in animal consciousness. And a large part of the philosophical establishment didn't want this,

28:46.160 --> 28:52.960
and I could have made a much better career if I hadn't said this. So now things have changed.

28:52.960 --> 29:03.120
If you today say a young philosopher who wants to do philosophy of mind should have one foot in

29:03.120 --> 29:10.480
neuroscience, it's almost a bit outdated. They should have a diploma in mathematics.

29:12.560 --> 29:20.240
If the journey goes on, as I predict it does, using the free energy principle and the conceptual

29:20.240 --> 29:28.080
tools involved, then it simply excludes a lot of the best young philosophers who don't have this

29:28.080 --> 29:36.560
math, just as I don't have it at their fingertips, from the debate. If that's where the edge of research

29:36.560 --> 29:46.080
moves to, this is also a sociological event. Because then, you know, when I was young, many

29:46.080 --> 29:52.640
German philosophers were trying to hide the fact that they could not participate in international

29:52.640 --> 29:58.880
debates because their English wasn't good enough. But now, it could be that you can't participate

29:58.880 --> 30:06.080
because your math isn't good enough. And this might also apply to many psychiatrists. If this

30:06.080 --> 30:15.760
project of computational psychiatry goes through, I'm not going to say anything about

30:15.760 --> 30:23.200
psychoanalysis. I'm going to be polite, but a lot of this stuff is going to look

30:24.960 --> 30:31.600
like some outdated New Age fantasies or something like this, some esotericism. And I must say,

30:32.560 --> 30:39.120
in philosophy of psychiatry, tell me what your experience is. But I've had conflicts

30:40.000 --> 30:48.960
with German psychiatrists who are very well-meaning, because there is this branch of phenomenological

30:48.960 --> 31:01.120
psychiatry where people actually are on the theory level of 1940, Ludwig Binswanger, that kind of thing.

31:01.680 --> 31:07.840
That's where they stopped thinking about philosophy and theory. And then their practice

31:07.840 --> 31:15.040
a whole lot. And if they have a certain subgroup, you tell me if this is the same in South Africa.

31:16.320 --> 31:25.040
And psychiatrists have an anti-reductionist ideology. And that's very strong for them. It goes

31:26.000 --> 31:31.680
together with pop phenomenology. And I think that's all fine. They should believe that.

31:32.240 --> 31:39.040
But what I don't like, if somebody acts out their own ideology on suffering people,

31:39.040 --> 31:46.480
on people who have a real serious problem, in these cases, we need just the best evidence-based

31:46.480 --> 31:53.680
theories we have. And we have to be super rational. But I found in my research career in

31:53.680 --> 32:00.720
interacting with psychiatrists, then many of them are a little ideology-driven. And

32:03.040 --> 32:10.480
are neither well-informed about empirical facts in neuropsychology or neuroscience,

32:11.360 --> 32:17.440
nor do they know anything about current debates in philosophy. Would something like this be true

32:17.440 --> 32:21.760
in the South Africa? I think yes, very much so. I think especially because we saw

32:21.760 --> 32:25.920
culturally diverse here in South Africa that you tend to notice when someone

32:25.920 --> 32:29.920
from a completely different background is treating a patient who completely does not

32:29.920 --> 32:34.880
understand what this person is talking about. And you see these culture clashes sort of playing

32:34.880 --> 32:41.520
a big role in how it's very miscommunicated constantly. And the person who comes from their

32:41.520 --> 32:46.560
own different culture sort of indoctrinates the other person or almost talks down to them.

32:46.560 --> 32:52.080
If it's, let's say, a doctor who's well-educated, a psychiatrist who feels superior and talks to

32:52.080 --> 32:56.880
someone who, let's say, grew up on a farm in the middle of a region of South Africa that's

32:57.440 --> 33:04.880
very rural and non-educated. And you can tell the sort of ideologies that this person has

33:04.880 --> 33:08.800
and is placing on this person. Perhaps someone of African culture and descent who

33:08.800 --> 33:14.960
believes in completely different gods, completely different ways of living, values clash completely.

33:14.960 --> 33:20.480
And it's opening up certain spheres of philosophical debate. There's one known as

33:21.840 --> 33:27.200
African values-based practice where you have to sort of incorporate values and understand

33:27.200 --> 33:33.200
that even when we treat patients, implicitly, there's normativity applied to everything we

33:33.200 --> 33:38.560
do on a day-to-day basis. And we can never forget this. And psychiatrists often forget this. And

33:38.560 --> 33:42.560
it was a part of that. When I learned about this, I realized the blurry lines between

33:43.040 --> 33:47.280
when you dissect psychiatry philosophically, it really does change the way you perceive the

33:47.280 --> 33:52.560
field altogether. And not you can actually trust neural correlates of consciousness the way we

33:52.560 --> 33:58.240
talk about it or not. And how we should actually apply this knowledge that we have. Because most

33:58.240 --> 34:02.640
of the time, we don't really even know the difference between physical illness, bodily illness,

34:02.640 --> 34:09.040
and mental illness, and the direct or indirect links they really have. And that makes it very

34:09.040 --> 34:17.760
tough on this side as well. Yes, you know, at first, where I first saw something, when I studied

34:19.520 --> 34:27.200
philosophy, it was even if you wanted to get women, it was very important to do something

34:27.200 --> 34:33.280
with psychoanalysis and Marxism. That was the hottest and the coolest stuff that's where all

34:33.280 --> 34:43.600
the good-looking women were. And I realized that it's a bit like poetry, but the psychoanalysis,

34:43.600 --> 34:50.240
but I don't know what is wrong with it. And then then once in passing, just said this,

34:50.240 --> 34:56.000
we talked about personal level properties and sub-personal level properties. And he said,

34:56.000 --> 35:05.360
if you introduce little persons in the brain or somewhere to explain personal level properties,

35:05.360 --> 35:10.400
you explain nothing, you've just explained them uncally. And then he suddenly said, well,

35:10.400 --> 35:17.040
the super ego and the id, these are actually, they don't explain anything because they are

35:17.040 --> 35:23.680
themselves described as personal level properties. And that was sometimes in your life, somebody just

35:23.680 --> 35:31.360
says that in passing. And it really opens a perspective to your life. That's when I understood

35:31.360 --> 35:40.400
that this is really also not open to improvement, to empirical improvement. But to this day,

35:40.400 --> 35:48.720
I don't know about South Africa, but in Germany, in Europe, I mean, it's firmly established psychoanalysis

35:48.800 --> 35:56.000
as a completely false theory of the human mind guides therapeutic action. And

35:58.240 --> 36:04.720
I've heard psychiatrist friends of mine say, well, as long as you can make a living and earn

36:04.720 --> 36:14.240
money with it, that long, you will have that. And so psychiatry is actually an interesting case

36:14.240 --> 36:21.360
where people have, they must have theories of mind or theory of what the conscious mind is.

36:22.000 --> 36:29.280
And they try to heal, they try to alleviate suffering. And then there are other people in

36:29.280 --> 36:36.720
philosophy who have also theories of mind, who are absolutely clueless. If you tell them, yeah,

36:36.720 --> 36:42.720
but you know, you can consciously experience thoughts without ownership. It's not necessary.

36:42.960 --> 36:51.440
That there is a thinking cell. I mean, I know times where colleagues said this is conceptually

36:51.440 --> 36:59.680
excluded. This cannot be the case in this world. So many old fashioned philosophers have these

36:59.680 --> 37:09.520
a priori assumptions about what is necessary in the human mind. And then nobody listens anymore,

37:09.520 --> 37:16.640
because now we have so many empirical data will show that it can be otherwise. But then again,

37:16.640 --> 37:25.600
psychiatrists, this has to be said, who also have a very high workload in their everyday life,

37:26.160 --> 37:33.360
and are under pressure. And you cannot really demand from them to read peer reviewed papers

37:33.360 --> 37:39.760
from analytical philosophy of mind. It's a difficult situation. It needs these conceptual

37:39.760 --> 37:46.560
instruments. But they are in this everyday, you know, they have to make decisions.

37:48.240 --> 37:56.400
Under time pressure. And with great suffering. At the time when I was writing also in German

37:56.400 --> 38:02.880
and speaking about the self model, I often had patients contacting me, which was often a

38:02.880 --> 38:13.360
harrowing experience. So something that's a time back. I had schizophrenics find me out

38:14.800 --> 38:21.200
privately or their relatives. And they were seriously convinced they had a philosophical

38:21.200 --> 38:28.560
problem. You know, they read the ego tunnel. I see. And then I said, no, please listen to me,

38:29.120 --> 38:36.000
you have to go into treatment. 1% of the world population have this. And then they say, no,

38:36.000 --> 38:41.600
no, no, you don't understand. I just want to understand the self model. I say, no, please.

38:44.000 --> 38:52.240
Is there a relative in the room? And I've had a lot of moving experience. For instance, one time,

38:53.120 --> 39:00.480
I was invited to the psychiatric department at the University Clinic of Frankfurt, my hometown,

39:00.480 --> 39:07.120
gave a big talk about the self model. And in the course, you know, a lecture hall

39:08.240 --> 39:16.480
of explaining that there's no such thing as a self. I realized that a considerable number

39:17.040 --> 39:23.040
of bored patients in how do you say in English, they're nightgowns. Yes, and they're,

39:23.760 --> 39:31.360
you know, they're comfortable house shoes had walked in from the ward that there were actually

39:31.360 --> 39:40.000
patients sitting in there. And not only psychiatry professors. And watching the faces during my talk,

39:40.880 --> 39:48.560
I realized this is not good, what I'm doing. There are some people in this audience who shouldn't

39:48.560 --> 39:55.760
be here that they shouldn't, they shouldn't hear that. It's shocking for them. And somebody let

39:55.760 --> 40:03.360
them in. I don't know, do you let your patients go to lectures? That's what I'm saying. It's

40:03.680 --> 40:10.960
it's such a difficult bridge to tiptoe on because you never know, even with philosophy in general,

40:10.960 --> 40:14.800
you never know what type of philosophical insights might trigger a psychotic episode.

40:16.800 --> 40:21.040
I mean, there's so many different, and that's what my master's focused on. And it really,

40:21.040 --> 40:25.200
that's what actually almost swayed me away from psychiatry, because I didn't go through with it.

40:25.200 --> 40:29.920
Now I just practice as a regular medical doctor, which just happens to have a master's event

40:30.000 --> 40:35.040
out that I'm not really technically I'm not applying it, but I think I'm always applying it.

40:35.040 --> 40:39.920
But because there's so many different facets behind this, how do you approach it philosophically?

40:39.920 --> 40:44.240
How do you approach it psychiatrically without ignoring the philosophy? Because

40:44.240 --> 40:48.400
these two fields are completely intertwined, and we can never really separate these two. And I

40:48.400 --> 40:53.920
think it's in order to do that. I think you cannot approach both of these topics without

40:53.920 --> 40:57.920
including the other often say that when you try and make a conclusion regarding the mind-body

40:57.920 --> 41:03.200
problem to not incorporate the atypical or the illness side of the mind, then you've

41:04.080 --> 41:09.120
completely uninformed decision. And I think that's why it's great that at the moment you're

41:09.120 --> 41:15.600
applying this all the time. And you mentioned Dennis and this passing moment and how he did that to

41:15.600 --> 41:21.760
you. I want when you think about Thomas, your view on consciousness altogether, because I know

41:21.760 --> 41:26.640
you consider this self to be an illusion. I mean, we're obviously, it's a phenomenal self model that

41:26.640 --> 41:31.120
we've created. When you take it far as consciousness, do you sort of head towards

41:31.920 --> 41:36.640
Dennis' definition of consciousness? Do you take it to an illusionism view of consciousness as well?

41:37.280 --> 41:46.880
Well, I have to confess, I'm getting sidetracked again, because listening to you,

41:47.680 --> 42:00.160
I have to make a footnote first. My psychology professor friends all know that they have a

42:00.160 --> 42:06.240
large population of students who come actually come to university with a self-healing project.

42:07.920 --> 42:14.320
In philosophy, you do have office hours too, you know. And the truth is,

42:14.960 --> 42:22.880
there is a small but considerable subset of philosophy students who take the subjects

42:22.880 --> 42:30.560
because they want to find a reason not to commit suicide. And I have seen this, just what you

42:30.560 --> 42:41.760
mentioned, to study philosophy properly can cause psychological crisis in some serious young people,

42:42.720 --> 42:51.520
some, you know, for instance, when they come from Muslim backgrounds or Catholic households,

42:51.520 --> 42:57.920
and they are for the first time confronted with arguments for atheism or something like this,

42:57.920 --> 43:04.400
and they go into it for a whole semester seriously, it can create big problems. But then,

43:04.720 --> 43:11.920
of course, there are also people who say it's people from South Africa who have good arguments

43:11.920 --> 43:17.600
to say that non-existence is to be preferred over existence, and you will have

43:20.560 --> 43:28.240
some young people with whom this resonates very strongly. So philosophers know this

43:29.120 --> 43:35.920
in another way. Now, before I get to illusionism, I have to say I think the way out is to change

43:35.920 --> 43:41.280
the incentive structure in the educational system and in universities. We need something

43:41.920 --> 43:47.600
that I have called died in the rule inter-disciplinary. So we need a whole generation

43:48.480 --> 43:53.280
of students who do, for instance, psychiatry and philosophy in parallel,

43:54.240 --> 44:00.160
but who get rewarded because it's extra work to be good in two disciplines at the same time,

44:00.160 --> 44:06.160
who have an incentive structure to do that. What we do have is this fake inter-disciplinarity

44:06.720 --> 44:12.240
in writing grants together and trying to get money, and then we all just, as soon as we have the money,

44:12.240 --> 44:19.040
we pursue our own hobbies, you know, and not that. So it has, you actually have to create a new

44:19.120 --> 44:25.040
generation of young people, and if the political system doesn't manage it, to make it attractive for

44:25.040 --> 44:33.760
them, to, you know, be to track research personalities, psychiatry and philosophy, and invest the

44:33.760 --> 44:43.520
extra work, then there will take other trajectories in the academic career universe, and you will not

44:43.520 --> 44:52.640
have the psychiatrists you are asking for. Illusionism. My confession, not with Dennett,

44:53.280 --> 45:00.560
but I have perceived this as, and I may be absolutely wrong, as one of these constructed

45:00.560 --> 45:08.640
debates, some people organize to get traction and eventually get tenure and create a little debate.

45:09.600 --> 45:14.800
So you can tell me a little bit about what illusion, because I really haven't followed

45:14.800 --> 45:25.200
the research literature. So where I start is, I have sometimes in my popular writings said

45:25.200 --> 45:33.120
something that was false, that one shouldn't say, namely the self is an illusion. This is

45:33.200 --> 45:37.440
false for at least two reasons. One, illusions are somebody's illusions.

45:39.680 --> 45:48.880
Second, if you define your terms properly, a hallucination would be a sensory misrepresentation

45:49.520 --> 45:54.480
where the object actually does not exist, whatever the voices, whatever you see.

45:55.280 --> 46:02.880
An illusion would be a sensory misrepresentation, a distortion, where a perceptual object

46:02.880 --> 46:08.560
actually does exist in the outward. These are the proper definitions. In that sense,

46:09.200 --> 46:15.200
consciousness cannot be an illusion. In that sense, so I always had the feeling at the beginning,

46:15.200 --> 46:21.200
this is a bit flaky, vague, right at the beginning, I get what they're saying,

46:21.280 --> 46:32.000
I want to try to get at. But of course, if you know my own theory about the PMIR,

46:32.640 --> 46:39.680
about the phenomenal model of the intentionality relationship, I have said that the self model

46:39.680 --> 46:49.200
is not just about the emotions, the thoughts the organism has, but that there's actually

46:49.200 --> 46:56.240
in the human conscious model of reality a representation of what philosophers like

46:56.240 --> 47:02.240
Franz Prentano or Edmund Husser have called the era of intentionality, the intentionality

47:02.240 --> 47:12.320
relationship. So being directed at a perceptual object or being directed as satisfaction conditions

47:12.320 --> 47:22.080
at an action goal is actually that is something that is represented in us. And that is also what

47:22.080 --> 47:26.320
a first person perspective is, you know, it's very dynamic.

47:29.280 --> 47:35.600
Now, of course, it is part of most of our self models

47:36.560 --> 47:44.640
that we are conscious right now. And in the forthcoming book, I will say,

47:45.920 --> 47:53.040
and provide empirical evidence that exactly this is false. It's not you that has the property

47:53.040 --> 48:00.560
of being conscious, but the epistemic space as a whole. It's just normally I call this the

48:00.640 --> 48:07.120
contraction principle, and it's maybe a bit too much to go into details here. It's contracted in

48:07.120 --> 48:13.440
normal non altered states of consciousness. It's contracted in the experience of a knowing self.

48:14.560 --> 48:22.240
I call this an epistemic agent model. So the model of an entity that wants to know

48:23.200 --> 48:32.000
selects goals of knowing forms concept directs its attention. That is an agent that an epistemic

48:32.000 --> 48:38.880
agent and active information hungry system that tries to know learn more about the world and

48:38.880 --> 48:47.840
itself. That's an epistemic agent. And an absolutely central part of our self model is that epistemic

48:47.840 --> 48:56.960
agent model. Now, if you see where this goes, you know, you also spoke about when I watch,

48:56.960 --> 49:01.440
I think that I was watching one of your lectures on, you were talking about an autonomy, the mental

49:01.440 --> 49:05.600
self control, the veto control, and then you did bring this up at some point. I remember

49:05.600 --> 49:09.280
you did bring about the fact that we have these epistemic agent model as well.

49:11.600 --> 49:15.680
And was this the lecture you gave on where you spoke about wandering minds at that point?

49:16.320 --> 49:21.680
I think so. Yes, I'm not working in this field anymore, but I have published four

49:21.680 --> 49:29.200
philosophical papers on mind wandering. And I'm kind of proud that the first one is basically the

49:29.200 --> 49:40.160
first one for a century, because I thought for, especially for philosophers. It is very important

49:40.160 --> 49:46.640
to take note of the new empirical research on, as I call it, task unrelated spontaneous thought,

49:47.440 --> 49:55.040
mind wandering daydreaming, because the very simple factor, a lot of details is that

49:56.480 --> 50:03.440
we are not in control of our own cognitive processes for more than 50% of our conscious

50:03.440 --> 50:14.480
lifetime. That's a safe conservative estimate. And I still remember when truly I talked to some

50:14.480 --> 50:20.720
eminent philosophers about mind wandering and the repeated collapse of the epistemic agent model.

50:20.720 --> 50:27.200
So I think when you have control over your focus of attention and listen to me, you have a stable

50:27.200 --> 50:33.360
epistemic agent model, but then you very often have a brief attentional lapse and think about

50:33.360 --> 50:39.440
what you have to do tomorrow or what your next question should be. And then that epistemic

50:39.440 --> 50:49.040
agent model collapses and has to be reconstructed. So in my view, mind wandering episodes always

50:49.040 --> 50:55.600
begin with a collapse of the epistemic agent model. That doesn't mean that the daydream cannot

50:55.600 --> 51:02.160
be about a future epistemic agent model that complicates things. But then you come back to

51:02.160 --> 51:08.480
in the present moment after a certain time, right? And I still remember some years ago,

51:09.120 --> 51:15.680
I talked to these really excellent philosophers, and somebody I really like, William Seger from

51:15.680 --> 51:21.600
Toronto said, now after the talk, come on, now this is, I have been listening to you for 60 minutes.

51:23.520 --> 51:29.840
Are you saying I have not been listening? That there were interruptions

51:30.800 --> 51:40.560
and I said, yes, maybe a few hundred, maybe a couple of dozen. And he said, but you're not,

51:40.560 --> 51:45.920
this is not phenomenologically realistic. You don't say while I'm listening,

51:45.920 --> 51:52.000
have been listening for one hour to you, I've had constant interruptions and lapses in listening to

51:52.000 --> 51:59.440
me and say, yes, that's what the data show. And the interesting thing was Bill and some

51:59.520 --> 52:06.560
others just didn't believe it. Just didn't believe it. They say, this is not true. This is not my

52:06.560 --> 52:14.800
own experience. I'm a stable knowing self. I've listened to you for many minutes. And that's

52:14.800 --> 52:21.200
an interesting discussion, you know. I feel sorry, I think my mind wandered off a bit there,

52:21.200 --> 52:25.920
because I accidentally took you off track there. When you were talking about these epistemic,

52:25.920 --> 52:31.520
these agents and these minds trying to understand your theory of consciousness a little bit more,

52:31.520 --> 52:35.760
do you feel that it's more of a linguistic problem that we are? Linguistics are playing a

52:35.760 --> 52:40.720
big role in us and our limitations in describing these phenomenological experiences. Do you believe

52:40.720 --> 52:47.200
that that's a major factor that hinders us from solving this problem? Well, that's the deep classical

52:47.200 --> 52:56.720
insight of analytical philosophy of mind. It of course does. But now I think we have a much better

52:56.720 --> 53:03.280
and fine grained way to describe what is actually happening. There's a hyper prior landscape in

53:03.280 --> 53:11.120
our brain, a landscape of very abstract assumptions. For example, about what a thought is, who the

53:11.120 --> 53:21.680
thinker is currently, and what the epistemic agent is. And you can have, if you have through

53:21.680 --> 53:28.240
cultural embedding and through language games you've played, you have a strong assumption

53:29.280 --> 53:36.800
that you are actually a continuous entity, a continuous epistemic agent. You need very careful,

53:36.800 --> 53:42.960
you need meditation retreats, you need a meditation practice, you need very carefully trained

53:42.960 --> 53:52.320
introspection to discover that that's actually not true. As you will top down shape your own

53:52.320 --> 53:59.120
experience of your own thought flow like this, and you will of course speak like this, this will

53:59.120 --> 54:06.480
reinforce the whole process socially, and you may not discover subtleties in your own experience.

54:06.960 --> 54:15.920
Unless neuroscientists come and do experiments with mind wandering and say, yeah, but people,

54:15.920 --> 54:24.320
if you test it, they have so many lapses. And they don't realize them. So the interesting thing

54:24.320 --> 54:32.720
about it is that just as most people walk through their everyday life, automatically thinking,

54:32.800 --> 54:39.760
neurotically planning, being haunted by unbidden memories, without even noticing that they are

54:39.760 --> 54:50.400
thinking. The same, of course, happens with these lapses and the mind wandering. Most people

54:50.400 --> 54:56.960
do not even realize that they're absent-minded. Unless you do something like experience sampling

54:56.960 --> 55:03.360
and fix a buzzer, a buzzer to your arm and whenever it buzzes, you ask yourself,

55:05.200 --> 55:14.480
have I been on task? And you're like, no, I was planning the holiday. But if the buzzer

55:14.480 --> 55:20.720
hadn't been there, you would think I was just washing dishes and I was paying attention all the

55:20.720 --> 55:31.680
time. And so I think if one refines introspection with the help of empirical research, one may

55:31.680 --> 55:37.680
discover that many philosophical assumptions about the human mind, for instance, the stability of

55:37.680 --> 55:45.280
the epistemic agent model, actually falls. And you're talking like this all the time,

55:46.240 --> 55:55.840
reinforcing it. Maybe some psychiatric patients are very sensitive people who have a

55:56.720 --> 56:04.800
better than average introspection and discover these discontinuities in themselves and get

56:04.800 --> 56:11.040
buried by them, could be. I was on that note, I was speaking to, when I spoke to Carl Friston,

56:11.040 --> 56:17.440
we spoke about this phenomenon in psychiatry where someone who's acutely psychotic,

56:18.640 --> 56:24.080
schizophrenic patient, acute psychosis, and you know the visual illusions, the checkered

56:24.080 --> 56:30.240
board illusion, all those famous ones, the blue dress, those types of famous visual illusions.

56:30.240 --> 56:34.960
A lot of the times when these acutely psychotic patients are having this episode,

56:34.960 --> 56:38.240
they don't tend to fall for it as much as the average human does.

56:39.200 --> 56:46.800
And that's a very fascinating set of research done because it begs the question of how this

56:46.800 --> 56:53.200
psychosis has completely revamped the way they perceive reality. So while we might consider

56:53.200 --> 56:58.880
them to be acutely psychotic and quote unquote not seeing reality for what it is, they're actually

56:58.880 --> 57:04.800
seeing reality for a little bit more verticality than we are actually seeing. So there's something

57:05.040 --> 57:11.920
hyperacuity and that hyperacuity might of course be lower into higher levels and then

57:13.920 --> 57:23.520
cause problems there. Yes, I've had interesting conversations with people in a closed ward.

57:25.040 --> 57:33.280
Unfortunately, both close friends who both are dead now. The most interesting thing for me is if

57:33.280 --> 57:41.200
you have a very careful conversation and you go along and you can say, you know that this step,

57:42.080 --> 57:49.920
this is not consensus reality anymore. This is what nobody believes. This isn't there, the towers,

57:49.920 --> 57:57.840
the towers where they're watching you. And they are absolutely aware of it. They can even say,

57:57.840 --> 58:04.000
I know this is not your reality, but it is my and I cannot help it.

58:08.320 --> 58:15.280
That is very interesting. It also has to do with the transparency of reality models. I mean,

58:15.280 --> 58:22.400
I don't know what the solution will be, but a very interesting question is of course how

58:23.200 --> 58:26.720
to become representations of the world that the brain generates

58:27.840 --> 58:34.960
real, like irrevocably real, and how do they become opaque and just

58:36.000 --> 58:45.840
like say in derealization syndrome or something become unreal. What are these mechanisms? I've

58:45.840 --> 58:50.640
also been fascinated by this. Most philosophers just think, well, this is just reality, perceptual

58:50.720 --> 59:00.080
reality out there in a household person. But in epileptic seizures, under the influence of hallucinogens,

59:01.120 --> 59:08.400
there is phenomenological hyperrealism. It's just like the volume control for

59:08.400 --> 59:17.200
realness can be turned up and down in depression, in depersonalization, as you know, much better than

59:17.200 --> 59:28.800
I do. The realness can go down even the realness of one's own body. What is that? And I have great

59:28.800 --> 59:39.120
hope that computational psychiatry will be able to describe this. What makes it real?

59:39.680 --> 59:48.560
One thing I'm already only recently beginning to understand is it may be that we have a better

59:49.920 --> 59:56.560
theory about how psychosis happens, how complex hallucinations occur.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:06.480
But this might still not mean that we can help people or cure people, because the human brain,

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:18.960
the human mind is such a complex thing. Do you have any view on how this might be brought into

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:26.240
therapeutic efficacy? Yeah, I think there's certain ways. I know what Carl Friston we spoke about.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.920
So when you think about free energy principle, and actually when I wrote that paper where I

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:36.880
quoted you a couple of times, I spoke about how when you use that principle, or if you use

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:44.240
hierarchical Bayesian brains and active inference as a theory to approach psychiatry,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.080
and then you go into computational psychiatry, you can then talk about the prior information

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.960
that you take in and the posterior conclusions that you make. So let's say you use virtual

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.160
reality for an example, or you take a bunch of virtual reality headset and place it on a patient,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.640
you can almost try and shift the prior information they constantly get on a day-to-day

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:08.880
basis, tailor their reality to something that we have to first prove, obviously with evidence,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:16.080
seems to lower the episodic rate of psychosis. So if we almost put them into a new reality

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.960
that slightly aligns with their physical reality a bit more, and almost remove some of the deluded

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:28.560
thoughts or the perceptual hallucinations that they experience, you can almost assist them in

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.560
that regard. But then we end up falling into the trap of possibly inducing psychotic. So it's

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.400
because we've altered the perception of reality, and this is why I find it so difficult to apply

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.760
many of these. Yeah, I mean, the tools are coming. There are some very interesting

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:55.920
results I vaguely remember with anorexia and body distortion, perception disorders.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:04.000
A very interesting but also sobering thing I saw many years in Milan and in Italy

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.800
is they took a number of psychotic patients without insight and professional actors from

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:20.560
the theater, and the actors played the patients exactly what the patient says and what he or she

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:29.040
does. And the interesting thing was that caused insight. So while they're watching somebody

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.440
playing themselves, they suddenly realize they're ill and there's a reason that they're here. But

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:45.760
the curtain closes again after the intervention. It's not a lasting insight. And that's, of course,

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.360
an interesting question. Like, how do you get, I mean, you are ill, you think you're someone.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.760
How do you get a lasting insight into the non-existence of self? A question Buddhists

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.920
have asked, of course. And a big part of a mental state examination is, and while often

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:12.000
psychiatrists will use a MSE, is what they call it, and MSE, so mental state examination. So

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.400
one of the main factors is insight in judgment. So when they're assessing you, one of the key

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.360
things they'll write down is either poor insight in judgment or maybe fair insight, poor judgment.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.200
Because sometimes, even if they have all the insight they need, the judgment regarding the

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.560
insight they have still doesn't correlate and correspond. So it's so difficult to actually get

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.240
down to what they really want or need. Another thing you could use, let's say virtual reality for

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.280
would be exposure therapies. So if someone has a serious fear of heights, maybe just to slowly

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.560
bring them while knowing they're in a safe environment to utilize it in that regard. But

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.480
that's just technology, though. That's not necessarily an application of a theoretical model,

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:06.640
I would say. So an ordinary, so-called neurotypical and healthy citizen,

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:16.640
how do you rate them on insight? That's exactly what the focus was on. I'm both

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.280
offered from Oxford. I mean, that's what he takes books about, is that we just cannot draw lines

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.680
like that. It's such a blurry spectrum in general, which is how I see consciousness at this point.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.720
We don't really know. There's so many different ways to define it. How do you actually draw lines

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.600
with anything? But does that relate? Can we come back to your question of illusionism?

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:45.520
Oh, yes, yes. Imagine an extreme case, rare case of Quotas syndrome,

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:56.640
where a patient will claim that he is dead and asks for the body to be disposed of.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:08.240
And will claim that he's not conscious. I mean, that is something we know. It can happen

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:16.160
that human beings are firmly convinced that they are dead and also have no mind.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.400
Does this tell us anything about illusionism? Or is this just rare anecdotal material?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.600
Well, I think it actually could tell people that the phenomenon is possible. So that's where I

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.760
think someone like the I don't know if you're familiar with the new defenders of these types

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:42.880
of theories like Keith Frankish, who firmly, what he describes is more of a ways I phenomenal

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.160
experience. So he says that these experiences are existing. It's the way we're defining them

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.120
to be more real than they actually are. So we're giving them this almost essence like quality.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.520
And I think that's where he specifically says, no, this is not actually correct.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.720
It's quasi-phenomenal. It is something that's happening. It's more the phenomenal nature of it.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.600
That intentionality or the aboutness that a lot of philosophers talk about

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.400
is what he's referring to that's not necessarily there.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.960
So and I think that's where Dennett also goes with it as well. But honestly,

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.800
I can't speak for them. I don't really.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:30.080
Well, I think there is a completely underrated paper which appeared in 1988

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.680
by Kathy Wilkis, also the late Kathy Wilkis, an Oxford philosopher,

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:46.320
who has a very simple point. She went through all languages and said that way over 90% of

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.200
the languages that have evolved on this planet do not have a word for consciousness.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:59.040
I don't know if this would still stand to test by today's linguistics,

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:07.440
but I believe it's probably true. So she makes this very funny move that she says,

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.120
yeah, that happened after the Cartesian catastrophe. That's a problem that emerged in

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:20.480
certain small circles in Europe 350 years ago. The rest of humankind never had a problem of

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:30.160
consciousness. You know, they have to be infected with it a little bit. And that is also

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:39.920
interesting. Why have so many human beings or cultures not evolved?

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:49.760
The concept of consciousness that puzzles us so much now. It's like they never saw the need

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.880
to describe something. I think they will understand what wakefulness is.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.000
I think most human beings will understand that what it means to be awake.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:15.360
You can also possess. So I haven't read Frankish or I don't know this debate. But would it tell us

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:26.240
something to know that there are certain kinds of coma where you have all the physiological

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:35.280
signs of being awake. You have a sleep wake rhythm. You even have gaze following movements,

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:42.320
sometimes which make it very hard for the relatives. But definitely also retrospective

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.200
reports, no conscious experience. The patient doesn't know they exist.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:57.120
And at the same time, in ordinary folks, we have wakefulness plus a conscious experience of

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:04.080
wakefulness. We can feel wakefulness. I say a lot about this in the forthcoming book where I have

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:11.280
500 reports where meditators from 57 countries in the world describe the experience of pure

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:18.560
awareness itself. And of course, it has a lot to do with just clarity and the experience of

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:28.640
wakefulness. So you can be awake and not know it. And you can be awake and awake. Like hopefully

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.880
the two of us are now doing. Does this tell us something about illusionism?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:43.600
That's a tough one. Look, I remember when I wrote my essay back, this was years ago as well.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.880
I at the time believed in it quite firmly. And not anymore. I mean, I think that I think this

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.240
podcast specifically has completely changed the way I perceive consciousness in general. And I've

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.760
spoken to so many different philosophers, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:10.240
that at this point, I find myself just not knowing where I stand. I often say I'm ontologically

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.080
agnostic regarding this concept at this point. I'm very intrigued by all the epistemology,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.320
everything we can talk about, but I'm almost unconvinced by all of them and very convinced

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.200
by most of them at the same time. Okay, let me add to your confusion. I think

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:37.760
consciousness is not a subjective phenomenon. Because we have empirical evidence

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.920
for conscious experience without a first person perspective. So I'm not going to go into details,

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:54.240
but say empirical data on ego dissolution under psychedelics, or the phenomenology of

01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:00.160
advanced practitioners of meditation, where there is just awareness without anybody we see

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:09.920
that all the stronger philosophical notions of subjectivity, like epistemological notions,

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:18.160
or even metaphysical notions, I would claim are grounded in our conscious experience of

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:27.280
being a knowing self directed at the world. That's where this issue comes from consciousness is

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.520
an intrinsically subjective phenomenon. And that's why it cannot be explained.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:41.600
But now we do have mounting empirical data that conscious experience can actually exist without

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:52.400
an experiential perspective, somebody directed at it. So couldn't it in these cases be something

01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:03.840
that not a person has, but that an organism has? Even Thomas Nagel said that in an unknown paper

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.960
called the boundaries of inner space in 1969, he says, if we, he said, we may have to fall back

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:18.480
onto the notion of an organism, if we cannot describe it as a personal level property. So the

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:26.720
brute awareness or the consciousness of it all. So could it actually be that

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:35.600
we are blinded by the fact that in almost all cases where we actually enjoy conscious experience,

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:45.440
there is always a knowing self and a perspective? I agree. I think it's, it's, it's one of those

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.360
things. There's, there's some great work being done at the moment by Michael Levin.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:56.880
Uh-huh. Tell me. And so he, well, he works with bioelectrical networks and what he slowly

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.480
tried, I also don't want to, I'm just going to paraphrase, because honestly, his work is so

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.960
complex that I even barely understand some of the concepts myself. But for the most part,

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.880
he's trying to blur this line completely of what intelligence is and what a big role this plays

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.160
for our own understanding of what consciousness is. And to show that even cells, even, and I'm

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.800
not talking about neurons, I'm talking about general cells, um, have electrical communication

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.400
that occurs, that if you disrupt or disturb it or even reprogram some of the electrical

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.320
communication, you can fundamentally change the way the cell will proliferate and develop

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.040
general. So that means this communication between cells that go beyond just chemical.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:43.040
And, and rather this is neurochemical communication and intelligence nonetheless.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.120
And the goal, I think, I mean, he's working, there's other people like Chris Fields,

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.800
Mark Psalms, Carl Friston, that they're sort of combining all these different fields together

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.880
and, and coming up, drawing slowly conclusions using Markov blankets and just various different

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.080
as fields. Yeah, just to sort of show us and blur this line even more of what we really consider

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:11.200
to be intelligent, conscious, um, in general. And I think it's sort of a fantastic program and great

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:19.360
work. Yes, it's exciting times. And from my point of view, the real question is if you can

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:29.520
find scale invariant abstract principles that go through from physics to biology

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.600
to the expression in our own brains with conscious experience. And I think they're

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:44.560
basically there. I mean, Carl's story is basically anchored in statistical physics.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:53.520
And we can see how this can be nested on different timescales. But still, I think

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:01.680
there's no such thing as panpsychism. Of course, these abstract computational properties

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:10.000
that go through the levels, they will have different strengths or so. But if you would say

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.400
that cells or even protons have proto-phenomenal properties, that's one of the sexy stuff people

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:28.000
like to hear. Then you get, then you get just another question. So why is our expression

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.920
of this form of being conscious so very different and so, so much richer? You just kick the, you,

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:44.400
how do you say, you re-confront the problem on a higher level. If you say there are similar

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:51.600
principles at work through all scales. But there is, of course, something unique

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:59.520
in waking up from dreamless deep sleep. There is something very dramatic happening there.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:10.000
And the question is, of course, it's also a bit unsettling. I think the motive,

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:18.800
the unadmitted motive for many people who are interested in the metaphysical side of consciousness

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:28.160
and all that, is that they look for a clever way to satisfy one of the deepest emotional needs,

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:35.040
all of us have, which is mortality denial. So if you want to make a career in a philosophy of

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:42.320
consciousness, you have to find some, you can't say anything crazy or wrong, but you have to

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:51.600
offer people a sexy back door, something like proto-phenomenalism or something like

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:59.680
panpsychism. Then you get a lot of intention. And that is because of often unadmitted basic

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:08.160
motive is, but could it exist after death? Could it exist after the biological brain has died?

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:21.840
And this deep need, which also is something computational. I have introduced a term that's

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:30.960
called existence bias. And David Benatar would immediately understand it. We are beings who

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.400
will always opt to continue their own existence, even if it's not in their own best interest,

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:45.760
even if it's obvious, even to them, that this will just increase the overall negative balance

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:54.240
of suffering. And there's a reason for this. I think Karl's story helps us to understand

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:01.840
why we suffer from existence bias, because we have to stay in a very, very narrow window

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:12.320
of certain parameters to stay alive. The process can be described as finding evidence for one's

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:20.960
own existence, as predicting, continuously predicting our own existence, to put it

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:28.000
falsely and in a very primitive way. We were never meant to simulate future worlds in which

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.680
we didn't have a lot of healthy offspring or in which we were dead. Of course, for short-term

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.640
risk management, we have to recognize I might be dead if I do that. That's a separate thing.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:48.960
But in principle, also, I say in the new book, we are an embodied existence bias.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:19:00.000
We are resistant, resistance. We resist thermodynamics in an amazing, highly improbable

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.480
way. You know how improbable it was that you and I haven't dropped dead of our chairs during this

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:12.000
conversation? Physically, it's a bizarre event. You know, that systems like that

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:20.960
should evolve that far away from thermodynamic equilibrium somehow create a stable state,

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:27.600
but we do it. And this is one of my favorite philosophers, Jacob Howey,

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.720
at Monash University, as described in a recent paper, because we follow an inner norm.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:45.120
And that norm is this existence bias. Now, my point is the existence bias on a psychological

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:53.280
and psychiatric level leads to mortality denial and to what the Buddhists have called

01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:02.080
the thirst for existence. We have this thirst for continuing existence, non-existence,

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:10.400
somehow almost is no option for us. And as long as we're healthy, as long as we're

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:19.280
mentally healthy. But my point is this also spills over in our theoretical treatment of

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:28.960
consciousness. Most of us normal human beings who are not monks, who have renunciated the world

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.120
and are ready to go into non-existence. Most of us that read these books about consciousness

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:42.960
have this deep, and this is not something intellectual, my existence bias. It's a

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:52.800
computational principle I embody in my cells, existence bias. And we want to find out, can

01:20:52.800 --> 01:21:02.960
this help me, proving my own existence? Can this help me developing a delusion? Because

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:11.360
now part two is we have a problem that probably no other animal on this planet has. We know,

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:20.240
I'll express it in free energy terms again, that our predictive horizon will eventually shrink

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:30.640
to zero. We know that we will die cognitively. That is what I call in the new book a toxic form

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:40.880
of self-knowledge. It's a major danger to our self-model. Evolution didn't want this. If we want

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:49.120
to stay functional in seeing our own mortality so clearly, we need to tweak our model of reality.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.800
States of consciousness are phenomenal models of reality. And that is where religious delusion

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:07.520
starts. This is where we have to find a way to come to terms with this, to deal with our mortality

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.680
because we are an embodied existence bias. And that is a big problem most people don't see if

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:22.400
you want to make a theory of consciousness. Because nobody wants to hear eliminative materialism.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:29.920
Everybody wants to have something that's a little mystery. You know what I mean?

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.320
Yeah, I get completely what you're saying. I mean, it's almost that little bit of an

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:39.040
Iain Vitelle, something that makes you special, something that almost you're going.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:51.920
Yes, of course. And you want any solution that doesn't leave a door open for that prediction,

01:22:52.480 --> 01:23:01.680
simulation of future selves might go on after physical death. Everything that says no,

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:08.480
your predicted horizon will shrink to zero doesn't feel right to beings like us.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:19.600
It feels unhealthy. It feels not good for the integrity of our self model. And that's the problem

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:25.760
materialists are really ruthless scientists or philosophers have, because there's a crowd out

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:35.520
there. And the crowd says, yeah, but this is a disenchantment of the world. On a God level,

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:43.760
this doesn't feel like, I like the heart problem of consciousness. I like that better. And isn't

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:52.320
panpsychism that, you know, that has an appeal? And that's a major barrier in making a theory of

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:58.240
consciousness. Thomas, the name of your book, it's a very German word. Do you want to just say it

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.200
for me quickly? And just for the listeners in the US? What? The name of the book, the forthcoming

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:10.960
book. Or the forthcoming book is where we use MIT Press in English, The Elephant and the Blind.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:17.360
And of course, there's a German version of it too. How do you say the German word? Because I've been

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:27.840
trying to pronounce this for a while. The Elephant and the Blind. Okay. And it is, of course, that

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:34.880
metaphor is describes exactly our situation in trying to understand what consciousness is, you

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.880
know, some people have a flank, some people have the trunk, some some blind people have the tail.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.320
They're all right. Then complete disagreement with each other. And the way I was actually

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.000
talking about is is Bavoud Steinskultur. Is that is that the word? Oh, that is the latest book,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.680
which hasn't found an English publisher yet. That is out since 6th of January. Yes, yes.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:07.120
That is a different. Do you want to know about Bavoud Steinskultur now?

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:14.960
I know how to pronounce that one. That that was about creating a cultural context, where we also

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.960
ask normative questions, questions like what is a good state of consciousness? Yes, yes. Will,

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.960
of course, apply to psychiatry? Sure. I mean, you spoke, I think there was a point where I

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.240
heard you discussing the fact that you look for what is it a negative utilitarian approach to

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.320
yes, to life. And I was really curious to know about a bit more about that work on your view on

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:49.360
that and how it touches on the mind in general. I'm a bit hesitant to go into that for two reasons.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:57.120
One is I'm not up to speed on the technical literature on negative utilitarianism. I have to

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.960
say that. I just, I mean, I've peeped into it a bit and I have certain intuitions, which I can

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.360
explain. And second, I have found that it is one of the question you have just asked is

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.920
one of the philosophical issues that are hard to discuss in the public.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.840
Yes, not true. Because they hurt some people too much. I think some people don't want to go.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.840
That question. Let's just, we'll scratch that. I'm going to edit that. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:36.720
I think it's a very tenable position. I don't know about Benatar's specific exposition and the

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:43.520
argument, but it's a very tenable position that life is not worth living and that existence is not

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:51.440
in our own best interest. I even have put a thought experiment out on the web, which is called

01:26:51.440 --> 01:27:00.960
the barn scenario, which is called benevolent artificial antinatalism, which makes the assumption

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:09.200
that a superintelligence emerges. And it is not in any way misaligned with our interests or unethical,

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.280
quite the opposite. It is, of course, much better in moral cognition than ourselves.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:21.120
It's fully on our side. It's not an end event. It's a benevolent superintelligent.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.600
And it discovers that nonexistence is in our own best interest and that for reasons

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:36.000
of self-deception mechanisms that evolution has put into our brains, we are not able to see this

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:43.040
fact that nonexistence is better. For me, it's completely obvious that we just state this that

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:51.680
if you see humankind as a whole, it is an ocean of suffering and confusion. I would even

01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:01.120
expand this to sentient life on this planet. I think evolution is nothing to be glorified.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:08.640
On this planet, it has created an ocean, an absolutely unfathomable ocean of suffering,

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:17.520
this fear of death, anxiety in an enormous number of conscious individuals that didn't

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:24.800
exist at this place in the physical universe before. So actually, we are in a highly problematic

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.760
situation or highly problematic here. And I mean, of course, evolution is also something

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:39.440
fantastic that has created all these beauties and the forms. But I think for me, it is highly

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:51.680
intuitive that an ordinary human life contains more suffering than joy. And I call this NP,

01:28:52.960 --> 01:29:00.640
negative phenomenology, very simply defined as all states which the system,

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.520
if it had a choice, would rather not live through. And I can, if you want to, do you want two more

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:17.040
minutes about this topic? We can. Yeah, we can go. Yeah. So I wanted to do an experience sampling

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:30.000
study, but never got to it. But I did a pilot study with, I think, 12 or 17 of my PhD students

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:40.960
in my group. So it was, so the question was this, you're going to get for one week,

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:49.680
you're going to get random SMS messages at different times. And whenever your phone buzzes,

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.400
you check, is this a moment I would take with me into the afterlife? So the thought

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:06.320
experience is like that. There is an afterlife. But it's called the eternal playlist thought

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:14.080
experiment. But you will not have any new experiences after death. You can make a selection

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.880
from those experiences you have created before you died. And they will buy a random randomized

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:29.280
algorithm that will be played back to you in eternity after death. So the question is how

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.560
many moments in your life do you actually have if you look there, where you say, oh, I would take

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:46.720
this with me into life after death. So I think we did, I have to, I think we did 100 samples.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.680
Then you lose about 30 people don't hear the phone buzzing, you get 70.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:06.080
70 data points from every student. And the two arguably two smart ones were embarrassed to say

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:14.720
that they had no, in the course of a whole week, they had no moment that was so good

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:21.760
that they would take it into the afterlife. Other people made other ugly discoveries. For

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:26.320
instance, they got into trouble with their girlfriend because the girlfriend realized

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:31.200
when they're hanging out of the court couch with her in the phone buzzes, he never says this was

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:42.000
a good moment. He never does anything on his phone. So I think the average was something like seven to

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:49.600
eight good moments or less per week. And then philosophical discussion exploded. That was

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.560
even more interesting. So all these brilliant young PhD students said, yeah, but this doesn't show

01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:01.280
anything. And I'm writing a PhD thesis and I'm making a contribution to mankind. And it absolutely

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:07.840
doesn't matter if I'm lonely, or if I'm unhappy. This doesn't say anything about the value of life

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:14.080
or boom, I couldn't say anything anymore. The defense mechanisms were up. But what I would

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:22.080
really like to do is a large, hurl bird style, experience sampling studies, just asking people

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.760
a large number of people this last moment before the buzzer rang. Would you want to

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:37.120
take it into the afterlife or not? As a criterion for a moment that where life was worth living.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:44.320
And my working hypothesis is these moments are rare, much rarer than we think.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:52.880
We all confabulate, like patients confabulating. No, I'm having a great life.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.120
Yes, we've got that positivity bias built in, just remembering all the good times.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:05.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think there is a point to be made that phenomenologically.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:16.400
And I find it so interesting that the free energy principle actually tells the same story

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:25.440
that a human life is one big uphill battle. In my view, if we are honest to ourselves,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:35.360
it's a strenuous affair to stay sane in a world like this. I mean, to protect your mental health

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:45.360
or your dignity, another topic in a world like this. It's difficult. It costs a lot of energy.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:53.440
And it would probably be much better for all of us if we could at least partly

01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:05.440
admit this to each other, maybe also doctors to patients that life is very often not easy for us.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.160
And that we frequently, all of us have experiences of losing control.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.800
The philosophical problem, of course, is, you know, there's all this in the consciousness

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:26.000
community, all this talk about color vision and, you know, cell food. But we don't have a good

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:33.200
theory of what suffering is. I mean, what is psychological suffering? What is that the nastiness

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:39.040
of it? Can there be a common computational principle? I think they came, you know, maybe it's

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.000
if the rate of prediction error minimization goes down unexpectedly,

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:52.240
you know, if you unexpectedly see that you're not doing well,

01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.640
that that gets existential and psychologically unsettling. I think it would be a major

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:08.080
achievement to have an abstract theory of suffering. And then ask the question,

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:16.160
how can this be alleviated? Because I think if there's any norm, so you asked about negative

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:24.960
utilitarianism, I think, because for two reasons, I make it very simple, there's more suffering in

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:32.000
the world than joy. And second, there is a shared moral intuition in almost all cultures

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:39.440
that we can draw on, not get into deep philosophical debates, that it is more important

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.880
to help a suffering person suffer less than to make a neutral or happy person more happy.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:56.320
Almost all people can agree on this. And I think a practical ethics can be developed from this,

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:02.880
that one say, admit to each other that we're suffering beings and focus on the alleviation

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:10.160
of suffering. The important point, of course, is that this also applies to those people who are not

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:18.240
yet born to future persons. They are suffering matters too. And, you know, climate catastrophe

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:25.200
and everything, they have no party in parliament. They have no lawyers who fight for them.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.600
That's why David Benito's work, sorry, sorry. That's where that huge chunk of David Benito's

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:41.280
work. I mean, he's probably not too far from here. Because UCT is a UCT professor in Cape Town.

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.640
Well, I think he was. But yeah, I mean, when I read that work, I find it very intriguing.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.640
But in your own work, I mean, how do you deal with it as a medical doctor?

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.600
Does it not sometimes creep up on you that there's so much suffering?

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.320
At all the time. I mean, every time you see it. And it does make you question. I mean,

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.880
I've questioned it many times myself, like, whether do I want to have kids? Is this?

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.240
Do you?

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:15.840
I think I don't know. I don't really, I don't have kids yet, but really not sure. And it's mostly

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.880
because of what you're talking about. I think factoring all the problems that we've got so far

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.000
and and what they can expect. I mean, it doesn't look too bright. It doesn't look too great.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.480
No, no, of course. In Germany, there's now an increasing number of young people

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:40.800
who have themselves sterilized or do not have children, not because of grand philosophical

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.480
arguments, but because of the climate catastrophe, because they just think it's reckless.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:55.440
I was there 40 years ago. It has always been quite obvious to me. But I also find,

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:06.800
I mean, if you start discussing these issues, in a way, it's as if you begin to confront the

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:14.640
power of evolution itself, the resistance in people will be so strong. You know, if you say,

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:23.120
have you ever thought about the possibility that you may have inbuilt mechanisms of self-deception?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:33.280
For most people, and I also think one shouldn't force discussions or things like that on people who

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:40.080
just do not want to hear about this. But of course, there is a classical philosophical

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:47.680
issues and I mean, there are classical answers. Christians have said this is a serious place.

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:58.800
Buddhists have said all life is suffering. And I have one paper in this edited volume,

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.880
The Return of Consciousness, which is called Suffering. I think this speaks also a bit to

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.480
the shallowness of the current debate. Because there are a lot of people who are trying to make

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:18.320
a brilliant academic career in neuroscience or philosophy with very smart ideas. But

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.560
there's this elephant in the room that conscious experience not only involves

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.560
out of body experiences and color vision and stuff we're all interested in.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:39.600
But that it is maybe a mechanism to drive a gene-copying device forward.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:53.680
I mean, I have no final verdict on this and I'm not sure if I were to read up on the technical

01:39:53.680 --> 01:40:00.960
literature on negative utilitarianism if it is at all tenable. What the situation on the

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:08.320
analytical research frontier here is. But I see when we share an intuition there.

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.040
I think so. I think we definitely do. Thomas, sorry about that break because South Africa

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.760
we have load shedding. It's called load shedding. Literally, this is a thing in South Africa where

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.200
the country is so corrupt and we've got so much going on where they cannot generate enough power.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.840
And because of this, they have rolling blackouts in the country and sometimes up to four hours,

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:37.040
four times a day. So you get stuck with almost half the day with no electricity. So right now

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.520
I've got no power. I'm using a generator and inverters to sort of kick everything in.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:51.440
Well, I hope one time in my life I make it. I'm the Asia guy. I've traveled a lot

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:59.840
in the South East Asia in my life. I've never made it south of Morocco or Egypt.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:04.320
I think if you do come to South Africa, you come straight to my city Cape Town.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.160
Yeah, it's beautiful. You'd love it. And you'd also love a lot of the academic work that's being

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.520
done on the side is quite amazing as well. So I think we've touched on certain ethics

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.720
applications of how we can understand consciousness from the mind-body problem

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:28.400
to the practical implications of psychiatry. Your forthcoming book, The Elephant and the Blind,

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.120
can you give us a little synopsis of what we can expect from it?

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:43.120
Yes, I can. So there's an open access paper out there which you can look at,

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:52.000
which is a psychometric study with meditators. It's in public library of science and it's called

01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:05.200
the MPE92M study. You'll find it. My co-author's name is Alex Gamma. So over the last three years,

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.880
I've tried to develop a completely different approach to consciousness. There is a kind of

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:18.240
explanation most people don't know about. It's called a minimal model explanation.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:25.760
And it means that you subtract everything from your target phenomenon that is superfluous

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:32.720
and not necessary for the causal emergence of the phenomenon. So I've asked myself,

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:38.160
so what is the simplest form of conscious experience human beings have? What can you

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:43.120
subtract? You can subtract color, vision, and you can subtract conscious thought.

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:52.880
And I have a candidate now. The candidate, it's completely hypothetical, is the experience of

01:42:52.880 --> 01:43:00.320
pure awareness and meditation. For the simplest state of conscious experience, you must know I'm

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:07.840
also a long-term practitioner. I've meditated twice a day for more than 46 years and done a lot in my

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:14.320
private life about which I've never talked so far. Now, after we've done that first psychometric

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:21.760
study, there's a much bigger one coming now. We're also non-meditators. Can describe if... Let me

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:28.320
just ask you right now. If you look at all the conscious experience, you have the colors, the

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:39.040
sounds, my voice, your interceptive sensations. Can you attend to the quality of consciousness

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:48.880
as such? Honestly, I don't think so. Right. Okay. See, that is the question. And the idea is that

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:58.080
there's actually a phenomenal character to awareness as such, which is completely transparent to

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:05.760
almost every normal human being. You never feel it. But meditators could be a population that

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:16.320
cultivates this awareness of awareness, meta attention, attention to attention. Okay. So we

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:27.760
did the psychometric studies and we had some results and we had about 3,624 surveys of which

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:35.520
we could use 1,403. And then we said, if you don't have to do this, but if you want to describe in

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:42.960
words, a paradigmatic experience you've had in which you experienced consciousness as such,

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:52.640
please give us a written description. And that led to 841 reports from 57 different countries

01:44:52.640 --> 01:45:00.160
where people described what they think is that what you think is unknown to you. And of course,

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:06.560
there may be confabulating, there may be misinterpreting, they have their own philosophical ideas and so

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:16.640
on. But in that book, I've tried to make a step forward before going into any grandiose philosophical

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:23.120
theorizing about pure awareness or demanding research programs before one knows what we're

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.800
talking about. I've just made an attempt to take the phenomenology very seriously.

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:36.880
And I've presented excerpts from about 500 reports by meditators how they describe the pure

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:43.920
awareness experience. And it's for a wider audience. So every chapter has a first part where you can

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:51.040
just read the descriptions. And then there are some ideas from neuroscience or philosophy.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:46:00.560
And then you find common denominators. Very simple. So I have it here. So the first chapter is just

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:08.640
called relaxation. That's trivial. For most people, there is a phenomenology of being deeply relaxed.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:16.560
The second most frequent thing is people describe it as peace. No thoughts absent of mental conflict.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:26.160
Then you have silence. Mental silence. Then you have wakefulness. There's some people describe a

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:34.480
distinct phenomenology of being awake. And now let me ask you a question. Has it ever happened to you?

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:41.760
Sometimes one wakes up maybe two or three times in a year, a little too early even,

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.880
and one has had a particularly good night's sleep, a particularly good rest.

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:54.800
Yeah, that actually happened last night. Yeah, you had? Yeah. Now, if you don't make the mistake,

01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:02.960
imagine you haven't made the mistake to look into your phone or connect to the internet.

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:11.600
And you haven't made a mistake to talk to anybody. You just got up a little early,

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:18.000
super fresh, and maybe with your first cup of tea or coffee, you just sat out on the terrace,

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.480
on the balcony, and just sat there. And you were just wide awake and super nervous,

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:33.120
nothing dramatic. You listen to the birds, you sip your tea. There was maybe a time where there was

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:44.640
a gap between two thoughts, maybe a two second gap. That is it. It's so simple. Every human

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.400
being knows it that you overlook it. Yes, I can say fancy things about it. For instance, I can also

01:47:50.400 --> 01:48:00.960
say the phenomenal character of tonic alertness. And if one describe it, it has interesting other

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:08.720
phenomenological characteristics, for instance, density or soundness. And then you get

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:15.040
into deeper aspects of it, like non-vulow awareness, absence of itself, it can take different forms.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:22.640
But I think one possibility is, and by the way, I'm not going to go into this book, so you have

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:30.240
500 reports, and I'm trying to offer the community a careful phenomenological description of pure

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:38.000
awareness. I'm creating appetizers, and people shall cook their own main courses. That's the idea,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.000
right? I'm just preparing for a minimal model explanation of consciousness.

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:54.000
But there are interesting things in there. For instance, I would say, in Carl Friston's term,

01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:01.920
what everybody has overlooked is that the strongest source of perturbation, that's my theory, the

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:08.720
strongest external stimulus that has to be explained away is not something that comes in

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.560
through sensory modules or through interception in the thalamus, but is the activity of the

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:21.600
Formatio Reticularis, the ascending activation system in the brainstem. That is actually

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:28.560
biophysically the most massive, completely unexplained signal source within the body.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:38.480
And this happens when you wake up in the morning, and what we need to control our own level of

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:46.400
tonic alertness, so my highly speculative theory goes, is a predictive model of the level of

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:52.720
cortical arousal, the level of tonic alertness, different aspects to that, that allows the organism

01:49:53.280 --> 01:50:01.840
to control its own long-term wakefulness. And I think that might be the simplest form of

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:10.400
conscious experience shared by all human beings. And if you listen to that, I found that in Mark

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.920
Song's latest book. Yes, The Hidden Spring. It's exactly what I was thinking about. Yeah.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.840
There's this tradition, there's this tradition, the Amazio, Pankse, Mark Song's, where they have

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.040
more of the idea that this is actually a homostatic auto-regulation, or it's that

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:36.560
I've said that, I've said that in being no one, that it is elementary bioregulation,

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:43.840
that you, so to speak, you feel the sheer fact of aliveness itself, the organism

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.920
trying to stabilize itself homostatically. I think there's one step below this.

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:59.120
My thinking is very parallel in that respect to Mark Song's. There is this very low,

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.600
this very fundamental subcortical signal source, which I think has to be predictively

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.440
modeled by the brain. And that creates the experience of wakefulness. But I think

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:20.720
in my terminology, it's not aliveness, but sheer epistemic openness, as I call it. It is,

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:29.520
as neuroscientists would say, stimulus readiness, the experience of stimulus readiness,

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:40.960
the availability of executive control without having to exert it. And I think there's an

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:51.600
overlooked, very subtle, very simple phenomenology of just being awake and aware. And

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.360
I think that could lead to a minimal model explanation of consciousness, because

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:08.240
that is what I'm very much interested in research right now. There are rare advanced

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:13.680
practitioners of meditation who report about something that is sometimes called clear light

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:21.760
sleep or witnessing sleep, an experience of being awake during non REM sleep. No dreams,

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:27.920
no content, don't feel the body don't hear the environment in the bedroom. If that could be

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:35.600
proven, it's not proven. But if that could be empirically shown that this phenomenon exists,

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:44.720
pure wakefulness in a completely paralyzed body in the non REM state. I think that would be

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:51.200
a major pro progress in the consciousness community, because then we have subtracted all

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:58.720
perceptual content, we have subtracted the self, we have subtracted the first person perspective.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:06.080
But we have some phenomenal experience, this embodied even, although it is of course neurologically

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:12.880
speaking, you experience a part of your brain, which is of course then politically incorrect

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.600
and all the meditators don't like it, because it interferes with their mortality denial.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:27.040
So this gives you an idea where I go, I think we should try to aim at a minimal model explanation

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:34.640
and actually say, what is that which cannot be subtracted from conscious experience?

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:44.480
And I think it is the silent clarity involved in wakefulness somehow. And that's the elephant,

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:51.920
and there are many blind who touch it from very, very many different directions over the centuries.

01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:56.080
So that's a bit where I'm going, of course, I have more to say.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:05.920
You can't spell all the beans yet. We'll have to wait to read it. No, Thomas, I'm super eager to

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.680
read this book. I've got two of your books on my bookshelf, Being No One, Ego, Tunnel Life,

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.000
Sitting Up There. I've actually got them very close to Dennett's books.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:22.400
It's like I've seen my books in a certain way. And I sort of put certain things because we've

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.880
had similar views, maybe not the same, but I tend to put them in similar places.

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.240
No, I think I've learned a lot of things. It's very fashionable to criticize Dennett. I still

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:38.000
know when I was a PhD student, I was allowed to peep in at the big guys at the Center for

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:45.600
Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld, Germany. And there were all these heroes, you know,

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:53.920
Jake Won Kim, and Robert Fangulik. And I met Dennett in a swimming pool, I still remember.

01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:01.120
You know, many people have this and that criticism, one never knows what he really says,

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.440
and what is actually is the thesis, and what is the argument. But I think

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:11.840
what we all underestimate is how much we have learned from him, from his books.

01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:19.360
You know, how important consciousness explained was in 1991 for many people, people forget that.

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.600
But he has been a real trailblazer, and I think a lot of people have learned a lot from him.

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.160
Yeah, I think that's a perfect note, because something I often ask my guests as we conclude is

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:40.320
if you had to think of around your perfect, what's it called, your perfect dinner,

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:45.360
good guests, or your Mount Rushmore, a favorite scientist slash philosophers,

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.480
who would those people be? You're like a top four. If you had to really think

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.800
best philosophers in history, or greatest or most influential to you at least.

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:05.680
Well, of course, in the modern debate of the mind-body problem,

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:15.440
since, say, all in tea place, after Gilbert Ryle, the concept of mind, people who stand out

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.920
to me are Hilary Putnam and Jaguar Kim. I've greatly profited from them.

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:28.960
But actually much more interesting is the completely unknown young people.

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:36.400
There are brilliant young people who are not going to name, because they will be embarrassed,

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.520
and probably would find a dinner with me boring, and had to be polite. But there are, you know,

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:50.800
there are what fascinates me. On a planet with eight billion people, there are some people

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:57.680
where everything went right. They have been smart. They had a normal, you know,

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:06.240
childhood experience with parents. They were in a rich country. They could go to a good university.

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:13.920
For some people, it works out. They found mentors. And there's a breathtaking new generation in the

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:21.440
consciousness community. You will only know their names in 15 to 20 years, but the standard

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:33.760
has really risen since my time. And if I look at this, they know math. English is like a second

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:41.360
language for them. They swim in the internet like fish, you know, and they will take this thing further.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:51.440
And I'm not criticizing you, but I always find it stupid how journalists or television people

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:58.480
only want their prominent old people, you know, while there are so many good people in their

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:08.000
end 20s around, which breathtaking ideas, but it will take 15 years until anybody takes notice.

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:17.600
So I would probably prefer if I could just quietly sit with these

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:30.160
young people who impress me by having a meditation practice, smoking five methoxy DMT,

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:38.240
and being good academically at the same time. There are some. And

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.440
sounds like my friends that I had made school.

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.840
Oh, yeah, right. How did that turn out?

01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:52.000
Very so. Some people did a lot of crazy stuff. Some people quit smoking completely. Some people

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.720
stopped drinking completely. Life changing things. Some people stopped drinking, some failed.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.600
So what I really appreciate is people who do their homework academically.

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:14.960
But for whom this is also something existential, not just careerism and who in their own life do

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:21.760
something, you know, to explore this. I've been this guy for all my life to explore this from

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:30.800
different angles and not just by reading books. And, you know, consciousness is not like any other

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:37.760
theoretical problem. In the end, it has something to do with your own life. And you can't just

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.520
be a nerd. It doesn't work.

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.080
Yeah, exactly. Now, I think I completely agree with you. I think it takes,

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:51.120
that exploration has to be part of it. You can't just sit idly and read books the whole time. You

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:56.880
have to actually engage with this. And it's the mind body problem is often say it's something

01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:02.880
that's difficult both intellectually and practically. You have to sort of engage with this

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:05.760
within both spheres. And I think you do that wonderfully.

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:10.720
I think that is also what this idea of a bewilderment school tour

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:15.440
alludes to there's a risk. I've seen this in training young people. You can be

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:21.200
in the top two percent and be a little bit on the autistic spectrum

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:32.160
and study perfectly well, write a PhD thesis, be superb, and then have no good ideas at 32.

02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:39.440
Just have no good ideas. Because you were only always good at passing all tests and knowing

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:48.880
everything. And this also has to do something with the, you know, the educational idea or idea

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:56.880
what academia is in an ideal world. It should be possible to also live an examined life and

02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:04.160
experiment with your own mind and your own consciousness. But I see the chances I don't

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.840
know about South Africa, but they're becoming slimmer and slimmer, because everything is so

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:18.480
competitive. And there's this fierce competition and scarce resources. And it breeds a certain

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.920
kind of researcher personality. And that may be very effective in some fields.

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:34.880
But somehow, I think in consciousness research, we need people with a wider perspective somehow.

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.480
Yes, you can't have that one, you can't have those students who are purely committed to

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.600
trying to grow their career. Whereas they're not really trying to actively engage with the topic

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:53.360
in that it incorporates meditation, for example, I mean, not many of them are going to actively do

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.680
the day to day meditation, if they know that they could just read one more book and pass the exam.

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:06.720
Yeah, it's in the time I have, you know, I've taught in eight German universities until I retired.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:14.960
They are under stress. When I studied philosophy, it was a much more interesting time. I mean,

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:21.840
I also had time to go to demonstrations and have myself beaten up by cops and go to India.

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.960
They don't have this time anymore. They are nervous about their CV. And they have these

02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:35.200
modular, I don't know if you have this in South Africa, this fully modularized BAMA system.

02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:42.320
Where they really have to plan how they study and what examinations are coming up.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.120
They can't waste a year on get falling in love with nature or some strange

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.920
philosopher and nothing comes of it, you know. Yeah, especially with an overpopulation crisis,

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:59.840
I mean, it's pretty much do or die at this point. It's either you get up and do it or you're just

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:07.600
going to fall behind. So it gets quite competitive. Yes. And somehow, we need protected spaces,

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:16.480
which are not an excuse for just hanging around and doing nothing. There's something really

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:24.480
a problem to be resolved there. Of course, because we know the other extreme, of course, exists too.

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:27.760
Yeah, exactly. It's always about finding that perfect balance. I mean, you're looking for that

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.440
perfect amount of book smart and street smart at the same time, just bringing them together.

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:39.920
Isn't it true, I mean, to study leave alone psychiatry, but to study psychiatry,

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:47.600
to study medicine is a very demanding path. It is, right? But he doesn't leave much space.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.480
How did you do that? That you could still read philosophy books? How could you do that?

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:56.240
I mean, it was very difficult. But I think it was, I think when you question things

02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:00.720
philosophically, there was a period in med school where I went through its deeply, deeply

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:06.000
depressed mood for a long while. But it was during that time where, I mean, as you brought up earlier,

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.280
I read a lot more philosophy journals. I mean, I read so many more philosophical books.

02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.320
And I mean, it was tough. You often feel guilty because you have to read the textbooks. You have

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:24.240
to constantly study all the time. I just made a plan because I felt like this is just too intriguing

02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:28.320
to not do. You reach that one point where you just got to sacrifice something else,

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:32.960
perhaps maybe not go out with your friends once in a while and read a philosophy book every now

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.720
and then or go out with your friends as well and get some sort of a philosophical view out of that

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:44.560
experience as well. So you're a bad doctor now, a bad but philosophically informed doctor.

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:52.000
Oh, hopefully not. I'll let my patience decide that. Now, I think it's, it's all about finding

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.520
that balance. And I think I did that. Well, I often used music as that, as that guide to

02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:02.480
sort of that meditative practice for me, I think is music and like playing an instrument. I think,

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:07.360
yeah, so I think that's, and yeah, meditating as well. It's something that deeply enjoy.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:14.960
I mean, another area that is very relevant. We haven't talked about is in philosophy is applied

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:22.880
ethics. I once founded a research unit for ethics of neuro technology, like new interventions in

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:29.600
the brain becoming better. And of course, in medical practice, you are really confronted

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:38.080
with ethical issues. I mean, I once had to go, I had a very sad time in my life, and I had to go

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:45.680
to a bone marrow transplant ward and see 40 people die and not a single person survive there of

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:55.360
leukemia. And afterwards, I always said as a philosopher, the patients have me to be protected

02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:04.400
from the interests of the medical industry. And after I had seen the fantastic job, these gay,

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:11.360
intensive care nurses do at quarter to three at night, get paid a really bad salary for it.

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:18.800
I thought two things. I thought, no, it's all wrong from what I really saw at bedside,

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:24.640
the patient has to be protected from their relatives and the emotional needs of their

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:32.000
relatives in that dying process. And second, all the lazy people in my philosophy department

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.160
should be fired. And these people should be paid a better salary, you know, these intensive care

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:46.880
nurses. I drastically changed my views from seeing what is really happening on on such a ward. And

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:56.240
of course, they confront these issues. Never. I mean, about say, how do you call this assisted

02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:05.760
suicide, I think is that I mean, they have to make these decisions. And nobody ever technically

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:13.200
discusses the they would use little philosophy seminars. And of course, many of the solutions

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:19.920
they find are even illegal, they have to do them undercover at their own risk. They have to deal

02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:28.160
with angry relatives. I've seen the situations where the patient is ready to die. And the doctor

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:36.400
is ready. Everything's clear. But the relatives aren't. You know, and speaking of alleviation of

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:44.240
suffering, it would be good, I think, if there were specialized applied ethic courses for intensive

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:51.920
care nurses and doctors, so that they can think about these things in a more structured way.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:08:00.560
When people ask them for help, and people ask for help, and then they basically try to do the

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:08.240
right thing. I don't know if that appears in your practice. And in South Africa, it's very much the

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:13.440
same. I think the amount of philosophy that doctors are told, or even I mean, I think patients in

02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.360
general, that's why I think once I've heard you say that you think it should be important that

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:24.800
in schools, they have certain practices that are fundamental to us growing into sort of,

02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:29.280
I wouldn't say better adults, but I mean, certain things like being taught about meditative

02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:36.240
practices, being taught more philosophical ideas at a young age. I mean, this sort of grooms this

02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:41.520
would this would in practice groom a relative from a young age to actually be supportive for

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:46.720
that person, the sort of human skills that we tend to lack or tend to focus on ourselves.

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:50.800
So I completely agree with you. I think that's a field that needs so much work.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:00.960
Have you ever been exposed to medical ethics or applied ethics? Is this part of your study?

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:07.440
Yeah, we do. We don't do enough, I can tell you that. So they generally fall into very,

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:15.200
very superficial topics. They focus very much on principalism and certain ethical.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.840
Yeah. So you get into those just beneficence, non-maleficent. And then you just get stuck into

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.720
that. And then you go into casuistry where you focus on just case-based ethics. Then we go into

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:32.160
everything else, utilitarianism and every other form of it. But it tends to majority of the focus

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.960
is on that principalism. And then as long as you're not doing harm, you're doing good,

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:42.560
it's kind of like you don't. And this is actually a way of defending yourself from

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:49.440
the messiness of real life situations, isn't it? In your practice, do you ever encounter

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:57.760
a situation where you think, oh, God, I would really like to be able to call somebody now,

02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.960
a professional ethicist and ask for advice? Oh, yeah, a lot. Should it be something like

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.600
an information clearance house or something like that? No, definitely. So if you work in a hospital

02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:12.480
in South Africa and if you have these ethical dilemmas yourself, you actually do, you call an

02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:18.080
ethics board. There is one. Yeah, you get the team together and you actually have ethical

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.280
discussions regarding what is the best plan for the patient. So it is a fundamental feature of the

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:27.840
healthcare system in South Africa. The unfortunate reality of our South African healthcare system

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:34.320
is that it's overburdened, under-resourced, corrupt, and so there's just so many other factors.

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.040
So we never really get the chance to actively implement these in the best way they possibly

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:48.560
could. But for the most part, we do. Yeah. But yeah, Thomas, this has been a great conversation.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:55.920
We've gone through so many different topics. Sorry about this. I think it's partly my fault.

02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:01.040
I mean, I had a structure planned and then I just let it go. But it's been great. I mean,

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.640
I've enjoyed it so much. Anything from you, any final words, anything you want to say?

02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:10.240
No, no. I thought this was a great experience. We've lost the red thread completely.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:17.200
I hope it is good for some of you readers, some of you, some of your audience.

02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.160
Definitely. I can tell you one thing. They will love the episode. If there's one thing I've

02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.040
realized, the mind-body solution listeners, they come for the philosophy, for the applied ethics,

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:31.440
for everything we spoke about pretty much within the niche of this podcast. So

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:38.160
nothing swayed out of the podcast niche. So I'm happy with this conversation. Even though

02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:41.920
it's called mind-body solution, it doesn't mean we focus solely on the mind-body problem.

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:48.080
It's an exploration of morality, ethics, mental health, all of it. So it fits perfectly.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:56.640
Maybe just point to one general problem I see that will also occur, for instance,

02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:02.400
in medical practice. I think in the consciousness community, of course, there is

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:08.320
a lot of discussion and they're competing in models, but we are getting somewhere.

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:15.280
A lot has happened since 1994 and there is progress. And of course, many people would

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:22.400
disagree, but there is a general picture appearing on the horizon. And one thing I'm

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:32.480
quite concerned about is that 80% of humankind on this planet still live firmly in religious

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:40.320
images of what a human being is in a religious worldview and are also quite immune to rational

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:49.760
criticism. And they will not like what science and philosophy eventually tell them about

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:56.560
computational structures, consciousness, evolution, the nature of the self. They will

02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:06.080
not like it. I think the general world public is not ready. And there are other things coming

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:14.400
to them, the climate catastrophe, AI, and so forth. And what I have called the naturalist turn

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:24.480
in the image of humankind, in the image of man, large parts of the population are not ready for

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:34.560
this. And this also includes you as a philosophically informed doctor may work under an image of man

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:44.640
that many of your patients do not share. And a big problem is how one can still firmly defend

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:53.920
science, a rational evidence-based approach, but keep respecting each other, respecting

02:13:53.920 --> 02:14:00.240
each other's vulnerabilities, belief systems, solutions people have found for themselves in

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:07.760
their own life. That's a major task, you know, to stand the ground of science and rational philosophy.

02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:17.920
But still respecting all those others on the planet who are completely somewhere else

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:24.080
with their belief systems. And maybe we should also give some thoughts to that.

02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.920
I think that's a beautiful thought to leave the listeners with. I think that's something that

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.680
we're all thinking, everybody's trying to figure out how to balance that fine line.

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:36.960
And I think you said it perfectly. Thank you, Thomas. Thank you so much.

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.560
Thank you for the invitation.

02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:41.920
It's been an absolute pleasure. I hope one day we can have a round two.

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:44.880
Perhaps in our round two, I will set a nice structure plan.

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.040
Okay, okay, okay.

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:52.080
But I enjoy this immensely. This was wonderful. Thank you so much. And I've been looking forward

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:56.480
to chatting to you for such a long time. Your work has deeply impacted my own work.

02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:59.680
And I thank you for all your contributions to the field.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:04.480
Yeah, and for being such a fill, thank you for being such a philosophically informed,

02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:12.080
you know, as medical doctors, we need, we can't have more enough of people like you.

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:20.960
One detail you might want to mention, I don't know it, but that book we have been talking about,

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:27.280
talking about will go in the brand new direct to open program of the MIT press.

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:32.160
That means it is freely available to every of your listen, everyone.

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:37.440
It could be end of October. I don't know when they get the act together,

02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:40.080
but you don't have to pay for it. You can just download it.

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:43.440
Oh, fantastic. Once the book's out, I'll definitely be putting a link to it

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.480
in the description. So as soon as the book's out, I'll have a link ready for you.

02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:46.960
Okay, good.

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:52.880
Thank you so much, Manu. I really appreciate it, Thomas.

02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.480
Thank you and have a great evening.

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:56.480
Yeah, have a great weekend. Bye-bye.
