00:00.000 --> 00:16.800
Jaja, you have a great approach of addressing the problems of consciousness. You go through

00:16.800 --> 00:22.000
the why, the how, the why not, the what, the where. So these are talking about the heart

00:22.000 --> 00:27.600
problem, the binding problem. What is the difference between conscious and unconscious

00:27.600 --> 00:33.520
brain processes? Where is the seat of consciousness? So I'd like you to start this conversation by

00:33.520 --> 00:39.040
running us through these processes. And in doing so, I'd also appreciate if you could talk me

00:39.040 --> 00:44.000
through your views on all of this prior to your quantum biology revolution, because it's always

00:44.000 --> 00:49.040
interesting to see how someone's view changes over time as well, regarding your concepts.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.280
Okay. So first, why are we interested in consciousness? Because if you look, if you

00:57.280 --> 01:03.680
get to the butcher shop and you look at a brain from a cow, it just looks like meat. That's what

01:03.680 --> 01:10.320
our brain would look like, a lump of meat. And the strangest thing in the universe, in my view,

01:10.320 --> 01:17.680
is the fact that a lump of meat can know it's there. And that to me is profoundly puzzling. And

01:17.920 --> 01:24.480
strange, because nothing else outside of that lump of meat inside our heads and presumably other

01:24.480 --> 01:30.080
people's or other animal's head has this property of knowing itself, knowing that it is around,

01:30.080 --> 01:39.440
that it is a thing. And that property is kind of mysterious, because it's outside of science.

01:39.440 --> 01:46.880
Science does not talk about this. It's not an area that can ever look inside our heads. And this

01:47.200 --> 01:53.040
describes our experience. It's only a first person account that we can have a go of our

01:53.040 --> 01:58.640
experience. And yet, it's the most important part of us. It's what would life be like if we were

01:58.640 --> 02:05.760
totally zombies, as the conscious community tends to call it. If we were zombies that have no

02:06.320 --> 02:12.320
consciousness, what would be the purpose of life then? So it's profoundly important. It's something

02:12.320 --> 02:21.360
that, in one way or another, I've always had an interest in. I've always been interested in the

02:21.360 --> 02:29.120
history of ideas and history of ideas going back to the myths and stories and the religious basis

02:29.120 --> 02:35.360
of where the religion comes from. It seems to come from the same question, really, that what is it

02:35.360 --> 02:42.000
that's inside us that is the us that is important to us and makes us feel that we're worth

02:42.080 --> 02:51.040
maintaining our life. So that, to me, is the most profound and interesting question of not only

02:51.040 --> 02:59.520
science and the whole of the world. Of course, not only science deals with the puzzle of

02:59.520 --> 03:08.000
consciousness, lots of literature and art also is around this strange understanding we have of

03:08.000 --> 03:18.320
ourselves and our perceptions. So that's always been the puzzle. And I didn't really get interested

03:18.320 --> 03:27.600
in trying to figure it out scientifically until over 20, 25 years ago, something like that, I guess,

03:28.320 --> 03:40.160
when I was, I wrote a book called Quantum Evolution, it was published in 2000. I became

03:40.160 --> 03:46.560
interested in the idea that quantum mechanics may be involved in life, in life more generally,

03:46.560 --> 03:53.760
not consciousness at this stage, but I thought it might be involved in evolution and I grew in

03:53.760 --> 04:00.320
touch with the, because I didn't know very much if anything at all about quantum mechanics, I got

04:00.320 --> 04:08.400
in touch with Jim Alcalely, who is a famous broadcaster and physicist, who was at the same

04:08.400 --> 04:15.520
university as me at the University of Surrey. And we, and it was then about evolution and mutation

04:15.520 --> 04:20.400
and whether quantum mechanics may be involved in this. And, you know, we're still pursuing that

04:21.360 --> 04:27.920
at the University of Surrey and unraveling that question of whether quantum mechanics is involved

04:27.920 --> 04:36.400
in mutation. But it did get me profoundly interested in the role of quantum mechanics in life more

04:36.400 --> 04:46.400
generally. And then I thought it's a book and I persuaded a publisher to give me an advance to

04:46.400 --> 04:52.160
write it, which was called Quantum Evolution. Now, in the book proposal, I had chapter 13,

04:53.200 --> 04:59.600
which was reserved for probably the most famous consciousness idea, the idea put forward by

05:00.800 --> 05:04.720
Roger Penrose and Stuart Hammerhoff, that consciousness can be explained by quantum

05:04.720 --> 05:10.320
mechanics and it's going to do gravity and gravitational collapse of wave functions.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.480
That sounded kind of interesting. And I thought, well, that's a good thing for chapter 13. That was

05:16.480 --> 05:22.080
the final chapter of the book, which otherwise looked at things like enzymes and DNA and that

05:22.080 --> 05:27.040
kind of thing. So, but chapter 13, I thought, okay, it's consciousness. And then when I started

05:27.040 --> 05:32.480
reading it, I knew enough about quantum mechanics at the time to kind of gave me pause and thought,

05:33.200 --> 05:39.200
well, actually, what they're proposing, Hammerhoff and Penrose doesn't work.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.960
They propose an interesting idea that structures called microtubules in the brain, which transport

05:48.960 --> 05:54.320
neurotransmitters up and down neurons, that they could be in a quantum mechanical state.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.480
And by this time, by the time I got to chapter 13, when writing the book, I'll get

05:58.480 --> 06:04.800
new a lot about quantum mechanics, a lot more than I did before I put it down as a topic for

06:04.800 --> 06:11.120
chapter 13. And I realized, no, that's not going to work. Microtubules are the busiest structures

06:11.120 --> 06:16.240
in the brain and always doing stuff. There's no way they could be in a quantum mechanical state.

06:17.200 --> 06:23.280
So I was convinced by their story, but reading Roger Penrose is, I then read Roger Penrose's

06:24.240 --> 06:29.680
book, Emperor of the Mind. Emperor of the Mind, the Emperor of the New Clothes,

06:29.680 --> 06:35.040
as I think of Roger Penrose, his book, On Consciousness, who come to me the title in a moment,

06:35.040 --> 06:41.200
but he convinced me that consciousness is a kind of field. And that's the fundamental idea that

06:41.200 --> 06:47.440
goes behind all of young field theories of consciousness and my own idea that when I look

06:47.520 --> 06:55.760
at my window here in the UK, and I see trees, I see wall, I see people moving around,

06:56.720 --> 07:01.440
I don't see them as independent things. They're all part of a single structure,

07:01.440 --> 07:13.680
which is my conscious mind. And how do you account for that in science? When, if we encode

07:13.760 --> 07:19.520
information, say, in a computer, it's all split down into binary digits. And one binary digit will

07:19.520 --> 07:24.480
be there, another will be over there, and they're all distributed all over the place. And this

07:24.480 --> 07:31.360
brings us to the binding problem, which is a famous problem in consciousness, that how is all

07:31.360 --> 07:37.040
the information bound up in your brain, or the matter is divided up into lots of discrete units,

07:37.040 --> 07:43.520
like atoms and neurons, et cetera, biomolecules or microtubules, they're all separate stuff.

07:44.320 --> 07:50.560
And information is distributed amongst all of them. So for example, if I'm looking at the trees

07:50.560 --> 07:56.480
across the road, facets of the trees such as the color of the leaves, the color of the bark,

07:56.480 --> 08:02.560
the shape of the leaves, the texture, the movement of the branches as they're swaying in the wind,

08:02.560 --> 08:07.680
all of those facets are encoded in different parts of our brains, in different neurons,

08:07.680 --> 08:12.800
in different areas of the brain. But that's not what it feels like. It feels like our conscious

08:12.800 --> 08:20.320
mind is stuck together. It's a single physical entity of which we are at the center of. And

08:20.880 --> 08:27.360
how do you make that? And what Roger Penrose proposed in his Emperor of the Mind, or whatever the

08:27.440 --> 08:33.760
book is called, something like that, is that it was a field. And what we mean by field is like

08:33.760 --> 08:40.320
the gravitational field that holds us, holds me on my seat at the moment. If you're standing up,

08:41.360 --> 08:48.160
it holds you to the ground. And the field is everywhere around, it's invisible, it's everywhere.

08:48.880 --> 08:53.360
But the field that the soul of your feet, if you're standing on the ground is an integration

08:53.360 --> 08:59.040
of the mass of your body and the mass of the entire planet. That's what's holding you at

08:59.920 --> 09:06.160
the soles of your feet to the ground. And that's kind of remarkable. And that's feature of fields,

09:06.160 --> 09:11.920
physical fields, that all of the information is distributed everywhere within the field. It is

09:11.920 --> 09:20.240
indivisible. There's no place where the soles of your feet or the continent of Australia,

09:20.240 --> 09:26.880
which is contributing to you being standing at that point, it's everywhere within the field. It's

09:26.880 --> 09:32.000
not just in Australia, it's at the soles of your feet as well, that information which provides a

09:32.000 --> 09:38.160
little bit of the gravitational force that holds you there. And that's really I thought what we

09:38.160 --> 09:42.560
needed for consciousness. Penrose thought that many people before him have thought that. And

09:42.560 --> 09:47.760
when I did more research, it goes back to guest out philosophers back in the early part of the

09:47.840 --> 09:54.800
20th century, they also proposed that consciousness was some kind of field. But that kind of fell

09:54.800 --> 10:01.360
out of favor when neuroscientists started studying the brain and seeing that when you see neurons,

10:01.360 --> 10:08.960
you don't see fields, you see neurons and they communicate by these synapses and neuron firing

10:08.960 --> 10:14.880
and all that kind of stuff. And that doesn't involve fields. So the idea that consciousness

10:14.880 --> 10:25.760
was some kind of field fell into disuse, if you like. Penrose re-energized it with his proposal

10:25.760 --> 10:31.360
that it was a quantum field. But the quantum mechanics, what quantum mechanics does is it

10:31.360 --> 10:39.360
turns matter into a field. So if you have an atom of matter that's behaving quantum mechanically,

10:39.360 --> 10:42.960
then it doesn't have a fixed position in space, just like the information of the

10:43.520 --> 10:49.520
of the mass of Australia isn't a fixed position in the gravitational field of the earth, it's

10:49.520 --> 10:57.360
everywhere. Well, an atom can be everywhere in quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics is really

10:57.920 --> 11:04.480
a science about fields. So if there was in the brain a quantum mechanical field, then it could

11:04.480 --> 11:11.280
account for consciousness. But the problem is in making quantum mechanical fields out of matter

11:11.280 --> 11:18.240
is hard. Normally, you have to have a very simple system, an atom or two in a box cooled down to

11:18.240 --> 11:25.920
absolute zero as close as you can get to it in a vacuum on an optical table, which will remove any

11:25.920 --> 11:31.280
vibrations or anything. And when you've got all this, you might retain a quantum mechanical state,

11:31.280 --> 11:35.920
those two or three atoms can behave as a single entity for, you know,

11:36.720 --> 11:42.720
in picoseconds or some very short length of time. But that's not going to happen in the brain.

11:43.520 --> 11:49.520
So although I was convinced that quantum that consciousness is a field, I wasn't convinced

11:49.520 --> 11:56.720
that it could be done by a matter field quantum mechanical matter field. So I looked around for

11:56.720 --> 12:01.280
what is there any other field in the brain. And of course, there is the field that people have

12:01.280 --> 12:06.240
been looking at for over a century, even then when I was first thinking about it,

12:06.240 --> 12:12.640
people knew that was the brain generates its own electromagnetic field. And that electromagnetic

12:12.640 --> 12:18.720
field is what physicians measure when they put the electrodes on your skull to do an EEG,

12:18.720 --> 12:26.000
they've been measuring it for 100 years or more. And mostly they've thought it's just

12:26.960 --> 12:32.000
there's just a consequence of the brain's activity, but doesn't impact on the brain's

12:32.000 --> 12:38.800
activity in any way. It's often described as the steam whistle of a steam train generates

12:39.360 --> 12:45.440
a whistle, we know about it, you can detect it with the EEG electrodes, but it doesn't function in

12:45.440 --> 12:52.000
any way. But it occurred to me, well, if consciousness isn't in the matter of the brain,

12:52.240 --> 12:56.320
in the electromagnetic field generated by brain, the brain's activity,

12:56.320 --> 13:01.920
then it already has some very interesting properties. For example, it contains all of the

13:01.920 --> 13:09.520
information in firing neurons. And that's kind of useful, because we've got an awful lot of

13:09.520 --> 13:16.560
information on conscious mind, it's distributed all over the brain. But in the brain's ear and field

13:16.560 --> 13:22.720
is everywhere within the brain's EM field. So that was kind of good. But it also has a very

13:22.720 --> 13:33.760
interesting property. And that's to do with how fields interact. And this, to me, was the key

13:33.760 --> 13:40.880
to thinking, wow, this could really be it. At that time, Francis Crick started to work on

13:40.880 --> 13:47.600
consciousness and the Nobel Prize winners for discovering the structure of DNA. Before Francis

13:47.600 --> 13:54.080
Crick worked on consciousness, working on consciousness as a scientist was like working

13:54.080 --> 14:02.320
on fairies. I'm going to study fairies from now on. It was a career destroying move, if you said

14:02.320 --> 14:06.640
you're going to work on consciousness. Nobody worked on consciousness. It was considered only

14:06.640 --> 14:13.280
crackbots worked on consciousness. But then this mega brain, Francis Crick started to work on

14:13.280 --> 14:18.240
consciousness and suddenly became respectable to think about consciousness. So he put a lot of

14:18.880 --> 14:25.920
gave conscious the consciousness field a really big boost. What he said was the best way to get

14:25.920 --> 14:30.080
into studying the brain is first of all, start with looking at the correlates of consciousness.

14:30.720 --> 14:36.240
What that means is, when we, for example, I'm always losing my glasses on them.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.600
When I take them off and I can't find them, and they're somewhere on a very messy desktop,

14:43.600 --> 14:47.760
I'm looking at that desktop and I can't see my glasses, then suddenly I can see them.

14:49.280 --> 14:56.160
Now, what happens between the millisecond before I saw them, when I was looking at them,

14:56.880 --> 15:03.600
the image of them was on my retina, but I still wasn't seeing them. And then suddenly I can see

15:03.600 --> 15:11.680
them. What happens in that few milliseconds between the image entering my retina, being in

15:11.680 --> 15:17.840
my brain, being processed, but I'm not seeing them. And when you see, when you become consciously

15:17.840 --> 15:23.760
aware of my glasses, in this case, and what a number of studies have demonstrated in the 1990s

15:23.760 --> 15:31.120
mostly, and the early 2000s, is that the best correlates of consciousness is not the neuron

15:31.120 --> 15:40.720
firing per se, but when neurons fire in sync. Though I'll be nearly there to the end of the

15:40.720 --> 15:48.000
where we get to the next moment. But when they fire in sync, you become conscious. Now, that's a

15:48.000 --> 15:54.960
bit of a puzzle, because neurons process information in independent, you know, the shape of my

15:54.960 --> 16:00.400
glasses, the colors of my glasses, all of those features will be processed in independent neurons.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.280
They're all firing, but not in sync. And then they get in sync, and suddenly I'm aware of them. Why?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.880
Informate, they're going through the same neural pathways, as we know.

16:09.840 --> 16:16.560
But there's a feature of electromagnetic waves, which explains it. When electromagnetic waves,

16:16.640 --> 16:23.840
like any wave, if they're waving in sync, then they have what's called constructive interference.

16:23.840 --> 16:29.600
The signal is amplified, because all of the waves peak some troughs, match up, and you get a bigger

16:29.600 --> 16:34.720
signal. It's like two waves in the sea. If they're waving in sync, then you're going to get a bigger

16:34.720 --> 16:41.040
wave. Whereas if they're waving out of sync, then the wave will be destroyed. So if consciousness

16:41.520 --> 16:46.000
is the brain's electromagnetic field, then we would expect it to correlate with

16:46.000 --> 16:52.320
synchronously firing neurons. And in the 1990s, that was demonstrated in monkeys and mice,

16:52.320 --> 16:58.800
and later in humans. That is the best correlate of consciousness. So it just made sense to me that,

16:58.800 --> 17:03.520
okay, all we need to do is switch from the matter of the brain to the electromagnetic field of the

17:03.520 --> 17:08.480
brain, you solve the binding problem, all your information is stuck together, and it matches

17:08.480 --> 17:13.680
up with the strongest correlates of consciousness, synchronous firing. And he explains why synchronous

17:13.680 --> 17:22.000
firing is associated with consciousness. So that was a revelation to me. And then it all made sense,

17:22.000 --> 17:27.760
and I thought, well, surely someone must have published about this idea before. I searched

17:27.760 --> 17:33.680
around, and no one did. Well, I might as well put a paper or two in, and I did. I met and had published

17:33.680 --> 17:41.040
a couple of papers on this idea. And that was more than 20 years ago now. And mostly it's been

17:41.040 --> 17:47.520
not taken seriously for most of those two decades or so. But now it's beginning to gain some momentum

17:47.520 --> 17:53.520
partly because of all the other theories of consciousness have kind of failed to really

17:53.520 --> 17:58.880
make progress in understanding a phenomenon where people say, well, we need something else.

17:58.880 --> 18:05.040
And I think that's what we need. The understanding the brains in field is where our conscious mind

18:05.040 --> 18:09.440
sits. So a very long explanation that gets us to the beginning of the story.

18:10.320 --> 18:14.720
I mean, this is just the very beginning for for all those who are not familiar. Let's let's let's

18:14.720 --> 18:20.240
define it. I mean, you call it the consciousness electromagnetic information theory, field theory,

18:20.240 --> 18:26.000
sorry, so the semi field theory. Do you want to define that for people? Yeah, so it's conscious

18:26.640 --> 18:32.320
information because it's encodes information and information. I mean information about the outside

18:32.320 --> 18:38.160
world. So this excludes EM fields that generated by toasters and stuff like this, which are not

18:38.160 --> 18:45.200
really communicating anything useful about the outside world. So it's information that is from

18:45.200 --> 18:52.080
our senses. And that gets from our memory and neurons, they get transmitted into the brains in

18:52.080 --> 18:57.760
field. And what is interesting about the brains in field that was discovered more

18:59.680 --> 19:05.920
after my first papers on consciousness is that it does influence neuron firing. Because if that's

19:05.920 --> 19:10.720
all that happened, if it was transmitted, the information is transmitted into the brains in

19:10.720 --> 19:16.160
field, then who cares? It's there. It's a reflection of the information in the brain, but it's not

19:16.160 --> 19:23.920
doing anything. But if if the brains in field influences neuron firing, then it can have a

19:23.920 --> 19:29.600
feedback that your conscious mind can start pulling on the levers of the neurons. And that's

19:29.600 --> 19:35.200
exactly what it's done. It's it does lots of studies, including some more recently, my own lab

19:35.200 --> 19:40.160
have looked at the effect of EM fields on neurons and neurons are both transmitters

19:40.960 --> 19:47.280
of information into the brain's electromagnetic field. But they are also receivers of that

19:47.280 --> 19:53.920
information. So it provides a loop of information from the neurons going into the brain's electromagnetic

19:53.920 --> 19:58.160
field where it all gets joined up. And there you can start thinking because that's where your

19:58.160 --> 20:03.360
thinking is happening in your conscious mind. And then your thoughts can influence your brain,

20:03.360 --> 20:08.320
can pull on the levers of neurons to do the kind of actions that we call our free will.

20:09.040 --> 20:16.480
That's the fascinating component of this is that you you've taken this complex subject of

20:16.480 --> 20:22.560
consciousness and which is a very deep philosophical question in its own right. And then you've also

20:22.560 --> 20:28.240
managed to now approach another topic that people often discuss in various different debates,

20:28.240 --> 20:34.560
which is free will. You've managed to tie these two concepts together. And it's interesting because

20:34.560 --> 20:38.160
when you first spoke about this, when I first read about it many years ago,

20:38.880 --> 20:44.720
I thought about the fact that people think about electromagnetic fields and they talk about it,

20:44.720 --> 20:49.760
particularly scientists, in a very mystical manner, you know, so like this is, and this is

20:49.760 --> 20:54.880
especially true in medicine as a doctor, I see it when you talk to another biologist or a doctor

20:54.880 --> 20:58.960
that when you start talking about anything regarding electromagnetic fields, they start to

20:58.960 --> 21:06.400
think that you're going down some sort of spiritual mystical, non-physical realm. Has that been what's

21:06.400 --> 21:10.880
been occurring to you as well? Do you feel like your theory is automatically placed in this group

21:10.880 --> 21:15.760
of mysticism? And that's not the case. Is this not ultimately a physicalist theory, if I'm not

21:15.760 --> 21:20.960
mistaken? Yeah, I think that that is a problem. That's one of the reasons why it's taken a while

21:20.960 --> 21:27.040
for it to become at least partly accepted, because it is grouped along with the wacky stuff, if you

21:27.040 --> 21:33.280
like. Yes, we have crystal therapists who are putting crystals on your body and claiming there's

21:33.280 --> 21:40.000
some electromagnetic field coming in and helping to heal you, and people talk about trees having

21:40.000 --> 21:46.720
these electromagnetic field auras around them, so it kind of plays into all of that, but it shouldn't.

21:47.600 --> 21:55.200
Electromagnetism is fundamentally scientific, since the work of Max Waller who showed that light,

21:55.200 --> 22:04.880
the light that we see is electromagnetism. It's a form of energy that comes from the sun. It's all

22:04.880 --> 22:12.400
electromagnetism. In fact, all of the things that happen on our world pretty much apart from gravity

22:12.400 --> 22:17.680
are all down to electromagnetism in one way or another. Chemistry is really all electromagnetism.

22:17.680 --> 22:22.560
It's pretty much everything that happens that we see is about electromagnetic interactions.

22:23.520 --> 22:31.040
It's not spooky at all, but it is not physical. Sorry, it's not material. It's not material,

22:31.040 --> 22:37.280
and that's the key difference that makes people kind of hesitant about it, because it's invisible.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.040
You can't see it. When you look at the brain, you see a big lump of matter and say, well,

22:41.040 --> 22:47.120
that's it. That's the brain. That's all that's happening. The dead brain, it's not happening

22:47.120 --> 22:54.000
well, but a live brain has an invisible electromagnetic field, which is just as rich in information

22:54.560 --> 23:00.560
as the brain's neurons. But as I said, it has that extra property of all the information being

23:00.560 --> 23:06.960
joined up as joined up as the information in a single photon or a single electron. It is completely

23:06.960 --> 23:14.640
physically united within the brain's electromagnetic field, and thereby binds the information in our

23:14.640 --> 23:21.280
conscious mind. So, yes, it's not materialist theory, but it is a figureless, physicalist

23:21.280 --> 23:26.400
theory. And that, I think, is when people say they're materialist, after me, it shouldn't really be

23:26.400 --> 23:32.000
saying that I have physicalists, because you can't explain our world with just material. You have to

23:32.720 --> 23:37.680
pretty much everything that happens is an interaction between fields, our current understanding of what

23:37.680 --> 23:43.120
matter is, what an atom is, and electron is. They are perturbations of fields, of electromagnetic

23:43.120 --> 23:50.800
field, gravitational fields, nuclear forces. They are all perturbations of fields. So ultimately,

23:50.800 --> 23:57.840
everything is fields. So this isn't a wacky idea at all. It's no more wacky than a materialist.

23:59.360 --> 24:06.720
Just because we can see matter doesn't make it not a field. It really is fundamentally

24:06.720 --> 24:11.520
another kind of field. It reminds me of one of the things you want. I mean, you mentioned this

24:11.520 --> 24:17.920
earlier as well, but the way you describe meat, and just this lump of meat, I mean, when you talk

24:17.920 --> 24:26.960
about that way, it sort of highlights this degree of absurdity. And it almost down and brings your

24:26.960 --> 24:33.120
theory back into sort of a normal realm of debate and chat, which is an important way to approach

24:33.120 --> 24:40.320
this. But I have noticed that other people also seem to have semi-field theories as well. And some

24:40.320 --> 24:46.320
of those do tend to go into the spiritual realms. And I think that's also hindering your own process

24:46.320 --> 24:53.280
and your own research. Yeah, I agree. I agree. There is a lovely story, actually, by a short story.

24:53.280 --> 25:00.800
You can find it online. It's easily found by Terry Bison called They're Made of Meat. It's a story

25:00.800 --> 25:09.760
of aliens who discover in some far distant galaxy an intelligence and sentience. And they're all

25:09.760 --> 25:15.280
excited about this. And then one of the aliens says, but the strange thing about this sentience

25:15.280 --> 25:21.440
is they're made of meat. And they're a gas. What? You mean that's stopped me by a butcher that we

25:21.440 --> 25:27.280
eat and chop and make steaks out of? That can't be sentient. That's just nonsense. And then you

25:27.280 --> 25:33.200
go on and on and on. And essentially, they decide to suppress the idea. It's so bizarre that

25:33.200 --> 25:40.240
consciousness could be made of meat. But that is what everyone else thinks. And it is far more

25:40.240 --> 25:46.640
bizarre to think that meat can be conscious than it is to think that electromagnetic field can be

25:46.640 --> 25:55.040
conscious. The latter is much more sensible and realistic and less wacky than the idea of a lump

25:55.040 --> 26:01.840
of meat is conscious. So, yeah. But yes, you're right. The spiritual stuff, I try to be very

26:01.840 --> 26:07.840
rigorous and not get into those deeply philosophical questions about meaning of life and things like

26:07.840 --> 26:14.080
this and panpsychism and all those kind of things and try to keep to the nuts and bolts of the,

26:15.200 --> 26:19.680
because I think there is a danger in many fields that they can get corrupted by

26:21.040 --> 26:29.680
sloppy thinking, sloppy kind of mystical thinking. And I'd like to keep it very scientific,

26:30.320 --> 26:31.520
scientific and grounded.

26:32.320 --> 26:39.440
John Jo, do you worry about the fact that even when people talk about materialist theories of

26:39.440 --> 26:45.200
consciousness, so whether it's matter, some sort of neuronal firing, whether it's a global workspace,

26:45.200 --> 26:50.640
whether it's integrated information, people are still going to be concerned that these

26:50.640 --> 26:58.480
electromagnetic fields are still merely correlates. And do you think that that still satisfies,

26:58.800 --> 27:05.440
satisfies the thirst that some people have for a theory that does not have this correlation

27:05.440 --> 27:09.760
issue? Because as we all know, correlation does not equal causation. The information.

27:09.760 --> 27:15.920
Yeah, absolutely. Essentially, we have to take a jump somewhere, but I think we have to make

27:15.920 --> 27:23.520
the jump as small as possible. And ultimately, we have to come around to the idea that something

27:23.520 --> 27:29.680
in our bodies is conscious. Okay, we know that we're conscious or something is conscious. And

27:29.680 --> 27:35.600
that's usually bizarre. I mean, as we said, we just made them out of meat and blood and bones

27:35.600 --> 27:39.840
and all the rest of it. And some part of it is gone. If I told you that your bones were conscious,

27:39.840 --> 27:45.920
you'd say, no, crazy, but it's no more crazy than believing the meat of your brain is conscious.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.720
So somewhere, because we have our own introspective experience of being aware,

27:51.280 --> 27:56.480
that's got to be a property of something in our brain. So we've got to pin it down somewhere.

27:56.480 --> 28:01.200
If we pin it on the matter of the brain, we're stuck with the binding problem. How does it get

28:01.200 --> 28:05.920
stuck together to give us our experience? If we put it in the brain's electromagnetic field,

28:05.920 --> 28:11.520
then that solves that fundamental problem of consciousness. And a lot more, it makes sense

28:11.520 --> 28:20.000
in lots of different ways that we haven't gone into yet. But it's got to go somewhere. And somewhere

28:20.080 --> 28:25.920
we've got to take the wacky leap and say that, okay, this thing that we thought was not aware,

28:25.920 --> 28:32.320
not conscious, is conscious. Because otherwise, how are we talking at the moment? Why are we

28:32.320 --> 28:38.400
arguing about it? Consciousness is a thing. Awareness is a thing. It's got to be pinned on

28:38.400 --> 28:41.440
something. The unfilled is the best one.

28:42.480 --> 28:47.760
Judge, some people have new theories of understanding the brain-body connection and sort of

28:48.480 --> 28:53.280
there are these new concepts like embodied cognition. The fact that we have a brain-gut

28:53.280 --> 28:57.760
axis, we've got relationships between our body and brain that are separate entities,

28:57.760 --> 29:04.560
almost like having two brains in a sense. The fields you're talking about are consistent with

29:04.560 --> 29:09.200
the brain. But what does that have to do with sort of serotonin receptors in the gut,

29:09.200 --> 29:13.200
other areas of the body? Does this entwine into these?

29:14.160 --> 29:22.000
I don't think it makes any difference from, if you believe consciousness is a matter of the brain

29:22.640 --> 29:28.880
or consciousness is the field of the brain, then we still have, it doesn't differentiate

29:28.880 --> 29:34.800
between the two theories in terms of whether there's a wider consciousness in, say, the gut

29:35.680 --> 29:44.240
or anywhere else. I don't think you need to, I mean, I'm a donor, a kidney donor,

29:44.240 --> 29:54.000
I gave my kidney. I don't think I passed any of my consciousness to her when I gave her a kidney.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.800
She is not good. She still doesn't like the things I like to eat. She doesn't like the music.

29:59.760 --> 30:06.880
So I don't think, yes, there is nothing about the body consciousness and things like that,

30:06.880 --> 30:13.120
which convinces me that anything outside the brain needs to be conscious. Because all of those

30:13.120 --> 30:19.600
areas that we think we are embodied in the rest of our body and in our gut axis and all the rest

30:19.600 --> 30:23.680
of it, they're all connected by neurons to the brain. So the information is in the brain, you

30:23.680 --> 30:32.000
don't need to have a consciousness elsewhere. And I think there's absolutely zero evidence for it.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.080
There's not any kidneys, there's hearts and other organs that have been transferred from

30:36.080 --> 30:41.280
one person to another. And there's no evidence at all that any consciousness is transferred in

30:41.280 --> 30:48.480
that operation. Tell me, John, do you know if any sort of, are there any newspapers, aren't there,

30:48.560 --> 30:52.160
that sort of describe EM fields anywhere else in the body?

30:53.840 --> 31:03.920
Well, there's lots of them. Yeah, heart, for example, we use ECG to detect heart arrhythmias.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.000
Sorry, I think I didn't ask the question correctly. What I wanted to know is,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.240
do you know if there's any sort of relationship between the EM fields that we do have in the body

31:12.960 --> 31:15.760
that link up to sort of the EM fields generated by the brain?

31:15.840 --> 31:21.520
Yeah, I don't know if you've, I think you have, I think I looked on your podcast,

31:21.520 --> 31:26.640
you've interviewed Mike Levine. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, okay. We've actually chatted a few times, yes.

31:27.200 --> 31:31.280
Yeah, fascinating work, him and Wendy Bean. Such amazing work.

31:33.200 --> 31:39.920
I think it's the prehistory of consciousness, the kind of thing that he's looking at. It's that

31:40.880 --> 31:47.200
he is already finding that the EM fields generated by the body have causal efficacy.

31:47.200 --> 31:53.680
They are doing things to help in wound healing and development and some, and those kind of things.

31:53.680 --> 32:01.280
That to me is a prehistory of what's happening in our brain, that the EM fields that were

32:01.280 --> 32:07.040
generated by the brain started in evolutionary history to make a difference to how the brain

32:07.040 --> 32:12.480
works. And instead of being, instead of having an influence on wound healing or development,

32:12.480 --> 32:19.520
they had an influence on our actions. And that's just seems to me a natural consequence of the

32:19.520 --> 32:26.560
kind of thing that Mike and Wendy and other people have found in the role of EM fields in other

32:26.560 --> 32:32.080
parts of our body. Once you have EM fields in the brain, then they are in the powerhouse,

32:32.080 --> 32:37.200
they are in the control room now. And they can start doing all sorts of things like making you

32:38.560 --> 32:45.600
making you happy, sad, making you do actions, preventing you from do actions. Suddenly, the EM

32:45.600 --> 32:50.000
fields are not just involved in development or wound healing, they're involved in everything,

32:50.640 --> 32:56.480
every action that you do. Mike actually might watch this episode because he just sent me an

32:56.480 --> 33:02.160
email the other day to say he watched a previous episode. I want to almost speak for him in the

33:02.160 --> 33:06.640
sense by saying, I mean, what he's trying to show at some point is that this bio electricity,

33:06.640 --> 33:11.120
I mean, this electricity, electrical signals can communicate messages, which is something

33:11.120 --> 33:16.560
we never really thought was a thing. And this is amazing work. I mean, he's showing how information

33:16.560 --> 33:21.920
can be transferred in ways that we could never imagine. And the impact this has, do you think

33:21.920 --> 33:28.480
at some point all of those bio electrical signals could perhaps create an EM field for the entire

33:28.480 --> 33:36.480
body that sort of communicates all together? Well, although the brain's EM field is everywhere,

33:36.480 --> 33:42.080
obviously, we know that if you have a transmitter very far away from you, it is less likely to be

33:42.080 --> 33:50.160
detected by your radio, you know, I can, I can detect the times when it was all radio signals,

33:50.160 --> 33:54.640
you can detect, you know, London, say, but I couldn't detect Edinburgh. And very occasionally,

33:54.640 --> 33:59.280
you might detect somewhere like Moscow or something like that on your radio, but very rarely. And

33:59.280 --> 34:05.440
that's because the strength of the signal decreases with the cube or the distance, is it? I kind of

34:05.440 --> 34:09.760
remember my physics, either the square of cube or the difference of distance. So the strength of

34:09.760 --> 34:16.560
the signal drops. So yes, the information, there will be some bit of information that say comes

34:16.560 --> 34:26.240
from your toe, that when it's injured, that will also impact the brain. But most of what the brain

34:26.240 --> 34:33.680
is doing is going to be influenced by the nearby EM fields, which are generated by neurons, particularly

34:33.680 --> 34:40.560
as neurons are the most electrically excitable, and are the biggest transmitters of, of signals,

34:40.560 --> 34:49.120
and the, and the most effective antennae for signals as well. So I would say, yes, it's possible,

34:49.680 --> 34:56.960
but I think the, the influences likely to go down the further and further away, the

34:58.160 --> 34:59.760
organ is from the brain.

34:59.760 --> 35:05.280
Yeah, and perhaps, and perhaps even the Mali nation might also control, because that's

35:05.280 --> 35:06.960
yeah, much more common within the brain.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.400
Yeah, but I'd be interested in Mike's view on this.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.120
We're going to chat about it soon.

35:15.120 --> 35:19.200
So when we have that other chat, I'm going to make a note to actually ask him about this.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.480
You touched on something just now, and I have a note here, just let me just find it.

35:25.920 --> 35:31.360
You said, at some point, I mean, when, when someone's alive, they can have this field.

35:31.360 --> 35:35.840
And then you said, well, unless they did, I mean, but sometimes when someone dies,

35:35.840 --> 35:39.280
you sort of still sort of see an electromagnetic field around them,

35:39.280 --> 35:41.440
there's still some sort of information being carried.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
So what happens when someone really dies?

35:43.440 --> 35:46.960
Does the information store somewhere within the field?

35:49.600 --> 35:53.200
Well, remember that the information is constantly changing in the brain.

35:53.200 --> 35:58.000
It's not that it's not like a hard disk of a computer that would be laid down forever.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.480
We do have memories that are in the Senate, or we believe memory is still one of my

36:02.480 --> 36:06.320
mysterious things about how our brain works, and we don't fully understand it.

36:06.320 --> 36:12.720
But most guesses are that it's, it's maintaining the synaptic connections of our brain.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.680
Those will be there, still there when we die, but they will start to disintegrate.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.600
So they won't last long.

36:21.520 --> 36:24.720
There is another interesting way of thinking about it.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.960
And I've not really, I've not really thought this,

36:29.680 --> 36:34.320
this is now when, when I go into dangerous, wacky area, but it's fine.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.200
This is an open space.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.200
This podcast is exactly what it is.

36:37.840 --> 36:42.320
But there is something that I think, I wonder what that means.

36:42.320 --> 36:47.440
But okay, information, information, according to quantum mechanics,

36:47.440 --> 36:49.520
information can't be created or destroyed.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.960
It's just moved around.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.800
So there's a conservation of information.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.240
It's a theorem.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.360
Or is that what they call it?

36:58.080 --> 37:01.760
No one's proved it as far as I know, but it's fundamentally quantum mechanics

37:01.760 --> 37:03.520
that information can't be destroyed.

37:04.480 --> 37:10.160
Now the brain's information, what the CM semi-field theory says is the brain's

37:10.160 --> 37:13.040
information has the quality of awareness.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.480
Okay.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.520
That's what is aware.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.040
The information encoded in the brain's field is aware.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.480
Okay.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.960
So then I have to say, I have to go on, look at that more deeply.

37:24.960 --> 37:29.680
You have to say, okay, well, is all electromagnetic field information aware?

37:29.680 --> 37:34.480
I say, well, you know, what's the electric, what can the electromagnetic field of a

37:34.480 --> 37:35.760
single electron know?

37:35.760 --> 37:36.880
What it knows is itself.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.840
It doesn't carry information about the outside world.

37:40.560 --> 37:44.880
What is normal and interesting about the brain is that the brain's young field

37:44.880 --> 37:50.400
carries this vast amount of information about the outside world and the inner world of the

37:51.200 --> 37:52.960
person, their memories and everything else.

37:52.960 --> 37:58.400
It's all encoded in the brain, so it's a much richer sourcing information.

37:59.920 --> 38:04.400
But it is information and it's never going to be destroyed according to quantum mechanics.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.000
So what happens?

38:06.000 --> 38:06.640
I don't know.

38:06.640 --> 38:14.320
I mean, every thought that we make is transmitted into the brain's field and some of that leaks

38:14.320 --> 38:15.120
into the universe.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.000
So what is that information?

38:18.720 --> 38:24.480
It's not connected in the same way, but it's still there, as I said.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.520
EM field is unified.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.840
There's only a single EM field for the entire universe.

38:28.560 --> 38:33.520
Universe has a single EM field of which our brains, our electromagnetic field is part of.

38:34.800 --> 38:41.360
So when we stop thinking and our brain stops working, do we become part of the universe's

38:41.360 --> 38:42.480
electromagnetic field?

38:42.480 --> 38:44.960
Do we get any awareness of that state?

38:44.960 --> 38:45.760
I don't know.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.880
I will find out.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.520
Not for a while, I hope.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.160
I was just going to say, hopefully not too soon.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.360
It is a kind of spooky, kind of interesting idea.

38:56.160 --> 39:02.720
Conservation information is if information, electromagnetic field information has the

39:02.720 --> 39:06.480
property of awareness and that's fundamental to semi-field theory.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.320
That's the only way we can account for consciousness.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.840
Then that information has gone off into the universe.

39:11.840 --> 39:15.200
Every thought that we've had still has that property.

39:16.240 --> 39:16.960
What does that mean?

39:16.960 --> 39:17.440
I don't know.

39:18.160 --> 39:24.400
It's crazy because I remember when I first, this was years ago, when I came across your work

39:24.400 --> 39:29.760
and Jim Alcalilla, I watched one of his, I think it was his, was it a Ted talk, if I recall,

39:29.760 --> 39:33.120
talking about quantum biology and then I went down this rabbit hole,

39:33.920 --> 39:36.800
learning about it, reading about it, then came across your work.

39:37.360 --> 39:43.200
I remember still back then being so fundamentally materialist that to me it sounded completely

39:43.200 --> 39:48.560
absurd and since starting this podcast, the more I've learned about other theories and

39:48.560 --> 39:53.600
understanding other people's perceptions, the way they work, it becomes a lot easier to empathize

39:53.600 --> 40:01.040
and sort of see the other person's viewpoint a lot clearer and but then you also don't know

40:01.040 --> 40:05.040
where to draw the line anymore because at this point, as we're discussing this, it's easy to

40:05.040 --> 40:09.120
see how we can tread down territories that are non-scientific.

40:09.120 --> 40:13.600
We can almost go into some sort of bizarre phenomenon that, I mean, it's not a bad thing

40:13.600 --> 40:18.160
necessarily. This is still intriguing things and it's not clear that the work is wacky.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.200
It still is quite cool that you can go down these routes, I think.

40:21.920 --> 40:30.000
Yeah, I think to me, the line is when it's no longer science and when it becomes no longer,

40:30.720 --> 40:36.640
when you can't actually prove what you're speculating about, it is no longer science.

40:36.640 --> 40:45.120
So people ask me, well, how do we know that the radio isn't conscious and I would say,

40:45.120 --> 40:52.320
how would you ever prove it was or wasn't conscious? And in turn, someone comes up with a way of

40:52.320 --> 40:58.400
answering that question, then I don't think there's any, that is part of science. We just have to say,

40:59.120 --> 41:03.840
well, as far as we know, the radio or my car or whatever isn't conscious,

41:04.160 --> 41:11.200
you know, maybe someday it will start talking to me and I'll disprove that theory. But until then,

41:11.200 --> 41:17.760
I'm going to take the default simplest way of accounting for the fact that my car doesn't talk

41:17.760 --> 41:23.120
to me, that it is not conscious. And I think we have to take the ideas that I was just saying

41:23.120 --> 41:27.760
about what happens to our consciousness after I don't think I'll ever be able to test that.

41:28.320 --> 41:33.840
So I count that as non-scientific speculation, which is perfectly okay,

41:33.840 --> 41:38.480
as long as we don't think it's science. We can speculate. Philosophers have been doing it for

41:39.280 --> 41:43.280
centuries and they go away with it. Why shouldn't scientists occasionally get away with a bit of

41:43.280 --> 41:48.240
speculation? I can just see the way someone could take this information and sort of a patient,

41:48.240 --> 41:52.400
maybe in a psych ward, listening to this conversation, now realizing that actually no,

41:52.400 --> 42:01.280
the radio really did say that to me. So I always have to put it in the podcast. I mean,

42:01.280 --> 42:05.840
this is just weird informational purposes only. This is not, I guess a doctor or one patients

42:05.840 --> 42:10.480
to really go around to think, yeah, okay, this is fine. This is purely educational. This is just

42:10.480 --> 42:17.040
a disclaimer for everyone. But tell me, the skull access is almost a Faraday cage,

42:17.040 --> 42:24.080
holds in all these signals, as much as possible, the fields at least. So it can't go too far. I

42:24.080 --> 42:27.920
mean, you briefly touched on that fact. I mean, it's not like you and I could step together side

42:27.920 --> 42:34.720
by side and sort of do almost a telepathic communication with each other. That's what

42:34.720 --> 42:41.600
you're saying either. No, I have a lot of people who ask me, and whenever you've been talking this,

42:41.600 --> 42:49.840
someone always pops up and says, does it explain telepathy? And I say, no. Because firstly,

42:50.960 --> 42:58.320
is telepathy a thing that can be explained by science? No, because no scientific experiment

42:58.320 --> 43:04.400
that's actually demonstrated telepathy. So it's like saying, does your theory explain aliens on

43:04.400 --> 43:10.160
the moon? No, because there's no need to explain them. There's no evidence for telepathy and all

43:10.160 --> 43:15.760
the scientific tests have shown nothing's there. But we want to expect it from my theory.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.400
You can see the headlines now, Semifield and the Fermi paradox.

43:24.640 --> 43:32.080
Yes. And no, I don't think telepathy can't be explained by Semifield theory. Because of that

43:32.080 --> 43:36.960
problem of the information is diluted as it goes further and further away from you. And also,

43:37.920 --> 43:42.800
your brain has developed, it's like going back to my Levine's work, your brain has developed

43:42.800 --> 43:50.880
to both make its own fields, own EM fields and decode those fields. I doubt if any other brain

43:50.880 --> 43:54.560
is capable of decoding it. It's probably only...

43:54.800 --> 44:03.200
Oh, John, I think I've lost you there.

44:04.080 --> 44:08.960
Ask in the brain, there's no fundamental code that all brains use. They're going to be using

44:08.960 --> 44:14.800
all different codes. So I think only your brain can decode the EM field information inside your

44:14.800 --> 44:20.800
head. Sorry, John, for a moment, I lost you, but you're back. Okay. As long as you're back, it's great.

44:21.760 --> 44:30.960
Okay, it's in the EM field. I could switch to another, I can see, I should

44:31.920 --> 44:35.520
to prevent it happening again, I could switch to another router.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.720
We'll give it a go. If it fails again, we'll switch over.

44:40.720 --> 44:45.200
Okay, we'll leave it as it is. While we're on that topic, though, I mean, what are the chances of

44:45.200 --> 44:50.320
other sort of electromagnetic fields interacting with ours anyway, not causing sort of telepathic

44:50.320 --> 44:58.480
communication, but actually affecting my own EM field? Yeah, people have concerns about this in

44:58.480 --> 45:04.880
terms of whether electrical installations, telegraph wires and stuff like this could influence

45:05.680 --> 45:15.520
how we think. It's feasible, I would say, if a very strong electromagnetic field can make a radio

45:15.520 --> 45:21.840
talk as it can when we have a radio receiver, it could interfere with the brain. But it's working

45:21.840 --> 45:30.880
on different frequencies, it's not going to be decodable. So by the brain, the brain is designed

45:30.880 --> 45:36.160
by evolution and development to decode its own information, not to decode the stuff that comes

45:36.160 --> 45:42.800
in the radio waves. And as far as I know, no one has ever managed to listen to a radio station

45:42.800 --> 45:48.480
just with their head. So we can't decode that information, whether it can do any harm to us.

45:49.360 --> 45:57.200
I think the evidence is very slight, if any, that there is any influence of power stations and

45:57.200 --> 46:06.000
stuff like that near us doing any harm. So my guess is not, but because there's been a lot of

46:06.000 --> 46:11.600
research and a lot of contradictory in this area of whether external EM fields can cause

46:12.960 --> 46:20.480
ill effects in people, I prefer to stay agnostic about it as I don't really study the literature

46:20.480 --> 46:28.400
enough to be very clear in my own mind about it. I think it's fascinating because you're

46:29.600 --> 46:38.000
discussing a theory that is so quote unquote, wacky, but it's not. And yet you simultaneously

46:38.000 --> 46:42.080
write a book that's like slightly simple and talk about Occam's Razor, I mean, William of Occam,

46:42.080 --> 46:48.400
and you discuss how you approach science in a very scientific manner because of the fact that

46:48.400 --> 46:53.520
you understand the difference between taking a leap of faith and then being agnostic when

46:53.520 --> 46:58.240
agnosticism is needed. So I just want to put that out there for you to sort of.

46:58.560 --> 47:08.480
Yeah, yeah, I think they, as you said, in my recent book Life is Simple, I make the case that

47:08.480 --> 47:14.160
what differentiates science from other forms of ways of making sense of the world is the science

47:14.160 --> 47:19.360
is committed to take the simplest solution to problems. To me, the simplest solution

47:19.360 --> 47:23.600
to consciousness is the brain's electromagnetic field. It solves so many problems,

47:24.400 --> 47:30.320
such as why synchronous firing should be correlated with consciousness. It gives us a way of

47:30.320 --> 47:35.280
understanding one of the other big puzzles of the brain, why most of what the brain does is

47:35.280 --> 47:42.400
actually non-conscious. And that's something we have to also explain. Because if the brain is

47:42.400 --> 47:49.200
just neural activity, then why isn't most of what the brain does conscious? We do a lot of very

47:49.280 --> 47:53.520
complicated stuff. A lot of people have argued, well, it's only the really difficult stuff that

47:53.520 --> 47:58.960
we do that we're that we need our conscious mind. No, we could be trying solving a really difficult

47:58.960 --> 48:05.120
equation and still on stand on our toe and become highly aware of a very simple stimulus of someone

48:05.120 --> 48:13.440
standing on our toe. So very simple stimuli can overwhelm our conscious mind. So complexity

48:13.520 --> 48:21.600
and consciousness aren't necessarily related. And yet we have to explain how some parts of

48:22.400 --> 48:27.440
some of the things that we our brain does is we're not aware of, like me waving my hands around

48:27.440 --> 48:32.800
when I talk, I'm not aware of that. And lots of things that we do blinking and all this kind of

48:32.800 --> 48:39.200
stuff, that's all done non-consciously. So we have to explain how the brain can work in two

48:39.200 --> 48:44.640
different ways. One a conscious way and one a non-conscious way. As far as I'm aware, the only

48:44.640 --> 48:50.640
theory consciousness theory really sorts this out is the semi field theory, another a and field

48:50.640 --> 48:56.240
theories of consciousness that says only the activity from synchronously firing neurons,

48:56.240 --> 49:03.600
because the waves of the synchronously firing neurons fire together, only that gets transmitted

49:03.600 --> 49:10.160
into the brain's electromagnetic field. If neurons fire asynchronously, and mostly they do,

49:10.160 --> 49:14.480
that information doesn't get transmitted into the brain's electromagnetic field,

49:14.480 --> 49:20.320
because the wave, the top of a wave of one neuron is cancelled out by the bottom of the wave of

49:20.320 --> 49:26.080
the other neuron. So it explains why only some information is consciousness, it's only the

49:26.080 --> 49:31.680
synchronously firing neurons, and that's exactly what we find. The rest of what the brain does

49:31.680 --> 49:35.520
is going to be non-conscious, so you get a conscious and a non-conscious mind.

49:35.520 --> 49:42.720
So all of those problems are just disappear once you just move consciousness from the

49:42.720 --> 49:48.480
matter of the brain into the brain's EM field. And I think it's a much simpler theory than others

49:48.480 --> 49:56.880
like IIT, which is integrated information theory, which has to propose this massively difficult

49:57.360 --> 50:01.440
mathematical equation is what explains consciousness and, you know,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.800
a level of consciousness can solve this equation for more than two or three neurons

50:06.800 --> 50:14.480
at most, and I just can't see that it's needed. So it's a simplest theory,

50:15.520 --> 50:21.440
and I admire that in science, and science has been driven by simplicity right from those early

50:21.440 --> 50:27.040
days, as you mentioned, William Rockham was the first modern person to make that claim that

50:27.040 --> 50:33.280
science is all about simplicity, and it has stood the test of time. The Higgs boson was predicted

50:33.280 --> 50:38.320
on simplicity grounds that were more complex theories, but the simplest was the Higgs theory

50:38.320 --> 50:44.000
that predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, and only one of them was the simplest of many

50:44.000 --> 50:49.840
theories to predict. One of them, the only advantage of the one that predicted only a

50:49.840 --> 50:55.280
single Higgs boson was simpler than the others, and that's the way it turned out. So science

50:55.280 --> 51:01.520
looks for simple solutions. Semi-field theory is, in my view, far simpler than any other theory

51:01.520 --> 51:11.040
that attempts to account for consciousness. As of mid 2024, are there any sort of labs, other

51:11.040 --> 51:15.920
people's work that you're looking to that are sort of showing support for this theory? How's

51:15.920 --> 51:24.960
the evidence looking for this theory, and any updates? Well, yeah, there was work in, I have to

51:25.520 --> 51:34.640
my brain is, my brain is useless, digging out names and particular studies, but at least tell us about

51:34.640 --> 51:41.920
the studies. I can send you the reference later if you want. There was a very fascinating study

51:41.920 --> 51:50.960
done by a group at MIT, and what they did was look at the brain neurons in the brain of monkeys,

51:50.960 --> 51:58.640
I think it was, that was recorded by multilateral recordings of the brain when they were keeping

51:59.520 --> 52:07.040
something in memory. And there's a lot of studies have done this, and they found that

52:07.040 --> 52:13.680
if the monkey is thinking banana safe, okay, when it recalls banana, different sets of neurons

52:14.320 --> 52:19.280
were fire. And there's a name for this, and again, this has escaped me at the moment, it will come

52:19.280 --> 52:28.240
to me sometime, it's that memories seem to not rely on particular neurons. A set of neurons will fire,

52:29.120 --> 52:35.440
but it won't be the same set of neurons when a monkey thinks of the banana two or three times,

52:35.440 --> 52:38.960
there'll be different neurons, there'll be five or six neurons say that will fire,

52:38.960 --> 52:43.680
but there'll be a different set of neurons, and that's very hard to explain in terms of memory

52:43.680 --> 52:48.960
when we think of memory in the synaptic idea of memory that I mentioned earlier, that it's to do

52:48.960 --> 52:55.760
with just the connections between neurons via synapses. A temporal drift, I think it is called,

52:55.760 --> 53:02.800
that the encoding of a memory drift between different neurons, but what this study at MIT

53:02.800 --> 53:09.440
showed is that what was preserved wasn't the neurons, but the electromagnetic field generated

53:09.440 --> 53:15.680
by those neurons. So although different patterns of electromagnetic fields just similar,

53:16.160 --> 53:20.640
yet the electromagnetic field of the neurons was always similar. So whatever was the memory

53:20.640 --> 53:26.080
of the banana was not encoded in neurons, it's encoded in the electromagnetic field

53:26.080 --> 53:31.520
generated by neurons. And that was a very fascinating study that I think could

53:33.200 --> 53:40.400
be very interesting. The other big area that I think, if anyone is listening who wants to try

53:40.400 --> 53:43.920
to make, I think it would be fascinating to make, and I think someone's going to do it, and

53:45.520 --> 53:50.800
I think it should be done despite people having fears about it. A conscious AI,

53:52.400 --> 53:58.560
that's got to be the way that things are going. At the moment we know that chat GBT is fantastic,

53:58.640 --> 54:04.560
does wonderful things, it's not conscious. We still haven't got, with conventional computing power,

54:04.560 --> 54:08.800
we haven't got any closer to consciousness. There's no inkling, there's not even this,

54:08.800 --> 54:12.480
there's kind of consciousness that a little baby will have as soon as it's bought,

54:12.480 --> 54:17.520
that's not no little baby is starting to go, go, go, go, go, go, and be, oh, I'm pleased to see,

54:17.520 --> 54:23.200
do spontaneous stuff like that. So despite the fact that modern computers are now competitive

54:23.200 --> 54:31.120
with the power of the human brain, but there's no spark of consciousness there at all.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.360
The reason for that, of course, according to the semi-fuel theory, is that all the

54:38.080 --> 54:44.000
conventional computers do is simulate what the non-conscious brain is doing,

54:44.640 --> 54:50.960
calculating and computing with the wires. That's what we've said that the neuron,

54:50.960 --> 54:56.720
the non-conscious part of our brain does, but then the conscious stuff, the information that goes

54:56.720 --> 55:02.640
through the brain's electromagnetic field, is where consciousness is, and that's where we do

55:02.640 --> 55:06.800
our conscious thinking, and that's where our creative thinking, that's when we come out with

55:06.800 --> 55:13.040
great ideas. We don't come up with them, oh, you rarely, sometimes we do, a non-conscious mind seems

55:13.040 --> 55:17.600
to be able to generate good ideas, but mostly we use our conscious mind to think and to come

55:17.600 --> 55:23.440
up with good ideas. That is lacking in computers because engineers, they call it electrical

55:23.440 --> 55:29.760
interference, EMF interference. When they build computers, they engineer them to not

55:29.760 --> 55:36.240
be influenced by their own electromagnetic fields. So they've engineered out consciousness in

55:36.240 --> 55:41.040
computers. That's happened because that's the way all electrical devices work. They don't want

55:41.040 --> 55:47.840
them to be interfered with by their own electrical activity. There's a fascinating

55:47.840 --> 55:54.480
experiment that was done over two decades ago. When I was first writing, yes, over two decades ago,

55:55.200 --> 56:00.320
by a chap called Andrew Thompson, a cobb's group, a cognitive science group at the University of

56:00.320 --> 56:07.280
Sussex in Brighton. I think one of the most fascinating experiments I've ever done,

56:07.280 --> 56:13.680
and no one's really picked it up and gone forward with it. I started to get funding to do work on

56:13.680 --> 56:19.840
it, but not take me forward. So Andrew Thompson did an experiment of making an AI, this was a

56:19.840 --> 56:26.640
long time ago, more than 20 years ago, but not designing it, evolving it. So it took something

56:26.640 --> 56:36.080
called an FPGA chip, field programmable gate array. And what these are, are a chip that can be

56:36.080 --> 56:41.920
reconfigured. The electrical connections can be reconfigured endlessly. So you can make lots of

56:41.920 --> 56:47.200
different configurations. So we took a number of them, let's say a hundred of them, and randomly

56:47.200 --> 56:54.000
set them to different configurations, and then tested each one for their ability to solve a task.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.360
And he gave it a simple task, I think it was recognizing musical note. And they're all rubbish

56:59.360 --> 57:05.280
at it, but maybe one or two were a little bit good at it, could do just slightly better than

57:05.280 --> 57:10.800
what would be expected from a random guess. So he took those, the best one, and then cloned it

57:10.800 --> 57:17.760
across the entire 100, and then mutated them all a bit. Okay. And then repeated the exercise,

57:17.760 --> 57:21.760
and then did it again and again and again for I think about a hundred generations until he got

57:21.760 --> 57:29.920
a chip that worked. It could now recognize musical note. So he had evolved in intelligence that could

57:29.920 --> 57:37.280
do this task rather than designing it. But it was weird. There was one feature of it that was

57:37.280 --> 57:41.520
particularly puzzling. It didn't work all the time. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't.

57:42.240 --> 57:47.360
And they worked out eventually, what was the factor? It only worked when the radio was on in the lab.

57:49.040 --> 57:53.840
Now, why would that be? Because this was an off-piste experiment that they weren't paid to

57:53.840 --> 57:58.560
work on. It was something they thought would be fun to do. So they did it at the end of the day

57:58.560 --> 58:03.440
when they finished the normal work as it goes into the evening and turned the radio on to keep

58:03.440 --> 58:09.440
themselves company. And they evolved the chip with the radio being on. So it was picking up

58:09.440 --> 58:15.440
radio waves and using them as part of its computation. And they needed those radio waves,

58:15.440 --> 58:21.840
EM fields, to actually do the computation. And that was one weird thing. The other weird thing

58:21.840 --> 58:27.760
about these chips were that there were some parts of the chip. It's a complex microchip,

58:27.840 --> 58:33.040
it's got lots of little circuits and resistors and capacitors here and there. There were some

58:33.040 --> 58:39.920
parts of it that were necessary for the computation. If they removed those completely,

58:39.920 --> 58:44.160
it didn't work. But they weren't connected to either the inputs or the outputs.

58:45.520 --> 58:50.640
But how do you explain that? The only way to explain it is that they're communicating through

58:50.640 --> 58:56.560
EM fields. So EM fields are within the chip are communicating with each other with different

58:56.560 --> 59:02.080
parts of the circuit. And also in that experience, they actually were picking up signals from the

59:02.080 --> 59:07.600
radio as well for the computation. So the fascinating conclusion of that is if you evolve

59:07.600 --> 59:14.720
an electrical circuit to do a task rather than design it, you involve an EM field, sensitive

59:14.720 --> 59:20.880
computer, one that computes through fields as well as through standard electrical,

59:21.760 --> 59:28.480
neural, and standard electrical connections. I think that has to be built on. And we have to

59:28.480 --> 59:35.200
build an AI that does this. And that also makes an excellent question. At what point

59:35.200 --> 59:43.280
were our EM fields generating this sort of potential in terms of our evolutionary journey?

59:43.280 --> 59:49.040
A very interesting question. Certainly somewhere in my guess is that the brain went through the

59:49.040 --> 59:56.320
same process that Andrew Thompson's experiment did. At some point, it started to, you know,

59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.360
communicating, first of all, the neural communication was all non-conscious. All of the

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.960
information was set down the wires. But then as more and more neurons got packed into the brain,

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.760
then it started generating and many of them were often seamlessly firing. It started to generate

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.880
its own electromagnetic field. And then those electromagnetic fields, and this has been demonstrated

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.520
experimentally, EM fields of the strength and structure of the brain's EM field. If you, we've

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.360
done experiments in our lab, if you apply them to brain tissue, that brain tissue will twitch if

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:39.200
you'd like. There is a feedback onto neurons. Neurons are sensitive to the brain's electromagnetic

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:47.040
field. Now, once that happens, then the actions driven by that brain are going to be visible

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.520
to natural selection. So natural selection acting on our brain that's now got electrical

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.000
interference will do two things. If the electrical interference is bad, is bad for us, then it will

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.800
insulate it. It will insulate those things. It will dampen down those electromagnetic fields,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.800
will make them fire asynchronously, whatever, get rid of that interference. So part of the brain

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:14.320
will evolve in the direction of being non-conscious because things you don't want to interfere with

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.680
with your conscious mind, like the heart beating or walking or breathing, all of that stuff needs

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:27.920
to be non-interferable. But if there was some capacity that was captured by electromagnetic

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.840
field interactions between neurons, then natural selection will kick in to develop that. And my

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.040
guess that has happened certainly by the time of primates, probably somewhere in Malamanian

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:47.440
evolution, maybe way back in vertebrate evolution, that that gradual takeover of electromagnetic

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.720
fields in terms of driving actions was selected by natural selection as being an efficient way

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.160
of dealing with complex situations by thinking rather than just automatically responding.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.280
And certainly primates have it, my guess is higher mammals like dogs and cats also have it,

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.440
but those are all guesses. Until we really understand and can prove what consciousness is,

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:20.560
it will be speculative. But somewhere, somewhere less than humans, I'm sure, has awareness and

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:26.480
consciousness like us, but it's a very, like us, but probably not very much like us. Can you think

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.760
of how you would think without language? That's a tricky thing, isn't it? How you would think without

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.600
language? Certainly we do, we kind of feelings and stuff, and that's what I guess animals are

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.960
thinking, they don't have language. So they think in terms of feelings, those can't be very complex

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.800
calculations and ideas that they can have, I guess they've seen food and say, oh, I'd like to be over

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:55.440
there and eat our food. And that's a feeling rather than in our mind where we can encapsulate

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.120
the feelings in words as well and start to compute with them by starting to think through

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:08.240
problems that I don't think animals have that capability. I just today, I think earlier I was

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.640
reading a paper, I can't remember by who, but it was on Orcas and apparently there's this,

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:20.720
they're starting to figure out a communication system that seems to be very much structured.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.680
I'm not too sure on the details, I just briefly came across this while I was at work reading,

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.880
and that seems fascinating to me because you're right, linguistics, language, this triumph in

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.760
evolution that sort of allows us to shape our views, shape our thoughts and sort of give

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.840
this synchronicity that's required to give attention to certain things, changed the game

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.520
for humans. This seems to be one of those game changes, I think. So it would be fascinating to

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.240
do these Orcas speak their specific type of language, because then this gives them a sort

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:05.360
of different EM field in that sense. Yeah, I think the experiments could be done once you

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.160
commit yourself to the idea that consciousness is the brain's EM field. The key question is,

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.520
does the EM field generated by a brain influence its own actions? And that's something that can

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.160
be answered. You can start to, you can imagine experiments that will then determine, you know,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:32.000
what percentage of brain activity in a particular animal is influenced by the animal's brain's EM

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.040
field. That will be a measure of consciousness if we could do that kind of measurement. I don't

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.800
know how we'll do it at the moment, but I'm sure it will be possible to do that at some stage and

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:48.560
find out how much animals are thinking consciously. Would you say this would be taken further with

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:54.080
regards to free will? At what point are they making active decisions to either go left or right in

01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:02.560
terms of... Yeah, well that does... The other thing that semi-field theory provides is a theory of

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:09.200
free will, which provides it for free, because it divides the brain's activity into those which

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.720
are non-conscious and those which are conscious. We call our conscious decision making those which

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.400
aren't made by the automatic part of our brain. We call it free will when we make conscious decisions

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:27.440
to raise my hand or not raise my hand. All of those are driven by our conscious mind. So I think

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:33.520
everyone gets into a muddle with free will because of the word free. I think we have to stick to what

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:41.840
the second word which is will. Will is when our conscious mind is willing our actions. It's not

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:49.520
necessarily free because it's all determinism ultimately in science. Jumping out of determinism

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.760
is very difficult. So it's still deterministic, but our conscious actions are those that are

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.160
driven by our conscious mind rather than our normal conscious mind. And that gives you a nice

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.680
simple explanation of free will. It doesn't require anything deep or philosophical. It's just

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.560
the stuff driven by our conscious mind, the free field rather than the neurons.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.160
Yeah, so it's sort of just a byproduct of being conscious in itself. So it just jumps along for

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:23.040
the ride. Yeah, yeah. Once the brain becomes conscious by having an EM field, then those EM

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:29.600
fields influence actions. We call that free will. I mean, if people say, you know, as I said, the word

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:38.000
free causes a lot of confusion here. If you think about what we believe our minds are doing when we

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:46.400
make purposeful actions, we don't necessarily think that without a preceding thought,

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:53.920
when I think, okay, I'm going to phone my brother. It may be because I've seen him put

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.640
something on the TV that's reminded of him. I wouldn't think that that idea will just pop into

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.960
my head without any precedent. And I think most of what we do, if we think hard about

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.640
every action that we do, it's perceived by some other thought. So I don't think determinism is

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:18.240
the problem of consciousness. It's never been. And in the past, people didn't think of it as being

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:24.560
non-deterministic. They talked about fate, that your actions will be driven by fate, not by,

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.000
and fate was something you had no control over. So the idea of determinant of being free will

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.800
being something or will being free, something that isn't determined by anything that's happened before

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.560
comes out of later thought in philosophy and Christianity, really had to be punished for

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.840
your sins. So that's really the source of where the idea of free will comes from.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.720
But if we just accept that there are some thoughts that we, there's some of our actions sort of

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.840
driven by our own automatic brain, and some are driven by conscious mind, and that makes a lot

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.840
of sense. And it's predicted by the semi-feel theory. And then you don't need to worry about the

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:09.760
philosophy. We touched on a species going from, from let's say, amoeba to humans, and obviously

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.800
maybe vertebras have this, perhaps mammals have this. What about humans? What about when we start

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:24.000
as embryos working our way upward into adulthood from childhood? When does this become active?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.840
Your guess will be as good as mine. Don't really have any insight. The key thing is that when the

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:42.240
brains in field influences the activities that a person is performing. And I think that's when

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.200
they become less than, more than reactions. So, you know, blinking is a reaction. If a fly flies

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.440
into your eye, you blink and you've got no control over it. Then you can see a baby, you know, might

01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:03.200
look this way and that way, and it will do the kind of pause and look at things. And, and,

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.640
you know, it can be pretty sure there's some thinking going on in that baby's brain.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.080
Once they start toddling around, moving around, and they laugh and stuff like that. I mean, I've

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.600
hardly any animals laugh. People say that some monkeys laugh, but so they can laugh at themselves

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.240
and they can find things amusing. All of those things are conscious things. We couldn't, we

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:32.400
wouldn't find anything amusing, non-consciously, for example. So, I think you have to ask the

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.280
question, what do we need our conscious mind for? And what can we do without our conscious mind?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.400
I can do all this moving around in my hands, non-consciously. I can drive a car pretty well,

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.960
non-consciously. I mean, we know that if we have an accident and everyone does that again, and you

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.040
think, what was I doing a moment before? You probably not be able to remember, because you have

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.080
all emotions that you're doing, I'm going on non-consciously. So, there's lots of things that

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:02.720
we do non-consciously. They're this stuff, like, you know, like a long division, we couldn't do

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.840
non-consciously. And there's another interesting feature of consciousness, that is, you can only

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.520
do one thing at once, really. And that's strange, because you can do lots of things

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.040
non-consciously, like me waving my hands around. I could be scratching my head and moving my arms

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:26.560
and I could be tapping a tune. All of those things are going on. But you can't say, do a crossword

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.960
and talk to someone at the same time, could you? So, your conscious mind is, this has been

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.160
established outside of the semi-field theory. But your conscious mind is what's called a serial

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.720
computer. It can only do one thing at a time. Whereas your non-conscious mind is a parallel

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.920
computer. It can solve lots of problems and be working on lots of problems simultaneously.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.840
So, again, you've got to account for that in the brain. Semi-field theory does it,

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.600
like that. It's no problem. There's only a single brain-em-field. Unlike the neurons,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.520
which are distributed and there's lots of different circuits, lots of different areas,

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.680
the brain-em-field from its perspective is singular. So, it's always going to be

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:13.760
only one thing at a time. Anything else will start to cause interference. So, it's identifying the

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.280
things that we do consciously. And certainly, we couldn't imagine talking non-consciously. You

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.400
couldn't have a conversation with someone non-consciously. You couldn't do anything creative

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.840
non-consciously. So, all of those things that we require our conscious mind for, when we see

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:37.920
those happening in, say, babies or in animals, then we've got to admit that they are very likely

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:44.080
also conscious. John, Joe, would you see the future of semi-field theory going? What would

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.640
you like to be done in terms of other people who watch this podcast, the thousands of people

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:55.040
listening? Where do you want some of these future scientists to take this and perhaps?

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:02.480
Yes. I think we have to take the brain's-em-field seriously and find out how it functions to,

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:08.320
as a conduit for information transfer in the brain. No one's really done that. I mean,

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.000
there's no one's even worked out how you can calculate how the-em-field generated by the

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.440
brain will influence neural firing patterns. All of those things need to be calculated.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.880
We need to do a lot more experiments on how neurons can communicate through electromagnetic

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:31.280
fields. And we're doing some of those experiments in our lab by applying external electromagnetic

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.240
fields. But it's tiny, the amount of work that's going on in this kind of area compared to what's

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.240
going on in other areas of neurobiology. And I think we need to try to use these principles

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600
to make a conscious AI. Ultimately, I think the only way that you'll prove a theory of consciousness

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:56.720
is by applying it to make a conscious AI. And the kind of work that I was describing earlier

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.960
gives you a route towards doing that. There are lots of other theories which will also give

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:07.200
you a route towards doing that, like IIT. According to IIT, commuters are already conscious.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:14.640
So to me, that's already disproved IIT. Global workspace has also been disproved because

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.000
computers can have global workspaces in the global workspace sense. And none of them have

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.880
shown any signs of consciousness. So we've got to wake up and kind of say, okay, well, let's

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:31.840
try to design a conscious mind based on different principles on, say, IIT or global workspace

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.560
or semi-field theory and let's see which one talks back to us. So would the goal then be to

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:45.440
create this artificial intelligence to match our electromagnetic field?

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.880
I think it's more than artificial intelligence. There's a conscious artificial intelligence.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.920
There are, of course, ethical issues there. And those have to be looked at as well.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.200
But the ethical issues will make any conscious being a person. Either way, everyone's trying

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.000
to do this. I think it's an inevitability at this point.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.480
Yeah, there is an inevitability there. And every time we have a baby, we make another

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.680
conscious being. So why not make one? And that would be a murderer and still go around and kill

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:23.920
people. So we can't predict what biological conscious beings will do. But I think the

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.400
advantage of it would be that we would be able to understand consciousness better

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.320
and, you know, going way into the future, we can think about the possibility of transferring

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.400
our minds to AI that's much more durable than these bodies are sadly going to decay in

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:48.960
not so many decades. So, you know, there are those kind of sci-fi ways of preserving humanity.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:55.520
And I think we will need them in the future. That makes it quite exciting to know that,

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.720
I mean, because it's obviously throughout the universe. I mean, we could in some way be

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.680
completely at the side of the universe if the tech becomes absolutely, if we can transfer our minds

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:17.120
into AI, then we could travel a lot easier to travel at sub light speeds to really explore

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.360
the universe. And then the question, of course, you mentioned the Fermi Paradox, why hasn't it,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.920
why haven't we already met the aliens who have gone through this stage and developed the very

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.960
durable forms of themselves? I mean, if a consciousness is an electromagnetic field,

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.240
could you transmit it? You wouldn't need a spaceship. You could send the big beam

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.560
of electromagnetic information across the universe. You know, there are all sorts of

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.720
sci-fi ideas that are so exciting and interesting, bizarre and speculative that we've got to go

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.840
and find out what there is there. And if you take the idea that consciousness is an electromagnetic

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:01.520
field, then all sorts of interesting stuff starts to emerge from that idea. It's completely

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.600
fascinating. And it's super exciting to see so many different theories of consciousness,

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:11.840
people taking leaps, people doing such great work. Thanks to you. Any final words, anything you want

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.400
to say or add? Do you think there's anything about semi-feel theory that people might have

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.680
misunderstood from this conversation or things you've always wanted to point out?

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:28.480
I just think that thinking that our mind is an electromagnetic field, an invisible form of

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.040
energy in our brain is, I think, interesting, fascinating, and it feels better to me than

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:39.920
to think my mind is a lump of meat. I think if everyone starts to think of themselves as this

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:49.840
entity of energy that is driving their brain, of electromagnetic energy, pulling the levers

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:56.400
of the brain, I think it just gives a different feel of what we think we are. And it makes so

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:02.880
much sense and it gives us lots of speculative ideas that we can take forward in terms of thinking

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.760
about what happens after death and all that kind of stuff. We're never going to know until we get

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:15.200
there, but we can speculate, nevertheless. And speculation is exactly what this podcast is about,

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.960
because although I call it mind-body solution, I don't claim to have the solution. Nor do I think

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:28.720
we'll find it, but hopefully one day it's possible. Absolutely. You've got to have an open mind,

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.240
but not so much your brain drops out. I'd say be passionately curious but reasonably

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.640
skipping at the same time. Absolutely. You've got to be rigorous. If you want to do science,

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.360
you've got to be rigorous. You can still speculate as long as you label it as speculation and this

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:50.640
is we can't prove this or that, but speculation is fine because it can inspire people to study

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:56.960
science and inspire people to do things that lots of speculations have turned out to be true. So

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:02.480
it's okay to speculate as long as we know that's what they are. Just look at how much science

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.880
fiction has become reality at this point. Exactly. It's phenomenal. Exactly. Indeed.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.640
Any final words, John Joe? Thank you so much. This has been such a... Well, thank you for talking

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:23.040
to me, Tevin. And yeah, anyone who wants to get in touch with me and if you've got any great ideas

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.080
to test me, feel thoroughly. And certainly, if anyone wants to make an artificial AI and

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:40.080
as the resources to do it, get in touch.
