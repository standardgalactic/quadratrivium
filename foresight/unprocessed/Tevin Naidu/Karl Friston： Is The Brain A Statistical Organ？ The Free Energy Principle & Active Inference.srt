1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
I've been reading your work for many years and you are someone who's managed to incorporate

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,440
so many different fields together. At this point, your free energy principle can be discussed

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,520
in fields of mathematics, physics, biology. It seems you've managed to cross all these

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,840
borders and I think it's perfect for this show. One thing I want to start off with is

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
when you think of the topic of the mind-body problem, you think of Rene Descartes and he

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,920
often said, I think therefore I am and you've now become synonymous with I am therefore I think.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
I think let's start off with that because I think it's beautifully poetic considering this

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,160
podcast is called Mind-Body Solution. Yes, I do like that homage to Descartes.

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:05,040
So the cheekiness of the reversal is based upon the free energy principle read as a physicist

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,120
and effectively this is a description, a principle that will be applied to anything that exists

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,800
and the maths tells you that if something exists in a certain sense then it can be read

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:31,680
or interpreted as making inferences. So if you allow me to equate inferring with thinking,

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:40,480
that means to exist is to infer. So if I am therefore I think. So that's the genesis. It's

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:50,480
one of those down that it's strange inversions. Speaking to the slightly sort of deflationary

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,880
aspect of the free energy principle, it's a slightly tautological aspect. I think at that

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,040
point it would be a perfect opportunity to let's play with definitions. Let's talk about free energy

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,480
principle, a Bayesian brain and perhaps active inference. Let's play around with these definitions

18
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,080
before we move to a formalism of the free energy principle. Right, so they're all very closely

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,120
related. So defining the free energy principle, first of all, what is it? It's just a principle

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,360
of the kind that you would remember at school in physics like Hamilton's principle of least action.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,840
And as such it is effectively a mathematical method. It's a method or a tool that you would apply

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,760
to a particular situation. And when applied to things like you and me, or in fact many other

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,720
animate things and biotic things, one gets an interpretation of the behavior of such things

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:05,840
in terms of active inference. The inference part is just a statement of sense making and

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,840
representation on the inside of the thing, where the thing in question can be a person

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,880
or a particle, it could be you or me. And that sense making speaks to making sense,

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,800
representing, explaining, inferring the causes of sensory impressions from everything else,

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:35,040
from the outside world. And the best or the most, if you like, inclusive way of understanding

29
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,640
that kind of inference and sense making, when applied to the brain would be the Bayesian brain

30
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,840
hypothesis. So the Bayesian brain hypothesis is the notion that we can understand our sense making

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,440
and to a certain extent with one commits to neuronal process theories, the underlying neurophysiology

32
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,520
neuronal dynamics, in terms of Bayesian belief updating, basically changing our physical,

33
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,400
biophysical states by neurodynamics to represent probabilistic beliefs, Bayesian subpersonal

34
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,640
beliefs, probabilistic beliefs about the causes of sensations. So that's inference, inference

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,200
loosely described under the Bayesian brain. Active inference is the simple move that you

36
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,000
acknowledge that the sensations upon which you're basing your inference are actively

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,280
sampled. You are in charge of the data that is subtending your inference. And that sort of

38
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,040
closes the loop between you as an inference machine, a statistical organ, or your brain,

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,600
at least as a statistical organ, and the world supplying that sensory evidence of those sensations.

40
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,520
And that story, that sort of closing the loop, an action perception kind of cycle,

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,520
a description of sentient behavior, appealing to the notions of active sensing and active learning

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,280
is one way of reading what comes out of the Fienta principle. So that's in my mind how

43
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,080
those things, how you triangulate amongst those three notions.

44
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
When we think about, I mean, obviously, as you said, they're all very linked. When you think

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,440
about the free energy principle, the formalism of it, do you think of energy minus entropy? And

46
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
then you obviously go into different aspects, surprise, divergence, then you discuss obviously

47
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,880
your internal states, hidden states, action perception, talk to us about how this formula

48
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
actually works. And how you, because a lot of people have noticed when they question you about

49
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,800
this theory, everyone comes from a specific field. So someone often tends to attack you from a

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,320
psychological perspective. Someone tends to talk to you from a biological perspective. How do you

51
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,840
navigate all these territories? And I think with that, I'd like to say that you, one of the few

52
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,200
people that I've noticed, who seems to be a genuine polymath in that regard, because you're always

53
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,200
able to answer these questions succinctly with a lot of definitions. And just beautifully, how do

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,760
you manage to do this? I have a lot of naughty and inquisitive students, so you get used to

55
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:33,360
answering questions after a while. Again, very gracious of you to say that. But it's not,

56
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:43,520
I don't think it's my wisdom. I think that ability to jump from different disciplines or just take

57
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,760
different perspective or views on what is probably the most important thing to all of us, which is

58
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,360
how do we work and why are we here? And is the gift of things like the free energy principle,

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
and the free energy principle, I'm not claiming that the free energy principle is just the current

60
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,080
formulation of millennia of thinking and physics and psychology and philosophy,

61
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,040
and probably nearly every other field, including behaviorism, economics and the like. So the whole

62
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:24,400
point of the free energy principle is that it is there to try and unify and to try and encompass

63
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,960
and thereby endorse all the various perspectives you could take upon scented behavior or choice,

64
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:41,200
the imperatives and write our decisions right through where do I look next in the next few

65
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:51,200
hundred milliseconds through to which school should I send my children to? And so the eclectic

66
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,000
aspect that is brought to the table by the free energy principle is just due to its fundamental

67
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,240
nature. It's a first principle account. And by definition, if it is a first principle account,

68
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
if it is applicable, then it should be applicable widely to various phenomena read or looked at

69
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,640
through the lens of an economist or a psychologist or a physicist or a philosopher. It's interesting

70
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:26,320
you say, oh, I talk about things like surprise information theory and entropy and intrinsic value.

71
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:34,240
You didn't actually say that, but I do talk about that. The whole charm of having a first

72
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,440
principle account that is sufficiently simple to write down mathematically is that you can see

73
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,040
that the same mathematical quantities mean different things to different people,

74
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,800
but they're all the same thing. So perhaps you're just to give you a couple of examples of them.

75
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,320
Underneath all of this is just basically a description of the states that I exist in,

76
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,800
those states that are characteristic of me. So how would I express that mathematically?

77
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,240
Well, I could just write down a function of any particular state that reflected how

78
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,720
characteristic it was of me. And that would be most commonly written down as a log probability

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,280
of me being in this state. Now, any log probability is basically a potential.

80
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,000
And if it's a potential, you can now read it in by analogy to thermodynamics.

81
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,120
That log probability of being in a particular state via me can also be read as a statistician,

82
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,720
and you can call that model evidence or in statistics marginal likelihood. If your information

83
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
theory would be called self-information, and the average of self-information is entropy.

84
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,000
If you were an economist, it would basically be the states that I aspire to. It would be description

85
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,280
of my attracting set, written as if you were a theorist dealing with vandal dynamical systems.

86
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,840
So now this same quantity now becomes an expression of utility or value. If you were

87
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,960
ET James, you would call it a constraint on the imperative to maximize the entropy,

88
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,720
and so on and so forth. So the key thing is that everybody's talking about exactly the same thing.

89
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,760
It's just that they've got different words from it. So the joy of sort of seeing that

90
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,120
central quantity under the hood being able to make sense to lots of different people

91
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:51,280
just is an expression of the explanatory scope of this kind of first principles account.

92
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,840
So everybody's right. They've just been using different words.

93
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,040
I think you're absolutely right. I think when people try to develop any theory or hypothesis,

94
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,040
it's always very important to sort of realize that we don't exist in a vacuum. There's so

95
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,560
many different fields of study that are studying the same things, but just defining them differently

96
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,920
discussing them very differently. But they all come together at some point and any good

97
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,840
theory needs to be able to explain these various expertise as well. There needs to be some sort

98
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,800
of a full explanatory version of all of these and there shouldn't be a gap and you manage to

99
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,400
bring these all together. When you talk about hierarchal Bayesian inference, it plays a very

100
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,840
central role in your work. And I remember when I was reading about this and doing computational

101
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,400
psychiatry as part of the blocks during my masters, I remember coming across your work and

102
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,640
thinking, this is so beautiful. This is the way you've managed to sort of incorporate this into

103
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,520
psychopathology is even more intriguing. Because I remember the first time I read about it and you

104
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,440
spoke about posterior and priors and the way it will dictate how someone experiences hallucinations,

105
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,440
delusions, and just general differences in their field of vision, etc. How did that come to you?

106
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,160
At what point did you manage to realize that this theory has a very active role to play in mental

107
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:22,000
health? Well, the answer is another strange inversion, I'm afraid. I started as a psychiatrist

108
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,680
and what used to be called a sort of mathematical psychologist or what I wanted to be a mathematical

109
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,640
psychologist. I think a clinical version of that is exactly as you say, a computational

110
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,000
psychiatrist. That phrase introduced by my friends, Reed Montague and Peter Diane,

111
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,240
has only been around for about half a decade. But now we're all computational psychiatrists.

112
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
So as a young man, I aspire to be a computational psychiatrist. So the free energy principle is

113
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,000
the denouement of that formalization. But I think it's a really important point you bring to the

114
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,440
table there. And I think there are two moves you have to make to appreciate the potential

115
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,000
applicability of things like the Bayesian brain of the free energy principle to the suffering

116
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,520
of patients that you might see in the health patients. The first move is to have a physics

117
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,520
of beliefs, a physics of inference, a physics of sense making, if you like, a physics of basic

118
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,800
sentence that is inactive. So it has to be sentient behavior. So it's all about choices

119
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,440
and decisions and how I move and indeed, how I control my autonomic reflexes, you know,

120
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,360
respond to my gut feelings and exert some sub personal control over my physiology and internal

121
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,680
learning. So that's the first thing that you have to have. You have to have a physics of

122
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:58,960
sentence. You have to have a mathematics that connects the foundations of our dynamics in a

123
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,800
physical world to the world of beliefs and inference and sense making and representation

124
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,320
in this inactive sense. So that's the first thing. Then once you've done that, you can then say, well,

125
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,360
okay, under what circumstances or what would it look like if this inference

126
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,120
went awry, was in some sense not fit for purpose with a particular world or eco niche or environment

127
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,760
or direct interpersonal relationship that this person was having to infer and to learn and to

128
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,880
actively navigate to deploy or active inference, for example. And then you get, I think, to

129
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,200
computational psychiatry. But that does depend upon committing to a view of all psychopathology

130
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,480
as intrinsically some kind of false inference. But it's a very natural view that if you just

131
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,560
think about hallucinations and delusions, for example, I mean, what are they? They are effectively

132
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,440
inferring something is there when it's not. So if you were a statistician, you'd say, oh,

133
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,200
yes, that's a type one error. That's just bad inference because you've got something wrong

134
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,320
with your standard error. But of course, you know that the standard error corresponds to the precision

135
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,480
in, say, predicted coding variants and the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which itself then

136
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,120
relates to synaptic gain and neuromodulation and the action of certain drugs. Similarly,

137
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,920
all neglect syndromes or in the old days would have been called dissociative or hysterical

138
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,640
syndromes. You know, again, read as false inference would simply mean I'm inferring

139
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,760
something is not there when it is. It's a type two error. And if you think about all the different

140
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,760
disorders and ways of suffering that people present within psychiatry and indeed quite a

141
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,000
lot of neurology as well, they can all be cast as some kind of false inference, you know,

142
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,760
dysmorpho-phobias, say, anorexia nervosa having false inferences about my body.

143
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,000
And even simple things like parking not simple, but awful things, but simple in the sense that they're

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,560
more motor and neurologically oriented conditions like Parkinson's disease, you could think of a

145
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:38,800
failure to infer and to realize my inferred intentions that I am now about to move. So

146
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,040
you would make two moves. First of all, we've linked physics to belief updating and inference.

147
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:54,560
And then we've taken psychiatry as instances of a kind of aberrance or a kind of failure

148
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,640
of the inference and belief updating process. But I repeat, put it in an inactive context.

149
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,400
So you couldn't explain Parkinson's disease unless you talked about

150
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,880
aning as inference, you know, treating movement and an active engagement with the world as the

151
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,080
realization of inferred plans, things that I am likely to do next in this moment or indeed

152
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
again, choosing which school to send my children to.

153
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,920
I still remember there was one specific line that I quoted from one of your papers. I can't

154
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,520
remember the name of the paper, but you actually spoke about that phenomenon way. Someone who's

155
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,560
acutely psychotic, schizophrenic, when you look at these patients and you show them visual illusions,

156
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,200
you're able, they're able for some reason to see the reality of the situation, whereas we fall for

157
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,800
this trick. So in those cases, people often say that they're seeing the real reality, the vertical

158
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,640
truth, and we're not. Talk to me about this phenomenon, because I think it's quite intriguing

159
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,720
that they don't fall for it, but you, with the free energy principle, with your theory, you're

160
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,560
able to explain this with the brain as well. Yeah, no, it's a fascinating area. So there are

161
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:18,480
rare instances where psychopathology or any pathology can actually improve certain performance.

162
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,960
Of course, one has to qualify what one means by improved performance, but the particular example

163
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
you're talking about, I think is absolutely fascinating. And it's a resistance,

164
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,200
characteristically shown with certain people, either people on the spectrum or people with

165
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:46,560
schizophrenia or schizo-type approaches to life, that renders them uniquely resistant to the kind

166
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,920
of illusions that we all experience. And it's just worth noting, well, what's an illusion?

167
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,880
Well, it's a false inference, but why is it false? It's perfectly good from the point of

168
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,920
view of the person having the inference and having the presumed percept and qualitative experience.

169
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:14,960
However, the experimenter, the naughty experimenter who's deliberately crafted this stimulus

170
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,840
in a way which is so unlikely that they can now say, no, no, this is a false percept because

171
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,680
I know how it was caused. And the subject, I, for example, have completely the wrong idea,

172
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,120
the wrong inference about how it was caused. So it is a wonderful tool for people in psychophysics

173
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:44,080
to actually test how our inferences can fail in relation to the actual causes of our sensations.

174
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,920
But to put that another way around, what it does, it's a beautiful pro

175
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,000
of the prior beliefs that we bring to the table. So that, you know, going back to the notion of

176
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,240
the Bayesian brain, read simply, that means that we have at hand a number of hypotheses

177
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,360
that can explain the causes of this pattern of sensory, for example, visual information.

178
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,960
And we generate these hypotheses actively, say predictions in predictive coding,

179
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,840
and then we look at the adequacy of these predictions in explaining the sensory data.

180
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,000
So we're effectively little scientists. We are testing hypotheses against sensory data.

181
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,040
And if they're not good hypotheses, we will reject them and revise our hypotheses. And this is the

182
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:41,680
Bayesian belief updating that we were referring to previously. But that adjudication and that

183
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,760
updating rests upon your prior beliefs before you see some sensory data,

184
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,480
relative to the precision of those data that are going to move your prior beliefs to making

185
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,360
it to posterior beliefs after seeing the data. So we come back again to this notion,

186
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,960
and a key notion of the precision afforded your prior beliefs, the way that you think the world

187
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,280
works, or the way that these particular sensory, panther sensory stimulation are generated,

188
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,320
relative to the evidence at hand through that you're accessing through your sensations.

189
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:31,040
So when people, well, certainly when people like me and you talk about this resistance to illusions

190
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,200
in people separate from schizophrenia, what we are effectively saying is that they

191
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:46,000
have less precise or imprecise prior beliefs that they're more sensitive to any sensory evidence

192
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,040
at hand. So if illusions are the things that reveal our prior beliefs, and people with schizophrenia

193
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,160
are resistant to illusions, that means they don't have very precise prior beliefs. And that tells

194
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,840
you an enormous amount about the message passing the dynamics and the sense making in people who

195
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,480
are resistant to illusions, particularly in relation to how we think the brain encodes

196
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,080
that precision, because you have to estimate the precision, it doesn't come for free.

197
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,320
It's very much like a statistician computing the standard error, which is the inverse or the

198
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,880
component of precision, it has to be evaluated. And if you get that wrong, you can produce your

199
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,160
type one, your type two errors, all that false inference and the rights and these nations and

200
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,760
delusions. And in this instance, a resistance to a particular kind of, not a pseudo hallucination,

201
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,280
but a particular kind of illusory person. I think I'm glad we're touching on this,

202
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,840
because this leads me into my next question, which which is surrounding illusionism as a

203
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,600
theory of consciousness. When you think of an illusion as a misinterpretation of a sensory

204
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,120
stimulus that does exist. And you think of the theory of illusionism, Keith Frankish, Daniel

205
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,480
Dennett, Susan Blackmore, lots of people working. And to an extent, when you take into account

206
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,520
certain things that someone like Anil Seth says with perceptions being active hallucinations,

207
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,000
you sort of come to this conclusion that, okay, the sensory stimulus we're receiving

208
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,960
sort of gives us an idea, a posterior belief at some point that we have what is known as a

209
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,400
conscious experience, a phenomenal first person subjective experience. Sorry, I'm going to head

210
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,400
into philosophy at this point and then we'll try to get back into the neuroscience, but and the

211
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,160
physics, etc. So when you think of Dennett and all these philosophers who discuss illusionism as a

212
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,240
theory of conscious, the basic premise is that we are experiencing something. However, because

213
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,200
let's say someone like you or Donald Hoffman who takes fitness payoffs over reality. The fact is

214
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,720
we are never really perceiving what is actually out there. We're just perceiving what is meant to

215
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,640
allow us to survive long enough, perhaps to breed to whatever we have to do. And in this case,

216
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,440
consciousness believing we have some sort of an entity, something similar to an Ian Vitale.

217
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,160
I mean, the fact that we believe this allows us to go through life and successfully reproduce

218
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,120
and continue to thrive. Do you think this has a lot of value? And do you think that these theories

219
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,760
of illusionism as a theory of consciousness has value using your theory of free energy principle

220
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,920
and the Bayesian brain to back it up? Well, in the way that you articulated them, absolutely, yes.

221
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,160
Okay. Do you have any rebuttals against that?

222
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,080
Not whatsoever. No, I think you phrased it in a compelling way and it fits exactly with the view

223
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:04,560
of a Bayesian brain and more generally the free energy principle. Your controlled hallucination

224
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,480
is just an expression of the way that sensory impressions somehow control our sense making

225
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,440
on the inside and the degree to which we let them control depends upon the precision that we afford

226
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,560
the sensory impressions. By definition, we'll never actually know what's going on on the outside.

227
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,040
So the whole point of inferring is you don't know the answer. You're just left with the best belief,

228
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,120
the best probabilistic guess as to what's going on out there. There will never be any

229
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,960
true access to the causes of that. And in a sort of complementary fashion, I will never know

230
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,960
what you are thinking. I can never know. So I'm on the outside looking at you.

231
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,960
So you're all including the free energy principle, but as applied to your brain, this is just a

232
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:04,080
hypothesis. It's just a belief. There is a fundamental divide that in the physics application,

233
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,680
the free energy principle rests upon something called a Markov blanket. But there's a fundamental

234
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,040
divide, an informational barrier, or probably beyond information, an existential barrier

235
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,720
between the inside and the outside of any thinking thing, which means that the question

236
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,320
is what is reality? Is there a metaphysics? Is unanswerable? All you can do is, I think in

237
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:40,080
itself, as inference to the best prediction as opposed to explanation. But inference to the

238
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,440
best explanation is perfectly okay in terms of explaining the world to yourself as you

239
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:55,920
sample it and as you sense it. So I am not a philosopher, so that's the one area that I am

240
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:05,680
very naïve in. However, I did want to make a philosophical point here that you use the phrase

241
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:14,960
that we believe in some aspect of ourselves, including the fact that we believe that we

242
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,840
have experiences. There is an argument that this is just another illusion. It's just another hypothesis

243
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,160
that in fact, selfhood in and of itself is just another hypothesis, that these are sort of illusions

244
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,280
that we bring to the table to make parsimmonious sense of the fact that there appears to be some

245
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,520
coherence in mind-bodied interaction with the world. But it's not a necessary belief for

246
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,960
living and surviving and adapting. I'm sure if viruses could tell you, they would deny

247
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:57,440
having a sense of self. You might argue that consciousness, either the kind of self-consciousness

248
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:05,360
that you refer to, or just the notion that I am having a qualitative experience. The kind of

249
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,520
experience that people like Thomas Mixinger would associate with opacity or phenomenal opacity.

250
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,320
These in and of themselves are still just hypotheses. They're just ways of explaining

251
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,880
my sense-making and this instance on the inside, as opposed to explaining what caused my external

252
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,720
sensory states. Does that make sense? But all of this I think is entirely consistent with the

253
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,480
views that you expressed. I think it's, sorry, were you continual? Well, no, you asked for a pushback.

254
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,880
The only pushback I can think of, and again, forgive me if I'm using the wrong words, but

255
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,480
the free energy principle inherits from the theory of sparsely coupled random dynamical systems.

256
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,200
And the special case that emerges when you have a particular kind of sparse coupling between

257
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:18,240
something and everything else. If that is true, it does have, if you like, a metaphysical commitment

258
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,880
that there has to be something else out there. So there is a sense that you can

259
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:35,040
be a complete skeptic. There is no reality from the point of view of applying the free energy

260
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:42,400
principle to my sense-making or indeed applying it to your sense-making, your sentience. But

261
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,920
the free energy principle in and of itself starts from a very metaphysical position that

262
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,640
there is an outside and there is an inside. And what we are looking at is quite simply a

263
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,680
generalized synchronization between the dynamics on the inside and the outside. That can be read

264
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,960
as inference and belief update. That's a pushback I can think of. I think that's exactly where

265
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,800
someone like Daniel Dennett would break away from someone like Donald Hoffman. Exactly what you're

266
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,080
talking about. Where Dennett would suppose that there is a reality, there is an external reality.

267
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,200
However, there's still no such thing as phenomenal experience or conscious experiences because we

268
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,760
are crafting this as we're going along or interpreting it that way. That might not be the

269
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,160
best way to say it anyway. Whereas Donald Hoffman then goes to the assumption that all conscious

270
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,360
experience is the reality we're talking about. And that might take it a bit further because now

271
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,880
there is no external reality. We're sort of creating reality from conscious experience.

272
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,400
But yeah, he takes a different physical route. Just called briefly what I wanted to say was,

273
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,840
I mean, I've got tons of notes here. Just want to show you a lot of different things. I've got a

274
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,560
bunch of equations here. The main goal was because I've seen so many different talks with you and

275
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,360
so many different interviews, I've noticed how people tend to, as I said, ask you questions

276
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,400
based on their expertise or their field of expertise. And I didn't want that to happen because

277
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,200
for the most part, I'm so on board with your view. And I love the theory so much that I used it in

278
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,200
my own master's dissertation to defend illusionism. So I, the dissertation is called psychiatry's

279
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
defense for illusionism as a theory of consciousness. And a huge chunk of that actually

280
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,920
incorporated your work, yourself, Chris Frith, many others. But I was worried that when I get

281
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,320
into this interview, I'm going to start defending it even more. And I did not want that to happen.

282
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,080
So I made very specific notes to sidetrack me off that path. But before I do leave that part,

283
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,280
the last thing I do want to say is, if someone does ask you what consciousness is,

284
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,160
how do you actually go about answering that question? Do you find that you go down a

285
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,520
philosophical route? Or do you stick to a neuroscientific slash psychiatric route?

286
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,840
Well, I think very much like you, it would depend upon who I'm talking to and who is listening.

287
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,640
It would be very context sensitive. If you're talking to

288
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:30,480
people who are in a more physics-y world, and they are interested in the naturalization of

289
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,800
consciousness, I would appeal to this, well, go right back to the Cartesian dualism. How would

290
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,600
you repair that? Or should you repair that? There is actually an argument I've heard recently from

291
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:54,160
very valued colleagues that there is a neo-Cartesianism that emerges from, specifically,

292
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,000
the free energy principle on the one hand, and quantum information theoretic formulations on the

293
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,720
other hand. This is due to things like the inner screen hypothesis by Chris Fields, which is a

294
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,400
fascinating resurrection of the Cartesian theater of a particular sort. But if I was talking to

295
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:22,720
somebody who wanted to naturalize in relation to the laws of physics written as usually differential

296
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,040
equations or in quantum information theoretic terms, I would be looking to answer their question in

297
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:38,800
terms of how do you bridge these two? How do you arrive at some kind of dual aspect monism

298
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,320
that still preserved the duality that explained it? And I would be talking about

299
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:58,320
the difference between a posterior belief, a Bayesian belief that is encoded by the states of

300
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,760
a brain, for example, and the probability distributions that are entailed by the states

301
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,720
of those brains. So you've got on the one hand an intrinsic information geometry that inherits from

302
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,080
the probability distributions that somebody in thermodynamics, a physicist, would understand

303
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,040
the kind that we use in brain imaging, for example, to look at brain activations through

304
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,120
the expenditure of thermodynamic energy in order to support neural dynamics,

305
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
but exactly the same by physical states are those that parameterize another kind of information

306
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,440
geometry, which is the information geometry of beliefs, the space in which I do my belief

307
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,560
updating, moving one belief from this point to this point. And of course, that moment is important

308
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,160
because most of the much of the arguments that I would engage with in terms of consciousness

309
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,880
would frame consciousness as a process. I think you mentioned that explicitly. What does that mean

310
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,760
from the point of view of trying to naturalize a conscious process that was quintessentially

311
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,360
believed basis movement on statistical manifold. So you do get that for free from the free energy

312
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:27,680
principle. So that's why I and a number of at least close friends and collaborators use the

313
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,440
phrase, you know, a physics of sentience. Sometimes we don't want to be quite so bold.

314
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,360
Sometimes you get told off for using the word sentience. So but at least you can talk about

315
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:44,080
a physics of information. And it is that sort of link between the information theoretic, the belief,

316
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:53,760
the statistical aspect of neural dynamics, and the thermodynamics that underwrite that,

317
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,360
which does, I think, provide that link between the, you know, the mensuric, well, you know,

318
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:11,760
the Cartesian dual aspects of certain things like the brain. If I was talking to people

319
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,280
in philosophy who are more interested in, you know, phenomenology, I think you have to address

320
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,400
some hard questions about, you know, what would be the necessary properties of a

321
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,360
self-organizing, self-evidence free energy minimizing system that could possibly support

322
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,400
qualitative experience or qualia as and then you have to ask other questions about

323
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,160
when would there be some self-awareness of this and, you know, issues of self-modelling of the kind

324
00:36:50,160 --> 00:37:00,480
again, addressed by people like Thomas Metzinga. Those kinds of conversations would take a slightly

325
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,360
different route and would focus on the phenomenology. And interesting, they come back to the precision

326
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:11,600
we were talking about before. If you remember, we were talking about having to estimate the

327
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:22,160
precision, which means that you've got, well, for those kinds of systems or creatures or

328
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:31,120
particles that have the capacity to estimate the precision of their implicit beliefs and

329
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:39,200
the sensory evidence that is updating those beliefs, that the very act of deploying those

330
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
estimates of precision and inferring that precision becomes a kind of mental action.

331
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:53,280
So now you've got a way of linking mental action, red as people like Jacob Nynowski and Thomas

332
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,400
Metzinga and that kind of philosophizing and with the psychological reading of this mental

333
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,400
action, which is just attention, it's just basically deploying or affording more attention

334
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:15,440
to this level of representation in a hierarchical context or this sensory stream, thereby selecting

335
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:23,200
that for belief updating, giving those sources of evidence privilege access to your deeper,

336
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,280
higher level belief updating. So now you're in the world of building bridges between attention,

337
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,200
mental action and phenomenology. Then you start to talk to people who like to think about

338
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,040
selfhood and self-modeling and self-awareness and you start to think about how do these things

339
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:55,760
unpack in terms of the kind of generative models that are necessary to define model evidence,

340
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,520
margin and likelihood, variational free energy. What kind of models would you need and you normally

341
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,240
get to your very, very deep models, hierarchical models where we normally have in mind a sort of

342
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,120
heterarchy or a centrifugal hierarchy. So your deeper is usually sort of more abstract and slower

343
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,720
and what normally starts to think about what kind of depth would be required

344
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,600
for me to have a sense of self. Well, first of all, I have to be an agent. To be an agent,

345
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:35,280
I have to have a generative model that entertains the consequences of my action, otherwise I can't

346
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,680
plan. So immediately we're talking about generative models entailed by certain creatures or people

347
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,760
that escapes the moment simply now because I've got a generative model of the future.

348
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,120
Unlike a thermostat or a virus, I've now got a very deep generative model of a particular sort

349
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,720
which goes into the future. It's future pointing, but crucially, it's my future. It's not your

350
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,280
future or anything else, it's just my future. What will happen if I do that? So that makes me

351
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,640
to an agent. So immediately you're talking about a very special class of self-organization,

352
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,240
self-evidencing. And then you have to ask the question, well, at what point do I recognize

353
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,080
that it is me that is actually doing the planning? And why? If you want to apply the

354
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,280
free energy principle, you have to ask the question, well, what licenses this kind of deep

355
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,440
generative modeling? And that's a pressing question because you have used the phrase

356
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,880
self-evidencing. I should just very quickly qualify that, which is a philosophical term,

357
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,960
which I know nothing about in philosophy. But I do know that Jacob Hoey, my friend in Melbourne,

358
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,080
is a philosopher, thinks it's quite apt to use as a description of the Bayesian brain minimizing

359
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,600
its free energy. Because if you remember, the free energy is synonymous with technically a lower

360
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,920
bound on surprise, surprise is self-information, but it's also the negative model evidence or

361
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,840
log-bottle evidence. So as you're doing optimal inference, you are implicitly trying to maximize

362
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,120
the evidence for your models of your nipped world, so you're self-evidencing. So the interesting twist

363
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:38,000
here is that you can easily show, literally on the back of a matchbox, that the log evidence

364
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:47,600
is equal to accuracy minus complexity, which means that every move I make and every aspect of my brain

365
00:41:48,320 --> 00:42:00,160
that is engendered during neurodevelopmental need evolution has to pay a price for every more accurate

366
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:12,720
explanation, illusion that it deploys. And that price is the complexity cost. So it means you're

367
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:20,640
trying to minimize the complexity. So why in earth would, say, evolution equip you and me with this

368
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,680
really deep generative model, where I've got all this extra complexity that I can be in this state

369
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,680
of mind, on that state of mind, I can be anxious, I can be in that, I can be frightened, I can be

370
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:37,040
embarrassed. Why would it do that? Well, of course, if it provides a parsimonious explanation

371
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:46,880
of my sense making and my active engagement with the world, then it pays its way in terms of the

372
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,320
increase in accuracy of the kind of things I can explain and engage with,

373
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,240
pays its way or compensates sufficiently for the increased complexity. And then you ask yourself,

374
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:12,960
what kind of worlds would potentially justify this kind of modeling, this kind of very

375
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,920
sophisticated hierarchy, deep modeling? And usually one ends up, and now I'm talking to people

376
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,360
in your ethology and social neuroscience, you end up with, well, the only kind of worlds in which

377
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,280
I need to infer I am me and I am in this dispositional state is in a world in which there are lots of

378
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,160
other things that are exactly like me that have certain dispositional, intentional states in

379
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,040
relation to me. Otherwise, I don't need this. It would be an overly complicated model. So you argue

380
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,320
yourself into a situation where this kind of consciousness, it can only be present, or is

381
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,400
any licensed under the free energy principle, in a world full of conspecifics and creatures,

382
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,400
and usually N and N functioned eternally, that depends upon lots of other people. So that now

383
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:14,000
becomes a slightly relational aspect to this kind of consciousness. So I haven't talked about the

384
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,000
inner screen hypothesis, but there is another quantum physics version of this. So there's lots

385
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,840
of different stories you can tell depending upon what people want to hear.

386
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,000
Carl, you touched on so many different ones there. I love the last one because

387
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
it reminds me of Chris Fritz's work, and he loves to talk about this social and relational

388
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,400
aspect of consciousness. You guys have written many papers together, and someone else you've written

389
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
with is a colleague of mine from South Africa, a very good friend, Mark Solms.

390
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,800
You guys have also written together, and I know Mark takes us down to a more basic level of

391
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,320
existence in terms of conscious experiences coming from more basic parts of the brain.

392
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,040
What got you guys to write together, and how did you guys sort of get together and do this?

393
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,400
These beautiful papers together. Right, well I'll just mention both Chris and Mark in that.

394
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,960
So interestingly, when I, as a young psychiatrist, got into brain imaging,

395
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:16,160
it was exactly at the same time that Chris was, Chris Frith, came from basically clinical

396
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,080
psychology and neuropsychology. Those were the worlds, certainly the UK's experts in schizophrenia

397
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,240
research. He came to join us at the MRC Cyclotron Unit, the very first brain imaging, also an

398
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,720
emission tomography studies of people with schizophrenia. So he's been my mentor and friend

399
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:42,080
since the inception of my academic career, and he's still meant to be writing the last paragraph

400
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:50,480
of the last paper that I'm trying to submit at the moment. Mark, but there's an interesting

401
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:59,120
connection and comparison between Mark and Chris. Mark, I met later in life at international

402
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:07,040
conferences, and we're very impressed with, in those days, his encyclopedic and very embracing

403
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:14,160
knowledge of Freudian ideas in relation to psychoanalysis, but also neuropsychology.

404
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:23,360
So he's one of those polymaths who can transcend different fields. He can write volumes on Freud,

405
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:32,000
and yet bring the most informative and puzzling neuropsychological cases to the fore

406
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,560
to evince some very deep questions about how we experience our world and how that can be

407
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,200
expressed via things like neuropsychanalysis. So the interesting thing is that Chris really

408
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,600
hates Freud, whereas Mark loves Freud, but they're both, they're both committed to understanding the

409
00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:00,560
brain as an organ, as a social organ. But as you rightly say, Mark is much more on the sort of,

410
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,480
you know, it predicates his work on the neuropsychology and the neurobiology,

411
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,960
whereas Chris is much more in terms of the dyadic and the social and social neuroscience aspects

412
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,360
that underwrite sense making where it matters. But both of them at the end of the day are trying

413
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,400
to understand the, you know, the patients they saw as young men, and perhaps Mark is still seeing

414
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:34,800
patients, I don't know. So that's how I got involved. Mark's ideas, you know, I think you're

415
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:47,840
absolutely right. They are more grounded in the wetwear that would have this,

416
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:56,960
that would endorse certain psychoanalytic, psychotherapeutic, neuropsychological and

417
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:05,280
psychiatric readings. And interestingly, he's happened upon exactly the same

418
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,280
focus that I suspect to your computational psychiatry thesis

419
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,520
focused on. So again, we come back to this key notion of precision and uncertainty. And of course,

420
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:27,280
you know, if you want a, you know, to naturalize psychopathology, it's all about beliefs. And

421
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:35,600
if you want to, what is definitive of a belief? Well, it has clearly, when thought of or when

422
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,040
read as a probability distribution, it has an attribute of content in terms of the location

423
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,640
parameters. But more importantly, it's got an attribute of uncertainty of dispersion.

424
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,720
That's the whole point about a belief as opposed to a point estimate. So if we are creatures that

425
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:01,360
deal in beliefs, then the, you know, the challenge that we face is basically evaluating and knowing

426
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,360
and representing our own uncertainty, either personally or subpersonally. You know, and indeed,

427
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,560
you can see this throughout, say, in economics, you know, the markets of lost confidence,

428
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,760
there's in, you know, things that matter, I usually knows the confidence and the uncertainty

429
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:25,280
that I hold my beliefs with. So that, that I keep using the word uncertainty, because there's a

430
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,480
lovely little phrase that Mark has celebrated in his most recent book that you know, The Hidden

431
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,080
Spring and Subsequence and Academic Publications, which is a notion of felt uncertainty. So he thinks

432
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:46,320
that feelings are all about the estimation of and deployment of precision uncertainty in exactly

433
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:52,160
the same way that we ended up trying to naturalize the resistance to illusions in people with

434
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,800
schizophrenia. It's all the same thing. So he puts a very heavy weight on that. To the extent he

435
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,640
gets very cross when people become cortical centric, you know, they think he's all in the

436
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,400
frontal lobes. He's literally deep in the hierarchy, literally deep in the cells of origin

437
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,240
of these really powerful neurotransmitter systems that do the attentional game, they do the

438
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,720
neuromodulation, they set the precision, they balanced and coordinate our belief updating.

439
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,560
And of course, that fits very comfortably with what we've talked about before, which is a mental

440
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:38,400
action read as attention, being able to get some control over those dynamics and belief updating

441
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,800
processes, that Bayesian mechanics that's going on inside our head.

442
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,720
So, I mean, you guys, both of your papers, I remember, you all sort of culminate and get

443
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,280
together with this idea that this Bayesian brain, this is fundamental to what we do.

444
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,320
When you think about perceptive experiences, we realize that at some point, my red sunset and

445
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,280
your red sunset are not the same. It's a very two different experiences, both comprised of

446
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,160
different neural, neuro factors, different social factors, different experiences in the past. So

447
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,960
even time plays a big role. This comes along well when you think of Markov blankets, because you

448
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,640
think of these different internal states, different active states, perhaps for each person who's

449
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,560
thinking, how do you find Markov blankets play? Well, let's first talk about how Markov blankets

450
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,600
play a central role in the free energy principle, and how this sort of navigates across different

451
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,280
areas from physics to chemistry to biology to psychology. Let's go to economics, etc.

452
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,400
Right. I thought you were going to talk about synchronization across Markov blankets and

453
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,960
communication. I wasn't sure you can get that at some point.

454
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:58,000
Excuse me. So, yeah, as you say, the Markov blanket plays a foundational role in the physics

455
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,960
reading of the free energy principle, where you have to, before you can start to talk about anything,

456
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:12,160
you have to be able to demarcate and define what you mean by something. And the first move is

457
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:19,360
to individuate that thing from everything else. How do you do that? Well, you simply identify

458
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,960
those states that intervene between everything else and the thing in question. They separate the

459
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:34,560
internal states, dynamics, paths, narratives. Technically, these would be states in a state

460
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,680
space, from the point of view of, say, a Langevin equation or some kind of statistical physics.

461
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:53,360
What transpires is that if you want to individuate the state's internal to something,

462
00:52:53,360 --> 00:53:00,000
from the state's external to something, then one way of doing that, and one could argue the only

463
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,880
way of doing that, is to demonstrate that they are conditionally independent. If you want to be

464
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,480
able to separate, there has to be some kind of probabilistic separability. There has to be

465
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,520
some kind of independence. But it's conditioned upon the Markov blanket. So what does that mean?

466
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,400
Well, it basically means that you and I, almost specifically your brain and my brain,

467
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,040
are not closed systems. We are open systems, and our systems are open to our niche, our

468
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:39,920
environment, or our heat bath, if you were a physicist. But that kind of openness is a kind

469
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,200
that preserves that conditional independence between me on the inside and everything else

470
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:52,880
on the outside. And that's where the Markov blanket comes in. And then you can, for most things,

471
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,720
partition the Markov blanket into two sets of states, the active states and the sensory

472
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,320
states. The semantics are rather obvious in the sense that it's just making a distinction

473
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:11,680
between those states that mediate the exposure of the inside to the outside. So the influence,

474
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,880
the vicarious influences of the outside on the inside and those of the sensory states.

475
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,320
And then to complete the circle, to induce the necessary kind of circular causality we need

476
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,440
for the synchronization we're going to talk about, you have to have the other side of the street,

477
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:35,120
which is the active states that mediate the influence of the internal states on the external

478
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:42,800
states. So you've got this rather delicate, fundamental sparsity structure where the sparsity

479
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,200
is read in terms of the influence that one state has on another state. The foregrounds

480
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,320
a special set of states that are called blanket states that can be divided into active and

481
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,960
sensory states that intervene between the external and internal states. The inner screen

482
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,880
hypothesis we were talking about before inherits from a quantum information theoretic formulation

483
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,800
of this notion where you can look at this blanket as a screen onto which I can write,

484
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:23,600
say the environment or the world out there writes onto this blanket, writes onto this

485
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,360
holographic screen and those become my sensations and I can then read those sensations from the

486
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:35,680
holographic screen on the inside and then I can couple back so that the environment senses me

487
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,640
through my actions. So there's a, if you like, one level of perfect symmetry between the two

488
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:52,960
and that symmetry is just, sorry, that symmetry is evinced by the minimization

489
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,720
of free energy in the sense that if I can predict what's going on out there and what's going on

490
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,960
out there is at the same time in some sense trying to predict what's going on inside my head,

491
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,440
the ultimate free energy minimizing solution, the most likely solution just brings us back to

492
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,000
being in characteristic states for the environment and the mean. So we're talking just about a

493
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,120
description of a generalized synchronization or a synchronization of chaos between two

494
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,280
sparsely coupled dynamical systems with a special sparsely structure that allows me to preserve

495
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,560
my conditional independence. So in a sense the illusionist perspective we were talking about

496
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:45,840
before is a must, it can't be any other way if you define existence as conditional independence

497
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,720
from the world in which you are immersed, but of course there has to be a world in which you are

498
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,240
immersed so you can't take that too far in terms of a skeptical position. Yeah, when you think of

499
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:03,120
Markov blankets, in the context of let's say neural networks, how could the concept of Markov

500
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:11,440
blankets be used to better understand flow of information or computations within a neural network?

501
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,680
Is this applicable and are there any specific applications we could

502
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,520
utilize this concept to enhance our understanding of consciousness, neural connections, etc.?

503
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,720
Yeah, I think there are, it's interesting that you should ask that and what you should do is get

504
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,880
Maxwell Ramstead and Chris Field and possibly even Mark and then Mark Serms has also been

505
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,960
involved in these conversations and another other people I'm sure they will also suggest.

506
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:49,040
So this group have been thinking for a year or two and are currently submitting papers to things

507
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:57,200
like the general consciousness studies and elsewhere that rest explicitly on arving the

508
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:04,240
internal dynamics of a brain in terms of nested Markov blankets and trying to ask the question,

509
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:12,720
is there something unique about a Markov blanket on the inside in your brain which

510
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,080
may be physically very distributed but statistically well defined that could possibly

511
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,040
support consciousness? So this is the inner screen hypothesis that I mentioned before.

512
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,200
So your question, perhaps you've actually seen a preprint.

513
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,520
Well, it's a very prescient and astute question then because this is exactly what people like

514
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:41,040
Maxwell and Mark and Ken and David and everybody else would love and Chris would have loved to

515
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,640
have been asked. Yeah, so that's the whole premise that well, first of all, it's a spin back.

516
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:55,120
So you're right to ask, are Markov blankets useful? I think that they are foundational and

517
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,520
they're used implicitly everywhere. I mean, not only are they foundational in the sense that they

518
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,400
define your existence and my existence and anything that we engage with or we think we engage with

519
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:14,160
but they are implicitly used whenever you start to simulate or reproduce

520
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,840
or emulate any kind of sense making or intelligence, artificial or natural.

521
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,640
Whether you're playing with neurons, neural cultures in a dish, the cell membrane is a Markov

522
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,840
blanket that defines the cell, the connectivity of the neurons defines another scale of Markov

523
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,120
blanket or another scale, which says that this is a network.

524
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,880
And exactly the same maths applies to neural networks in machine learning and artificial

525
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,600
intelligence research and the operation of your iPhone or Google search machines.

526
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,680
So these things become practically really important in defining the network of a thing

527
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,240
that's doing the computations or the information processing in a pragmatic sense.

528
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,360
And indeed, you can read these active and sensory states as the inputs and outputs to

529
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,640
anything that is doing some kind of computing. So they are essential in defining things like,

530
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,160
say, von Neumann architectures. You and I don't use a von Neumann architecture,

531
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,000
but you can still use Markov blankets to define them. But even if you look at the kind of architectures

532
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:34,800
that we use for sense making in the hierarchal Bayesian brain or hierarchal predictive coding

533
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:45,360
story, then the message passing that is required to do the brief updating becomes tremendously

534
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:53,040
efficient due to the presence of these carefully self-maintained, self-evidencing Markov blanket

535
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:00,160
structures. So remember the Markov blanket rests upon a sparsity structure. It's what the connections

536
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:06,160
and the influences that are not there. So that means that you can now do local computations.

537
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,680
If you can define the Markov blanket of you, you may be just an element of your dendrite,

538
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,120
dendritic tree, you may be a synapse, you may be an entire dendritic tree, you may be a cell,

539
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,600
you may be a brain region, you may be the campus, you may be an entire brain,

540
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,280
you may be an entire person, or you may be a family, you may be a species, you may be an institution,

541
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:36,400
you may be a biosphere, and every scale the same rules apply whereby you get the efficiency from

542
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:44,240
the sparsity where the sparsity underwrites the very structure and the ability to actually dissect

543
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:52,880
every scale, the system at hand. So that leads to, I repeat, that's practically really important

544
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,000
when you're designing your networks or chips. You need to keep all your computations as local as

545
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,840
possible and you do that by using your Markov blanket. If you wanted to, if we return to

546
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:18,000
the implications for belief updating in a brain, then just saying the phrase hierarchical predictive

547
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,160
processing or hierarchical Bayesian inference immediately connects you to a certain class

548
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,800
of Markov blankets because the hierarchy is just defined in terms of the connections that are not

549
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:38,720
there. So each hierarchical level possesses a Markov blanket that separates its superordinate

550
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:46,560
level from its subordinate level. So just talking about hierarchical structures is just one special

551
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:53,920
case of a particular kind of nested Markov blanket. And then we get to, is there a special

552
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,120
Markov blanket? So now this is the crux of the paper that you haven't read, but I thought you had.

553
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:06,160
I'm looking forward to it. Well, I'll send you, well, I asked, you know, if you email Maxwell

554
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,320
Ramstead and Montreal, he'll send you, he'll send you, I've only got a copy with all the authors

555
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:18,720
redacted, so I'm not quite sure who the authors are. I'll take up that off, I'll take up that

556
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:29,920
off and definitely do that. No, he'd be delighted. So the idea of one of the key ideas that fits very

557
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:37,200
comfortably with the ideas from Chris Field and people like Jim Laysbrook and Mike Levin,

558
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,840
which is this inner screen hypothesis, is that there is one irreducible Markov blanket.

559
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:50,880
There is one that you can't get inside and find any hierarchical structure or any partition.

560
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,320
So what would that mean if there was one or more possibly, but there was certainly at least one

561
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:04,160
irreducible Markov blanket in my brain? It would have some quite profound implications.

562
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:11,760
It would mean that it could never see itself other than acting on the outside, which is the

563
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,640
rest of the brain. So the only way it can solve evidence is by engaging in mental action.

564
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,640
And now you ask, well, what kind of mental action would it engage? What are the executive

565
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,320
systems, the active states of this particular minimal Markov blanket? They are precisely

566
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,800
the cells of origin of the neurotransmitters that implement precision control and attention.

567
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,920
So we're right back with Mark Soames again, but we're in a very comfortable position because

568
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,080
not only are we friends with Mark Soames, but we're also friends with everybody who talks about

569
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,440
things like higher order thought theory. So predicate the entire argument on this hierarchical

570
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,880
structure, which means that at some level, and usually it's the higher level or the deeper level,

571
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:06,080
do interesting metacognitive things start to happen that you could associate with

572
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,640
conscious processing. But this is exactly what the minimal Markov blanket, irreducible Markov

573
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:18,320
blanket would say. It is something that is deep within the hierarchy that there is no higher

574
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:23,520
or deeper level. Because if there was, you'd be able to partition the internal states within

575
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,840
that minimal Markov blanket. It also fits very comfortably things like the global neuronal

576
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,600
workspace theory. I mean, what is global? And what is a workspace? Well, it's something where you

577
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,400
can share stuff. So you can't further subdivide it and it's global because it sees everything.

578
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,160
So it has, it has a lot of constructability in relation to a game where we started,

579
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,920
everybody's right, but they just got their own way of expressing it. But in this instance, we are,

580
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:57,520
or one is expressing it explicitly in terms of individuation, separability, read through the

581
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:03,920
lens of the free energy principle in terms of Markov blankets, crucially in a scale applied

582
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,760
to a particular scale, this scale is the scale of brains. So this wouldn't work when you're

583
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,760
trying to describe the weather or evolution. It wouldn't work when you're trying to describe

584
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:24,640
things at a quantum level or indeed at the level of a single neuronal, neural population.

585
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:31,040
This argument is scale is tied to a particular scale, but it has, if you like, a scale free

586
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:41,360
aspect in the hierarchical partitioning that induces the notion of a non partitionable or

587
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:48,880
irreducible Markov blanket. So, funnily enough, that notion of the irreducible Markov blanket

588
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,320
being the inner screen is exactly the new Cartesian theater that we're talking about.

589
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,520
That's very fascinating. I mean, I'm scheduled to chat to Mike Levin soon,

590
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:06,400
and I had no idea. I think I should send him an email to chat about this. You said it was Mike Levin,

591
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,000
Mark Sorms, Chris Fields, who else was, there was one more name you mentioned.

592
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:20,720
The inner screen hypothesis that, if you like, provides a cornerstone for this more collective,

593
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:27,200
inclusive effort to try and get at, you know, what Vanya Weiss would call a minimal unifying

594
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:36,400
model of consciousness. That includes people like Mark Sorms and David Rudolf and lots of people.

595
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,640
Organized by Maxwell Ramstead, and Chris Fields is a really important player in that,

596
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:55,840
but the inner screen hypothesis in and of itself is indeed due to Chris Fields and his

597
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:03,360
friends, and particularly Mike Levin and people like Jim Glacebrook. So, that formulation is

598
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:08,480
another, if you like, access, which you'll have some great conversations with both Chris and Mike.

599
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,640
So, they come at this from the point of view of sort of basal cognition, the notion that

600
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:26,320
everything is effectively, can be cast, and possibly even is, just a process of information.

601
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,120
It's just information processing, and self-organization just is

602
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:41,920
the processes that evolve that effectively do believe updating or process information,

603
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:48,000
usually classical information, you know, when it comes to sort of kind of biotic self-organization

604
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that Mike Levin deals with. So, he's famous for Xenobox and all sorts of really insightful

605
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:05,440
takes, new takes on cellular and biological self-organization.

606
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:12,560
You know, some of my favorite ideas are, you know, if you'd, you might like, is that, you know,

607
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:20,000
when you appreciate that sort of, you know, physics, and this is a Chris Fields quote,

608
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,720
there is no bright line between sort of physics, biology, and psychology. They're all the same

609
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:32,720
things, just using different words. And Mike takes this to his extreme, what he used to,

610
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:39,600
he's got more sophisticated in the past review, but several years ago, he had this notion that

611
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:48,000
cancer was a delusion, a delusion that arose from a pathology of basal cognition, which I think is

612
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,480
why your cells are failing to infer, know their place, they're failing to infer that, no, I shouldn't

613
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,600
be growing in this context. They've got this delusion, oh, I should keep on growing. And of

614
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,520
course, he's absolutely right. So you can even get a computational psychiatry of cancer out of this,

615
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:13,360
but it does require a commitment to think about all self-organization as basically a process that

616
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:20,000
can be read as an inference process or a belief of basic dating process, the right kind of

617
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:29,360
processing and bounding self-information and entropy read from the point of view of information

618
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:38,000
theory. Chris Fields' particular take comes from his skills with Jim Glacebrook in quantum

619
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,520
information theory. So that's where the information theoretic aspects come, and then you can start to

620
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:49,280
talk about the relationship between the principles of unitarity and entanglement and the like,

621
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:58,560
and what that means when read or what it means in terms of a quantum formulation of the classical

622
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,840
reading of the free energy principle that doesn't normally deal with quantum, you know, it usually

623
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,720
starts with, you know, classical mechanics with all the kind of formulation of the like.

624
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,240
I know, I love so much about what you just said, because when I talk about it, I often think about

625
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:22,720
the same thing. I often call ourselves receiving persons organized by organelles, crafted by cells,

626
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,560
designed by DNA, manufactured by molecules, assembled by atoms, forged by fusion over,

627
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,400
forged by fusion via stellar supernovae. So this is a saying, because I think if you don't

628
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,240
incorporate all these things together, you're just, you're missing out an opportunity not to

629
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:44,480
reduce things to the nothing but aspects, but rather to grow the complexity of what we're talking

630
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:51,920
about. You just increase the scope of the conversation so much more by discussing every realm of reality.

631
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,800
And I think you get that, and you seem to be working on that from that perspective as well.

632
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,960
Absolutely. That Gail, I think that's a lovely way that you actually expressed it.

633
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:11,520
You should definitely get Chris Fields on your podcast, because his big thing is that scale

634
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:19,440
freeness, that scale invariance. And in fact, I was on a call literally about two hours ago,

635
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:26,080
where he made, I thought, a delightful point that because the free energy principle is by

636
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:32,000
construction scale free, it cannot be reductious at the same time. So it is quintessentially

637
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:39,280
anti-reductionist. So what you just expressed, I think, covered all those scales. And I think

638
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:47,280
that's part of the saying, your formalism has to be scale free. It has to be deployed

639
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:53,840
for me, mathematically, in the spirit of the renormalization group. It has to be deployed

640
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:01,200
time and time and time again. And as soon as you realize that, then you start to ask deep questions

641
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,160
about bottom-up and top-down causation between scales. So as soon as you've got a scale free

642
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:16,160
theory that can apply either to gamma oscillations in your hippocampus, or it can apply to natural

643
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:21,520
selection, led as Bayesian model selection. Then you start to ask big questions, well,

644
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:29,600
how does this very slow self-evidencing process contextualize and be informed by this very fast

645
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,360
self-evidencing process or information processing in a way that is emergent from just having these

646
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:43,360
same kinds of processes unfolding with a separation in this instance, temporal scales. So, you know,

647
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,080
Chris would wax lyrical for a long time about this. So you should perhaps you can get Chris and

648
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,640
Mike together. I think that's a very good idea. I think I should start doing that. I know the

649
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,680
last, I think you Kurt and Mike, I think spoke together as well, if I recall correctly, I can't

650
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:03,360
remember. Yes. Yes. I wanted to ask you, when you think about this project that everyone's talking

651
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:10,800
about, and Markov blankets, do you think that because some systems are so complex, do you

652
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,800
find, do you think there will be any sort of indirect or hidden causal relationships that

653
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,800
might hinder this from happening? What sort of applications or techniques should be employed

654
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,280
to effectively identify Markov blankets within complex systems?

655
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:37,760
Ah, right. Yeah. So this is a very sort of practical issue. And it would be very nice to be able to

656
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:47,680
sort of parcelate the brain, for example, or parcelate an institution or an economy to be able

657
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:56,720
to identify the different Markov blankets given some empirical data. There is a worked example

658
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:02,160
of this, which is little known because it's just so complicated. It's almost impossible to read,

659
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:09,600
but I wrote it and I'm quite proud of it. And I think it was in network science, but it was

660
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:19,040
exactly the challenge of taking brain imaging data with thousands, hundreds of thousands of

661
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:25,200
measurements of activity over time, and then parcelating it at different scales. So it was

662
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,680
exactly what we're just talking about. It was creating Markov blankets and Markov blankets

663
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:38,320
and doing it in a way that was empirically constrained by measuring the connectivity

664
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:44,160
and its sparsity to imply where the Markov blankets were. And then once you've got a Markov

665
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:49,760
blanket, those now constitute the Intel states of a bigger Markov blanket. And then you can sort

666
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:57,920
of carve up the entire brain at successively course from course spatial scales. And what was

667
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:08,320
really interesting is a phenomena that is, I was going to say emergent, but in fact it's actually

668
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:16,480
baked into the normalization group that you would access mathematically, or you would use to access

669
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:23,200
the scale free behavior, at least formalize or naturalize it, that things get slower as they

670
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:32,240
get bigger. So we could actually estimate the time constants of the neuronal fluctuations

671
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:40,640
and implicit belief updating associated with different spatial scales ranging from a cubic

672
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,640
centimeter or millimeter or so of the brain through to entire frontal lobes. And then we can

673
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:53,600
extrapolate out to very, very big things and very, very small things and look at the characteristic

674
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,440
time scales. It was just implicit by scanning through the time scales by having lots and lots,

675
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:06,160
you know, literally hundreds of thousands, well at least a thousand, a thousand little Markov blankets

676
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:12,800
all jostling together, partitioned and then moving to say a hundred of them and then to ten.

677
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,040
And just by extrapolating, you could then think about sort of collections of brains,

678
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:26,080
ten brains, or a tenth of a cubic centimeter of the brain right the way down to the quantum scale.

679
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,080
And just look at the different time constants that were engaged. So that was a really interesting

680
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:36,880
academic exercise, but it did rest as the same, being able to identify Markov blankets. What

681
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:45,760
you're asking though is a key issue in terms of complex system analysis and modelling, being able

682
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:53,200
to carve the system in the right kind of way in order to usually to simulate it in a way that

683
01:17:53,200 --> 01:18:00,640
allows you to do forecasting or scenario modelling and the like or projecting a response to a

684
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:07,760
therapeutic intervention in say clinical neuroscience or psychiatry through to weather forecasting.

685
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:13,680
You know, getting the right course-graining, the right Markov blankets in plain is absolutely

686
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:19,120
essential. There are lots of people working on that at the moment. One email exchange I've had

687
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,320
this week is from a gentleman called Jeff Beck who's taken on the very deep challenge

688
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:32,240
of considering Markov blankets that wander around. So one interesting aspect

689
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:41,120
of a simple definition of a Markov blanket is that it depends upon a probability distribution

690
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:50,400
that exists over a non-trivial amount of time. But if you think of something like a candle flame

691
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:57,600
that is moving and furthermore the constituents, the molecules and the irons that constitute

692
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:06,560
the plasma that is the surface of the flame, is it fair to say that the flame has a Markov blanket

693
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:13,600
given all its constituent molecules, i.e. other small-scale Markov blankets, are continually

694
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:23,120
being exchanged and moving and wandering around. So he's taken on the challenge of taking Markov

695
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:30,320
blankets into this sort of more liberal domain and dynamic domain and see if one can still apply

696
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:36,480
the free energy principle in a practical way. But to do that, he has to have at least simulations

697
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:44,080
on numerical studies that allow him to actually identify Markov blankets that move like waves

698
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:51,040
in certain media. So that's still an outstanding problem which a lot of people, when I say a lot,

699
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:57,600
a few key postcomings are looking at and I think it's a very useful ability to be inquiring.

700
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,040
That's quite fascinating. It's great to see that so many different people are working on this at

701
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,120
this point because when you look online and you look at the amount of citations, I mean you are

702
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:10,400
one of the most cited neuroscientists on the planet and it's great to see that a lot of people

703
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,040
are taking these concepts seriously and trying to roll with it. Looking ahead to the future,

704
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:22,640
what directions or advancements do you anticipate in the study of Markov blankets, for example,

705
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,840
except for the one you just mentioned? Where do you think the free energy principle is going from here?

706
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:38,000
I think there are probably three directions of travel and we've implicitly already covered

707
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:48,400
the most important ones in our conversation. So the first one is indeed computational psychiatry

708
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:56,720
and computational neurology. I mean in a sense all the work that Chris Frith and I and many other

709
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:04,560
colleagues put in decades ago into understanding functional brain architectures via brain imaging

710
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,800
was in the service of ultimately asking questions about neurology and psychiatry and much of the

711
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:18,880
theorising that led to active inference and the free energy principle inherited from the data

712
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:26,160
analytic and modelling that we were applying to make sense of brain imaging data and realised

713
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,960
exactly the same principles could be applied to the brain or when I say realised we're told by

714
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,880
people like Geoffrey Hinton you can apply the same principles to the brain, the Helmholtz machine.

715
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:45,680
So that's one direction of travel I think. Again, I use the word naturalising. I recently

716
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:52,160
learned what it means and I think it's a useful phrase to naturalise psychopathology in a way

717
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,800
that you can write down the laws and the maths and you can start to create in silico patients

718
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:04,320
and digital twins and intervene on them without actually giving drugs or psychotherapeutic

719
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:10,640
interventions to patients until you've shown. To a certain extent that style of approach is

720
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,880
already starting to bite not in the context of the free energy principle explicitly but certainly

721
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:25,520
in the modelling of things like epilepsy. Having naturalised a pathophysiology say the

722
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,200
transmission of epileptic discharges and seizure activity in the brain to the extent you can

723
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:37,040
actually put it in the computer and start to do weather forecasting of this particular person's

724
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:42,480
brain and what might happen if we did this and that. I think that's one very exciting way forward.

725
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:50,080
Another complement of that sort of applied application of the free energy principle

726
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,880
would be the ability to phenotype people. So there's a phrase computational phenotyping which

727
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:04,720
I quite like which basically means being able to characterize this person or this cohort

728
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:12,080
in terms of the parameters of their generative models that they use to explain their world

729
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:20,160
and that provides a really powerful and efficient summary on this person and in terms of their beliefs

730
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:26,400
and their belief updating and their prior commitments and being able to be able to measure

731
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:32,320
and quantify somebody in that kind of way can be very very useful not only in terms of tracking

732
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:38,160
the responses to therapy but also just getting the right nosologies the right way of carving up

733
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:44,480
various psychiatric conditions and their etiologies because now you've got a naturalised

734
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,760
process theory under the hood. So that's one kind of thing. The other direction of travel I think is

735
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:56,960
in artificial intelligence just actually building see practically what the free energy principle

736
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:09,040
brings to the table is not really a pretty first principles account of existence and sentient

737
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:16,480
behaviour but practically another strange inversion another denit strange inversion

738
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:24,640
instead of having to instead of having to understand the system in terms of its dynamics

739
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:30,640
as you would the complex system modelling you're trying to understand the underlying mechanics

740
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,400
by saying well these dynamics this set of say differential equations looks as if

741
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,600
it's performing a gradient flow on this light who not functional this

742
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:49,360
Lagrangian and I'm going to try and estimate what this what this underlying potential function

743
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,960
is that causes my dynamics and it's best a simple explanation for the complex system I want to

744
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:06,720
understand. For me of course that's always going to be this surprise or the log marginal likelihood

745
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:13,920
or the free energy bounds on that but what you can do is if you know that the dynamics of your

746
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,960
complex system can always be expressed as a gradient flow on a free energy functional

747
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:26,800
of a gerative model where the gerative model just scores or articulates characteristics states of

748
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:34,880
being that you want to emulate then what you can do is you can just write down the free energy

749
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,040
functional of your preferred states of being and then just integrate the system to reproduce

750
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:46,240
the sentient behavior that you would have seen if this thing existed and had these was attracted

751
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:51,520
to these characteristics states so it's a really powerful way of building machines that look as

752
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,720
if they exist in a particular way of course that's the aspiration of machine learning and

753
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:03,200
artificial intelligence you know and so it's certainly in principle you could deploy the

754
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:09,360
free energy principle in the context of building artifacts that do the right kind of belief updating

755
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:16,160
by the right kind of course I mean being able to model their world where their world is basically

756
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,880
the world of users basically you and me which brings us to the third direction of travel which is

757
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,640
the kind that Chris Fifth would like which is you know the explicit acknowledgement that

758
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,000
what is really interesting here is this scale free application of free energy principle where

759
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,400
you've got lots of different free energy minimizing self-evidencing Markov blankets

760
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,640
all living in Markov blankets of a different scale in institutions and theologies and their

761
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:50,240
ideologies and your ethnic bounds and all that so how does that unfold and how do you get the

762
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:57,360
right kinds of ecosystems that have this joint free energy minimizing behaviors that does not

763
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:06,160
incur upon or require certain Markov blankets to be vitiated or destroyed you know so what

764
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:13,600
we're talking about now is a physics of an ecology that has sustainability at its heart

765
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:20,320
or at its core because the whole point of the free energy principle it's a description of systems

766
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,960
that have an attracting set and how they sustain themselves within that attracting set so I would

767
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,600
imagine that the free energy principle will be useful and indeed pursuing this with colleagues

768
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:40,960
that and versus AI so my colleagues in industry this this is one application the free energy

769
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:49,200
principle in the service of in you know underwriting in a principled way the aspirations of all

770
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,240
right-minded people engaged in designing the next version of the world the world wide web

771
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:00,720
or artificial intelligence or information services and speak not to growth but speak

772
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:08,080
to sustainability that you're a biomimetic take on sustainable ecosystems but in this instance

773
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:13,840
ecosystems of intelligence so that was a bit hand wavy but it's you know it really is a fascinating

774
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:19,200
game when you start to talk to people who are actually in charge of engineering the next the

775
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:24,800
next web there really is so much potential um there's something I wanted to ask and I forgot

776
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,840
about it earlier but I was thinking about Markov blankets and how they they play this role um to

777
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:36,080
sort of this differentiate between let's say it can sort of play a role between differentiated

778
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:43,600
between a self and an other in a sense and does it have any role or impact when it comes to free will

779
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:51,040
how can you incorporate these ideas together well let's do my games

780
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,040
um so the self versus others

781
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,280
check the sound there as your sound is my sound good on your side

782
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:04,320
my sound is good and your sound is good otherwise yeah good

783
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,600
are you hear me yeah I can okay so I think you picked two ideas um

784
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,160
I haven't been able to return to that question um so let's um self and services

785
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,920
uh sorry just having an issue with your audio

786
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,560
um okay are you

787
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,920
okay are you okay no no sorry I was having issues with this audience

788
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,400
yes I couldn't hear you for about

789
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,920
it's back it's back sorry what did you do

790
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,560
okay so what I mean was when you think of Markov blankets they can indirectly play a

791
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,240
role in differentiating between a self and an other

792
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:16,240
how is this possible is this what's the trait of the free energy principle and

793
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,600
Markov blanket and what role does this

794
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
when it comes to

795
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:31,200
right yes thank you okay um so the self versus other I think is really important um

796
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,080
it was irrespective of

797
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:43,840
issue that that's that's that's what we didn't know we haven't covered any of our conversations

798
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
and it is the

799
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,400
and so you're thinking about early development and

800
01:30:55,360 --> 01:31:00,400
I myself have been thinking of a new goal in Charles as to engage in that kind of work

801
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:05,600
out behind the world of this system and of course the first thing that I think we need to

802
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:13,040
um and recognize where the further is that is that another is not part of itself you know

803
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:19,280
the free energy which shall enslave to being right in the sense and um you know

804
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,160
as to

805
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,080
so

806
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:57,280
So I think that's quite the notion of just having blood in the blood of others, in a

807
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,280
clear way.

808
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:05,040
It's a really central aspect of having a model of pregnancy, building estimations and illusions

809
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,040
about women and the world, and what behind your model of pregnancy, when you're looking

810
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,880
well, that's what it means like you and your mother.

811
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:22,880
So I would, I know that, you know, and I think that's how she's going to do that, which I'm going to introduce now.

812
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,880
There are a lot of my colleagues who have done this, you know, and you've got an actual

813
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,880
attention on the side of it.

814
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,880
There's, you know, there's a hundred years on your side, so I think it's certainly

815
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,880
the exercise of the audience of that, and I've also seen a course in human-human

816
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,880
disasters, as you can see, and I'm sure you've heard about it, because certain things tend to be

817
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:50,880
different, and that's there, and in between, the modern world model of the, I think that

818
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,880
is the world model, and it's not as good as the modern world model.

819
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:59,880
It's part of itself, I mean, I think, I have access to every kind of, like, anything,

820
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,880
including your children.

821
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:06,880
So I think that's how the space needs to go in, and how the modern world has to be

822
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,880
experienced, and I think that's the way it's constituted by how it's going to happen, you know,

823
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,880
and so I think that's a really important point, and I think that, you know, that was in terms of

824
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,880
how it really is, as long as it's science, you know, that kind of thing, you've got

825
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,880
additional structures, and so on and so forth.

826
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:30,880
I think that's what we're talking about, you know, to, you know,

827
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:40,880
in order to have, you know, in a certain psychology sense, I have to be able to select from

828
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,880
something.

829
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,880
So what are the things that I'm going to select from, and what, well, you know,

830
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:53,880
the energy business, and that's from your active influence, and those are the things that

831
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,880
are going to have to go to the models of their future.

832
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:02,880
So I can select from those kind of actual features that are under their control.

833
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,880
So for example, which is that sound, which is going to have to go to models, and then

834
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,880
contain the consequences of that kind of thing, policies.

835
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,880
And I think in a position position, what we know and what we can select is the role of

836
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:22,880
the available and what we have in mind as a part of the modern world models.

837
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,880
So this is just a statistician's matter.

838
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,880
It's just amazing modern selection.

839
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,880
But it's quite wide, and the context is selective, it's interesting.

840
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:41,880
For me, that is also a nice, nice answer to the words, in the real world,

841
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,880
in the real world of employment, you know, in the real world.

842
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,880
And I think that's what I'm going to say.

843
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,880
I notice it's posing a price to age.

844
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,880
It's a very new price to patients.

845
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,880
And that's the objective model of their future.

846
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,880
So you wouldn't have to buy the virus, and you wouldn't have to buy some thermostat.

847
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,880
But it would apply to a bigger and more new kind of thing.

848
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,880
So that would be one thing.

849
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:12,880
There are other ways of using this in the basic level, in terms of the terms of the

850
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,880
casting of the virus.

851
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,880
I think what's more interesting now is the amount of energy that you can see

852
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:22,880
in the cell going on, and I think that's one of the various models

853
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,880
that are there for these people.

854
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:32,880
I think that sort of brings me to something I wanted to ask you

855
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,880
from the very beginning, with the free energy principle in mind,

856
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,880
what do you call is the meaning or purpose of life?

857
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:53,880
Well, as a physicist, I don't really have too much of a question.

858
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,880
It has no meaning.

859
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:01,880
So from the point of view of physicists observing a universe that was comprised of things,

860
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:08,880
what will not the free energy principle is saying is that if this universe is settling

861
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,880
on to an attracting set, and if they are all like attractors,

862
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:20,880
then it must be the case that it is, on average, maximizing the energy of being

863
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,880
on things, attracting the characteristic states.

864
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,880
It's just like it's rolling to the bottom of a hole.

865
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,880
That's it.

866
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,880
What way of reading that rolling to the bottom of a hole,

867
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:39,880
that convergence to the attractive set,

868
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:45,880
is in terms of a minimization of thermodynamic free energy.

869
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,880
The special claim that's brought to the table by the free energy principle

870
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,880
is the assertion of a Markov blanket.

871
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:56,880
Now, you can read the minimization of thermodynamic free energy

872
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:02,880
in terms of a minimization of certain beliefs, inference,

873
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,880
where the beliefs are held by internal states,

874
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,880
but they are about external states.

875
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,880
So this is important.

876
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,880
I've phrased it like that because of your purpose on the meaning.

877
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:22,880
So the free energy principle gives you what people like a Ramster custom,

878
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:29,880
which is exactly the same as physical mechanics,

879
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,880
exactly the same as physical mechanics, exactly the same as quantum mechanics.

880
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:39,880
The only difference is that you've got a Markov blanket in your partition

881
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,880
inside the outside.

882
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:44,880
So in this and only this situation,

883
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,880
when you talk about beliefs having a meaning about something else,

884
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,880
there is no something else unless you have a Markov blanket.

885
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,880
You can't get meaningful information in statistical mechanics.

886
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,880
It's just the probability of being in the state,

887
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,880
whereas in the free energy principle, it actually requires being now.

888
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,880
So this particular physical state has a meaning in the nation,

889
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,880
in every sense it is explaining its hypothesis about it is a model of

890
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,880
this external state about something else, this illusion of what might be out there.

891
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,880
So I think that the meaning of life,

892
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:30,880
if there is life in the sense of there being a Markov blanket,

893
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,880
there is emergent meaning and that meaning is found in the internal dynamics of life

894
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,880
and its meaning is established in a relational sense.

895
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:47,880
This is the relation of the internal sense making,

896
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,880
the measurement of your quantum physicist,

897
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,880
of whatever is causing these donations and the sensations

898
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,880
that you are using to do your measurement.

899
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,880
So this is a model to it.

900
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,880
There is a levy and an election quantum information theory,

901
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,880
which I'm completely subscribed to.

902
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,880
So that would be one way to do it.

903
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:14,880
I think a slightly more popular answer to the question would be,

904
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,880
well, what's the meaning in my life,

905
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:23,880
where I am one of the superior systems that has this capacity for agency

906
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,880
in the sense that I have very precise dynamics

907
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:32,880
and that I have the ability to model the consequences of my action

908
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:38,880
in this very particular case where I can now infer what I am going to do in the future.

909
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,880
There is something called expected free energy,

910
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:47,880
so you can compute the probability of a particular narrative action

911
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:58,880
trajectory into the future as basically a softmax function

912
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,880
of the expected free energy.

913
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:06,880
So the path into the future that has the lowest expected free energy

914
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,880
is the most likely action that I will follow,

915
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,880
and it will select very well.

916
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,880
I will select the path that has the lowest expected free energy.

917
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,880
What does that mean, expected free energy,

918
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:28,880
in the same way that you can express log evidence as equal to accuracy minus complexity,

919
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:34,880
you can express the expected free energy as the expected information

920
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:39,880
minus the expected cost, where the cost is a surprise,

921
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:46,880
the negative self-evidence that scores the characteristic state.

922
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:52,880
So if you are in a very uncharacteristic or dead dissipating,

923
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,880
then that would be very surprising, highly costly.

924
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:03,880
So you have now got two, like, affordances or imperatives or ams that you will select,

925
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:10,880
which is what I am reading, the meaning of life to be,

926
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,880
what is my life meaning, what is its purpose, what is my purpose.

927
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:20,880
Well, it is the imperatives and the libel things I choose to do.

928
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,880
What do I choose to do?

929
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,880
I choose those things that minimise my expected free energy.

930
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,880
What does that mean?

931
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,880
It means I will try to choose those things and maximise the expected information gain

932
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,880
or minimising the expected cost.

933
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,880
The expected information gain is just curiosity.

934
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:43,880
So the meaning of life for me, assuming that I am avoiding all those costly states of being,

935
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,880
just like, you know, don't put myself in danger or go out very much,

936
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,880
I get into trouble with my life,

937
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:54,880
but the majority of what I mean is the curiousity.

938
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:01,880
It is basically being a scientist, the energy principle is like a person.

939
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,880
I think that is a beautiful way to put it, Carl.

940
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,880
There are so many things I want to ask you about,

941
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:10,880
but something I often love to ask, I guess, is,

942
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,880
and I think it is because this gives us an idea of how you were crafted as a thinker

943
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,880
and how you really developed as a thinker over time.

944
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:23,880
If you had to give us a Mount Rushmore of your favourite philosophers or scientists,

945
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,880
who comes to mind instantly?

946
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,880
Who are these people who really guided your thoughts growing up

947
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,880
and made you the man you are today?

948
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,880
Because I am pretty sure when people look at your work today,

949
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:37,880
from the time when time moves on, we are going to be talking about you,

950
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,880
have a feeling, the same way we talk about some of the greats,

951
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,880
and I think it would be great to know who inspires Carl Friston.

952
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,880
Right, yeah.

953
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,880
Always a tricky question to ask that one.

954
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:57,880
One reason it is tricky is my hero is Sherlock Holmes,

955
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,880
but Sherlock Holmes is not a real person.

956
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
I can't because he is my hero too.

957
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,880
I think that is a great option.

958
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:15,880
I think the two people, when I read or reference with warm feelings

959
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:21,880
and a tinge of excitement, especially when I find their quotes,

960
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,880
are Helmholtz and Feynman.

961
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,880
Herman von Helmholtz and Richard Feynman.

962
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,880
Look, the Helmholtz reference, that makes sense.

963
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,880
I mean, when you think of unconscious inference and all your work,

964
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:35,880
it makes a lot of sense.

965
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,880
What about these guys really get you going?

966
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,880
Well, very much what probably gets you going about people like Mark Somes

967
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,880
and possibly me, I mean, he was a clear polymath.

968
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,880
I mean, if you just think about every move you make,

969
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,880
or certainly every move I make in my little world,

970
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,880
in trying to naturalise psychology and psychopathology

971
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,880
and more generally sort of what makes us tick,

972
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,880
you come across some foundational idea

973
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,880
or principle or decomposition that he has brought to the table.

974
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,880
So you've mentioned the notion of unconscious inference.

975
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,880
I mean, that's just basically the Bayesian brain,

976
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,880
as beautifully articulated by Peter Diane

977
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:26,880
and Geoffrey Hinton's Helmholtz machine in the early 90s.

978
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:30,880
So that's certainly one thing, but it doesn't stop there.

979
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,880
You look at his work in perception generally,

980
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,880
he had all the one aspect of illusion,

981
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:43,880
illusionist thinking at least, down to fine art

982
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:47,880
and anything that was worth saying at some point, even if you said it.

983
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,880
But more than that, of course,

984
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,880
the Helmholtz notion of free energy

985
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,880
and the contribution to thermodynamics

986
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,880
is also pretty central to what we're talking about.

987
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,880
Well, I'm the kinds of things I talk about.

988
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,880
Interestingly, right down to something called

989
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,880
the Helmholtz decomposition,

990
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,880
which I suspect you probably won't know about

991
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,880
if you're more interested in computational psychology.

992
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:15,880
So this is an expression of the fundamental theme

993
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:18,880
of, what is it, vector calculus?

994
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,880
No, variation, I can't remember my part.

995
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,880
Anyway, the Helmholtz decomposition just means

996
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,880
that what you can do is describe any dynamics

997
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,880
in terms of two effectively orthogonal parts.

998
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,880
One part is dissipative,

999
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,880
and it climbs hills or climbs down hills,

1000
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,880
like the ball rolling down the hill.

1001
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,880
This is the thing that generates energy.

1002
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,880
It's a thing that does Bayesian belief

1003
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,880
updating in an information theoretical

1004
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,880
of the energy principle context.

1005
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,880
And the other part is called the conservative part,

1006
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,880
also in a solenoidal flow.

1007
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,880
And this part, if you like,

1008
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,880
circulates upon isocontos or potentials

1009
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,880
or probability distributions.

1010
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,880
So this is, if you like,

1011
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,880
can be read in many, many different ways.

1012
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,880
If you're an engineer,

1013
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,880
it's a decomposition of procedures

1014
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
that you would use to assimilate data

1015
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,880
or estimate unobservable states

1016
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,880
to do inference as an engineer

1017
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,880
using, say, a Kalman filter.

1018
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,880
And you would have a prediction.

1019
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,880
So given my beliefs about states,

1020
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,880
the prior prediction about what I'm going to sample next,

1021
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,880
and that would be the conservative solenoidal part,

1022
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,880
and then you would have your update,

1023
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:38,880
which is basically a prediction error

1024
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,880
weighted by its precision,

1025
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,880
which changes my prediction, my prior belief.

1026
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,880
And that's the, if you like, the dissipative part.

1027
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,880
That's my engagement in the world.

1028
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,880
That's what takes energy

1029
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,880
and does the belief updating.

1030
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,880
But that is written down mathematically

1031
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,880
very beautifully by the Helmholtz decomposition.

1032
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,880
And what it tells you

1033
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,880
is that if you've got this,

1034
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,880
if, by appeal to the Helmholtz decomposition,

1035
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,880
you've got this solenoidal flow,

1036
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,880
then you are necessarily

1037
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,880
breaking something called detail balance

1038
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,880
of the kind that you see

1039
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,880
in open systems and non-equilibrium systems.

1040
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,880
So there's a direct mathematical mapping

1041
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,880
between the Helmholtz decomposition

1042
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,880
and the class of systems that physicists use

1043
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,880
and study,

1044
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:29,880
which largely in the past few centuries

1045
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,880
has been sort of

1046
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:34,880
systems, closed systems that are equilibrium.

1047
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,880
In this century, it's now all about non-equilibrium systems.

1048
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,880
And that non-equilibrium aspect

1049
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,880
is just due to the conservative part

1050
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,880
of the Helmholtz decomposition.

1051
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,880
Also, it is exactly the thing

1052
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,880
that makes us lifelike.

1053
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,880
It's what equips us with life cycles,

1054
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,880
with biorhythms, with oscillations in the brain

1055
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,880
at every scale of gammas oscillations

1056
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,880
and our favorite hippocampal dendrite

1057
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,880
through to our beating heart

1058
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,880
and respiration, through to our sleep wake,

1059
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,880
diurnal cycles, through to our life cycles,

1060
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:14,880
through to the orbit of the heavenly bodies.

1061
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,880
All of these, that's not quite a biological aspect,

1062
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,880
but certainly for biological systems

1063
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,880
that break detailed bounds

1064
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:26,880
and have this particular kind of itinerancy,

1065
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,880
while still maintaining their integrity

1066
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,880
and a free energy principle.

1067
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,880
Then you've got a description of biotic self-organization

1068
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,880
that foregrounds oscillations and rhythms

1069
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,880
and arenses returning to the states I was once in,

1070
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,880
which of course is part of this

1071
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:48,880
sort of keeping our stuff within characteristic states.

1072
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,880
So I got on a little bit there about Helmholtz.

1073
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:54,880
You can see why you're such a fan of Helmholtz.

1074
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,880
I mean, it's clear.

1075
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,880
You can see the joy in your face when you're talking about this,

1076
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,880
and it's very fascinating work as well.

1077
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,880
It makes sense why this really gets you going.

1078
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,880
And Feynman, what about Feynman, really?

1079
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,880
Because Feynman, I'm a huge fan of Feynman's work.

1080
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,880
Sometimes even for fun, I end up watching Feynman lectures

1081
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,880
just to keep me calm at night.

1082
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,880
Yeah, it's one side of the entertainment

1083
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,880
that I can enjoy.

1084
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,880
My wife watches as well.

1085
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,880
My wife is a nurse and not into the physics.

1086
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,880
But yeah, now he's a very alluring personality.

1087
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,880
But if you didn't know this,

1088
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,880
it's possibly worthwhile just saying out loud,

1089
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,880
I mean, the variational free energy was his invention.

1090
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:44,880
So he was trying to, well,

1091
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,880
one reading of the history is that it was his invention.

1092
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:51,880
You could have good arguments with Russian mathematicians

1093
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:57,880
that can get at compression and free energy minimization

1094
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,880
from the point of view of algorithmic complexity

1095
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,880
via things like soft induction and the like.

1096
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,880
And certainly there is a school of thought

1097
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:09,880
that really celebrates that sort of compression view

1098
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:15,880
that is described by free energy minimization.

1099
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:20,880
But the Feynman view is much more closer

1100
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:26,880
to my academic training and inheritance.

1101
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,880
So what he was trying to do

1102
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,880
was to solve exactly the impossible marginalization problem

1103
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,880
that people would try to solve

1104
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,880
if they wanted to engage in exact base and inference,

1105
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,880
exact sense making, the exact statistics

1106
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:47,880
to actually get a grip of the very best explanation

1107
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:52,880
of this metaphysical world that of course doesn't exist.

1108
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,880
But that's intractable in the same sense

1109
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,880
that he couldn't possibly integrate over all the paths

1110
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,880
a small particle say an electron

1111
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,880
would take in quantum electrodynamics.

1112
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,880
He couldn't possibly normalize that probability distribution

1113
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:11,880
by integrating over all the universe of paths

1114
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,880
an electron could take.

1115
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,880
So what he did was to dissolve that problem

1116
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,880
by converting this inference marginalization integration problem

1117
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,880
into an optimization problem.

1118
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,880
And he did it by creating this band on the quantity

1119
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,880
he wanted to optimize, namely the log marginal likelihood

1120
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,880
which is the variation of the energy.

1121
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,880
So that's all of the Feynman view principle.

1122
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:45,880
It's greatest debt, I think,

1123
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
but that's not quite fair on health health

1124
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:51,880
so everybody else runs through from a cat through to a...

1125
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,880
And base all the way through.

1126
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,880
Everybody, yeah.

1127
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,880
There's certainly people you couldn't mention.

1128
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,880
Anyway, certainly from a technical point of view

1129
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,880
that that pathological formulation is so beautiful

1130
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,880
and it is leveraged directly,

1131
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,880
certainly in my personal work

1132
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,880
and the way that I would formalize the free energy principles.

1133
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Not the only way to...

1134
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,880
You could read the free energy principles

1135
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,880
as dual to James's maximum entropy principle

1136
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,880
but when read or written as a...

1137
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,880
in its pathological form,

1138
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:31,880
that is really a homage to Feynman's original conceptions.

1139
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,880
But as you say, he's such a delightful person to watch as well.

1140
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,880
And like me, he was a committed smoker, so I like that.

1141
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,880
Yes, you love your cigars, I know that.

1142
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:45,880
I often think about that video of Feynman

1143
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:48,880
where he's talking about a red flower, I think it was.

1144
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,880
And he says his friend, his artist friend,

1145
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,880
looks at this flower and then tells him,

1146
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:57,880
you as a scientist, you're obviously going to break this down

1147
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:58,880
and ruin it.

1148
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,880
And he's like, no, no, no, it's actually because I'm a scientist,

1149
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,880
I'm going to look at the cells beneath the flowers.

1150
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:06,880
I'm going to look at every single flow of each atom.

1151
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,880
He's going to look at every single aspect of this flower

1152
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,880
in so much greater detail

1153
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,880
that it only increases in its complexity and beauty.

1154
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,880
And to him, the flower is far more beautiful because of this.

1155
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier

1156
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:21,880
and I think that's something that you guys have in common.

1157
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,880
Yeah, and with you apparently with you.

1158
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:29,880
It's beautiful because Feynman has that perfect way

1159
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,880
of blending the science with the art.

1160
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,880
And that brings me to this question.

1161
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,880
I wanted to ask you, when are you going to make or write a book?

1162
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,880
Because your work is so complex to a point

1163
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,880
where most people really don't know how to approach it.

1164
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,880
When it comes to whether it's a neuroscientist, psychologist,

1165
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,880
physicist, if they don't understand the work,

1166
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,880
they're going to find it very difficult.

1167
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,880
Have you ever thought of writing a book

1168
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,880
that is a bit more for the layman out there?

1169
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:03,880
Yeah, no, I'm notoriously bad at writing accessible photos

1170
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,880
of a kind I think would be required for a book.

1171
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,880
So I'm probably not going to.

1172
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,880
What I've found tends to work best

1173
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,880
is to have the next generation of people

1174
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,880
who are much more fluent.

1175
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:21,880
Usually either because they're sort of

1176
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:26,880
in a person facing kind of science

1177
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,880
like psychology or medicine

1178
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,880
or they've had a philosophical training.

1179
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,880
So I find these people are much better

1180
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,880
than I am at articulating in prose and narrative form the ideas.

1181
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:42,880
So they can write the books.

1182
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,880
I'm just sitting back and I did try once.

1183
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:50,880
There's a book called Robert Pryor,

1184
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,880
Robert Pryor, MIT Press,

1185
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,880
who has been asking me for at least three decades

1186
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,880
when I go into writing the Free Energy Principle book.

1187
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,880
And he thinks he's got precedence

1188
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,880
because his surname is Pryor.

1189
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:08,880
So he thinks any book that appeals to the major pain,

1190
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,880
especially the Free Energy Principle,

1191
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,880
has to be commissioned by him.

1192
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,880
And he was absolutely right,

1193
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:17,880
but the problem is there is stuff I can write,

1194
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,880
it's so torturous.

1195
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,880
And I have to say that, you know,

1196
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,880
as with the Free Energy Principle itself,

1197
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,880
with its emphasis on complexity minimization,

1198
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,880
namely providing a parsimonious explanation,

1199
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:32,880
the Free Energy Principle becomes simpler and simpler,

1200
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,880
the longer it baronates, certainly in my head.

1201
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,880
So I've taken now every year now,

1202
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,880
I write a paper describing how a simpler version

1203
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,880
and a simpler version, that process will go on

1204
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,880
at some point it may be sufficiently simple

1205
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:48,880
to be attractive to Robert Pryor

1206
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,880
or any other editor who invites me

1207
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:54,880
or asks me the question that you've just been asking.

1208
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,880
My suspicion is I will probably be retired or die

1209
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:59,880
before that was derived.

1210
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:04,880
So, you know, but there are some wonderful renditions

1211
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,880
of the Free Energy Pro and Con.

1212
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:09,880
But certainly most recently,

1213
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,880
the Active Inference book by Thomas Parr

1214
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,880
and Giovanna Pazzullo, you know,

1215
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,880
I actually say it there that, you know,

1216
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,880
I was allowed to write the forward, but nothing else.

1217
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
Yeah, that's okay.

1218
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,880
I was just about to ask you,

1219
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:26,880
what are some of the reading recommendations?

1220
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,880
I think that's definitely one.

1221
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:28,880
That's on top.

1222
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:32,880
That's actually a book that I want to read desperately.

1223
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,880
And I cannot wait.

1224
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,880
If you had to recommend us any other books,

1225
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,880
what type of books would you recommend

1226
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,880
to either increase our knowledge with regards

1227
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,880
to the Free Energy Principle or Active Inference in general,

1228
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,880
or just books that you find help a scientist,

1229
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:54,880
philosopher in general to grow in this field?

1230
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,880
I'm afraid I'm not going to give you a very good answer

1231
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,880
for that.

1232
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:00,880
There's a reason for that.

1233
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:01,880
There are two reasons.

1234
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:04,880
One, I don't have time to read books.

1235
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,880
When you get to my age, you tend to be,

1236
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,880
you get asked to write blurb for books.

1237
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:14,880
So I have to speed read certain chapters of books,

1238
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,880
but I don't actually have time in my working life

1239
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:20,880
to read books.

1240
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,880
I can only review papers and scientific proposals.

1241
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:26,880
That's even working seven days a week.

1242
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
Any papers that come to mind?

1243
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,880
Any papers that come to mind?

1244
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,880
Oh, there are lots of papers.

1245
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:35,880
Yeah, but I'm not going to tell you what they are

1246
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,880
because the people I don't mention will be very, very upset.

1247
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,880
So I'm not very good at reading books nor recommending books.

1248
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:49,880
So what I'm going to do is what my father is.

1249
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:53,880
So he sometimes sends me books to read,

1250
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,880
which he thinks are good for me.

1251
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:57,880
So I'm just going to mention the last one that I read,

1252
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,880
literally a couple of weeks ago,

1253
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,880
which is Hell Go Land by Carlo Rovelli.

1254
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,880
I really like that.

1255
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,880
So that would, I would certainly recommend that.

1256
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,880
And I think that had color written that last year,

1257
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,880
as opposed to I think 2014,

1258
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,880
there would have been more emphasis

1259
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,880
because the Friended Bridge Bridge is just that,

1260
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,880
you know, that viewpoint,

1261
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:22,880
I think articulated slightly more in a classical setting,

1262
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,880
in particular the pathogen formulation of Richard Feynman.

1263
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,880
So I really enjoyed that.

1264
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,880
Otherwise, if people are generally interested,

1265
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,880
there are lots of wonderful papers, usually by philosophers,

1266
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,880
usually by, again, people like Andy Clark,

1267
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:39,880
Jacob Howe, and Maxwell Ramstead,

1268
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:44,880
you know, when he's wearing his philosophy hat.

1269
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,880
But there are also lots of really wonderful other,

1270
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,880
but you can just go to a repository.

1271
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,880
So Baron Edge has got a nice repository and GitHub

1272
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,880
of his favorite FEP papers.

1273
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:56,880
There's something called the Active Inference Institute,

1274
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,880
by Daniel Friedman,

1275
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:02,880
that is dedicated to trying to organize the material

1276
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,880
in a didactic or pedagogical way.

1277
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,880
They're actually writing now, I think,

1278
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:09,880
another Active Inference book,

1279
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:12,880
which is an explainer for Thomas's and Giovanni's

1280
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,880
Active Inference book.

1281
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,880
So if you're interested, I think you go to the people

1282
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,880
actually know how to teach and articulate these ideas.

1283
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:23,880
It's funny because one of the last people,

1284
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,880
well, this was actually a year ago now that I think about it,

1285
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,880
who talks about hierarchical Bayesian brains

1286
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,880
and Active Inference.

1287
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,880
It was Lisa Feldman.

1288
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:32,880
Oh, yes.

1289
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,880
Yes.

1290
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:34,880
And one of the books.

1291
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:35,880
Yes, exactly.

1292
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,880
And the book she recommended was Halkeland.

1293
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,880
And this was just when the book came out.

1294
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,880
So it's funny that you both basically talk around

1295
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:44,880
the same topic and recommend the same book.

1296
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,880
So it clearly is an impactful book in general.

1297
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,880
Yeah.

1298
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,880
Well, she's also written some very influential stuff

1299
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,880
in the emotional sphere.

1300
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,880
And there's now, you know,

1301
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:55,880
quite a key player in the Active Inference,

1302
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,880
but certainly the emotional inference

1303
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,880
and intercepted inference field,

1304
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,880
along with Anil Seth and colleagues.

1305
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:07,880
Just to close off called any theories of consciousness,

1306
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:11,880
the brain that you feel sort of go against

1307
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,880
the free energy principle,

1308
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:16,880
anything that you know stands out that counter argues

1309
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:20,880
this principle in a way that does sort of get you,

1310
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,880
get you shield up.

1311
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,880
No, I'm afraid not.

1312
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:27,880
I think that probably affects the fact that I don't have

1313
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,880
a philosophical training.

1314
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,880
So I don't, you know, I'm not used to adversarial progression,

1315
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:34,880
adversarial argumentative approaches.

1316
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,880
No, I don't, you know, the whole point of the free energy principle

1317
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,880
is it has to explain everything or it's, it explains nothing.

1318
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,880
So if there is a viable theory of consciousness out there,

1319
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:48,880
there has to be some way of, if you like,

1320
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,880
reframing it or substantiating that right theory

1321
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:56,880
by naturalizing it using the free energy principle.

1322
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,880
Remember, free energy principle can never be wrong,

1323
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,880
so it doesn't need to defend itself.

1324
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,880
It's just a method or a tool,

1325
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,880
very much like Hamilton's principle of least reaction.

1326
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,880
Inherently unfalsifiable.

1327
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,880
Yeah.

1328
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:10,880
Yeah.

1329
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,880
And I think just, I'd like to say thank you so much

1330
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,880
for all your work.

1331
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:16,880
I clearly supported in the fact that I,

1332
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,880
I quoted you a couple of times, referenced you numerous times.

1333
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,880
So to me, it is replicable.

1334
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,880
It is work that a lot of us are using out there.

1335
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:28,880
So from my side, I just want to say thank you so much, Col.

1336
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,880
It's a pleasure.

1337
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,880
It's an absolute honor to actually chat to you.

1338
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:34,880
And I really enjoyed this conversation.

1339
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:35,880
Well, so am I.

1340
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:38,880
You've asked some really excellent questions.

1341
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,880
You've kept me on my toes, but also kept me smiling.

1342
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,880
Thank you very much.

1343
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,880
Thank you.
