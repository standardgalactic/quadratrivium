1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Su, I'm so glad we managed to reschedule this. Is the sound working fine? The internet connection

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,200
is great this time. Everything works. Good. I think so, yeah. Okay, my side, it's perfect.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,520
How was the retreat, Su? Oh, the retreat was fantastic. I can't remember whether I told you.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
I didn't want to go. I'd kind of signed up half-heartedly and the weather being here and

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,800
being over 20 degrees is amazing and sunny and I thought, you know, all this meditating all the

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,200
time, I wasn't looking forward to it and it was brilliant. The teacher, I really went because

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,360
of the teacher, Fiona Nuttall. She's a Zen master and extraordinary teachings and the Zen interviews.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,600
You know, this is part of Zen retreats is the interviews and she just really rings things out

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,920
of you that you don't know are there and then sends you back to work. I can just talk merely from

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,720
your energy right now. You look in a great place. The other thing was in these particular type of

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,800
retreats, there were two work periods of an hour each in the day where you could be sweeping the

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,160
floors, cleaning the toilets, chopping vegetables in the kitchen and this lovely sunny weather,

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,760
you know, and you don't have any choice and I got gardening so I'm very happy. That's very

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,440
unzen, isn't it? Because you just do what you do because you don't do it and, you know, not care

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,120
about the outcome but it meant I was outside at each day doing hard physical labor which I'd much

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,720
rather do than chopping vegetables or something like that. So yeah, it was very good. As for,

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,920
you know, great insights, well a lot happened. It was, you know, struggling with a koan for

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,200
a week. I see. Things happened. Do you feel like philosophically any changes fundamentally in your

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:16,080
views? No but I think my way of thinking about things is kind of loosened up

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,040
and I spend quite a lot of time as you realise thinking about the mind-body problem, the nature

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,280
of mind, the nature of agency and how we wrongly feel we're controlling things and

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,600
this koan work tends to hint at those but I can't say I've got some great philosophical

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,920
breakthrough now, sorry. Well, I think while we're on that, it's the perfect time. I think

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,840
let's take the listeners and the viewers on a journey soon. If you could give me a history

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,360
of the mind-body problem from your perspective, I'm curious to know which aspects of this story

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,320
you tell me right now. Gosh, you kind of ask the question is though I'm a philosopher and I'm not

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,600
or are you doing something much more personal? No, no, I think in general what if you had to

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,880
think of the story of the mind-body problem, which names come to mind, what type of philosophies or

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,880
even psychology, neuroscience, which icons or figures in history come to mind when you think of

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:28,480
this infamous problem? I'm going to disappoint both you and your listeners because I don't really,

31
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,040
as I said, I'm not a philosopher. I don't remember the names of all the brilliant

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,760
philosophers and I kind of, you know, I know this problem goes way, way back into ancient Greeks but

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,760
you know, I don't, I'm not going to pull any names out of the non-existent that's on my head.

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,880
I don't think in that way about it. I think about it every day in terms of

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,040
what's out there and what's in here and is there a difference between inside and outside and so on.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,200
But if I can twist that around to why it's been so important to me, like so many things in my life,

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,760
it goes back to the very dramatic outer-the-body experience or mystical experience both that I

38
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,960
had when I was 19, which is a very long time ago, which convinced me completely of a dualist view

39
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,520
as it convinces so many people. I think it's Thomas Metzinger who said, you know, anyone who has that

40
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:35,760
kind of experience must become a dualist, a substance dualist indeed. And so that becoming

41
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,280
utterly convinced of a dualist view and then actually deciding to devote my life to instead of,

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,880
you know, I had a, what I imagine would have been a very good PhD place at Sussex University,

43
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,400
which now has the, you know, the Sussex Consciousness Lab there. Not that it would have in those days but

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
you know, I turned that down because I wanted to prove dualism. I wanted to prove, you know,

45
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
astral planes and all these other worlds and everything and show that scientists were closed

46
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:16,080
minded as I'm often being accused of being. And so I set about it experimentally, being really

47
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,880
an experimental psychologist, not a philosopher. And all the evidence I got was suggested I was

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
wrong and so I had to turn to my mind. And since then, which you were talking now,

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,360
late 70s, early 80s. Since then, I've been pondering how on earth to make any kind of

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,240
monist, any kind of neutral monism actually work. I think, look, so for me, it's very difficult to

51
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,400
actually have a very skeptical interview with you. And it's because you were part of shaping

52
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,080
many of my own views. Yeah, so a big, a big chunk of my dissertation focused on illusionism. So

53
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,480
illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I used psychiatry to defend illusionism as a

54
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,120
theory of consciousness. I quoted you a couple times. And I've obviously

55
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,760
particular, I cited you many times and particularly the delusion aspect of it all. So there's many

56
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,640
aspects where I want to come as a skeptic, but I just cannot because fundamentally, I think

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,640
there's so many aspects of this that we agree on. It's going to make this very difficult.

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,360
But I think that's exciting anyway, because what I want to know is when you came to the conclusion

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,400
of illusionism as a theory of consciousness, I know so many people in your life influenced you,

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,360
people like Dawkins. I know Dennett's part of those people who you support in terms of certain

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
views. I know nowadays you disagree with many aspects. Perhaps Free Will will be one of them.

62
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,040
No, that's the only, that's really the only one. I mean, basically, I'm a Dennettian and, you know,

63
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,000
I love it when I find something I disagree with him about, we can have a great argument, you know.

64
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Your books, Dennett's books, all together on my shelf. So you guys all come together in a nice

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,640
So when Frankish published the paper, Illusionism, and he had all you guys together,

66
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,120
Graziano, yourself, there were many of you guys together. Tell me about that journey. How did

67
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,360
that come about? I think Clive Frankish wrote and told me he had been invited to do this special

68
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,880
issue and asked me whether I'd like to write it, write something. And I was then thinking a lot

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,200
about the things that I wrote about in there. A lot of my thinking is taking direct experience

70
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,800
and trying to analyze it. So in that paper that I wrote, I wrote about an experience where

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,800
I've been on, I can't even remember what island this was, but anyway, I was on some island walking

72
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,600
up quite steep, rough sort of steps going up. And I really wanted to get to the top

73
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,960
in time to be able to go down and catch the boat back to wherever I'd come from.

74
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:00,720
And I can remember that as I was walking and and being mindful, somehow or another, I realized

75
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,600
that a few moments before I had, I thought, am I going to get there in time? And I thought, oh,

76
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,560
yes, because it's only five past 12. Hang on a minute. I must have just a few moments before

77
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,960
looked at my watch and I looked at it again. And it was five past 12 without in any normal

78
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,920
sense of the word being conscious of it. And this brought up all the sort of Donetti and kind

79
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,520
of thoughts. Well, what's going on? Right this moment now being mindful, I can say, this is what

80
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm mindful of. This is what I'm conscious of. This is what I'm doing. If I cast my mind back

81
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,800
to a moment before it doesn't have to be very long. I really don't know what I was conscious of.

82
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Doesn't make any sense. This is one of the things where Dennett says,

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,760
there is no fact of the matter. If you ask what was I conscious of a moment ago, there is no

84
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,640
fact of the matter. And yet we assume that there is an answer to that question that at all times

85
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
during the day, when whatever we're doing, we're conscious of something or another. Well, that's

86
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:09,120
simply not true, I think. So I kind of wrote my article for this around that experience and what

87
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:17,200
it means for why we're deluded. And the reason I say delusionism rather than illusionism is

88
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,760
illusions brings to mind very much sensory illusions, vision and hearing and so on that

89
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,680
where you get things, you know, there's the difference between reality and appearance.

90
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:34,000
But the delusion I was more interested in the kind of folk theories we make up about consciousness.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,320
And one of those is that at all the times when we're awake and in that sense conscious, there

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
must be something we're conscious of and other things we're not conscious of. And that's not

93
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,120
true. And then I think because I tend to write not terribly academically, acceptably, I tend to

94
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
write rather personally, oh, I think this and I have this experience and this is what it means.

95
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,280
And so then Keith started to say, well, can you change this and can you change that? And then

96
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,600
actually he tried changing things for me. And then I was like, no, you can't do that. I wouldn't

97
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,760
ever say that. And we sorted it all out. And in the end, I was very happy with it. So that's sort

98
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,240
of how it came about and what happened. And then there are all these other interesting papers in

99
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,720
the same issue, which then became a book. I find Frankish's view too difficult for me to really

100
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
understand. You say illusionism is a theory of consciousness. It's not really, it's a whole

101
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,080
bunch, it's more like it's an approach to consciousness. It's a way of thinking about

102
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,480
consciousness, which has many variations. Yes, sorry, continue. No, no, go on. I was going to say

103
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
because yes, because you define illusionism very differently from what Frankish is talking about.

104
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,880
Yeah, that's right. You see it more as a way to rectify and clarify other views of consciousness,

105
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,480
whereas Frankish is talking about the phenomenal aspect of consciousness. Do you want to clarify

106
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,800
that in your own words? Well, yes, I think he starts by saying that the phenomenal properties

107
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,040
don't exist. Well, I'm immediately thrown into, but I'm not a philosopher and I don't know what you

108
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,480
mean. The other day, Bernardo Castro said to me, if something exists, it has properties. And I'm

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,080
going, well, I don't know about, I don't really know how philosophers define existence or properties,

110
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,720
and I don't want to go through the painful, I've got enough to learn that's really interesting

111
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,520
in neuroscience and psychology. And I try and read philosophical things, but I don't think I'm ever

112
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,840
going to get my head around exactly what Frankish means. And whether it's the same as what Dennett

113
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,120
means or not, going back to what you've already elucidated, it's the way Dennett pulls apart

114
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,360
the mistakes we make, the pits we fall into, the errors that just abound all over the place

115
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,960
that appeals to me. And by calling my approach delusionism, I suppose I'm just trying to say,

116
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,200
look, I'm not, I don't agree with all the other people, I'm not saying I'm right or better,

117
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,240
but I'm more interested in the kind of semi-intellectual ways we get things wrong,

118
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,040
and the assumptions we make, than I am in making an actual theory. Because I don't think

119
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,040
I don't think any of these have an actual theory, except possibly with the exception of

120
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,960
Michael Graziano, who refuses to call himself an illusionist. And it's an illusionist theory,

121
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,240
for goodness sake, Michael. I think he's a bit cowardly, really. I understand it, I get it,

122
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,480
you know, if he calls it an illusion, people will misunderstand. I've had that all the,

123
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,840
all the time I've been working on consciousness. You know, people say, you say consciousness

124
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,880
doesn't exist. I don't say that at all. I say it's illusion. How do you define illusion?

125
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,160
Something that's not what it seems to be. And that's really, if I want to say anything I will

126
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,200
say, 100% sure that I believe, it's only that, that consciousness as normally conceived of by

127
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,160
most people, it's not what it seems to be. Graziano was one of the first people I interviewed

128
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,840
for this podcast. And I remember when we spoke about, prior to that, he helped me out with my

129
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,400
dissertation. And we discussed the fact that attention schema theory is most certainly an

130
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,800
illusionist theory of consciousness. It's, it approaches it fundamentally by saying that what

131
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,920
we seem to believe is consciousness is merely an interpretation of what we think is happening around

132
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,200
it. But he calls it a caricature. And in my own work, I also said, I believe that if some,

133
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,120
if you believe something is an illusion, there's no point in changing the words around it. You

134
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
might as well just change other people's perceptions about the actual word. Because

135
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,400
an illusion is defined as an emiss interpretation of a sensory stimulus that does exist. So you

136
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,120
cannot say that it doesn't exist. There is a stimulation that's happening that does exist.

137
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
And that's fundamentally where I think Keith and you differ because you agree that something's

138
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,440
happening. I am not necessarily agreeing what you just said that it's a, it needs to be a sensory

139
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:14,880
stimulus. Yes. Well, does it? Um, I don't think so. It's a misinterpretation of a stimulus that

140
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,480
exists. Okay. But can that be an internal stimulus? I mean, because I'm thinking the whole gamma of

141
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,520
experience, including sensory impressions, where we make a, um, a reality appearance distinction,

142
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,400
that's one sort of illusion. But when it comes to, you know, my own, I'm shutting my eyes,

143
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,600
it's dark. I'm, you know, I'm thinking about something that, you know, I'm thinking to myself,

144
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
Oh, what I'm conscious of now, if I think that way, is my own thoughts about whatever it is,

145
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
what I'm going to do tomorrow or something, you know, that's not a sensory stimulus. In fact,

146
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,400
it's not really stimulus unless you say this bit of brain is stimulating another bit of brain. So

147
00:14:52,400 --> 00:15:01,120
I just quibble slightly there. Yes. So I would say something is happening. And somebody's responding

148
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,400
to something that's happening. Something's responding to something that's happening. Um,

149
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,800
like Dennett, who begins, um, his 1991 consciousness explained with sitting in his rocking chair,

150
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,120
appreciating the way the light is, you know, fully on the dapples on the leaves and all that.

151
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,560
You know, I take as a similar view. I mean, look, there's this, ha, but

152
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,120
the leap that's so easy to make is there's this out there and there's me in here. And that's

153
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,840
already an interpretation. And that's an illusion. So that's where I take off from. And I, I define

154
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,880
illusion is an illusion much more simply having looked it up in various, you know, OED and other

155
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,560
such places as something that is not what it seems to be. That's, that's kind of vaguer. And I'm

156
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,000
happier with that. Yeah. Now, I think what you're doing is basically it's intuition pumps for

157
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
thought thinking about consciousness. It's pretty much trying to show people that, okay, look,

158
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,960
there's something happening. We don't know what it is, but assuming that you can find certain

159
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,480
entities or an Ian Vitale or an answer that's going to come out is just the wrong approach.

160
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,760
So searching for a neural correlate of consciousness is not the right way.

161
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,840
And it's amazing how popular that has, you know, good for Francis Crick and Christoph Koch,

162
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:30,240
starting the whole framework for consciousness and let's, I mean, Crick said, you know, we can't

163
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,640
jump straight in at causal explanations. We have to start with correlations. So what do we do?

164
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Well, here's this problem consciousness, let's look for the neural correlates. Great, as a starting

165
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,840
point. But when you really start thinking through intuition pumps and delusions and what have you,

166
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,680
it doesn't make sense anymore, because it relies on the assumption we were discussing earlier,

167
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,240
that there are some brain processes that are conscious and there are other ones that are

168
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,120
not conscious. And that is such a tempting illusion. But it's not, in my opinion, it's not true.

169
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
At what point did you realize, because there's so many different studies that show us that we're

170
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,160
not seeing reality for what it is. Heuristic adaptations, perhaps, shortcuts in our processing,

171
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,680
limited processing, perceptual experiences. So we can't even see outside the optical window,

172
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,400
we can only see ROYGBIV. At what part were you looking at all this information and finally

173
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,680
concluded, okay, you know what, there is no fundamental entity called consciousness that we

174
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,720
are searching for? Well, you ask that question in a way that assumes that there is some sense in

175
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,520
saying the world as it actually is. Yes, I must say, I'm more tempted nowadays to theories that

176
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,560
don't say that. I'm very tempted by various kinds of panpsychism, none of which I can fully endorse,

177
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,040
by information based ideas, that everything fundamentally comes down to information. So

178
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,320
I've been struggling without enough maths with thermodynamics and other ideas about

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,680
energy and information and evolution and how these things work. And really struggling with

180
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:22,960
some kind of straight idealism doesn't work in the sense that, you know, if everything is mental,

181
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
how on earth do you explain why we agree about things about the outside world, what you were

182
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,560
saying, you know, how the outside world really is? Well, I'm not going to go that far, but you

183
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,720
can agree that, you know, you can see my picture, I can see your picture, I can see the cupboards

184
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,680
behind you and the whatever, you know, and I'm pretty sure I could predict, this is kind of

185
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,560
important really, that if you went, turned around and pulled a book out, you know, there'd be a space

186
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,760
in the bookshelf. Interestingly, I've got particularly fascinated recently with predictive

187
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,880
processing and Bayesian brain type theories. And when I'm thinking about all this stuff,

188
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
what is the world? What is the relationship between this body and this thinking and everything and

189
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:12,080
that plant you can't see behind the screen? It's always, well, if I did that, if you turned around

190
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,240
and took your book out, if I picked up these glasses, then I would find they felt like this.

191
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,240
It's always if at last something makes sense, of course, because the predictive processing

192
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,760
theories are saying that that that all all of perception and of thinking indeed, and of, well,

193
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:40,640
I'll leave Pontius for a moment, but all all that is making predictions. That's what system is. So

194
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,320
I try to work from first principles with that sort of idea. So here's a clever brain,

195
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,640
multiply, it must be a kind of tangled hierarchy. It's not hierarchy with, I think,

196
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,120
with me at the top controlling everything, which is kind of how it seems. But it's

197
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,400
hierarchical, nevertheless. And at every level, there are predictions referring to the lower

198
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,800
level and so on. And that begins to make sense of the world, but brings me right back to, well,

199
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,520
then what's it all made of that's doing this? And it also raises the question of, well, does

200
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,480
Bayesian brain approach actually turn into a theory of consciousness and not necessarily?

201
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,120
So I've been playing in fact, when I was on the retreat one evening, I was, we get a little bit

202
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,800
of free time and I went sat under a tree, and was kind of thinking about this with respect to the

203
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,680
tree that that I was looking at, and trying to think about what can underlie this on any kind of

204
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,720
modest view. And again, coming back to kind of fundamental thoughts about information and prediction.

205
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
You see, I can't give any answers. I mean, I'm really struggling with all this stuff. I don't

206
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,040
have my own theory beyond, beyond everyone's else is deluded. And so am I. Look, I completely agree

207
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,160
with you because when I came when I started this podcast, I was so I initially came to it with a

208
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,040
very emergentism approach. So I thought at some point, okay, these layers will eventually

209
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,880
culminate into an experience that we call consciousness. Then I went down the very

210
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,680
illusionist path. And I think fundamentally, my view is most likely aligned with that stall.

211
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,320
But as you're saying, after speaking to so many people and reading so many other philosophers

212
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,440
and thinkers, you start to question reality in general, because materialism as it stands

213
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
matter, we really just don't understand what matters. And I think that's the fundamental

214
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,880
problem why we cannot ever talk about reality in a way where we think what reality could ever be

215
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,840
is something beyond. So I completely agree with you. So even when I said that, look, when

216
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,440
there's certain things we cannot see in terms of reality, I still honestly do have no idea

217
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,520
what we should be seeing. So I agree on that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get quite annoyed. Got,

218
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,280
you know, bored of being annoyed that people just assume I'm a materialist. And I said,

219
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,040
no, I think materialism doesn't work any better than idealism work. And, you know,

220
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,800
that's why I call myself a neutral monist. But then when I look that up as what it actually

221
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,320
means in philosophical terms, it gets a little bit complicated. I think, God, I'm not that all I'm

222
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,920
saying is all I can say for sure is dualism doesn't work. For me, was Raymond Tellis,

223
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,800
he once said he's ontologically agnostic. And I like that. Oh, that's a nice phrase.

224
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,920
I really do. Yeah, because because ever since he said that, I think that's the

225
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,000
term I go to all the time. I'm ontologically agnostic. But when it comes to epistemology and

226
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,080
the stories we've been telling each other, I think I'm pretty much almost atheist towards

227
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,600
those stories or a whatever that theory is. Yeah, it doesn't have to have God, does it? A

228
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
theory story, something or another. Yes. Exactly. But I think it's a beautiful term,

229
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,000
ontologically agnostic. Thank you. When you think about your okay, so your journey,

230
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
you obviously at some point concluded, okay, these theories and the way we're approaching

231
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,040
this isn't working. It came down to ask yourself these questions. Am I conscious now? That was a

232
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,200
big part of your paper. Am I conscious now? Marvin Minsky once said, if you asked a computer,

233
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,080
if it's conscious now, it doesn't matter because humans can't answer that question. Anyway,

234
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,120
we spend most of our lives in autopilot. So if we ever expect a computer to really think about

235
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,120
the fact that it's conscious, we really do it ourselves. Is there anything you want to add on

236
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,080
that? Yeah, well, the large language models make that very interesting, don't they? Because

237
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,160
given that, I mean, the terrible thing is that they just amplify the idioses of what humans

238
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,160
say and write. So I imagine I've not tried this out, keep thinking I should spend some time playing

239
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,920
around with one of them. But, you know, given that so many people say, well, of course, I'm

240
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,360
conscious, then presumably picking it up from the massive database of everything people have said,

241
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,680
then these so-called AIs have not really, but, you know, we'll just say the same. Yes, of course,

242
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm conscious. I mean, if they can say, oh, I love you and I want to be with you and all those

243
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,280
ridiculous things that they do, they're going to say they're conscious and that doesn't tell us

244
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,720
anything at all any more than it tells us when somebody else says they're conscious. But that

245
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:15,520
question that you say that I wrote in that paper, that was 2016, I think that illusionism thing.

246
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,680
I've been thinking about this question a lot longer than that. And it kind of began, I suppose,

247
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,640
when I was happily a colleague of mine. In fact, he was also a Zen master. He was a

248
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,920
John Crook, a biology lecturer at Bristol University and a Zen master. And I was learning

249
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,760
to meditate with him. And this is going back to the 80s. And he was teaching a course that was

250
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,600
sort of involved quite a lot of consciousness. And he wanted to leave and devote himself more

251
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,480
to running retreats and so on. And so I took over this course. And I began teaching that

252
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,040
in the late 80s at some point, with a lot of, you know, there's so little was was known then.

253
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,440
And then in 1991, sort of early in my first few years of teaching, it's outcame Dennett's book.

254
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,440
And that really changed things and really forced me to think. And I met him, he came to Bristol

255
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,440
and gave a lecture and that really fired me up. And that made me do the first ever experiment on

256
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,440
change blindness, which worked out amazingly. And he predicted that it would work. And I thought,

257
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:33,440
well, I can do that, you know, and did with a student. So when I was teaching that course,

258
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,400
I was already asking myself, well, I'm talking about consciousness. Well, what is it? Okay,

259
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm conscious now. Or am I? What does that mean? And so I began right from the beginning of that

260
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,320
teaching near the beginning anyway, getting the students to do what I did. In other words,

261
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,800
to ask themselves many, many, many times a day, am I conscious now? The first thing I learned is

262
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,120
that they won't do it. Or most of them won't do it. Or the ones who say they're going to do it,

263
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,440
find it really hard to do. And at the end of the week, when they come back, let's say these

264
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
in those days were nice small classes, I have like 30 or 40 students and, you know,

265
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,240
and I could ask them all how many people did it, what happened? Most of them forgot to do it or

266
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,920
tried and didn't really get anywhere. Some had really insightful experiences and began to question

267
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,600
they had this shock, which I've written about as you probably know, but this kind of shock when

268
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,760
you go, are you conscious now? Hey, are you? I don't know whether I can get you to have it. But

269
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,600
you know, you suddenly think, Oh, well, of course I am. But a moment ago, I really don't know was

270
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,440
I it's as though I've woken up by asking the question. And in a way, I think this is a really

271
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,960
important point. I can even go so far as to say, you're not conscious unless you're asking yourself,

272
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,400
am I conscious? Exactly. It's that active awareness of the fact that you are asking yourself at least

273
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,440
it's almost that metacognition of it all. It is a metacognition, but it's a delusion,

274
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,440
isn't it? I mean, it's a word based thing. Am I conscious now is saying, and then you start looking

275
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,320
around and going, What am I conscious of? And, you know, that hence the second question in the

276
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,000
big textbook that I have follows. And I've just my daughter and I've just completed the fourth

277
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
edition, which will come out in a few months, I hope. And through all of the editions, every chapter

278
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,640
has one of these practices that I wanted students to do. I mean, a lot of them did get in the

279
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
hang of it after a while and they and really worked hard on it. But then it becomes, well,

280
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,800
what was I conscious of a moment ago? And lots of other questions of what, you know,

281
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,400
am I conscious of what what I was doing, all sorts of questions that that you can ask,

282
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,080
but they all depend on words. And if you do mindfulness practice without needing any words

283
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:01,040
by just kind of becoming present, then that gets you away from the wordiness a bit.

284
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,000
And then if you keep doing that a lot, then you're much more alert and open to what's going on.

285
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,320
But you can't really say anything more about it. And what's going on here? This is what's

286
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,480
really interests me. We fall back on these things that there's this thing called consciousness that,

287
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,080
you know, that we might find. And then we're back to the neural correlates of this thing

288
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,400
called consciousness, and it's got to be squirted out of the brain or, or as in the hard problem,

289
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,680
it's got to as Dave Chalmers put it, how does subjective experience arise from

290
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:43,040
objective activity in the brain. And so you come back to that sort of, to me, deluded idea that

291
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,480
consciousness is something that like toothpaste, it sort of comes out of your head.

292
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,080
You have to give me a definition of delusionism and perhaps compare it to illusionism.

293
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
How would you define and differentiate them?

294
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:04,720
Well, I would say that most versions of illusionism, I would agree with to the extent that they say

295
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,200
that something about our experience is not as it seems to be.

296
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm more specifically saying, we are actively deluded about it. Not just that it's an illusion,

297
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,320
but it's a kind of thinking problem, because we jump so quickly to assumptions. And that, and

298
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
if you look up delusion and illusion, they're not really that different, but delusion carries more

299
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,160
of a kind of intellectual, wordy thinking thing. And I think that's why I used that word to show

300
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,360
that we make assumptions that we can describe in words. Well, I think consciousness is made in the

301
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,440
anterior of something or whatever. I think consciousness is a product of the brain. I

302
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,760
think consciousness extends beyond the brain into the astral worlds, or I think consciousness

303
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,760
survives death. Whenever we talk about, people talk about these things, they are kind of

304
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:11,680
reifying with words, this thing. And the word delusionism, I think, gets to that more.

305
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,280
Maybe it doesn't for everyone, but that's what I think is the difference. But it's not a huge

306
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:24,240
difference. It's just, I think, if people say that illusionism is a theory of consciousness,

307
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
you said this, and I think I would disagree in the sense that it's not one theory. It's not

308
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,800
a testable theory, as a whole theory. It's a bunch of approaches that different people have,

309
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,640
and they're all slightly different. And we probably all agree that in some fundamental way,

310
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,880
we've mostly got it wrong about the nature of consciousness, that we probably disagree about

311
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360
where the origins of the mistakes are. Sorry, that's a bit rambly. I don't know whether that

312
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,720
answers your question. When I took illusion as a theory of consciousness, I was actually

313
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,800
directly quoting Frankish's paper, the headline. I think that's what he called it, illusionism as

314
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,240
a consciousness. So when I approached it, I used psychiatry to try and assist it and defend it.

315
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,320
But at some point, I used a lot of Carl Friston's work. I'm not sure. Are you familiar with Carl

316
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,880
Friston's work with the free energy? Well, I haven't read, I'm just started reading the latest book,

317
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,840
and it's very hard going. As I said, when my daughter and I were doing the fourth edition

318
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,000
of the textbook, I read a lot of the control hallucination sort of stuff, so predictive

319
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,800
processing. I think Carl Friston's work is brilliant, but I do not understand the maths.

320
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,080
I just simply do not have enough of a maths background to understand that. But I mean,

321
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,760
over the years, I've learned something about Bayesian theory, because it pops up in psychology

322
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,640
quite a lot. But I'm very much enamoured of the way that predictive processing is changing the

323
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,040
way we think about all sorts of things in psychology now, or in neuroscience. And I think

324
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,480
that's really going places. I think we're really going to get somewhere with that.

325
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,000
When I spoke to Carl, I actually asked him if he thinks when you apply his view of

326
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,600
Markovian Blankets, the understanding of the free energy principle, Bayesian brains,

327
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,000
does he think this is actually a theory that supports illusionism? And he said it, yes.

328
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,240
He actually said technically, it would, because when you take into account,

329
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,640
in my paper, and when I discuss this with him, if you take into account the prior information

330
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,840
you receive, because that's a fundamental aspect of all of this, you're taking a lot of

331
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,080
prior information, and then you make posterior conclusions regarding your experience. If most

332
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,760
of your prior information tells you things like, I'm a self, I'm a person, I have a conscious entity,

333
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,080
your most likely posterior outcome is going to be, I am a self, I am a person, I have consciousness.

334
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,520
And then at some point, I used your work to say, if you define a delusion, a fixed false belief,

335
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,960
and if already the illusion has promoted a false belief, it becomes fixed at some point because

336
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
of all the prior information you've already received regarding this. And at some point,

337
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
that's why delusionism is bound to occur. And I think that's how I sort of work.

338
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,040
Great. I must watch this, your discussion with him, which I should, but there are so many things

339
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,640
to watch and listen to. It's a wonderful world, but it's also so difficult to choose, but I will

340
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,280
do that. But you were talking about Markov Blankets and Free Energy Principle and so on.

341
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,480
Again, the maths defeats me when it comes to Markov Blankets, although I do want to pursue

342
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,720
that more. But I have spent quite a lot of time thinking about the Free Energy Principle, because

343
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,160
it relates to what I was saying earlier about my interest in whether we can base an entire world

344
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,280
on some kind of informational theory, and trying to struggle with how that relates to Gibbs Free

345
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:48,160
Energy. And there are relationships between them. But again, I don't have all the background

346
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,080
skills to do very well with this, but I really think this is important and will help us a lot.

347
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,880
And I agree. I think so as well. I think at this point in your career, which aspects of this problem

348
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,840
or is it free will? Is it consciousness still? What's intriguing you the most at this point?

349
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,360
Well, you say at this point in my career, did you say?

350
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,760
So much. I mean, if you think about it, your work spans on so many different aspects. You

351
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,640
talk about memes, you talk about consciousness, free will, Paris psychology, there's so many

352
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,560
different elements to your career that it makes it quite difficult for one to actually try and do

353
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,280
an interview. Which is why I don't call it a career, because I only had a proper job for a few

354
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,960
years, because I couldn't quite hack it. I prefer to work by myself sitting here, you know. So I,

355
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,520
you know, I always kind of feel a bit surprised. I mean, my initial reaction to that question is

356
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm really struggling with, you know, I'm 71, surely. And people are always saying to me,

357
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,480
Oh, you don't need to work anymore. You should be. And I have a big garden on the river. And,

358
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,560
you know, I'm spending a lot of time growing vegetables. And why don't you just do that?

359
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,640
Oh, and I do painting and kayaking and weightlifting and all kinds of things. You know,

360
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,640
why don't you just do those things and forget all that work? When I'm sitting there doing the

361
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,040
email, I'm like, Oh, God, you know. And so you could say at this point, I give it all up. But

362
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,800
that's not true. The more serious answer is it's really we've we've touched on this many times

363
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,160
already. It's really the what is the nature of the world? How does a world sustain what appears

364
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,840
to be dual existence observers and observed experiences and experiences when I believe

365
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,360
and so do you, I think that there is no true observer observing them. And you can have and

366
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,360
importantly, you can have experience without an experiencer with a lot of practice. And that's

367
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,120
really interesting how brains, you know, if you are in the delusion of the self is really in charge,

368
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,920
then it becomes really peculiar to think, Well, I am trying to get rid of myself.

369
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,360
I am trying to not believe anymore in me, you know, those kinds of things you get in all sorts

370
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:08,160
of tangles. And yet certain processes lead to a brain that is more adept at dropping some kinds

371
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,280
of illusions. So part of the answer to your interesting and difficult question is, that's

372
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,960
why I still go on retreats. This particular one I've just come back from was a co on retreat.

373
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,160
And I had a really, really tricky and interesting co on, which I have not resolved, which is good,

374
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,880
because then I can keep, it can keep working, but has had some quite profound effects on me

375
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,240
with all the struggles going on. So that's one way. And again, that's not a career is it,

376
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,240
but that's one way that I want to engage by doing I meditate every day and have done for

377
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,120
40 years nearly. To practice and train this brain and then thinking sort of memetically and

378
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:57,840
evolutionarily. It's not me train the brain. It's this person being having picked up

379
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,000
Zen meditation memes over there is somehow thinks it's worth doing and goes on doing,

380
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,200
you know, you when he's tried to dismantle those those prior assumptions about self,

381
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,560
you start thinking in these weird ways. So that's one big streak of it. The other has been

382
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,880
for my daughter and I doing this fourth edition and me getting into the predictive

383
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,040
processing, I'm still really interested in that. And I've got two books at the moment that I want

384
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:33,440
to read relevant to that. I've also got totally different thread going on, which I started last

385
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:42,720
year writing a book called, well, it's pretend possible title is God's memes, how and how

386
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,480
religions evolve to exploit us and why we let them. So you can imagine this is, you know,

387
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,080
they are memes out there, horrible meme plexus that get into people's heads and then you can't

388
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,960
get them out. So I'm reading books now about sort of mental immunity and that kind of thing. So I'm

389
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,280
doing that and it's all so I can't give you an answer. Perhaps I should. I think all my friends

390
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
and family will say for goodness sake, give an answer just decide what you're going, you know,

391
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,600
but I can't I just get I just keep thinking and being tempted by difficult ideas.

392
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,880
I remember there was a time where I was about, I think I was about nine and and at that point I

393
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,840
became very atheist to a point where I was very anti-theist. And I still remember as the years

394
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,320
went on, where were you living then? What sort of situation were you in? I'm from South Africa,

395
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,240
but I'm from Indian descent. But in South Africa, Indians have been living here for almost I think

396
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,840
about 160 plus years. So we're generations in at this point. And I think I'm like eight.

397
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,240
So did you have religious parents or I'm just I think so they are they couldn't they Hindu

398
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,040
by origin. Some of my family are Islam. I've a Muslim, so they follow Islam. And but I grew up

399
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,600
very much Hindu. But at some point, not really convinced about it. But I think my dad

400
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,280
subliminally just tried to hint me towards non-believing like just not doing it. You know,

401
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
he constantly made me watch National Geographic. He made me he wanted me to break away from

402
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,640
it somehow. So it happened very early on. And I remember throughout the years, I was very

403
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,600
anti-theist. And it was when I started coming across a lot of your guys work. So so Dennett,

404
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,360
Dawkins, Hitchens. And I still remember thinking, I mean, this this finally I found this group of

405
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,240
people where they're thinking the same thing. I'm pretty much it's all I've been thinking about.

406
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,200
When you find yourself writing this book at this point, I'm not as anti-theist as I used to be.

407
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,000
I mean, I can understand why we think this and why we get to that point. But I remember you first

408
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,560
break out, it's almost kind of like you want to go all out and and get the best arguments.

409
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,080
Do you feel like that's changed for you over the years where you found yourself constantly wanting

410
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,960
to battle and debate? And now you kind of just like, I might as well just let the person think

411
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,600
what they want until it sort of involves something that's going to directly. Well, this is why I was

412
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,360
interested in where you were coming from, because I was brought up as a Christian. My mother was a

413
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,240
was quite serious Christian. I mean, in the Church of England sort of way,

414
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,560
when she went to church most Sundays, I occasionally went and I had phases. So I didn't

415
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,560
ever have any, you know, really violently. I just remember as a teenager, just I went to the most

416
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,480
horrendous boarding school, and we had to go to chapel every day and twice on Sundays. And I, you

417
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,960
know, it was so boring. And then I began to think, well, it's also rather stupid and doesn't make sense.

418
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,120
And so I became quite quite atheist, but not in an aggressive kind of way. Then at the age of 26,

419
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,680
I fell deeply in love. And both of us became kind of a bit Christian again. And we had to

420
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,680
get married in a Christian church, because that was what you did in those days and where we were.

421
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,360
And that lasted maybe a year or two and kind of gently fizzled out. So I was a very different

422
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,280
kind of experience from you. When I've been trying to write this book, I certainly how I

423
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,760
should admit that I have some times when I'm thinking, and I want to write, this is total crap,

424
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,560
yo, what idiot can believe this, you know, and I think, well, it's not very constructive. And

425
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:20,560
actually, they're not all idiots who believe these things. Oh, I've had the most twice recently

426
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:29,120
had time to talk at length with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. And he is such an

427
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:38,880
interesting man. There is an intelligent kind, as far as I can tell, public spirited, longing to

428
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:47,920
help people, person who will talk to me as an atheist in a very friendly and open way. And I

429
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,960
try to remember people like that. Now, I think he is completely deluded about the nature of the

430
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,960
universe and how we got here and everything else. But I really like talking to him about it. So I

431
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:10,400
guess that helps me be a little more flexible in the way I use my atheism.

432
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Yeah, my girlfriend is Christian, and I know she is a believer in it. But I feel like this age,

433
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,480
and at this time in my life, it's no longer a thing, because I know if it was 10 years ago,

434
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,160
it would be something that would be a deal break. Ultimate, it would be done. But at this,

435
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,120
I often think when you're talking about this, I remember the conversation you had with

436
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,680
Jordan Peterson, and you guys discuss this, do you, now while writing this book,

437
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,400
are you looking back at certain conversations like that, and formulating counter arguments to

438
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,040
someone like Jordan, who's very good at arguing and counter points, even though you fundamentally

439
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,120
obviously disagree with? Oh, that was a quite scary encounter. But I saw a little bit of it the

440
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,640
other day, because somebody asked me, I get so confused about all these things, but somebody

441
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,920
asked me to go on their podcast or something. I haven't gone anywhere with this yet. It was

442
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,720
literally yesterday, and that he was putting together some kind of something or other that

443
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,120
included clips for me and Jordan Peterson. And so I watched it, it was very short, you know,

444
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,880
like a minute. I thought, oh, good for me. I actually stood up to him and argued back. I mean,

445
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:23,120
God, I knew nothing about it. I had not even heard of him. When Premier Christian Radio it was,

446
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:30,160
the discussion was on. I'd done things for, Justin Briley runs it, and I'd done things for him

447
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,480
before and enjoyed it very much. So I was happy to go along. And I had to look up Jordan Peterson,

448
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,360
but you know, time being what it is. I read his, I read his book most of it on the train going up

449
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:48,400
to London. It's three and a half hours from here. And it's 12 rules for living, which had quite an

450
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,360
impact on me, because some, you know, ludicrous things in there, and yet it's a bestseller,

451
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,440
and people follow the rules, and one must be nice to cats. And I mean, there's weird things in there.

452
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:08,000
Like make your bed and small things. Yes, yes, yes, quite good advice. And yet the whole

453
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,160
thing's wrapped up in these weird stuff. And I was sitting there, kind of getting cross with it in

454
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,400
the train. And there was this elderly couple opposite me. Now, I mean, again, I'm interested in,

455
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,480
in where you were when you were growing up, because during my life here in England,

456
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,280
people have got less and less and less religious. So this is typical of me. I don't think first

457
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,760
before I speak. Sorry. But there was this elderly couple opposite me on the table in the train.

458
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,600
And I so went, I sort of looked up at them. I said, Oh, God, this book's doing my head in

459
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,440
or something like that. You know, oh, what is the book? And I said, Oh, that's really interesting.

460
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,760
I said, Oh, he believes in God. And I went to, you know, just that's the sort of thing I would

461
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,640
say. And they said, Yeah, isn't that trouble? And just to completely agree with me. And that is a

462
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,880
kind of assumption I occasionally fall foul of. I was on a group walk up on Dartmoor a couple of

463
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,600
weeks ago. And I happened to say something just assuming that the two people who were listening

464
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,200
to me wouldn't believe in God. And one of them said, Well, I think that something about Jesus

465
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,720
Christ is my, you know, whatever, should be more careful, or should I? And it always raises that

466
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,720
question. I think the fact that I can safely assume almost all the time that other people

467
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,120
around me don't believe in God. They're not thoughtful. I mean, they haven't thought through

468
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,280
their atheism to great deep degree. They just, they just, it's the normal thing around here,

469
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,560
you know, people in my village, we all go and sing Christmas carols at Christmas and thoroughly

470
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,880
enjoy ourselves. And so, and then, you know, those things in the Christmas carols like,

471
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,360
does not abhor the Virgin's womb, you know, I think, Oh, yeah. And so some of us women are

472
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,000
going, Virgin's women, you know, we're just having a laugh. And maybe some people in the

473
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,160
audience in the village, if there's about 100 of us there in the village square, you know,

474
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,600
who are really upset by what we're doing, but that's kind of the atmosphere that I live in.

475
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:06,960
So it's very easy to be loosely atheist or more strictly atheist and not have to make a big fuss

476
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,880
about it. I still do remember that was quite a long time ago, because at that point, I don't

477
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,720
think Jordan was at this level of, of, of fame and popularity is at this point. It was around

478
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,280
the time I think Sam and him also got into a huge debate and they had that two part series where

479
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,000
they got really into it. In doing your research, I mean, are you rereading books like The God

480
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,440
Delusion or Why God is Not Great by Hitchens? Are you, how's your research process going with this

481
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:40,640
book? So the specific question, I started reading Hitchens again. And like the first time, I

482
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:49,280
really disliked it intensely. It's unkind, spiky. Very aggressive, yes. I don't, I don't like it.

483
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:58,000
The God Delusion, I may well read again. But most of my research has been online finding

484
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,480
things out. I mean, the things I found out like, okay, it seems to me that religions should

485
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,920
make people behave like their religion tells them and therefore be kinder and more altruistic. So

486
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,440
look into all the, you know, research evidence on, on whether it's true and it's not, you know,

487
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,680
and it was, the evidence goes in all sorts of directions, but basically it's not. And then I

488
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:29,760
got very interested in, in poverty and, you know, it's a very obvious, excuse me, it's a very obvious

489
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,520
fact about the world that the poorest countries are the most religious. Now, why is that? And then

490
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,160
there's Gregory Paul's research showing that if you compare developed countries

491
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:51,760
on what he calls a dysfunctional society scale against how religious they are, well,

492
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,800
the most religious countries are the most dysfunctional, meaning that the more religious

493
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:05,440
the country is, the higher rates it has of murder, teenage pregnancy, abortion,

494
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:13,280
various kinds of serious crime, incarceration rates. I mean, all the things that you would expect

495
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:20,960
that a religion would improve are actually very much worse. And then there's the question, why? So

496
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:28,720
we're back to causality and correlation. These are all correlations. Now it looks from the evidence

497
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:39,120
as though it's not that religions cause depravity, murder, incarceration rates, it's rather the

498
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,400
reverse. It's that living in a dysfunctional society where you are afraid for your health,

499
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,880
for your life, for everything makes you turn to religion. And then the means get hold of you

500
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,480
and you start to believe that you're good because you believe this stuff and you're good because

501
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,760
all of that and you're good because you oppose abortion and you whatever and you think people

502
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,480
should be locked up for whatever it is. And so the United States is particularly interesting

503
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,040
in that respect because it's a very rich country, but it has high rates of religion and it's so

504
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,760
different from the UK speaking sort of the same language, which we have a state religion and

505
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,240
they don't. It's so interesting that. So I mean, I just got myself hooked into, you know,

506
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,760
reading loads of stuff to draw and work out the effects of being captured by religious means.

507
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,200
I haven't read, I know Dawkins wrote a book, I think, it wasn't too long ago for,

508
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,320
was it for young teens, I think, for a book? What is it called? Do you remember? I forgot

509
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,440
the name of the book. No, and I haven't read it either. Maybe I should. There's so much to read

510
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,360
and it's so interesting. The reason why I'm asking about that is, I mean, I know that

511
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,200
Charles Darwin is a big inspiration for you. I mean, I love Charles Darwin. He's one of my

512
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,000
favorite people of all time, possibly. And, and I know Dawkins also up there, these guys,

513
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,600
how have they influenced your way of thinking overall in life? Oh, hugely. I mean, my two greatest,

514
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,760
if you have this lovely sort of dinner party thing, you know, who would you invite from the

515
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,200
Mount Rushmore? Your Mount Rushmore.

516
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,280
Why? I'm sorry, I'm not with you. So, you know, Mount Rushmore, the fourth figures,

517
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
the leading figures. It's not all those, yeah, but they're all presidents, weren't they?

518
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,600
But I mean, who would those four people be in terms of the thinkers? You're talking about the

519
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,600
dinner table. It's sort of a similar... Oh, no, yeah, yeah. That's so different, though. They're

520
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,080
not on a pedestal. They are. They are. I would like them, like the Archbishop of Canterbury. I

521
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,080
would like to sit down. I like so, my husband and I went to dinner with him. We sat around a

522
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,720
lovely table in Lambeth Palace and had a lovely chat. So, I'm thinking of that, not

523
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:48,560
so my top two would be Charles Darwin and William James. Now, we haven't mentioned William James,

524
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:56,320
but he is such a great hero of mine. Now, his two volumes of 1890, The Principles of Psychology,

525
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,720
has such a profound effect on me. And I keep thinking about him, how way ahead of his time he

526
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,600
was, and the way he thought about things. He clearly was struggling with the kind of problems

527
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,880
we've been talking about here, about dualism, about the nature of the world, the nature of the mind.

528
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,120
Can there be split personalities? And does that mean there's really somebody or not?

529
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,080
And I love one of his thoughts about, and this is all in the textbook, and my son, Julian, did a

530
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:31,600
lovely cartoon of cows, where he says the owner of the thought, and so the thought with a big T,

531
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,600
is then, in the next moment, passes off the owner of the cow's one, and then the thoughts,

532
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,440
passes them on. It's a new owner, but the same, you know, cows. There isn't a, there isn't a

533
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:53,120
continuous self. Exactly. I'm sorry about that. James's idea that, I mean, his chat is 100 pages,

534
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:59,360
his chapter on self, and it's really hard going, and I've read it a few times. I'd love to have

535
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,040
time to read it again, but I don't. But it very much fits with the kind of Buddhist

536
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:13,920
non-self, or another kind of view that the self isn't what you think it is. And the Buddha was

537
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,520
sometimes saying, there is a self in terms of isn't, which of course fits with the same thing.

538
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,920
There is this illusion, but there isn't the thing that you think the illusion tells you there is.

539
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,160
And William James was really struggling with all of that. So he would be, along with Darwin,

540
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,040
they're my two great historical figures that I so much admire. Of recently, well, I know Richard

541
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,800
Dawkins very well. He's been to stay here a few times. You know, I meet him anyway, so I don't

542
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:49,440
have to have a mythical dinner table. Then it's same. Yep. We have occasional meme lab meetings

543
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,320
here. We've got one coming up soon, and both of them have been to those, and we've been able to

544
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,880
have long chats about memes and things. And I admire both of them, but they're both still alive

545
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,200
and going strong, which is great. One of the William James quotes that come to my mind, because when

546
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,200
you think about, particularly what you're talking about with religion and how people are influenced

547
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,640
by other people and language, etc. I mean, he talks about how pruning of brains William James

548
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,960
once said, I think he said, for a child, sensory inputs, one great blooming, buzzing confusion.

549
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,080
I think it's something along those lines. Yes, yes, the blooming, buzzing confusion.

550
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,600
Yes. Because at some point, we just take in the information we receive, and then that point,

551
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,880
that becomes your fundamental beliefs. And if everything you, if all the memes you were gathering

552
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,640
over the years were about religion or about a specific view on consciousness, that's what

553
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,280
you're firmly going to believe at some point. But the buzzing, blooming confusion is very

554
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,640
interesting because it led to all these different arguments in psychology about just how much we

555
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,000
have prewired and how much we don't. So he was in the direction of, although not entirely,

556
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:00,320
in the direction of that it's not prewired, it's all got to be in response to the input,

557
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,480
which was a pretty novel idea then really. And now I think we know that there's quite a lot of

558
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,760
prewiring. But still, that the brain becomes organized by the organization in the, in the

559
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,320
structure of the input. So the visual cortex or auditory cortex get organized in the way the

560
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,480
input comes in. And now this is another thing to think about in terms of predictive processing.

561
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,000
So when you think about a system that is at many levels at once trying to predict what's

562
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,600
coming in the, from the next layer, that fits with it. Your, your baby with buzzing,

563
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,680
blooming, buzzing confusion is, is, you know, struggling. It's got a structure set up that

564
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,600
is capable to do this struggling, that is capable of making predictions, but they're going to be

565
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,720
really simple like to do with, if I put, we're back to, if, you know, if I put my arm here,

566
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,360
ooh, it hit something and then I'll predict and the way babies learn that and the way they blah,

567
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:02,400
blah, blah, blah, and gradually hone what the noises they make according to the responses and

568
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,880
so on. So yes, I think a lot of William James's ideas, not all, I mean, a lot of things he said

569
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,200
were simply bomb, you know, that he didn't have the physiology. But a lot of those ideas

570
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,360
are still helpful. I think one of my favorite quotes as well has got to be,

571
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,400
then it's illusion. I mean, consciousness is illusion off the brain for the brain,

572
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,040
by the brain. Oh, I've not heard that, but yes, yes.

573
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,160
Off the brain for the brain and by the brain. By the brain. Yeah.

574
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,120
When you hear something like that, what do you think? How do you think then it would approach

575
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,000
a lot of the new idealist theories that are coming out today? Any idea? I've spoken to him by email,

576
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,840
but seems to be relatively unavailable to chat on a podcast lately.

577
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:50,080
Oh, he's been terribly busy with all this paper on artificial persons and all the

578
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,480
danger of that because he normally replies to my emails very quickly and he didn't this time.

579
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,440
And then when he did replies, I've been totally snowed under with all this stuff.

580
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,920
And you know, so that's probably why I think he would be irritated by it,

581
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,760
but I don't know and I shouldn't speak for him. Now, I must say, I believe that when we fixed

582
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:16,880
this up a long time ago, I said I could only talk for an hour because you can tell I can't,

583
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,240
this is my problem. I've got chronic fatigue. It's not too bad at the moment,

584
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,400
but I can't not pour out lots of energy. So I've been sitting here really enjoying talking to you,

585
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,400
but it takes a lot of energy and I need to sort of collapse pretty soon.

586
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,920
So I completely understand. I know so much, but thank you. I really appreciate it. I've

587
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,720
been waiting a long time and hopefully in the future we can chat about something in a bit

588
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,120
more detail because there's so many topics I want to discuss with you.

589
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,240
Well, you asked brilliant questions. I do quite a lot of podcasts and they vary so much.

590
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,480
And you know, this is one of the fun ones where some of the questions are fun because I can

591
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,520
answer them easily. Others are fun because I can't answer them and you're really making me think

592
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,240
I'm pushing me and that's that's good. So thank you.

593
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,760
I really appreciate it. I mean, it's great to hear that. I feel much better

594
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,240
leaving this conversation knowing you feel that way. Thank you so much.

595
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,640
It's great. Have a great evening, Sue. And yeah, and we'll chat again.

596
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,800
Oh, let's do that. I would enjoy that. Thanks very much. Cheers.

597
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Bye.
