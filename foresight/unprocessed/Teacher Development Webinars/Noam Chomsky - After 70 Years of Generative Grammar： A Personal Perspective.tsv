0	7000	Yes, you can start.
7000	10000	What did you say?
10000	16000	Good to go.
16000	27000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to our session today. This is a very special session because of our guest, but also because TESOL Tampico Talks is collaborating
27000	37000	with teacher development webinars. My friend Amunalai is here. My name is Jorge Torsal Masan, and we want to welcome you to this unique session.
37000	46000	Amunalai is going to introduce himself, and he's also going to introduce our special guest. I mean, he needs no introduction, but he's going to go for the protocol.
46000	51000	Amunalai, over to you.
51000	62000	Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim. As-salamu alaikum. My name is Zaman al-Dawthand, and I just asked, you know, with the couplet of Shah Latif, the famous poet of Sindh.
62000	63000	He says,
63000	90000	It translates as those worshippers who search the ocean and find different jewels from the depths. Latif says they are the ones who have found profound ones.
90000	101000	So it's my singular honor, a player, and a privilege to introduce Professor Noam Chomsky, considered the founder of a modern linguistics.
101000	110000	Noam Chomsky is one of the most cited scholars in modern history. Among his groundbreaking books are Syndicate Structures, Language in Mind,
111000	124000	aspects of the theory of syntax and the minimalist program, each of which has met distinct contributions to the development of the field. He has received numerous evas, including the Kyoto Prize in basic sciences, the
124000	139000	Helmholtz Medal and the Ben Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science. Chomsky introduced the Chomsky Hierarchy Generative Grammar and the concept of a universal grammar which underlies all human speech and is best in the innate
139000	153000	structure of the mind brain. Chomsky has not only transformed the field of linguistics, his work has influenced a field such as cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, computer science, mathematics,
154000	176000	childhood education, and anthropology. Professor Chomsky is one of the most influential public intellectuals in the world. He has written more than 100 books and his website is www.chomsky.com. Certainly right said by the New York Times magazine, the most important intellectual alive.
176000	182000	So ladies and gentlemen, Professor Noam Chomsky for you.
184000	188000	Over to you sir.
188000	217000	Over to you sir.
217000	223000	Thank you for the technical problems.
223000	228000	Times brief there's a lot I would like to cover.
228000	240000	So I'll have to keep to a sketchy rather informal account we can extend things in the question period.
240000	259000	The first term goal of theoretical inquiry is explanation, not just description. Description is hard enough descriptive inquiries seek to show that this is the way things are.
259000	275000	The explanation seeks to show why things are this way, and not some other way. So much more ambitious endeavor, but it is the goal to keep in mind.
275000	296000	In the case of language inquiry proceeds at two levels. One level is concerned with in languages. The second and higher level is concerned with the general faculty of language.
296000	320000	And the other to it as FL faculty of language. FL is the innate endowment that enables a language to be acquired and used. The theory of FL is called universal grammar, you G traditional term it's adapted to a new context.
320000	347000	At the first level the study of individual languages inquiry seeks an adequate grammar of the language, the description of the properties of the language, an adequate grammar must at the very least provide a listing technically a recursive enumeration of the grammatical sentences.
347000	371000	Beyond that, it must yield what has been called the basic property of language. Each language is a digital infinity of hierarchically structured expressions, each of which determine determines perhaps constitutes a thought.
371000	380000	Each of which can optionally be externalized in some sensory motor medium.
380000	404000	A bold thesis would be the generation of thought by the internal language is entirely separated from externalization, which would be an ancillary process. I'll actually assume this return to pretty strong reasons to suppose that it's correct.
404000	425000	In this conception, the internal language consists of the compositional rules that satisfy the basic property, along with what's called formal semantics more accurately term logical syntax.
426000	452000	Important matter that I'll put aside here. The system for generating thought, we can call I language, it's internal individual in the technical sense, intentional with an S meaning we're interested in the actual system coded in the brain, not just one that yields the same output.
452000	468000	Well, understood in this way, the study of language conforms to a long tradition from classical Greece, classical India up through the 19th century.
468000	487000	Throughout the core of the tradition, regarded language as fundamentally a system of thought as audible thought in the phrase of the 19th century linguist William Dwight Whitney.
487000	506000	We know that the restriction of sound is too narrow. This tradition was swept aside in the 20th century by behaviorist and structuralist currents, and it was forgotten. It's still very little known.
507000	523000	Modern approaches in the 20th century take language to be at its root, a system of communication, rather than a system of thought system that perhaps evolved from animal communication.
523000	542000	Recent work seems to me to indicate quite clearly that the tradition was on the right track and should be carried forward. That's a controversial view today, but I think it's justified, and I'll adopt it here.
542000	564000	No returning to explanation. The task arises only at the higher level. In query into FL, the faculty of language seems that any human infant can acquire any language with comparable facility.
564000	582000	If so, FL is a shared human property. There's also by now substantial evidence that FL is unique to humans, that its fundamental properties have no analog in the animal world.
582000	610000	If so, FL is a true species property shared by humans, unique to human essentials. FL must enable any human infant to acquire any language to condition on UG that has been called explanatory adequacy since the 1950s.
611000	636000	Sometimes it's called Plato's problem. It was raised in a certain form by Plato, as it was formulated by Bertrand Russell. It's the problem of how we can know so much, given so little evidence in technical terms of linguistics, it's the problem of poverty of stimulus.
636000	662000	In the early days of the generative enterprise in mid 20th century, it was recognized that the poverty of stimulus problem was quite serious, and that standard formulas within behaviorist frameworks will get nowhere.
662000	685000	There are contemporary variants with supercomputers and astronomical amounts of data, but they do no better. These early conclusions were established more firmly as serious experimental inquiry was undertaken in later years into language acquisition.
686000	708000	It was found that the problem of poverty of stimulus is far more severe than had been assumed. By now it's been quite solidly established that the knowledge of language of a two to three year old child goes far beyond what they exhibit in behavior,
708000	736000	and also that the gap between data available and knowledge attained is vast greatly deepens Plato's problem. These results seem to suggest that the faculty of language must be rich enough to yield complex knowledge from impoverished data, very rich therefore.
737000	759000	Well, at the same time, FL must somehow accommodate the wide variety of languages poses a problem that problem deepens return to another condition that FL must satisfy, sometimes called Darwin's problem.
760000	781000	How can FL have evolved under the conditions of human evolution, though evidence is fragmentary. There are some plausible conclusions about these conditions. Modern humans appeared about two to 300,000 years ago.
782000	792000	There's no genomic evidence that the small group of humans began to separate not long after they appeared.
793000	800000	All share FL, which was presumably already in place.
800000	812000	Prior to the appearance of modern humans, there's virtually no indication of significant symbolic activity in the archaeological record.
812000	825000	Not long after their appearance, there's very rich evidence. Note that these numbers are barely a flick of an eye in evolutionary time.
825000	836000	Well, all of this suggests that FL appeared in a narrow window of time, pretty much along with modern humans.
836000	847000	And there's quite strong evidence that it hasn't changed since. Well, if all that's the case, we expect FL to be very simple.
847000	857000	So we therefore face a conundrum. FL must be rich enough to handle Plato's problem.
857000	873000	At the same time, simple enough to deal with Darwin's problem and the apparent wide diversity of languages all determined by FL lurks in the background.
873000	881000	These are basic conditions that be satisfied by UG.
881000	897000	The conditions appear to be contradictory and much of the search for explanatory theory in past years has been guided by this apparent contradiction.
897000	908000	For the first time, I think we can now begin to see how the conundrum might be resolved. So let's turn to that.
908000	924000	Let's begin with the problem of diversity. That problem would be greatly reduced if diversity of language is sequestered in a particular component of the overall system.
924000	936000	The natural place to look is in externalization, excluding the language operations that yield the thought system.
936000	950000	That move has initial plausibility for eye language, the POS, the repository of stimulus problems are overwhelming, generally insurmountable.
950000	957000	For externalization, at least there's some direct evidence what's heard or seen.
957000	976000	Though this hasn't been firmly established, research is tending towards showing that the variety, complexity, and easy mutability of language is indeed sequestered in externalization,
976000	992000	leaving the system of generative generation of thought relatively fixed, be completely fixed, we might someday discover that would vindicate an ancient tradition.
992000	1014000	If this turns out to be true for language, it wouldn't be very surprising. Externalization, some sensory motor medium, is not strictly speaking language, rather it's a combination of the internal system for generation of thought
1014000	1026000	and sensory motor systems that have nothing to do with language. They were in place long before language appeared, haven't changed since.
1026000	1046000	So we might expect that mapping the internal language system into completely unrelated sensory motor systems would be a complex task, solvable in many ways, easily subject to at least superficial change.
1046000	1061000	And so it seems to be. Well, if this is basically correct, then the poverty of stimulus problems reduce largely to externalization.
1061000	1075000	These topics have been the subject of extensive research since the principles and parameters framework was formulated 40 years ago.
1075000	1088000	That was the first approach that offered at least a potential framework for accounting for acquisition of language in a feasible manner.
1088000	1104000	And very important work, much of it by the late Ken Hale and his students, which is shown that languages that appear to be radically different are actually cast to the same mold at deeper levels.
1104000	1119000	One high point in this research was Mark Baker's work on showing that on developing a hierarchy of parameters.
1119000	1144000	The major step forward was later taken by Ian Roberts, who's shown that very simple algorithms based on elementary cognitive principles can feasibly zero in on choice of parameters tested this approach with thousands of languages of great typological
1144000	1160000	variety. I think we can fairly say that the problem of externalization systems is fairly well in hand, at least in principle, partly in practice.
1160000	1177000	And if externalization is the primary, maybe the only locus of variation, a large part of the conundrum is on its way to resolution, namely variability and learnability.
1177000	1200000	Well, to proceed beyond, let's turn to some concrete examples. I'll begin with the most fundamental property of human language, one that is quite surprising in many ways, and has rich consequences that are not always sufficiently appreciated.
1200000	1215000	This is the property called structure dependence. Let's briefly review some standard cases. So begin with the operation of construal.
1215000	1231000	For example, finding out what verb phrase an advert modifies to take the sentence, the man who fixed the car carefully packed his tools. It's actually ambiguous.
1231000	1247000	Could mean he fixed the car carefully, or he carefully packed his tools. Now, place the adverb in the front, carefully, the man who fixed the car, packed his tools.
1247000	1262000	It's unambiguous, can only mean he carefully packed his tools. Actually, that poses a puzzle. The advert in initial position has to find a verb phrase to modify.
1262000	1282000	But in doing so, we ignore the simplest computation, find the closest verb phrase, which would be fix the car. We reflexively ignore that and choose the more remote verb phrase, packed his tools.
1282000	1288000	It's clear if you think about the structure of the sentence.
1288000	1307000	The phrase packed his tools is actually closer to the advert, then fixed his car, fixed the car in the abstract structure. And that's what we attend to, though we never hear it is actually more involved.
1307000	1326000	But that's enough to bring out the basic puzzle. We ignore the simple computation on linear order of words. We reflexively carry out a computation on strict structure. Let's take a second example.
1326000	1338000	Anaphors terms that don't refer in themselves but find to and find an earlier antecedent that determines what they refer to.
1338000	1363000	Well, the simplest algorithm is to seek the closest eligible antecedent as in sentences like the boys expect the girls to like each other means the girls like each other, not the boys. Sometimes, however, that fails as in sentences like the friends of the boys like each other.
1363000	1380000	Here it's the friends who like each other, not the boys, the closest antecedent. So once again, we ignore the simplest algorithm, which relies on what we hear words in linear order.
1380000	1400000	Now we use an algorithm that applies to abstract structures, and it's quite complex. First we have to identify the subject noun phrase, then we identify by the core element within the noun phrase, choose that as the antecedent.
1400000	1403000	That's what we do reflexively.
1403000	1421000	Final example, take verbal agreement sentence like the bombing of the city cities is a crime, not are a crime. The bombings of the city are a crime, not is a crime.
1421000	1444000	So again, we reflexively ignore the simplest operation, adjacency, and again carry out an operation that looks quite complex construct the abstract structure, subject predicate, locate the head of that structure.
1444000	1447000	That's what we do reflexively.
1448000	1458000	Well, these observations generalized structure dependence holds of all constructions in all languages.
1458000	1482000	What that means is that from infancy and on through life, we reflexively ignore 100% of what we hear words in linear order. We attend only to what we never hear abstract structures generated by the mind and operations on these structures.
1482000	1496000	Furthermore, experimental work has shown that the principle is known to children as early as they can be tested two years old or less.
1496000	1510000	Notice that this curious property is restricted to I language, the generation of thought principle doesn't hold for externalization.
1510000	1526000	Well, the only plausible conclusion is that I language and externalization are distinct systems for I language, computation ignores what is externalized.
1526000	1553000	Furthermore, all of this must be part of the innately fixed faculty of language property of Eugene conclusion further supports the thesis that I language which is language proper is a system of generation of thought, as was assumed in the millennia old tradition.
1553000	1571000	Prior to the behaviorist structuralist revision in the 20th century. Well, it's plain why languages use linear order for externalization is required by the speech organs, which cannot produce structures.
1571000	1582000	In fact, sign language, which is the resources of visual space available, does not adhere strictly to linearization.
1582000	1604000	We recall that the sensory motor organs used for externalization are unrelated to language and their nature and evolution. So it's not surprising that I think which pure language ignores the properties that are imposed by these non linguistic organs.
1604000	1625000	Well, with this in mind, we can turn to the why questions. Why does Eugene for structured abundance. The optimal answer would be that this follows from the simplest forms of Eugene, using the simplest operation for generating expressions.
1625000	1642000	The simplest operation is unbounded binary set formation. It's the basis for what's called merge in the literature, and in fact, structure dependence does follow directly from merge.
1642000	1658000	So to put it metaphorically, when mother nature created language, she found the simplest possible solution, which is incidentally, the way evolution works.
1658000	1677000	Similarly, all of science so it appears to driving intuition of science since Galileo spinoso broadly verified that Einstein called it the miracle creed that guides all serious inquiry.
1677000	1700000	In terms of language, it's called the strong thesis. Reliance on merge as the soul structure building operation has many other crucial empirical consequences won't be able to go into it in the time available but there's fair amount in the literature.
1700000	1718000	Reliance on merge as the soul structure building operation yields the core of the basic property, generating an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions.
1718000	1734000	I can only add that the primitive elements of the system are elementary concepts, elaborated by merge these become phrases, we can translate straightforwardly to event semantics.
1734000	1759000	And then tactic exponents of participants in events program along these lines, if it can be fully carried out with complete to generate the theory of generation of thought should add that the evolutionary origin of the most elementary concepts that have to serve as primitives is a complete
1759000	1764000	mystery, and will probably remain so.
1764000	1776000	There are no analogs in the animal world, no record of their development. Well, there are two logical possibilities for merge of X and Y.
1776000	1788000	The two are distinct, or one is part of the other. Technically, it's called a term of the other. The two options are called external and internal merge.
1788000	1806000	External merge yields combination, as in read books, internal merge yields displacement, as in which books did he read, where which books is understood to be the object of read.
1806000	1823000	The strong minimalist thesis should not permit an operation of deletion, which would allow far richer systems in externalization deletion does take place within narrow conditions.
1823000	1834000	But that does not apply to I language, which we may therefore assume has no deletion operations that has consequences.
1834000	1853000	Let's take again simple cases like which books did you read the I language representation is which books did you read which books, which is interpreted directly as for which books X, you read the books X.
1853000	1871000	The merge automatically yields the phenomenon of displacement with reconstruction. It's a topic that's been extensively studied. It falls out directly from the optimal system of generation.
1871000	1896000	This structure dependence does what reaches our mind in this case is which books, did you read which books, but which reaches the ear and reaches consciousness is which books did you read externalization removes all but one occurrence, which has to remain to indicate that the
1896000	1917000	operation took place. That's a general economic issue, radically reducing both mental computation and execution of articulatory emotions, actually the result of these simple operations to maximize computational
1917000	1942000	efficiency yield problems for perception and parsing, what are called filler gap problems. The parser finds a WH phrase, like which books, and it has to find a gap that fills it for interpretation, turns out to be quite complex, one of the major problems in parsing.
1942000	1964000	The problem would be radically reduced if the gap were filled, but Mother Nature didn't care about that when designing language. She insisted on finding the most elegant solution, even though it poses difficulties for language use quite serious ones.
1965000	1979000	A sentence has become more complex. This is one of many cases in which computational efficiency conflicts with communicative efficiency.
1979000	1993000	And in all cases, communicative efficiency is sacrificed. It's more evidence for the traditional conception of languages, fundamentally a system of thought.
1994000	2016000	All of this is consistent with how evolution proceeds quite generally. Schematically, we can distinguish three stages. First, some disruption takes place, maybe a mutation or drift or gene transfer, or
2016000	2043000	a bacterium accidentally swallowing another microorganism. That's the breakthrough that led to complex cells. That's why we're not all bacteria. The second stage is reconstruction. Nature reconstructs the new entity in the simplest way, observing the miracle creed, paying no attention to how the new entity might be used.
2043000	2065000	The third stage is winnowing the outcomes that reproduce more effectively prevail. That's natural selection. Well, that suggests a reasonable scenario for language evolution. First, some minor rewiring of the brain took place.
2066000	2083000	Yielded the new property of recursive enumeration. Next step is reconstruction. Nature devises the simplest, most elegant way to organize the new system. Strong minimalist thesis.
2084000	2101000	The semantic theory becomes available, possibly with more primitive origins. Computational procedures are given part of natural law. The winnowing stage is never reached, possibly because of lack of time.
2102000	2114000	Possibly because the optimal system is so delicately designed that it's either all or none. So we're approaching an interesting conclusion.
2115000	2134000	The internal language might be perfect on a common human possession. That's the strong minimalist thesis proposed 25 years ago, was not then regarded as realistic, rather as a long term goal that might guide research.
2134000	2154000	Recent work does suggest something more audacious. Thesis might indeed be true as evolutionary theory, leases to suspect, along with science generally, and as empirical inquiry increasingly suggests.
2154000	2165000	Well, there's a lot more to talk about. Many new, many other possibilities, but I don't think there's time to talk about it here.
2165000	2180000	The crucial point is that the internal language seems to keep to the strong minimalist thesis throughout, with no departure necessary, even for pretty complex cases.
2180000	2192000	Well, remains to show how far we can extend such reasoning. Needless to say, that's an extremely challenging task.
2192000	2208000	Nothing like it has ever risen in the study of language and thought. There are promising early steps far beyond what could have been imagined just a few years ago.
2209000	2226000	Final remark, strong minimalist thesis has several functions. One is a disciplinary function, sharply restricts the options for description, and thus deepens explanation.
2226000	2255000	It also has an enabling function. It provides options for what I language might be, for what kinds of subsystems might exist. An interesting question just coming into focus is to explore whether I languages make use of all the possibilities that are enabled by the strong minimalist thesis,
2255000	2276000	which may be more than just a guideline for inquiry, as assumed in the past, but may actually express fundamental truth about the nature of language and thought, the most distinctive possessions of this strange species of ours.
2276000	2286000	Thank you.
2286000	2292000	Thank you, Mr Chomsky. Amala, do we have any questions? Did you select some?
2292000	2310000	Yeah, I see this question. To what extent does the UG remain available to second language accusations? If you can see the chat, Mr Chomsky.
2310000	2332000	Okay, I see questions here. First one I see is, what's your take on views of data linguistics that focus on the data instead of UG and internalization, and also criticize the syntactic theory as well?
2332000	2344000	What's your take on Annie Chomsky in School of Thought? Well, I can't comment on all of them. There's plenty of criticism. You have to pick them up and look at them.
2344000	2363000	As far as data linguistics is concerned, it's fine. You can collect a lot of data and can look at it, can find surfed properties of it. It doesn't tell you very much, just as in any other field. You look at a lot of data, you don't find much.
2363000	2382000	If you want to study the laws of motion in physics, you don't collect data about leaves blowing in the wind. What you do is careful experimentation, including thought experiments, to focus on the crucial principles.
2382000	2410000	Now, right now, data linguistics is very popular. There are studies that you've seen many of them in the press, a lot of excitement, GPT-3 and others. They take astronomical amounts of data, maybe 50 terabytes of data, have thousands, maybe a trillion parameters,
2411000	2431000	supercomputers running on them. And with all of that data, they can find surfaced properties of the expressions in some vast amount of data. You string things together like this, it looks more or less like language.
2431000	2451000	It tells you absolutely nothing, zero. The proof of that is that the same systems work exactly as well for impossible languages. So for languages, say that violate structure dependence, which are impossible for humans, they work just fine.
2451000	2467000	It's very much as if I were to go to a physics conference and say, I have a terrific new theory. It accounts for all the particles that have been discovered, even the ones that are possible and haven't been discovered.
2467000	2486000	And it's so simple that I can express it in two words, anything goes, sorry, I don't get the Nobel Prize, because the same theory accounts for everything that's not a possible particle. So it tells you precisely nothing.
2487000	2508000	All of these things that are achieving vast excitement and the press basically do nothing. I mean, there are approaches based on the same techniques, deep learning, that do do something.
2509000	2527000	So for example, the Google translate is based on these techniques and it's useful. There's been some success in handling protein folding by these methods, but these data linguistics approaches are absolutely worthless.
2528000	2533000	They don't achieve anything useful. They don't.
2533000	2552000	And they tell you nothing about language by definition. So basically it's a way to use up a lot of the energy in California and to develop public relations for the Silicon Valley, but it's doing nothing else.
2553000	2561000	Well, the next to what extent does UG remain available to second language acquisition.
2561000	2577000	And secondly, is it true that movement from the specifier VP the specifier of TP is not motivated by the chest case checking property nominative case.
2577000	2584000	Well, first, to what extent does UG remain available to second language acquisition.
2584000	2592000	There is a good deal of research on that by people working on second language.
2592000	2600000	My own view is that decisive conclusions have not been reached.
2600000	2616000	There's, and it may actually vary among people remember there's a lot of individual variation and variation as to how the second languages are acquired, a second language that's acquired through immersion.
2616000	2629000	The best way if possible is going to be acquired very differently than one that's acquired by reading a grammar or going to a class.
2629000	2637000	And it's possible that UG functions in the first case, much more effectively than it does in the second.
2637000	2644000	These are basically open research questions, non trivial ones for teachers.
2644000	2653000	Is it true that movement from the specifier VP, the specifier TP is not motivated by the case checking principle.
2653000	2662000	Well, again, that's an internal technical question I my own view is basically that it's not.
2662000	2669000	There's no reason why the nominative case couldn't be assigned to the specifier of VP.
2669000	2691000	There are other reasons for this having to do with the, what's called EPP, the and the and ECP the empty category principle which are very, which are tied together and they're very their properties of certain languages, their
2691000	2703000	properties of languages that don't automatically delete the freely delete an empty subject. So Spanish and English are quite different this way.
2703000	2718000	Spanish, you don't have to pronounce the surface subject and spec TP in English you do English is one of a relatively small number of languages where you have to pronounce it.
2718000	2735000	Spanish is one of the much larger category of so called no subject languages in which you don't. So for Spanish, the movement is not obligatory. It's optional for other reasons for semantic reasons.
2736000	2749000	And I think when we look at all these things together they really have to do with what's called labeling theory. It's been discussed for the last 10 years or so I don't have time to go into the details.
2749000	2766000	Well, how does generative grammar differ from descriptive grammar depends what you mean by descriptive grammar. If you mean what was meant by it and structuralist linguistics.
2767000	2782000	Descriptive grammar. What I studied when I was a grad student under graduate 80 75 years ago was regarded as a taxonomic science. That's what it was called.
2782000	2798000	There are procedures of analysis which you use that find the units of a language and the way in which they are organized relative to one another. That was descriptive grammar.
2798000	2811000	If there's anything new it's just by what's called analogy. I don't think any of that can be sustained. A generative grammar does something quite different.
2811000	2827000	It tries to tell you what all the possible structures are for the entire language. It's quite different from a taxonomic grammar. Furthermore, the elements that enter into it can't be acquired by procedures.
2827000	2845000	That was shown years ago. Now, from another point of view, the generative grammar is a descriptive grammar, but a very different kind from the descriptive grammars of structural linguistics.
2845000	2863000	What do you see as the future of linguistics in the future six field in Pakistan? Well, controversial subject question, of course, my own feeling is pretty much what I tried to describe.
2863000	2884000	I think there's a future for linguistics as quite a new field, a field that for the first time is able to provide genuine explanations for the basic phenomenon of language, instead of describing them, which is hard enough.
2884000	2903000	There's a couple of examples. There are many more that can be carried through. It's a major breakthrough for the future. You can't predict the future of science, so we don't know. But that's my personal opinion.
2903000	2924000	We just see the future differently. What about the future in Pakistan? Well, simple answer to that depends on Pakistani linguists, other linguists who are interested in studying or do other native languages of Pakistan.
2924000	2939000	I don't know if you're interested, but for the future of the linguistic field as a general field, it'll depend on developments within Pakistan, in Pakistani universities and research centers.
2939000	2952000	Many things changed in the last 70 years. What new parameters must we take into consideration for effective language teaching?
2952000	2978000	A few years ago there were no parameters. The assumption in structural linguistics explicitly stated over and over was that any languages can vary virtually without limits and each individual language must have to be studied in its own terms
2978000	2994000	with no assumptions about other languages. That was in the mid-1950s the basic doctrine that was sometimes called the Boazian doctrine, rightly or wrongly.
2994000	3012000	Well, that's very far from true. I should say that something similar was believed in biology at about the same time. It was assumed that organisms vary virtually without limit.
3012000	3024000	Each one has to be studied on its own. In biology that's now known to be completely false. In fact, there are very narrow constraints on possible organisms.
3024000	3044000	So narrow that some have even speculated that there's a universal genome and the apparent variety of organisms is just superficial working out of some of the possibilities determined by the fixed form for organisms.
3044000	3071000	I think something along those lines has happened with regard to our concept knowledge of language. About 40 years ago there was an innovation in linguistic theory suggesting that the basic theory in our minds has fixed unchanging principles
3071000	3085000	like some of those they discussed and parametric variation, a set of parameters. So that would mean that language acquisition is kind of like a question answering game.
3085000	3105000	An infant asks for each parameter, is it set this way or that way? Is it set as an old subject language like Spanish or like a language that requires an explicit subject like English? Yes or no question can be answered in a very small amount of data.
3105000	3120000	Does the language have verb proceeding object like English and Spanish or does it have verb following object like Japanese and many others? Again, answer Belenna, small number of evidence.
3120000	3139000	We now have recent work of the kind I mentioned like Ian Roberts, which shows how the infant can work through the system of parameters very efficiently to fix on the exact language.
3139000	3163000	I want to look at what look like the plausible set of parameters. The best work I know is by Ian Roberts and by Giuseppe Lungabardi, teaches at York University in England, has done extensive work on the variety of possible parameters and what they tell us about the history of linguistics.
3163000	3181000	That's a new topic that he's innovated and it tells us quite a lot. You can get much deeper knowledge of the relationships among languages at a much deeper level if you look at shared borders than in the standard way.
3181000	3196000	So that's a source you can look in. How does UG theory play into surviving languages like Romanian, maintaining its Latin roots along with neighbouring Slavic languages?
3196000	3215000	You can say the same about English, about 60% of the vocabularies romance, though a lot of the grammar is Germanic. Say the same about French. French has a lot of Germanic properties, but it's a romance language.
3215000	3233000	So it has a critic movement like the romance languages, but it's like English and German in requiring an overt subject. Well, UG is exactly what studied by UG.
3233000	3250000	So how are the range of parameters determined for particular languages? They all seem to share the same principles at an underlying level. In fact, the same is true of languages.
3250000	3269000	Amazon or Papua and Guinea tribes that haven't had other contact for tens of thousands of years. When they're studied carefully, they seem to have the same underlying principles, different parametric choices.
3269000	3288000	There is a phenomenon of called Sprachwende languages commonly accept some features of neighbouring languages, even if they're related, not closely related, which is what happened with Romanian.
3288000	3304000	It picked up some of the properties of neighbouring Slavic languages in these geographic areas of which involve interaction among people. In the case of English it's pretty straightforward.
3304000	3326000	The Norman conquest in 1066 turned English into a mixture of romance and Germanic with a lot of romance vocabulary. In fact, the majority, but Germanic Germanical structure.
3327000	3342000	Given the natural, the recent advances in natural language processing and AI, what prospects do you see for SLA?
3342000	3358000	As I mentioned, the advances in natural language processing and AI, well, they may be useful for some purposes. Just tell us absolutely nothing about language.
3358000	3387000	If they happen to be useful for some purpose, say Google Translate, Life Translation, Transcription, SLA, that's fine. Use whatever is useful. But if you're interested in the nature of language, the nature of cognition, human cognitive processes, this work just tells you basically nothing for the reasons that I mentioned.
3389000	3406000	Does the human brain contain a limited set of constraints for organizing language? Undoubtedly it does. We don't know very much about it because we don't know very much about the human brain.
3406000	3432000	It's a very hard topic to study. The brain altogether is a hard topic to study, even for tiny organisms. So if you take an ant, which has a brain the size of a tiny, a minute brain, you need a microscope to see it.
3432000	3454000	We have no idea how it carries out highly complex computations that humans can't carry out so the desert ants in my backyard can navigate in a way that a human can't. They use computations that are inaccessible to us.
3454000	3472000	We have to duplicate it with complicated instruments. Even the ant brain is very hard to understand. Human brain is much harder because we cannot do experiments, the kind of experiments that immediately come to mind.
3473000	3490000	You can't do them for ethical reasons. So we happen to know a fair amount about the human visual system, but that's from experiments with some monkeys, which rightly or wrongly we've allowed ourselves to carry on.
3491000	3505000	And they have about the same visual system they do. But you can't do that for language because there's no other organism. No other organism has even the rudiments of human language. So there's nobody to study.
3505000	3523000	And you can't study the human brain for ethical reasons. So it's a very difficult topic. Nevertheless, there are some achievements. One of the most important ones, in fact, has to do with structure dependence, what I mentioned, the property I mentioned.
3524000	3544000	There is research created by Andrea Moro, fine linguist in Italy, Milan research group, which was able to show that here's the paradigm they used.
3545000	3563000	They took subjects, say, whose native language was German, and they gave them two kinds of invented languages. One invented language was based on an existing language that they didn't know, maybe Italian.
3563000	3580000	Another database was very simple language, which used principles that you don't have in language, like linear order. So a language in which negation is the third word of a sentence.
3580000	3599000	It's very simple to work out. Well, it turns out, when the subjects were given an inventive language based on an actual language, the norm, the language areas of the brain language, dedicated areas of the brain function normally.
3599000	3613000	When they were given an invented language that violated structure dependence, even with trivial algorithms, there was diffuse activity, the brain, the language areas were not activated.
3614000	3633000	Well, that tells you that the brain, it tells you something about what we expect to be true, that the brain is structured in such a way as to be available for language the way it is.
3633000	3651000	It sets conditions on what language must be. One of them are the conditions that conform to the fundamental principle of structure dependence. There are a few other things like this, which are quite interesting, but it's a hard topic.
3651000	3659000	What are my thoughts on systematic functional grammar?
3659000	3673000	I think it tells us much about the questions that I've been discussing here. It may be useful as indicated in the question by studying the wider context in which language is used.
3673000	3686000	So there is a broad context in which language is used, which is not studied by the generative grammar which investigates sentence grammar.
3686000	3696000	It's a perfectly sensible topic and maybe functional grammar can provide some help with that. It does all to the good.
3696000	3718000	So if I say something like, John went to the library, he bought a book, John went to the bookstore, he bought a book.
3718000	3736000	If you think about what the language tells you, doesn't tell you what the word he refers to. That discourse is perfectly possible if John went to the store and Bill bought a book. Doesn't tell you that the book was bought at the store.
3737000	3751000	It's perfectly the sentence that are perfectly possible if John went to the bookstore, Bill bought a book somewhere else. That's perfectly possible. Language doesn't tell you anything about that.
3751000	3768000	There are conditions of normal discourse that make it likely that in John went to the store, he bought a book, makes it likely that he is John and that he got the book in the store.
3768000	3780000	That's plausible because of the nature of human functioning systems and maybe functional grammar can tell you something about such things.
3780000	3787000	I frankly think there's not going to be a lot to say about it. These are quite complex and diverse.
3787000	3794000	Well, that's the end of the questions that I see here.
3794000	3799000	Oh, I see a couple of others.
3799000	3808000	Let me say Chomsky, if you have the time to answer them, that's okay. Or if you want to stop right now, it's up to you.
3808000	3814000	Sorry, I couldn't hear that.
3814000	3828000	I'm asking you about the questions. If you want to go ahead or you want to stop here, we know you have some other things to do and we had only one hour for this webinar.
3828000	3833000	Should I go on with some further questions?
3833000	3834000	If you want to.
3834000	3837000	Is that what you're suggesting? Yeah, okay.
3838000	3844000	How may we better connect UG with contemporary teaching?
3844000	3850000	It's kind of like asking if you're, suppose you're a swimming coach.
3850000	3862000	It's a good idea to understand something about physiology and use your knowledge of physiology and improving your teaching of swimming.
3862000	3869000	If you're teaching language, it's useful to know something about language. That's UG.
3869000	3875000	A skilled teacher will figure out how to use their knowledge of language.
3875000	3885000	UG in teaching just as a good swimming coach will use their knowledge of physiology and teaching swimming.
3885000	3891000	There's no formula for this. That's what good teaching is about.
3891000	3902000	As a generative grammar is concerned, you have this claim that teaching grammar should be excluded in classroom construction.
3902000	3912000	It's been criticized by some linguists long said that teaching should not be excluded, but that of communication should be foregrounded.
3912000	3921000	Do you think this claim of excluding teaching grammar and classroom instruction is still valid, especially in today's time?
3921000	3928000	It depends what your goals are.
3928000	3937000	If you want the student to understand the language that they're acquiring, it's perfectly useful.
3937000	3942000	It's very useful to teach something about the nature of the language.
3942000	3955000	If you're teaching just by immersion the best way, so you send somebody to Italy to study to learn Italian, they'll just pick it up by listening to it.
3955000	3962000	That's not teaching. That's immersion.
3962000	3967000	You try to make it as much like a child as you can, but there's no...
3967000	3972000	There can't be an answer to this. It depends what you're trying to achieve.
3972000	3981000	If you're trying to achieve communication skills, but you don't care whether the person understands the language, you can foreground communication.
3981000	3986000	If you care about whether the person understands the language, you'll teach grammar.
3986000	3990000	That's just the nature of the language.
3990000	3994000	Why did I choose grammar?
3994000	3997000	Grammar is a funny word.
3997000	4004000	Grammar, in the technical sense, grammar just means the nature of language.
4004000	4008000	What I've been talking about is grammar.
4008000	4013000	What's the nature of our faculty of language and thought?
4013000	4016000	Because we're intimately connected.
4016000	4021000	So why did I choose to study language and thought? Good reason, I think.
4021000	4029000	These are the fundamental properties that distinguish humans from the rest of the organic world.
4029000	4034000	So if we want to understand what kind of creatures we are,
4034000	4040000	if we want to know thyself as the Delphic Oracle advised us,
4040000	4044000	the obvious thing to look at is language and thought.
4044000	4050000	It's been assumed for several millennia. I think it's a wise choice.
4050000	4056000	I chose it for the same reason.
4056000	4066000	Well, the others that I see here have to do with
4066000	4070000	finding
4070000	4077000	those exposing learners to the cell environment for more than three years,
4077000	4081000	make them acquire, develop a native like language.
4081000	4088000	A child, yes, a child will pick up a second language in almost no time.
4088000	4093000	Just to give you an example from personal experience.
4093000	4100000	My family went to, I was teaching in Italy about 40 years ago.
4100000	4103000	So my whole family came along.
4103000	4110000	My older kids were studying, 20, 25, were studying Italian.
4110000	4112000	They really wanted to learn it.
4112000	4115000	We had a 10-year-old who didn't want to learn it.
4115000	4120000	He didn't want to come with us. He said he was not refused to learn Italian.
4120000	4127000	Well, after a month, the 10-year-old, if the phone rang, the 10-year-old had to answer it.
4127000	4135000	Despite himself, he just acquired Italian by being in school where everyone was talking Italian.
4135000	4138000	Children just absorb it like a sponge.
4138000	4145000	The older kids were working on it, just my wife and I were going to make it harder for adults.
4145000	4154000	So the answer is depends on age, depends on motivation, depends on all kinds of things.
4154000	4161000	But you can live in a foreign culture for all your life and not know the language.
4161000	4163000	I know people like that.
4163000	4169000	Do you find the need for an eclectic approach to communicative competence?
4169000	4174000	Do we need to apply all kinds of competence time to test the speech?
4174000	4179000	Currently, researchers use only four or five or single competence.
4179000	4189000	Well, I really don't know. It seems to me, if you want to broaden the approach to communicative competence, whatever that is,
4189000	4194000	use whatever you find valuable to increase it.
4194000	4197000	I don't think there are any formulas.
4197000	4205000	Why do two children of same parents start speaking languages at different ages?
4205000	4212000	Well, there's slight individual variation, but not very much.
4212000	4225000	Unless there's some very unusual circumstances, two children in the same family will start speaking at about the same age, maybe a couple of months different.
4225000	4230000	UG has nothing to say about this. It's a matter of maturation.
4230000	4238000	The maturation of innate competence, it's like acquiring the ability to walk.
4238000	4244000	You find children are slightly different. One child may be walking at 12 months.
4244000	4253000	Another might start walking at 14 months, but it's just a matter of how the organism matures.
4253000	4258000	Maybe the main core of UG in just three words.
4258000	4266000	I don't know if I can do it in three words, but it's the theory of the nature of language.
4266000	4277000	We talked about explanation and description. What about the metacognitive aspect of learning?
4277000	4283000	I don't know what can be said about that, not familiar with it.
4283000	4295000	I think I'll probably have to stop here. I don't see any simple questions.
4296000	4304000	Yes, Mr Chomsky. Thank you very much. We really appreciate you being here with us.
4304000	4310000	Thank you very much on behalf of T-Soul Tampico Talks and Teachers Development Webinars.
4310000	4312000	Thank you.
4312000	4315000	You want to say something before Mr Chomsky leaves?
4315000	4322000	Yes, Professor Chomsky, it has been a really fulfilling experience having you at Teacher Development Webinars.
4322000	4326000	Thanks to T-Soul Tampico Talks for organizing this wonderful talk.
4326000	4337000	As a student of linguists and now I am a scholar, I have been reading your work and seeing you as a father figure.
4337000	4340000	Having you is like a dream come true.
4340000	4346000	I really can't express my happiness and humbleness.
4346000	4353000	I much appreciate your time and experience in sharing all this.
4353000	4359000	You celebrated your birthday a few days ago.
4359000	4366000	Happy belated birthday to you again. Long live.
4367000	4369000	Thank you, Amnala.
4369000	4375000	Thank you, everyone. We hope to see you again in our next events, our next webinars.
4375000	4383000	Yes, I would like to also like to acknowledge Master English Training for sponsoring a Zoom account.
4383000	4389000	The other ones, the supporters have come to us in time of need.
4389000	4398000	Thanks to Master English Training and Fatima, who deals with all these things.
4398000	4404000	Thanks very much for your time and support and appreciation for Teacher Development Webinars.
4404000	4410000	Thank you to T-Soul Tampico Talks.
4410000	4415000	Thank you, Amnala. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Mr Chomsky. Bye-bye. See you next time.
4419000	4422000	Thank you, Amnala.
