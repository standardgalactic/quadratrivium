00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's face it, social media is making us depressed, it's funny that the very networks

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,480
which were designed to bring people together are in reality drifting people apart.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,400
And although we're surrounded by thousands of online friends, in reality we're feeling

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,160
more lonelier than ever before.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,600
And in case you're wondering how to fix things, first and foremost, get out of your houses,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,640
get off your phones, get away from your computers and come to the houses of Allah.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,960
Not only would this be extremely rewarding for your spirituality, it is extremely beneficial

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
for your social and mental well-being.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,400
And if praying side by side, shoulder to shoulder wasn't enough, we need to give salam to those

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,240
beside us, those we know or those we don't.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,760
And after you've done that, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he would always

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
emphasize the importance of visiting one another.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,360
The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he tells us of an amazing instance where a man

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,160
went out to visit his friend for the sake of Allah.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,960
He is stopped by an angel.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,640
The angel says to the man, where are you going?

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,440
He says, I'm going to visit my brother such and such.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,560
The angel says to him, do you have any favors, anything you want off the brother, which is

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,200
like us today, the only time we go visit someone or call someone is when we need something.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,560
He says, no, I just love him for the sake of Allah.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,840
I'm visiting him because I love him for the sake of Allah.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,960
The angel says, then no, that I'm a messenger to inform you that Allah loves you just as

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,440
you love your brother.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,200
Subhan Allah, Allah loves you.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,920
Just because you're visiting your mate, just because you're visiting your brother, this

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,960
is our religion, a religion with all solutions to whatever social problems you throw at it.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
May Allah alleviate the feelings of loneliness and social exclusion from amongst our youth,

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,080
from amongst our elderly, and may Allah bring peace to society.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,360
Assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
