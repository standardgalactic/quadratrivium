0	5600	Let's face it, social media is making us depressed, it's funny that the very networks
5600	11480	which were designed to bring people together are in reality drifting people apart.
11480	16400	And although we're surrounded by thousands of online friends, in reality we're feeling
16400	19160	more lonelier than ever before.
19160	24600	And in case you're wondering how to fix things, first and foremost, get out of your houses,
24600	29640	get off your phones, get away from your computers and come to the houses of Allah.
29640	34960	Not only would this be extremely rewarding for your spirituality, it is extremely beneficial
34960	37960	for your social and mental well-being.
37960	43400	And if praying side by side, shoulder to shoulder wasn't enough, we need to give salam to those
43400	47240	beside us, those we know or those we don't.
47240	51760	And after you've done that, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he would always
51760	54800	emphasize the importance of visiting one another.
54800	59360	The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he tells us of an amazing instance where a man
59360	63160	went out to visit his friend for the sake of Allah.
63160	64960	He is stopped by an angel.
64960	67640	The angel says to the man, where are you going?
67640	70440	He says, I'm going to visit my brother such and such.
70440	75560	The angel says to him, do you have any favors, anything you want off the brother, which is
75560	80200	like us today, the only time we go visit someone or call someone is when we need something.
80200	83560	He says, no, I just love him for the sake of Allah.
83560	86840	I'm visiting him because I love him for the sake of Allah.
86840	91960	The angel says, then no, that I'm a messenger to inform you that Allah loves you just as
91960	93440	you love your brother.
93440	96200	Subhan Allah, Allah loves you.
96200	99920	Just because you're visiting your mate, just because you're visiting your brother, this
99920	104960	is our religion, a religion with all solutions to whatever social problems you throw at it.
104960	109920	May Allah alleviate the feelings of loneliness and social exclusion from amongst our youth,
109960	113080	from amongst our elderly, and may Allah bring peace to society.
113080	115360	Assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
