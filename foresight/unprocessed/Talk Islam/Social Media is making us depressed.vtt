Let's face it, social media is making us depressed, it's funny that the very networks

00:05.600 --> 00:11.480
which were designed to bring people together are in reality drifting people apart.

00:11.480 --> 00:16.400
And although we're surrounded by thousands of online friends, in reality we're feeling

00:16.400 --> 00:19.160
more lonelier than ever before.

00:19.160 --> 00:24.600
And in case you're wondering how to fix things, first and foremost, get out of your houses,

00:24.600 --> 00:29.640
get off your phones, get away from your computers and come to the houses of Allah.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.960
Not only would this be extremely rewarding for your spirituality, it is extremely beneficial

00:34.960 --> 00:37.960
for your social and mental well-being.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.400
And if praying side by side, shoulder to shoulder wasn't enough, we need to give salam to those

00:43.400 --> 00:47.240
beside us, those we know or those we don't.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.760
And after you've done that, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he would always

00:51.760 --> 00:54.800
emphasize the importance of visiting one another.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.360
The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam, he tells us of an amazing instance where a man

00:59.360 --> 01:03.160
went out to visit his friend for the sake of Allah.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.960
He is stopped by an angel.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.640
The angel says to the man, where are you going?

01:07.640 --> 01:10.440
He says, I'm going to visit my brother such and such.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.560
The angel says to him, do you have any favors, anything you want off the brother, which is

01:15.560 --> 01:20.200
like us today, the only time we go visit someone or call someone is when we need something.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.560
He says, no, I just love him for the sake of Allah.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.840
I'm visiting him because I love him for the sake of Allah.

01:26.840 --> 01:31.960
The angel says, then no, that I'm a messenger to inform you that Allah loves you just as

01:31.960 --> 01:33.440
you love your brother.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.200
Subhan Allah, Allah loves you.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.920
Just because you're visiting your mate, just because you're visiting your brother, this

01:39.920 --> 01:44.960
is our religion, a religion with all solutions to whatever social problems you throw at it.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.920
May Allah alleviate the feelings of loneliness and social exclusion from amongst our youth,

01:49.960 --> 01:53.080
from amongst our elderly, and may Allah bring peace to society.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
Assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
