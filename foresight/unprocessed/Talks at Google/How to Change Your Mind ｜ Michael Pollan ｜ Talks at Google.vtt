WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Thank you, David. Thanks very much. Can everybody hear me in the back? So I get to talk about

00:16.440 --> 00:22.440
my trips, but you don't. It doesn't seem fair. So I'm going to just talk for about 10 minutes

00:22.440 --> 00:25.540
and just tell you a little bit about what this book's about, and then I'd love to take

00:25.540 --> 00:32.940
your questions and let your interests dictate the path that we take this afternoon. First,

00:32.940 --> 00:39.100
thanks. Thank you very much for coming. This book is a real departure for me. Those of

00:39.100 --> 00:42.460
you who know me as someone who writes about food might think it's a little weird that

00:42.460 --> 00:48.140
I'm turning to psychedelics. But in my head, there is some continuity as well as change.

00:48.140 --> 00:54.180
And the continuity is that I see my writing about food as part of a larger interest in

00:54.180 --> 01:00.460
writing about nature. And the way we eat affects nature dramatically, more than anything

01:00.460 --> 01:06.580
else we do, actually, in terms of changing the landscape of the planet and the atmosphere.

01:06.580 --> 01:11.820
It's your most powerful engagement with the natural world. And I've always been interested

01:11.820 --> 01:18.500
in that engagement. And we use nature and plants, especially for many things. Food is

01:18.500 --> 01:26.020
an obvious one. Beauty is another. But something we almost all use plants for that I've always

01:26.020 --> 01:32.700
been kind of curious about is to change consciousness. Most of us today probably use the plant to

01:32.700 --> 01:38.700
change the contents of your mind, or at least the feeling tone in your mind, you know, whether

01:38.700 --> 01:44.420
it was coffee or tea or a cigarette or cannabis or whatever it is. I mean, this is something

01:44.420 --> 01:50.340
we do in every culture on earth, does it? With the one exception that proves the rule,

01:50.340 --> 01:54.540
the Inuit do not have any plant drugs. But it's only because not even grow where they

01:54.540 --> 02:01.420
live. As soon as they go somewhere else, they get with the program. So it's been a longstanding

02:01.420 --> 02:06.460
interest. And to me, it's all part of that story about this fascinating engagement we

02:06.460 --> 02:12.740
have with other species that defines us and reveals a lot about us. So I've, and I wrote

02:12.740 --> 02:18.420
a little bit about cannabis and botany of desire. And I wrote a long piece about growing

02:18.420 --> 02:24.060
opium in my garden back in the 90s. And I've written about medical marijuana. So I had

02:24.060 --> 02:30.460
this interest. And then along comes this new research, which I began reading about. In

02:30.460 --> 02:40.060
2010, I read about a really interesting odd study where researchers at NYU and Johns Hopkins

02:40.060 --> 02:44.380
were giving psilocybin, this is the ingredient in magic mushrooms, they were synthesizing

02:44.380 --> 02:50.500
it, to people who had cancer diagnoses, people very sick, many of them terminal, in the hopes

02:50.500 --> 02:56.420
that they would have what they call the mystical experience, a powerful spiritual experience

02:56.420 --> 03:01.100
that would change their attitude toward their death and help them essentially to die with

03:01.100 --> 03:08.020
more peace. These were all patients who were struggling with depression, anxiety and fear,

03:08.060 --> 03:13.420
profound fear. And the stories, so I started writing about that because it seemed like

03:13.420 --> 03:18.380
the last thing I would want to do is trip when I was facing a terminal diagnosis to

03:18.380 --> 03:26.540
lose control like that. And you would presumably have a very dark experience. So I started

03:26.540 --> 03:32.020
interviewing these people for a piece I did in the New Yorker in 2015. And just to give

03:32.020 --> 03:36.460
you one example to give you the flavor of it, I remember talking to this woman, she

03:36.500 --> 03:42.900
was a figure skating instructor in New York, in Manhattan, she was about 60. She was not

03:42.900 --> 03:49.060
a psychonaut, she'd never used psychedelics before. And she had ovarian cancer. And her

03:49.060 --> 03:54.220
cancer had been treated successfully, but she was paralyzed by the fear of recurrence.

03:54.220 --> 03:59.380
She just couldn't function because she thought any day now this could be back. So she entered

03:59.420 --> 04:07.900
into this trial at NYU and had a high dose psilocybin experience. And I should explain how

04:07.900 --> 04:12.300
this is done because the image you may have in your head of taking psychedelics, you know,

04:12.300 --> 04:16.180
taking a handful of mushrooms and going to a concert or something, this is not how it is

04:16.180 --> 04:23.420
used in a clinical setting. It's a very controlled experience, it's guided. So you work with two

04:23.420 --> 04:29.180
guides, a man and a woman, they prepare you over a course of several sessions as to what

04:29.220 --> 04:35.580
to expect. So they'll talk to you what to do if the experience becomes frightening, which it

04:35.580 --> 04:40.540
often does, and how to navigate that. They call it the flight instructions. And their main

04:40.540 --> 04:46.500
advice is, you know, if you see a staircase, go up it. If you see a door, open it. If you see a

04:46.500 --> 04:51.460
monster, don't run away. Just step right up to it and say, what are you doing in my head? What

04:51.460 --> 04:58.620
do you have to teach me? In other words, surrender to the experience. Trust, relax. You

04:58.620 --> 05:05.060
know, they quote John Lennon, relax the mind and float downstream. And that's very important

05:05.060 --> 05:09.300
advice. And it's often the difference between a good trip and a bad trip. A bad trip is

05:09.300 --> 05:13.420
essentially a panic reaction against what's happening in your head, which is very heavy.

05:13.420 --> 05:21.020
I mean, you're experiencing your ego dissolving, in fact, in front of you. And then they sit with

05:21.020 --> 05:25.940
you for the whole experience, and they give you a helping hand if you're getting upset or

05:25.980 --> 05:30.380
struggling, and they take you to the bathroom and give you a glass of water. And then afterwards

05:30.380 --> 05:36.500
is a really key moment called the integration session, where they sit with you, you tell the

05:36.500 --> 05:40.820
story of your trip. And it usually is this narrative. It's almost like this intracyclic

05:40.820 --> 05:46.020
movie where you go different places, and you try to make sense of it and apply the lessons to

05:46.020 --> 05:54.580
your life. So in the case of this woman, her name is Dina Bezer. She had this trip, and there were

05:54.580 --> 06:01.260
many elements I won't go into. It was like six hours. And she went into her body, imaginatively,

06:01.260 --> 06:07.420
and she saw this black mass under her ribcage. And that was her fear. It wasn't her cancer,

06:07.420 --> 06:13.020
because that wasn't in the right place. But she saw what she realized was her fear. And she screamed

06:13.020 --> 06:17.060
at her fear. And you have to see this woman. She's a very timid, small woman. And she said,

06:17.300 --> 06:26.420
get the fuck out of my body. And it did. It disappeared. The black mask was gone. And afterwards,

06:26.420 --> 06:33.140
she said, I realized during that experience that I can't control my cancer, but I can control my

06:33.140 --> 06:38.820
fear. And that distinction meant everything to her. And one of the hallmarks of the psychedelic

06:38.820 --> 06:45.460
experience is that whatever insights you have during it have a force, the likes of which you've

06:45.460 --> 06:50.580
never experienced. These are not just opinions or insights that reveal truths. This is something

06:50.580 --> 06:55.940
William James a long time ago writing about the mystical experience called the noetic sense.

06:55.940 --> 07:03.380
It's a very uncanny thing. And it's what allows people to change that if they think, say they're

07:03.380 --> 07:08.580
trying to quit smoking, and they have some epiphany that, gee, my breath is really precious,

07:08.580 --> 07:13.860
I should not ruin it by smoking, suddenly that'll be so strongly held as a belief that they can

07:13.860 --> 07:19.140
actually stop smoking. So anyway, so that's the kind of experience that I was learning about.

07:19.140 --> 07:23.540
And I became fascinated to understand the neuroscience behind it, what's going on in the

07:23.540 --> 07:28.820
brain when people are taking one of these trips. And we now know some interesting things about

07:28.820 --> 07:33.780
that. If you're interested, I can talk about that. And also the history of it, like, what happened to

07:33.780 --> 07:41.860
psychedelics in the 60s that they became so stigmatized that research stopped. There had been a

07:41.860 --> 07:48.260
very productive period of research all through the 50s that was yielding really promising results

07:48.260 --> 07:54.820
in the treatment of alcoholism, in dealing with people who were dying, depression, anxiety, obsession.

07:54.820 --> 08:03.220
And then after this moral panic that hits the culture around 1965, nobody studies it anymore.

08:03.220 --> 08:09.380
The funding dries up, scientists are a little embarrassed by it. And we had an unprecedented

08:09.380 --> 08:16.740
situation where a promising line of scientific investigation was stopped. That never happens.

08:16.740 --> 08:22.740
And we lost 30, 35 years of research into psychedelics. Thankfully, it's resuming.

08:22.740 --> 08:27.220
And my book is very much about the Renaissance, even though I go back and look at the history and

08:27.220 --> 08:32.820
figure out why we had this panic reaction about them. And try to look at them in a very matter

08:32.820 --> 08:38.260
of fact way as interesting tools, interesting tools for understanding the mind and for healing

08:38.260 --> 08:42.660
the mind. Now, we haven't proven all this. There's still more research to be done.

08:43.620 --> 08:49.700
We're kind of in phase two, and there's three phases to FDA drug approval. But so far the

08:49.700 --> 08:56.180
results have been remarkably encouraging. It is one of the most powerful psychiatric interventions

08:56.180 --> 09:02.740
that the researchers have ever seen. And we're in a situation where mental health care is so

09:02.740 --> 09:09.140
broken in this country. It's failing to reach half the people who need it. The last major

09:09.140 --> 09:14.980
innovation were the SSRI antidepressants in the late 80s. There really hasn't been anything since

09:14.980 --> 09:23.540
that. And so we need some new ways of thinking. And along comes this powerful old but new innovation.

09:23.540 --> 09:30.180
And the research is, you know, it's being privately funded for the most part. Big

09:30.180 --> 09:33.780
pharma is not interested in this. There's no intellectual property that you can control.

09:35.540 --> 09:41.860
But a lot of donors, many in the tech community actually have stepped up and are funding this

09:41.860 --> 09:47.780
research. And I was just at a fundraiser where, you know, the last seven million dollars was raised.

09:47.780 --> 09:54.020
And so we will find out. We'll get the real test, the scientific test of what are these drugs good

09:54.020 --> 09:58.500
for. And then there's the question of what are they, what value might they have for the rest of

09:58.500 --> 10:05.140
us? Because they help people who have serious problems. But as one researcher put it to me,

10:05.140 --> 10:10.740
they're very important for the betterment of well people. And I can talk a little bit about

10:10.740 --> 10:15.940
that too. So as part of this, because it's sort of my brand to do immersion journalism, you know,

10:15.940 --> 10:23.060
when I wrote about the cattle industry, I bought a steer. When I wanted to learn about architecture,

10:23.060 --> 10:31.540
I built a house. So of course I had to experiment. And I found some guides underground. And there

10:31.540 --> 10:36.740
is a thriving community of underground guides in America who could give me an experience very much

10:36.740 --> 10:43.860
like the ones at NYU and Hopkins. And they were, you know, transformative experiences, some of them.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.300
Some of the most meaningful experiences of my life. And the idea that a molecule could occasion

10:49.380 --> 10:55.300
that is to me still kind of mind blowing. So I'm going to, though, I've given you lots of leads

10:55.300 --> 11:00.980
and things you might want to follow up on. And I'm happy to talk about anything. I advise you

11:00.980 --> 11:07.380
not to talk about your own experiences. I want to welcome the Google Microdosing Club to today's event.

11:07.380 --> 11:21.300
Anyway, so yeah, question. Alright, so I don't want to be the devil's advocate here.

11:21.300 --> 11:26.420
Please do. This idea that we're going to, we're going to give somebody this drug,

11:26.420 --> 11:29.300
they're going to have this transformative experience, and then it's going to change them.

11:30.420 --> 11:35.140
I understand how that makes sense to me. But the idea that that change would necessarily be

11:35.700 --> 11:41.140
for the better, that person comes back from a trip and decides they're going to quit smoking,

11:41.140 --> 11:45.700
that's great. But why doesn't a person come back from a trip and decide they need to kill their

11:45.700 --> 11:55.060
neighbor? Right. How do we break the symmetry there? Set and setting. So one of the important

11:55.060 --> 12:01.140
features of psychedelics is how little the experience is foreordained or dictated by

12:01.140 --> 12:07.780
the drug itself. The drug is like an unspecific mental amplifier. And so your expectation and

12:07.780 --> 12:12.580
intention is very important to what happens. And one of the things that happens in the preparation

12:12.580 --> 12:17.860
is that the guide is helping you set an intention. Like I want to quit smoking. I want to confront my

12:17.860 --> 12:26.180
mortality. And you will usually have an experience in that realm because that's what you've been

12:26.260 --> 12:35.380
primed to have. Could the drugs be used for evil? Well, we have the case of Charles Manson. Manson

12:35.940 --> 12:42.820
apparently, we don't know that all the details, but used LSD on his little posse of what would

12:42.820 --> 12:50.500
become murderers. And the drugs are incredibly suggestible and that you could imagine a charismatic

12:50.500 --> 12:55.620
figure using them that way. Now, the CIA sought to use them that way too. The CIA had a very active

12:55.620 --> 13:00.260
research program in the 50s. The same time all this university work was going on in the 50s to

13:00.260 --> 13:07.460
help people, the CIA was trying to weaponize LSD and psilocybin. And they thought they went through

13:07.460 --> 13:14.660
a series of different paradigms. One was you would use it as a truth serum. People could tell you

13:14.660 --> 13:21.940
the truth if you gave it to them in interrogation. People said crazy shit. It didn't work. There

13:21.940 --> 13:29.860
was no truth in that. And then they thought, well, we could use it to have foreign leaders. We could

13:29.860 --> 13:34.260
dose them and they would do embarrassing things. That might work. I don't know. And we don't know

13:34.260 --> 13:38.660
how far they got with it. And then the other one was his mind control, right? That you could use

13:38.660 --> 13:44.100
this drug to control people's minds. As far as we know, that didn't work either, but we don't know

13:44.100 --> 13:52.500
for sure. And we shouldn't put too much by them. So I think it all depends on your therapist and

13:52.500 --> 14:01.540
how the situation is. People don't generally have violent episodes after psychedelics. In general,

14:01.540 --> 14:07.140
the experience tends to be one where you discover that love is the most important thing in the

14:07.140 --> 14:14.980
universe. And this hallmark card platitudes suddenly becomes this profundity. And it is a

14:14.980 --> 14:19.620
profundity, but we've heard it so many times that it's banal. There's an interesting line between

14:19.620 --> 14:27.060
the banal and the profound. And psychedelics definitely worked on that line. So I think

14:27.060 --> 14:31.940
we should be mindful of that possibility, but I don't think we certainly haven't seen anything

14:31.940 --> 14:37.300
like that. There have been a thousand dosings of volunteers since this next, this new wave of

14:37.300 --> 14:43.380
research. And there has not been a single adverse event. No psychotic breaks, no jumping out of

14:43.380 --> 14:49.220
windows. But there's no question that people can do stupid things on psychedelics as they can on

14:49.220 --> 14:58.420
alcohol and any number of other drugs. So thanks for your question. Do you have any theories of why

14:58.420 --> 15:04.900
our brains are wired to react to things from plants and fungi? And are there any things from the

15:04.900 --> 15:12.820
animal kingdom that do the same thing? Well, animals do like plant drugs also. We have many cases of,

15:12.820 --> 15:18.500
I mean, if you've had a cat, never given them catnip. No, I meant like any venoms that... Oh,

15:18.500 --> 15:25.140
yeah. Well, one of the psychedelics I experimented with is something called Five-Meo-DMT. This is

15:25.140 --> 15:31.860
a pretty obscure psychedelic. I see a couple of nods in the crowd that... Actually, only one.

15:34.180 --> 15:40.820
That is the smoked venom of the Sonoran Desert Toad. Somebody figured that out, right? I mean,

15:41.940 --> 15:51.860
what a species, huh? But why are we wired for this is a really interesting question. So the way the

15:51.860 --> 16:00.180
drugs appear to work in the mind is that they bind to your serotonin, one particular serotonin

16:00.180 --> 16:05.300
receptor that's very common in the cortex. And they start a cascade of effects. That's what

16:05.300 --> 16:11.460
neuroscientists say when they really don't know what's happening for a while. But that that in

16:11.460 --> 16:18.180
turn eventually down-regulates something called the default mode network. I'll tell you what that

16:18.180 --> 16:23.620
is because it's very important, actually, and it explains a lot. So when they first started doing

16:23.620 --> 16:29.140
fMRI imaging of people's brains on psychedelics, they would basically inject you with psilocybin

16:29.140 --> 16:33.700
and slide you into the MRI machine, and you'd have what could be a very scary experience.

16:35.780 --> 16:39.860
And then they took these pictures, and they expected to see lots of extra activity because

16:39.860 --> 16:45.300
there's such fireworks in the experience. But they were very surprised to find that, in fact,

16:45.300 --> 16:52.180
this particular network went quiet. And this is a network that's very active when you're not on task,

16:52.180 --> 16:56.740
okay? It's in a seesaw relationship with the attentional networks when you're like working or

16:56.740 --> 17:01.380
something like that. But when you're asked to just lie back in an MRI machine and they're trying to

17:01.380 --> 17:07.140
get a baseline, this lights up. And they were like, why is that? What is it doing? Well, this appears

17:07.140 --> 17:13.700
to be the part of your brain that is active when you're mind wandering, when you're ruminating or

17:13.700 --> 17:19.700
worrying or reflecting on yourself. It's a center of self-reflection. It's also involved in time

17:19.700 --> 17:25.780
travel, the ability to think about the future or the past. And it's involved in theory of mind.

17:25.780 --> 17:31.860
This is the term for the ability to think about the mental states of other people,

17:31.860 --> 17:36.420
central to compassion and imagination, things like that. And lastly, it's involved in something

17:36.420 --> 17:43.620
called the narrative self or experiential self. And this is kind of where you knit together what

17:43.620 --> 17:51.460
happens to you at any given moment with the story of who you are, based on who you've been and who

17:51.460 --> 17:58.500
you want to be. And it's kind of where we sustain that story that our sense of self depends on.

17:59.220 --> 18:06.260
And so this network, so if the ego has an address, it's in the default mode network.

18:06.820 --> 18:13.300
This is what the research shows. It's really interesting that this is what gets down-regulated

18:13.300 --> 18:18.900
during the experience. And it chimes with the experience of ego dissolution people report

18:18.900 --> 18:24.980
on a high-dose experience. I had an experience on a guided psilocybin trip where I felt my

18:24.980 --> 18:30.660
sense of self scattered to the wind like a blizzard of post-its. And then I looked out,

18:30.660 --> 18:34.980
and I don't know, who's the eye who's looking out at this? I mean, there was a split in consciousness

18:34.980 --> 18:42.260
where I could watch myself then get spread over the landscape like a coat of paint out there.

18:42.260 --> 18:46.500
And I was fine with it. This other self was fine with it. And it was this kind of very

18:47.300 --> 18:53.700
unperturbable consciousness that could behold this thing. And I realized I'm not identical to my ego.

18:54.420 --> 19:01.060
And that's a very important insight to acquire, I think, and very useful. But what was going on

19:01.620 --> 19:05.540
in my brain was the default mode network was going offline for a period of time.

19:06.100 --> 19:11.620
The sense of self dissolves. And then something else happens, which is other networks in the brain,

19:11.620 --> 19:16.660
which normally would only communicate through this hub, start talking directly to each other.

19:16.660 --> 19:21.540
And there's a map in the book of the brain on a placebo and the brain on psilocybin.

19:21.540 --> 19:25.860
And one looks like the root map of American Airlines. And the other looks like the root map

19:25.860 --> 19:33.300
of some little commuter line that only goes to 10 places. So new connections form. And what are

19:33.300 --> 19:39.940
those new connections? I mean, that's the interesting question. Is that your, say, your hippocampus

19:39.940 --> 19:46.180
talking to your visual cortex? And so you start having images of things that you fear or desire?

19:46.820 --> 19:52.500
Is it the basis of hallucination? Or is it perhaps the basis of a new metaphor or new insight

19:52.500 --> 19:58.340
or new meme? We don't know yet. That's the next step is to really understand that. So these are

19:58.340 --> 20:05.300
temporary changes in the brain. Eventually your ego kind of reconsolidates. But having had a glimpse

20:05.300 --> 20:12.340
of that other way to behold experience is very powerful. And in my integration session, I said

20:12.420 --> 20:18.020
to Mary, who was my guide, I said, well, okay, I've had this amazing experience of ego dissolution.

20:18.020 --> 20:22.020
And I realized I'm not identical to my ego. I can have a little distance on it.

20:23.060 --> 20:28.100
But I said, my ego is back in uniform and on patrol. So what good is that? And she said,

20:28.100 --> 20:33.860
well, basically, you've had a taste of another way to react to life, a little less defensive,

20:33.860 --> 20:38.020
a little less trigger happy, and you can cultivate that. And I said, how? And she said, through

20:38.020 --> 20:43.140
meditation. And meditation is kind of how you keep alive the psychedelic experience. It makes

20:43.140 --> 20:47.460
you a very good meditator. Although I know you're not supposed to say good or bad meditator.

20:49.700 --> 20:56.820
But being trapped in that language. So that's kind of a real shorthand of what we understand

20:56.820 --> 21:02.660
about the neuroscience. The neuroscientific investigation of this phenomenon is absolutely

21:02.660 --> 21:07.780
fascinating. And for me, that chapter of the book was the most challenging to write. Well,

21:07.780 --> 21:11.620
not the most challenging, but one of the most challenging and fascinating to learn about.

21:11.620 --> 21:21.780
So thanks for your question. Hi. So I have heard rumors that monks have been able to achieve

21:21.780 --> 21:30.740
similar thing to a psychedelic trip. Do you know anything about what that entails? Or if there's

21:30.740 --> 21:37.380
any research that leads to it being a strong? I mean, there's anecdotal research that's really

21:37.380 --> 21:43.620
interesting. So one very relevant fact, at the same time we were doing this imaging work on

21:43.620 --> 21:49.540
psilocybin in the human brain, there was another researcher at Yale, imaging the brains of very

21:49.540 --> 21:55.060
experienced meditators, people who had 10,000 hours of meditation experience, and they would go

21:55.060 --> 22:02.340
into the fMRI and meditate. And their brains looked identical. They also had this suppression

22:02.340 --> 22:08.180
of the default mode network. And of course, that is the state of kind of selflessness that people

22:08.180 --> 22:14.820
report coming out of meditation. In terms of the monks, these are people with really long

22:14.820 --> 22:21.060
experience meditation, meditation, and that they can almost it will probably quiet the default

22:21.140 --> 22:26.740
mode network. There's a famous story about Ram Das, Richard Alpert, who was Timothy Leary's

22:27.620 --> 22:33.460
collaborator, went during the Harvard psilocybin project in the early 60s. This guy went on to

22:33.460 --> 22:40.500
become a guru, basically. And he's still alive. He's in Hawaii. And he was very interested in

22:40.500 --> 22:47.060
psychedelics and then found Hindu religion. And he went to India and he told his guru about LSD.

22:47.780 --> 22:52.500
And his guru said, I want to try it. I want to see what happens because you're telling me you're

22:52.500 --> 23:01.380
reaching this spiritual plane on this drug and that's my territory. And so Ram Das apparently gave

23:01.380 --> 23:08.980
him 600 micrograms of LSD, which is a beyond heroic dose. And that's what the guy wanted. He said,

23:08.980 --> 23:16.020
give me as much as you have. And the monk, or whatever he is, he's a guru, I guess, takes it.

23:16.020 --> 23:23.860
And so nothing happened. Is this true? I mean, it's, you know, Ram Das tells the story and

23:23.860 --> 23:30.500
swears that it's true. But it goes to your point. There are other ways to achieve the same effect.

23:31.940 --> 23:37.220
Psychedelics are probably a shortcut to becoming a really good meditator. But my guess is we will

23:37.220 --> 23:43.860
find at some point that all the disciplines, the spiritual disciplines that share this sense of

23:44.260 --> 23:51.940
of transcending the ego are doing the same thing in the brain, that that is where that's

23:51.940 --> 23:56.900
happening. And I'm thinking of sensory deprivation, you know, if you get into these tanks, sensory

23:56.900 --> 24:04.260
deprivation tanks, they're sort of coming back. They were a thing in the 60s, or fasting, or prayer,

24:04.260 --> 24:09.220
or the right kind of music and breathing exercises. One of the psychedelic trips I had

24:09.220 --> 24:15.380
involved no drugs, something called holotropic breathwork. It's based on a yogic breathing

24:15.380 --> 24:21.220
exercise where you essentially hyperventilate. You breathe really fast, you exhale more than you

24:21.220 --> 24:28.660
inhale, and you enter a trance state. It's the most uncanny thing. And my guess is that

24:29.220 --> 24:35.460
hyperventilation is starving the default mode network of oxygen, and reducing the activity

24:35.460 --> 24:41.060
there. So this is all areas to be explored. We may find other ways to achieve the same thing.

24:41.700 --> 24:44.420
But I think it's all connected. Thank you so much. Thank you.

24:46.580 --> 24:51.540
Hi. One of the interesting trends that I've read about on blogs and whatnot is the rise of

24:51.540 --> 24:57.780
microdosing. For those who don't know, microdosing is taking small doses of psychedelics on a

24:57.780 --> 25:04.180
somewhat regular basis, far too small to actually cause any sort of trip. And proponents of microdosing

25:04.260 --> 25:08.580
claim that it can help with things such as depression and anxiety, improve mood, improve

25:08.580 --> 25:12.900
creativity. I'm wondering if you've got a chance to investigate microdosing at all in your book.

25:12.900 --> 25:16.660
And if you get a sense that some of the renewed research interest for

25:16.660 --> 25:20.980
high dose experience might carry over into researching whether microdosing is clinically

25:20.980 --> 25:27.460
significant or not. Excellent question. So microdosing is a very interesting phenomenon.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.700
As the questioner said, it's taking a subperceptual dose, often with LSD,

25:31.700 --> 25:36.180
about 10 micrograms every third or fourth day. And the reason you don't take it every day is

25:36.180 --> 25:40.820
because it would lose its effect. The drugs kind of cancel themselves out at a certain point.

25:42.580 --> 25:47.460
Many people anecdotally report success with this, that it's kind of a brain tonic,

25:47.460 --> 25:50.340
and it does help with depression. There's a wonderful book written about it,

25:50.340 --> 25:55.220
if you want to follow up, by Ayelet Waldman called A Really Good Day. And she's someone who's

25:55.220 --> 26:02.100
struggled with depression for many years and found more relief on this regime of microdosing,

26:02.100 --> 26:08.900
and she's been through the whole pharmacopoeia, I'm sure. The reason I don't spend a lot of time

26:08.900 --> 26:14.500
on it in the book is that there isn't yet anything beyond the anecdotal reports. They're

26:14.500 --> 26:20.260
interesting, they're really provocative, and they're being systematically connected. If you go online,

26:20.260 --> 26:24.580
there's a guy named James Fadiman, who is one of the first generation researchers,

26:24.580 --> 26:29.460
who's advising people on the protocol and soliciting reports and getting this interesting

26:30.260 --> 26:37.620
dataset. But it has not been trialed the way the large dose psilocybin has. I hear that these

26:37.620 --> 26:42.740
trials are about to happen, and so we may get some really solid information on whether microdosing

26:42.740 --> 26:48.260
works. The fact is, though, there is such a strong placebo effect with psychedelics.

26:49.060 --> 26:54.820
They're so suggestible that it's very easy to see how it would work. Just the very idea that

26:54.820 --> 27:01.540
you're taking a small dose of LSD probably would have an effect. But is it a pharmacological effect

27:01.540 --> 27:09.780
or a placebo effect? That's what remains to be learned. I'm skeptical about it. I do want the

27:09.780 --> 27:16.820
research to happen, and this interest in macrodosing, if you will, has stimulated people to fund some

27:16.820 --> 27:21.940
research, some of which will be underground and some of which will be above ground. So I'm very

27:21.940 --> 27:29.780
excited to see what they come up with. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks for being here today. Wozniak

27:29.780 --> 27:34.260
pretty famously said that LSD was one of the things that differentiated Apple from Microsoft.

27:34.260 --> 27:40.900
Yeah. I think Job said that too. And at this organization, we selected, apocryphally,

27:40.900 --> 27:43.700
Eric Schmidt, a CEO because he was the candidate that been to Burning Man.

27:43.940 --> 27:49.380
As an external observer, I'm curious, what are your observations about the intersection between

27:49.380 --> 27:55.300
psychedelics and the technology or the tech industry? It's a really interesting relationship.

27:55.940 --> 28:00.420
So Steve Jobs famously said too, it had been formative to his intellectual development. And I

28:00.420 --> 28:04.420
thought it was him, but maybe it was Wozniak who said that Windows would have been a much better

28:04.420 --> 28:11.380
product had Gates ever taken LSD. It was like a really mean thing to say. I think Gates immediately

28:11.380 --> 28:15.780
said, but I did, but I did. But it didn't work. It must not have been enough.

28:18.900 --> 28:23.940
And I thought this was the beginning of the tech community's interest in these drugs.

28:23.940 --> 28:27.860
And because it's very current, I mean, you know better than I, but I mean, I've talked to lots

28:27.860 --> 28:32.420
of people in Silicon Valley and it's a big part of the culture right now. Microdosing,

28:32.420 --> 28:37.540
macro dosing, there's, I mean, I know one prominent tech company that uses it in their

28:37.620 --> 28:43.460
management training, you know, LSD. So it's, there's a lot of, you know,

28:45.380 --> 28:49.060
a lot of interest there. And it is the tech community, as I said, that's funding a lot of

28:49.060 --> 28:58.500
this research. But it turns out that engineers have been interested in LSD back in the 50s.

28:59.140 --> 29:04.100
And that there's this very interesting episode before Timothy Leary and the whole 60s psychedelic

29:04.100 --> 29:10.420
story that we think we know so well. There was this research period. And there was this very

29:10.420 --> 29:14.980
interesting character who's kind of a counterpart to Leary named Al Hubbard. And I tell his story

29:14.980 --> 29:20.180
in the book. He's a very mysterious figure. He's got, he's involved with the OSS, which became the

29:20.180 --> 29:30.020
CIA. He's playing both sides of many worlds. But he had a vision in 1951 that told him he could be

29:30.020 --> 29:36.420
involved in a major civilization change. He realized it was LSD. He went to Sando's where,

29:36.420 --> 29:41.220
which owned the patent on it. It was a Swiss pharmaceutical company, persuaded them to give

29:41.220 --> 29:49.700
him something like a liter bottle of LSD, which probably is enough to trip a third of the population

29:49.700 --> 29:55.060
of earth at that point. I mean, just an incredible amount, which he keeps buried in Death Valley at

29:55.060 --> 30:00.100
his place. And anyway, he's a great character. He's so much more interesting than Leary. So he's,

30:00.100 --> 30:04.820
he becomes the Johnny Apple seed of LSD. And, but he's got a different theory. He said,

30:05.460 --> 30:10.420
he was kind of a conservative guy. He wanted to turn on the elite. So he was going to do captains

30:10.420 --> 30:18.100
of industry, you know, engineers, artists, people in the church, the Catholic church.

30:18.100 --> 30:23.620
And he would go around with the satchel tripping people. Remember, it was legal then. And he became

30:23.620 --> 30:30.820
a very gifted guide. So he has his eye on the tech world as one of the places where you could

30:30.820 --> 30:37.780
have this multiplier effect. So he turns on a couple of engineers who are working at a company

30:37.780 --> 30:42.100
called Ampex, which is actually one of the first Silicon Valley companies in the 50s.

30:42.100 --> 30:46.420
They make magnetic tape on which, as you know, all computer information was stored,

30:46.420 --> 30:51.780
but also video and sound recording. They had 40,000 people in the valley before it was called

30:51.780 --> 30:58.660
Silicon Valley. And, and the head of strategic planning, he turned on another guy and actually

30:58.660 --> 31:05.140
Ampex for a while was going to be the world's first psychedelic company. And, but the, the president

31:05.140 --> 31:10.420
was Jewish and Al Hubbard was Catholic and he kept bringing in crucifixes and things and the

31:10.420 --> 31:17.220
president said, go away. And so, but anyway, so these engineers though were so taken with this

31:17.220 --> 31:24.180
experience that they left the company, a group of three or four engineers and started a big research,

31:24.980 --> 31:31.780
something called the International Foundation for Advanced Research. And they were doing a lot of

31:32.420 --> 31:36.580
psychedelic research. And I've always been interested as to why engineers in particular

31:36.580 --> 31:41.860
had such a strong reaction to this drug. And I talked to, I talked to a couple engineers about

31:42.420 --> 31:47.380
and you can tell me if this chimes with your sense of things. But this guy, this one guy in

31:47.380 --> 31:53.700
particular told me that, oh, and the, some of the early chip designers were into LSD. It's very

31:53.700 --> 31:58.100
hard to design a chip without a computer. But of course, at the beginning you had to. And you

31:58.100 --> 32:06.100
could hold this complex 3D structure in your head with the help of the drug. And this guy said, oh,

32:06.100 --> 32:09.860
and one of the, sorry, one of the early people at the International Foundation for Advanced

32:09.860 --> 32:14.260
Study who was tripped was someone you probably know, if you know your history of your industry,

32:14.260 --> 32:21.780
but a Doug Engelbart, right, who invented, you know, the mouse and the interface and email and

32:21.780 --> 32:27.540
like everything, right? There was this mother of all demos. Well, that guy got LSD from those

32:27.540 --> 32:33.940
Ampex guys. And under the influence, they were doing a creativity study. He invented something then.

32:34.740 --> 32:40.580
It wasn't that profound. It was something he called a tinkle toy to toiletrain boys and was

32:40.580 --> 32:46.660
something you could like aim a stream of urine at and it would make things happen. Okay, it's not

32:46.660 --> 32:55.460
quite the, you know, the mouse, but it was pretty cool. But it primed the pump, you know. So anyway,

32:55.460 --> 33:01.300
where was I? So this engineer was talking to you said, well, the problem, if you're an engineer,

33:01.300 --> 33:06.900
as opposed to a scientist, scientists can like their goal is to reduce problems to the simplest

33:06.900 --> 33:13.060
terms. But engineers are faced with an irreducible complexity and number of variables. So the

33:13.060 --> 33:19.220
challenge is different. The challenge becomes finding pattern. And psychedelics, one of the

33:19.220 --> 33:25.300
things that happens is you find pattern where you didn't see it before. And that he thought was why

33:25.380 --> 33:31.060
so many engineers found this a useful tool. I think that's fascinating. I think there's,

33:31.060 --> 33:37.380
John Markham wrote an interesting history about Silicon Valley and the 60s. And there's some

33:37.380 --> 33:44.580
very good stuff on on drugs. And he interviewed jobs about his experience. But yeah, it's part

33:44.580 --> 33:53.140
of the tradition you're in. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Hi. So you talked a little bit about

33:53.140 --> 33:57.860
how like every culture in the world has experienced this to some degree or is integrated into their

33:57.860 --> 34:02.020
their culture. And I'm curious from a sort of anthropological perspective, because I imagine

34:02.020 --> 34:08.260
there's a huge range in the way that that these drugs are applied, right? It's a select few or

34:08.260 --> 34:12.980
it's open to everyone or it's ritualistic or it's ordinary or whatever. Are there other sort of

34:12.980 --> 34:20.180
cultural patterns that can be deduced or associated and, you know, from from drug use within those

34:20.260 --> 34:24.260
it's a good question. I actually think we have a lot to learn from the traditional use of these

34:24.260 --> 34:29.620
drugs. So we're going to stay on psychedelics. And there are lots of plant drugs that are not

34:29.620 --> 34:34.660
that controversial like caffeine, although in some cultures they might be. But psychedelics have been

34:34.660 --> 34:41.460
used for it looks like several thousand years. It appears that the ancient Greeks, all the writers

34:41.460 --> 34:47.300
you've heard of participated in an annual ritual that involved what seems to be a psychedelic.

34:47.620 --> 34:53.700
It was called the Kikion. It was an annual rite in honor of Demeter, harvest related.

34:54.500 --> 35:01.620
It was called the Eleusinian Mysteries. And everybody was sworn to secrecy about this.

35:01.620 --> 35:07.220
So we don't know that much about it. But everybody took this potion and went to the underworld,

35:07.220 --> 35:12.340
had experiences of a beyond and it was very profound. And it was the only time you were ever

35:12.340 --> 35:18.020
allowed to take this drug. We don't know what the drug was. And in fact, one person was caught

35:18.020 --> 35:23.380
using the drug at like a party and, you know, was, you know, imprisoned or killed or something.

35:23.380 --> 35:31.300
It was a big crime. The lesson I think the takeaway from lots of traditional cultures use

35:31.300 --> 35:38.740
is that they recognize that these were very powerful medicines not to be treated casually.

35:39.300 --> 35:44.260
And that they all surrounded the use of their plant medicine, as they often call it,

35:44.900 --> 35:52.900
with ritual, ceremony, elders in attendance. It was never careless. It was never casual.

35:52.900 --> 35:58.180
It was never recreational. It was a profound experience. And I think when the drugs hit the

35:58.180 --> 36:05.860
West, beginning in the late fifties, early sixties, we didn't have any container for them.

36:06.260 --> 36:11.140
We didn't have rituals. We just kind of like took a handful of mushrooms and went to a concert

36:11.140 --> 36:18.100
or we drank LSD from the punch bowl. And I think that's why some people really got in trouble.

36:19.300 --> 36:24.500
And so that the lesson that we failed to learn was that, yes, these drugs have an ancient lineage,

36:24.500 --> 36:28.740
but look how they were used. Look at what those cultures learned by trial and error.

36:29.540 --> 36:36.660
And now we see it in shamanic ceremonies in South America. There were mushroom cults in Mexico

36:36.660 --> 36:42.100
that went back, we don't know how long, but at least a thousand years. But they were always taken

36:42.100 --> 36:50.420
in a group with guidance, with someone who wasn't taking the drugs, and with enormous care. And

36:50.420 --> 36:55.140
I think that's what we lost. And we need to now invent that container for ourselves. Maybe it's

36:55.220 --> 37:00.100
this therapeutic protocol I'm describing. I'm not sure. But that's the cultural work that needs to

37:00.100 --> 37:11.700
be done. So thank you. Sure. I was wondering whether in your research, you'd come across the video

37:12.420 --> 37:22.340
of a debate from 1967 between Timothy Leary and Jerome Lethvin at MIT. No, Jerome Lethvin.

37:23.060 --> 37:29.060
For those who don't recognize the name, Jerome Lethvin was one of the pioneers of neuroscience.

37:29.060 --> 37:37.060
He was one of the four authors of one of the first papers on the physiology of perception

37:37.060 --> 37:44.340
titled What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain. And he was also one of the most charismatic

37:44.340 --> 37:54.100
professors at MIT in the 1960s. And they held this debate sometime in 1967. And Leary went first and

37:54.100 --> 38:03.220
he had the whole audience lulled into going along. He was very charismatic. And Lethvin got up and

38:03.220 --> 38:08.660
said, bullshit. I think it may have been the first time bullshit was allowed to be said on

38:08.660 --> 38:20.820
broadcast television. Anyway, Lethvin's biggest argument against taking LSD was the phenomenon

38:20.820 --> 38:27.380
of uncontrolled flashbacks and how that could get people into trouble. But as I was standing

38:27.380 --> 38:34.740
in line here, I looked it up and it's on YouTube. The whole thing actually ran about two hours.

38:34.740 --> 38:42.420
WGBH, public TV station, recorded it and broadcast it at a one hour edited version.

38:42.420 --> 38:50.180
So Lethvin, L-E-T-V-I-N? Yes. Maybe one or two teas. Well, this is a good occasion to talk about

38:50.180 --> 38:57.620
risk. So let me, unless you want to frame the question, but I'd love to. I'll let you talk

38:57.620 --> 39:03.700
about it, but I just wanted to ask one more side question. When you talk about food, you almost

39:03.780 --> 39:09.620
always bring a bag of groceries. Yeah, oh yeah. I was wondering if you brought a bag with you.

39:12.820 --> 39:22.420
Let me tell you a little tutorial on the law. So I was a very nervous Nellie doing these

39:22.420 --> 39:28.340
experiences. I didn't have a lot of experience with psychedelics in college. And even after,

39:28.340 --> 39:32.100
I was really too afraid to take these drugs. I didn't think I was psychologically sturdy enough

39:32.100 --> 39:38.900
at that point in my life. And so before I dove in for this project, I did a lot of research

39:39.860 --> 39:44.500
as I want to do as a journalist to figure out, well, what are the dangers? Because there are

39:44.500 --> 39:49.300
lots of stories you heard in the 60s. People staring at the sun to let go blind. That was one

39:49.300 --> 39:55.620
story, scrambling of your chromosomes. Both those stories, by the way, were, one was made up. The

39:55.620 --> 40:00.500
first was made up and that's been proven. And the chromosome story was withdrawn within months.

40:00.500 --> 40:07.060
It was just really bad research. Psychotic breaks and that did happen sometimes. There are people

40:07.060 --> 40:13.940
at risk for schizophrenia that an acid trip was what tripped them off. But a lot of what was,

40:14.660 --> 40:18.340
well, let me divide it into two. There's physiological risk and there's psychological

40:18.340 --> 40:27.780
risk. On the physiological side, it's stunning how, I don't want to overstate this, but that how,

40:27.780 --> 40:33.620
compared to other drugs that we take routinely, how non-toxic, relatively non-toxic, classic

40:33.620 --> 40:41.860
psychedelics are. And I'm talking about LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline. There is no known

40:41.860 --> 40:48.900
lethal dose, which you can't say about over-the-counter drugs you take for a cold or for pain.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.820
There are very few molecules in your brain that are washed out really quickly and they don't seem

40:54.820 --> 41:00.340
to affect the, you know, they affect your brain and they don't affect other parts. If you have a

41:00.340 --> 41:04.660
panic attack, your blood pressure is going to go up, but they don't directly affect other systems.

41:05.220 --> 41:11.140
That's one thing. And they're also non-addictive. The first thought you have upon finishing a

41:11.140 --> 41:15.460
psychedelic trip is like, when can I do that again? It's actually, do I ever have to do that again?

41:16.580 --> 41:21.540
And because it's really intense and they're, so they're not habit forming. If you give the rat,

41:22.500 --> 41:26.260
in that experiment where the rat has two levers, one's cocaine and one's

41:26.260 --> 41:31.380
food and if you press it the lever, he gets a dose of cocaine and they'll press it till they die

41:31.380 --> 41:36.820
over and over and over again. You put LSD in that contraption, they'll press it once and never again.

41:38.740 --> 41:47.380
I mean, imagine being a rat on LSD. So from the physiological point of view,

41:47.380 --> 41:53.380
they're safer than a lot of drugs we take routinely. And I was surprised to learn that,

41:53.380 --> 41:58.020
frankly. Psychologically, you know, it's very hard to sort through the stories.

41:58.580 --> 42:04.740
The flashback phenomenon, which I've heard reported, I have never found any really good

42:04.740 --> 42:10.100
research on it. And I'm still looking for it. If anybody has a good paper on that, I'd love to see

42:10.100 --> 42:17.380
it. There are, you know, I've had, I've kind of flashed on things that happened in my experience

42:17.380 --> 42:23.220
because they're part of my store of psychic, powerful psychic memories. Is that a flashback?

42:23.220 --> 42:28.980
I don't think so because I can get it out of my head. But there are people who have these unbidden

42:31.060 --> 42:35.620
moments of consciousness that are, that, you know, may be connected to what happened to them.

42:36.580 --> 42:43.700
I haven't heard that they interfere with people's life or mental health. But it's a question mark.

42:45.060 --> 42:50.820
The great danger is the danger you have drinking too much also, which is doing stupid things,

42:50.820 --> 42:56.820
walking into traffic, falling. All that happens on psychedelics as it happens with any powerful

42:56.820 --> 43:02.740
drug. And that's why a guide is really important, somebody to look out for your body. In the

43:02.740 --> 43:08.660
studies that have gone on, there have now been a thousand dosings of people who have been screened

43:08.660 --> 43:14.420
for mental health problems and things like that. And there has not been a single serious adverse

43:14.420 --> 43:20.420
event. So are there adverse events when people use the drugs recreationally? Yes, we all know

43:20.420 --> 43:24.820
people who've had really bad trips and they usually stopped using it at that point, felt trapped,

43:24.900 --> 43:33.940
had panic reactions. But often psychiatrists who didn't know this territory would misinterpret

43:34.500 --> 43:39.300
a panic reaction as a psychotic break because it sure looks like that. You're having delusions,

43:39.300 --> 43:44.820
you're hearing voices, you know, I mean, to an average psychiatrist, this would say psychosis.

43:44.820 --> 43:51.220
But often it was a panic attack. I interviewed Andrew Weil, Dr. Andrew Weil about this. And he

43:51.220 --> 43:56.180
was very interested in psychedelics in the 60s. He was at Harvard and Lyria was there. And when he

43:56.180 --> 44:01.940
graduated from medical school in 1968, he went out to San Francisco and volunteered at the Haid

44:01.940 --> 44:08.420
Ashbury Free Clinic. And they were seeing lots of LSD casualties as they call people coming in,

44:08.420 --> 44:13.540
having bad trips, thinking they're losing their mind or they're dying. And he knew the territory

44:13.540 --> 44:17.620
really well, having used a lot of psychedelics. And he would come into the little cubicle with

44:17.620 --> 44:23.060
somebody who was completely freaking out. And he had on his white coat and his stethoscope and his

44:23.060 --> 44:27.460
clipboard and he'd ask a few questions. Then he'd say to the person, well, excuse me, there's someone

44:27.460 --> 44:32.100
in the next room who's really in trouble. And he'd leave. And they were like, wow, someone's more

44:32.100 --> 44:39.460
fucked up than I am. And they would suddenly feel fine. They would just completely subside. So

44:39.540 --> 44:44.340
suggestibility is a very big part of the experience. Yeah.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.220
Thank you very much for coming to talk to us today.

44:49.220 --> 44:56.740
Oh, thank you. Thanks for your great question. Thank you.
