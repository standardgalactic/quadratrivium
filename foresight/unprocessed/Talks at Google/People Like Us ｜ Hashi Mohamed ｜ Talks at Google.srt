1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Thank you very much for coming. I will tell you a little bit about me and how effectively

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,840
the book came about in the first instance. Then I will touch upon the themes of the book,

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,160
which have been, if you've been following the press, quite provocative and controversial.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,400
I know what it feels like to be chased by trolls on Twitter now. I will be very keen

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,120
on finding out whether there are some real life trolls here today. Then thirdly, I want

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,720
to just sort of get your thoughts from your own experiences because what I have found

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,560
is that in writing this book that there's a lot of what I'm saying that resonates for

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,200
a lot of people no matter where they've come from and no matter what kind of life experience

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,480
you've had. So that's essentially what I hope to do in the first sort of 25 minutes

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,200
and then we can open it up and then I will gladly sign your book as well afterwards.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:10,000
So a little bit about me. I was born in Kenya to Somali parents and we were growing up in

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,880
a semi-slum called Isli in Nairobi and my parents met in Kenya about late 1980 and my

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:29,640
mother, bless her, has given birth to 12 children. So I'm number eight in that long list. I was

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,040
glad she didn't stop after number seven, but I wish she did after number eight and she

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,200
had got married and had the first six children with her first husband and the second six

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,360
children with my father and one of my younger siblings had died when he was very, very small.

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,720
And so they met in Kenya where they were living throughout the 80s when I was growing up there.

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,520
And roughly sort of when the war broke out in 1991-92 in Somalia, so many of my family

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,280
had moved over to Kenya seeking sort of some sort of refuge and help and it was roughly

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,120
around the time when the Dodab refugee camp had opened up in Kenya. And for my father,

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,120
we were always now settled in Kenya where he had lived and he had started his life and

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,480
had established himself and we were going to stay there, certainly his children and my

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,880
mother. And what was interesting about that was that I was the first person in my whole

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,680
family's history to be born outside of Somalia, so to be born in Kenya. And for my father,

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,320
that meant that our future was going to be in Kenya for all intents and purposes. But when

26
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,840
his mother, his sisters and his other siblings all were fleeing the war from Somalia and came

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,600
to Kenya, there was a choice to be made. There was a choice to be made as to whether or not

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:08,720
they were going to seek asylum outside of Africa or stay in Kenya or as most people were thinking

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,880
at that time, the war is just going to die down in a bit and we'll just go back over and it's

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,120
going to be fine. But then a lot of my siblings then sought asylum and I have brothers and sisters

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,200
who ended up in America, some ended up in Canada, I have cousins who ended up in Sweden,

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Norway and all sorts of different countries. And for my father, we were going to stay and by

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,360
this point it's sort of like 92, 93. And then in 93 when vast majority of my family had sought

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,280
asylum where they could, my father died in a car crash in Kenya. So then that meant there was

35
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,640
another choice to be made. At this point my father's brother was given a full scholarship

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,040
to study and then work in Italy where he was starting to establish himself and maybe start

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:09,080
his own family. And he came back to Kenya to bury his brother, my father. And then there was another

38
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,000
choice to be made there because he had to have a conversation with my mum and say,

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,360
do you stay here with these kids? And my mum and father never learnt to read and write,

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,600
they never were formally educated. And they had to decide what to do. My uncle's advice was you're

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,360
here with no income, with no real way of feeding these children. Either you follow this wave of

42
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,640
people who are seeking asylum somewhere else in the world and try and find a new place to start

43
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:49,000
again with help or you stay here and nobody knows what's going to happen. You now have with you

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,240
five children under the age of 12. And my mother said, well, okay, well, I think I could make it

45
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:07,400
here but leave the youngest one and take the rest. Which meant that we, the elder ones, ended up in

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,000
London without our parents having just helped to bury our father. So you could just imagine for a

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,880
moment being a nine-year-old boy or as my sister's six-year-old girl, five-year-old girl, turning

48
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,960
up in a place like London without your mum, without your dad, not understanding the language. I'd

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,160
like to think I've mastered the English language now a little bit. Not understanding the culture,

50
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,800
not understanding anything about what's happening. Such was the shock for us

51
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,720
that I still remember to this day, and I talk about it in the book, walking down the street

52
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,520
and where I'd come from in the semi-slum in Nairobi, there were no street lights.

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,920
When walking down the street and literally walking into a lamppost and knocking myself out

54
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,320
as a child, that's just how different and new the environment was to us.

55
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,280
And settling into a place like this when you don't understand the culture and the customs,

56
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,840
when you don't have an adult to explain to you what's happening, why it's happening,

57
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,360
what it means to be here, how it's going to work, all of those things can be really, really difficult.

58
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,000
But here's the key point about that. That kind of beginning and that kind of start for a lot of

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,480
people like me, especially Somalis who came and sought asylum in this country, that was a really

60
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,680
remarkably unremarkable thing. In fact, in many ways we were lucky because we hadn't seen war.

61
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:49,560
I had my father's sister who had come to Kenya and then the UK to seek asylum. She had six kids

62
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,240
of her own, but her husband had been killed in the war and all of her children had experienced the

63
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,840
war. At least with us, we hadn't experienced the war directly, but we were victims of the war

64
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,840
indirectly. And so in that sense, the starting point was remarkably unremarkable in that sense.

65
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,960
There was nothing special about the difficulties that we were facing at that time.

66
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Then what happens after that? Well, then it's, my mum comes four years later and we're having to

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,600
sort of get to know your mum all over again because we now all speak English. She doesn't speak any

68
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,240
English. You're trying to communicate with her. She's speaking to us in Swahili and Somali,

69
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,520
which we understand but not very well. And you can imagine all the difficulties that then that

70
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,760
causes. I try and talk about it in the book as much as detail as I can, but it was quite painful,

71
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,160
as you might imagine, to sort of dig all that up and think it through and what it meant and

72
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,520
why certain choices were made and why certain choices were not made and so on. But then I did

73
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:06,280
enough to get to the GCSEs, enough to get to the A levels, enough to get to an undergraduate degree

74
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,440
in law and French at the University of Hertfordshire. I then got a full scholarship to do my post

75
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,360
graduate studies at Oxford University. Then I got a full scholarship to study for the bar exams in

76
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:26,440
London. Then became a barrister fully qualified in 2012. And then here I am now promoting this book

77
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,320
that is telling that story. Now, you know, in many ways, it's a sort of shortened version of

78
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,080
people say, well, now it must mean that, you know, it's smooth sailing from here. Well, I mean,

79
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,520
there's still plenty of time to mess this up, you know, let's not get carried away. But it's that

80
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,000
kind of journey that I'm still digesting in many ways. And I will continue to digest for quite

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,320
some time because there's no shame in admitting that the pain and the sorrow and the grief will

82
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,120
take a lifetime. And one of the ways in which a sociologist and a psychologist and a neuroscientist

83
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,280
that I interviewed for the book and talked about were explaining how when grief, for example,

84
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,480
or a traumatic event, it's really important. Come on in. Trust you to be very late.

85
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,720
Just one of those things that, you know, I know him, I'm not just picking up on him.

86
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm not just picking on him. And, you know, it's it's one of those things that people talk about

87
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,120
when, you know, trauma or a death, for example, people always say, well, you'll get over it,

88
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
you'll get over it. But actually, one of the ways in which people explain that is,

89
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,920
is they say, well, imagine your brain is just this one big sort of circle. When you're young,

90
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,200
and something very traumatic happens like death, that particular event will be also another big

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,240
circle within that brain circle of yours, because it will dominate a huge part of who you are.

92
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,920
But as you go older, and as you mourn properly, and as you digest that trauma, that inner circle

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,400
that signifies and represents that trauma just gets slightly smaller compared to that part of

94
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,280
your brain that is there to be dealing with it. So in other words, you never get over it. It just

95
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,960
becomes a smaller part of who you are, the contours of your life, the part of what makes

96
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,600
you a whole human being. And that is, for me, the best way in which somebody described to me,

97
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,240
the way in which we deal with trauma, and death, and that kind of thing that happens to you in

98
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,560
our life. So it's quite important that you don't always come across to people, say to somebody,

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,520
well, you'll get over it, it's fine, time will heal you. That's just not the right way to look at it.

100
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,400
Because if you do, you're going to come up against the wall that hits you and hits you and hits you.

101
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,960
So what about the book in terms of the themes? Well, the themes that I've looked into here

102
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,280
are quite varied and big. So the book ranges from what is happening to you as a child,

103
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,000
and sort of what is happening to you in the womb of your mother, and the kind of diet that your

104
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,800
mother's having in terms of what kind of human being that you grow up to become,

105
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,760
all the way through to whatever fulfilling career you're looking for, whatever fulfilling

106
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,200
destiny that you want, if you've ever dreamt of ever being at Google or whatever it is.

107
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,240
What exactly is happening at each stage that allows you to be able to succeed, and how does

108
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,280
it all come together is the kind of overall thesis of the book. So I touch upon this idea,

109
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,040
for example, which is that all the things that people talk about, biological determinism,

110
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,240
for example, are you born with your talents, or is it part of your environment that actually

111
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,280
teaches you? What does the science suggest? How does it affect me personally? How do I think

112
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,440
that my illiterate parents, who were never formally educated,

113
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,640
are a part of who I am now? And actually, does it mean that your intelligence can be measured

114
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,680
by way of sort of formal education as opposed to informal education and life lessons?

115
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,200
And does it mean that your destiny is determined purely by virtue of the fact that you may or may

116
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,360
not be born to people who actually know how to read and write, for example? It's quite controversial,

117
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,120
but I tackle it in the book. The answer is more or less it's 50-50. But equally,

118
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,400
you may be born with some talent, but your environment may well suppress it. You may be born

119
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,840
with very little talent, but the right environment might really, really accentuate that and make you

120
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,280
push whatever little talent you were born with to a level that it goes to. The way I put it is,

121
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,240
how do you make sure that somebody's environment doesn't determine their destiny

122
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,160
in the same way as somebody's environment manages to protect them from their destiny?

123
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,320
And that's the best way to look at the nature and nurture debate in that context. Education.

124
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,000
How many of you guys have heard governments, politicians, ministers always say education's

125
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,360
the answer. Education, education, education. If you just get them to school and they know how to

126
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,000
write and get a university degree, they will be fine. How many times do you always hear that? You

127
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,200
hear that so many times. Well, I've got a newsflash for you. The idea that education is the answer

128
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,200
or even the main answer to the conundrum of social mobility is nonsense.

129
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:00,600
Complete and utter nonsense. And I'll tell you why. Education, for education's sake, is fundamental

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,600
to the human progress. You need to learn how to be literate and numerate and be able to communicate

131
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,600
and be able to understand people. You need to be able to read a bank statement. You need to be able

132
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,040
to fill out forms. You need to be able to understand, you know, the mechanics of communicating with

133
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:23,080
human beings both in writing and in speaking. Of course, that's a given. But the idea that more

134
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:32,040
exams and more degrees and more qualifications necessarily equals a trajectory in which you

135
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,440
will become socially mobile, it just doesn't follow. It doesn't follow and we've got to tackle that

136
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,280
head on because the consequence of not tackling that is putting pressure on our education system.

137
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,800
It's putting pressures on our teachers. It's putting crazy pressure on the kids. And it's putting

138
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,280
forward unrealistic expectations on parents who are desperately trying to do what they can for

139
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,760
their children. And I set that out what that means in the book. And then when you translate that

140
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:13,960
into what that looks like, take this example that was found in, by a couple of academics at the

141
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,920
London School of Economics, Sam Friedman and Daniel Morrison, who wrote a book called The Class

142
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:28,040
Sealate. They looked at two individuals and took and made sure they controlled for degree

143
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,000
classification, the subject that they studied, the kind of university they went to, and then the

144
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,600
kind of entry job that they had. The only difference between these two people is that one went to a

145
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,360
state school and one went to a private school. Everything else is being controlled for, okay?

146
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,320
When they get into that same entry job, it turns out that the person who went to private school

147
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:02,920
within three and a half years is earning 16% more. How do you account for that?

148
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,400
These are two individuals who more or less had the exact same trajectory when you control for

149
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,680
everything else except for what school they went to. And yet, three and a half years later,

150
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:26,200
one is earning 16% more based on what school they went to. How do you explain that if education

151
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,520
and especially tertiary education was supposed to be this great equalizer, was supposed to be this

152
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:41,480
moment that everybody becomes equal in terms of equality of opportunity? Again, there are no easy

153
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,560
answers to this, but I delve into it and I try and figure out what it could mean and what are the

154
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,920
kind of unwritten rules, the social capital connections, the cultural capital, how you

155
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,160
understand the culture in which you're going into. The Barrister profession, where I am now as a

156
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:08,680
Barrister. Cultural capital is huge. You know, being able to understand how people communicate

157
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,640
when they talk about what school and what college you went to, rather than saying,

158
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,360
what did you study? They will say, what did you read? And that's the kind of lingo that

159
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,120
Oxbridge types will understand and maybe others wouldn't. And that cultural capital can make a

160
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:33,000
difference. And again, what does that mean if we keep banging on about the fact that education is the

161
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:41,400
answer? Another big theme in the book is the role of luck. How many of you guys believe you're lucky

162
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:48,040
in life? Okay. And for those of you who don't put your hand up, do you think it's all you put your

163
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:55,480
hand up? You worked hard to be here. One person, that's good. I hope you're being ironic. Because

164
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:03,320
if you're not, you really need to read the book. Luck is important, because especially successful

165
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:11,320
people tend to tell a story that it's all them, that they worked hard, that it was all down to them.

166
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,960
And I give about four or five examples of that. But I'll share with you two examples.

167
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:24,200
Jeff Bezos. And I'm allowed to mention the names of competitor organizations.

168
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:35,240
Jeff Bezos talks about, and many of the sort of founding fathers or individuals who start

169
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,120
up tech companies always tell this story of, I founded my company in a garage. You know what

170
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,880
I mean? It was in my garage. I sat there and I worked hard and it came together. This

171
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,240
nonsense that they tell people about it all began in this garage. Have you seen that image of Jeff

172
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,760
Bezos sitting in his garage with Amazon written on fountain pen and sitting there hunched in

173
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,040
front of his computer and he built this billion dollar? Well, here's the footnote. The footnote is

174
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:13,080
in 1995, Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250,000 for free to start up his company. And all of the

175
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,520
connections and people that he needed to know and all of the things that he needed to push to be

176
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,000
where he is. And of course, things picked up in a way that has been exponential and arguably

177
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,600
in a way that we will never see happen again in the way that it happened at that particular

178
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,600
moment in time. Now, if that's not lucky, I don't know what is. But that's not the story we tell,

179
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,280
right? That's not the story we tell. The story we tell is he worked hard in this garage and look

180
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,160
at this guy now. He deserves to be there. And the reason why that's a problem is because we set

181
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,760
then unrealistic expectations about what success looks like. We then set people up for failure.

182
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,800
We then tell people the kind of stories that I consider to be irresponsible when it comes to

183
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:08,040
people's expectations of what they're worth, of what's possible and what's probable in your

184
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,000
set of circumstances. And that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about in the book and I try

185
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,120
and lay out. Another example is Bill Gates, who we all know about how he came about with the

186
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,600
natural stories he dropped out of Harvard. And, you know, he's amazing. Look at him now. What they

187
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,080
don't tell you is that he's one of the very few people who had access to the early computer

188
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:37,400
in a way that was unprecedented and learned hours and hours and hours of coding and programming

189
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,080
and being able to do it in such a way that his parents in that context, in that environment in

190
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,440
Seattle, allowed for him to grow in a way that, again, arguably will never see again.

191
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,560
But when you hear about his story, you hear he dropped out of Harvard, right? Dropouts are good.

192
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:06,040
Dropouts can succeed too. I won't get to the big guys of your... That's for another time. Don't bite

193
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,320
the hand that feeds you. But luck. Luck is an example of the way... There's a really good professor

194
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,680
briefly. I'll mention by the name of Robert Frank at Cornell University, who's written a really

195
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,960
fantastic book about luck, success and luck. And the way he describes luck is actually,

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,120
interestingly, Casey and I were talking about bikes earlier in a different context, but you're

197
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,080
riding a bicycle. And when you're riding your bicycle and you're riding it really strongly

198
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,160
and the wind is blowing at you, you're fully aware of the wind because it's pushing at you.

199
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:47,000
You're like struggling. Your feet are pedaling away. You're feeling that the wind, that current,

200
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,960
is pushing back at you. That's you being fully aware of your bad luck because it's there. It's

201
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:02,680
constant. It's consistent. But say you take a left and now you're going downhill in a slight incline

202
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,440
and now the wind is in your back and you're cycling fast and you're flying. You will only

203
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,800
notice that the wind is in your back and you're on the incline for the first 10 seconds. After that,

204
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,880
you're more likely to say it's all me. You're much more likely to say it's all me because look how

205
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:28,760
fit I am. That's you hardly ever noticing good luck. You will always be aware of bad luck,

206
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,280
but you're less likely to notice good luck. And again, I set that out in the book. Now don't

207
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,520
get me wrong. I'm no shrinking violet. I do think I'm special too. And I don't want to undermine

208
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,640
my own talents and what I'm good at, but it would be a complete nonsense and a folly to not acknowledge

209
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,120
the number of times I've had help, the number of mentors who've shown me the way, the number of

210
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,480
second chances I've had, the number of opportunities that people have given me,

211
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,280
that I then recognized, that I then worked on, that I then pushed. And that's important because

212
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,520
otherwise another different story is both irresponsible and sets people up for failure.

213
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,600
That's another, you know, it's really important that I impart that to you. The next themes in the

214
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:28,120
book are in relation to concepts like confidence. Where does this idea of confidence come from?

215
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,560
What does it take for you to be confident enough to be in a room like this and address people and

216
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,640
talk in a big meeting and hold your own and be confident? What does that actually look like?

217
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,360
What does it taste like? How do you teach it? Can you teach it? Can you learn it? Can you unlearn

218
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:51,480
it? What are the kind of contexts that give it a boost and what are the kind of contexts that

219
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,640
undermine it? It's all there. I delve into that. Imagination is another chapter which is about

220
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,360
this idea that if you're coming from, you know, one of the most deprived areas of the country

221
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,280
and you have never met a barrister or a programmer or somebody who works in an environment that you

222
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,800
hope to aspire to one day, how do you have the imagination to first of all picture yourself there

223
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,920
and then actually work towards it? How does that happen? It's a big question and I try and tackle

224
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:32,680
it. And then there's another question which is often quite controversial and I get in trouble for

225
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,680
it. This is a country in particular. How many of you guys grew up in the UK? Just out of interest.

226
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Good. So those of you who grew up in the UK will recognize this instantly, perhaps less so the

227
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,960
ones who didn't, but you might recognize it now that you're living here more. This is a country

228
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,720
that is obsessed with a lot of things, but one of the things that it is really deeply obsessed with

229
00:24:50,440 --> 00:25:05,000
is accents. And how you speak and how you communicate can in so many ways determine whether

230
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,080
or not you will be successful in this country, despite what your qualifications show and despite

231
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,720
how competent you might be and despite how gifted you might be. I am not ashamed of saying it.

232
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,520
English is my third language. I didn't speak like this when I was growing up and my accent has

233
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,720
undoubtedly changed. I speak in different ways depending on different languages, depending on

234
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,360
who I'm talking to, depending on where I am and depending on what I'm trying to achieve.

235
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:43,320
That's the reality of understanding the world as it is rather than the world as you would like it to

236
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:50,440
be. And so if it occurs to you very early on in your life, it turns out that they say that

237
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,440
it's very hard for you to change your accent after the age of 25, so some of you it's too late,

238
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:04,600
so don't worry about it. If very early on it occurs to you that this is a fundamental issue

239
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,320
for example, not me saying this, but the statistics show that if you have a Scouser accent from

240
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:19,400
Liverpool, a Geordie accent from Newcastle or the Northeast, or a Brummy accent from Birmingham

241
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:27,320
and the Black Country, you will be significantly and disproportionately discriminated against.

242
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,000
28% of people believe that they have been discriminated against based on their accents,

243
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:42,760
and they are right because 80%, 80% of employers say they have discriminated against people

244
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,720
during interviews based on their accents. Now if you're faced with that kind of fact,

245
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,520
do you still keep your accent or do you change how you speak? I'll ask a different question.

246
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,040
How many of you still speak how you spoke when you were 15? Put your hand up.

247
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Exact same how you spoke when you were 15? Two people out of the rest of the other people who

248
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:17,160
are in this room. Sorry I didn't see if you guys might have said the same. Ish. For me,

249
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,040
if you still speak in that accent, I would argue that that suggests in some ways that you were

250
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,800
born into a particular accent that allows you to be able to keep it in one way or another.

251
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,600
It has to be. And those who say to you, oh you're changing and you're not being yourself,

252
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,880
you're being inauthentic, just be yourself, it's guff, it's nonsense. It sets you up for failure,

253
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:50,600
and I am not ashamed of saying so. You just got to read the book. Now the last thing I'd add is

254
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,040
there's a lot more about employment, what employers should be doing, how to improve

255
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,520
employment practices, and just generally about my reflections of how and where things are going.

256
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,120
I thought I'd read for you then a slight short bit in the book before we open it up to question

257
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:17,960
and answer. I've spoken for a bit longer. I hope this is not single use. I like it.

258
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,800
I'll read you this small passage here that just sort of encapsulates the book in a nutshell for

259
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,080
you so that when you are reading it you can kind of more or less know what it's about based on this

260
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,960
bit here. The reality remains that for a young refugee boy who buried his father at the age of

261
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,200
nine arrived in Britain without his mother and was brought up in poverty and among profound

262
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,320
deprivation. The chances that you would be writing a book like this one are minuscule,

263
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,280
not impossible, but highly improbable. In that context what politicians should really be saying

264
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,080
is this. The chance of you succeeding in Britain today is down to many factors. The wealth and

265
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,840
profession of your parents, the kind of school you attended, your mental and physical health,

266
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:14,120
and the quality of your early environment in terms of stability and attention. You'll need

267
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,880
to work harder than you have ever imagined and hope that whatever talents you have given the

268
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:26,360
fast-paced development of automation you are still going to be needed when you grow up.

269
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,960
You'll need a lot of luck as you go and let's hope that along the way someone explains to you the

270
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,800
unwritten rules of the world you want to join and you'll need to make it through all of that

271
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,160
with your belief in yourself and your vision in your future still intact and then

272
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,200
maybe you'll make it. It's a bit of a mouthful but it's certainly better than people that say

273
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,120
when we live in a meritocratic society. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

274
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,600
Maybe up to questions. I'm going to ask mine first for I'm selfish. Please wait until you have

275
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,480
the mic because it is needed for the video. So my question which I know the answer but I also

276
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,600
like to hear the detail behind it is so would a child arriving from a similar situation now to

277
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,240
Britain have a better experience than you or a worse experience? It's a very good question. A child

278
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:34,840
arriving today would almost certainly not have the best experience that they might have had when I

279
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:43,800
was growing up partly because things have hardened in society these days. I don't think we've become

280
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,760
more racist or more intolerant. I personally don't think we have. I think we've more or less been

281
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,200
as racist and as intolerant as normal. It's just we're more aware of it now because of social media

282
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,880
and all of the things that are out there. So in some ways I think it's harder because it's all in

283
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,240
your face and it can be quite demoralizing but I think your life is easier because now more than

284
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:14,360
ever we're more aware generally. Now that doesn't mean that we're more aware because people are

285
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,520
aware because they're kind of curious. I think we're more aware because the information is out

286
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:26,120
there. The the data is out there. The opportunities are out there. People are talking about this

287
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,080
issue. Everywhere I go everyone's talking about diversity and inclusion and diversity and all

288
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,480
this that and the other. Now I talk about the book how a lot of organizations are doing this in a very

289
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,840
cat-handed way and actually some of them are causing more damage than good but at least it's out there.

290
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,760
At least we're talking about it and I gave an interview to The Guardian or The Observer I can't

291
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,240
remember where I said in the book I said in that interview I said I wish I had a book like this

292
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,960
where I'm talking about what it feels like to be growing up lonely without information without

293
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:06,040
data without understanding how to sort out my homelessness situation without getting somebody

294
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:13,000
to help you with application form or how do you know just anything any sort of information out there

295
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
how do we find it so in a way things are worse because of the kind of climate that we're living

296
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,240
in but actually things are a lot better because of the fact that so much of this information now

297
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,800
is available to you in a way that it's never been before.

298
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,640
Hi thanks Hashi this is an incredible story a lot kind of resonates a little bit with

299
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:43,240
some of the stuff that I've got for I guess it's advice really so people like from my community

300
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,360
to come and say look you know how do I crack this puzzle of British society how do I and

301
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,440
then now you can say to them buy this book yeah yeah yeah and and what you've articulated really

302
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:05,720
well is is like the facts of life all right and so I struggle sometimes with like what I would

303
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,440
aspire the culture to be versus what the culture actually is and perhaps what my experience was

304
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:17,640
was perhaps not the experience that you absolutely will be having so I can give the experience that

305
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,880
so my question I suppose is like how do we you know give advice without being too cynical or too

306
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,280
you know perhaps it's changed yeah yeah yeah well I mean it's a very good question because

307
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,960
my experience growing up as a you know as a young black kid with a Muslim name is not going to be

308
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,880
the same as a young Asian kid growing up in in a city London in similar or worse set of

309
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,080
circumstances right and for me the best advice I tell them and and there is some cynicism in that

310
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:58,840
is that it's really really basic and it's really fundamental it is critical that you treat the

311
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,720
world as you find it rather than some utopia of what you hope it to be and the sort of

312
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:16,040
advice that people give especially in my profession that just be yourself you'll be fine it is such

313
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:24,120
poisonous crap that for somebody who doesn't have the information the wherewithal the understanding

314
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:32,360
the context the ability to actually question that it is such poison for you because what then

315
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,640
happens is that you be yourself without understanding that the world doesn't work like that and pretty

316
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,200
soon you get to a point where you're in conflict with yourself because when you realize that the

317
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,960
world doesn't accept you as you are where are you going to turn to because what you've been told to

318
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,920
believe is be yourself because the world is fair and you'll be fine because soon when you realize

319
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:01,000
that doesn't work but you still believe the world is fair then the logical conclusion is that the

320
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:09,240
world that is fair won't accept me for who I am and that's the trouble and so you have to be cynical

321
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,760
in the you have to understand that the world as it is rather than as we would like it to be

322
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,760
isn't the same thing but then the question then becomes when you do make it and when you do get

323
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,360
to the point where you are successful whatever success looks like for you it is important that

324
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:34,360
you tell a responsible story of your eyes and that's what I'd like to say I'm doing now is yeah

325
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,960
I knew my what I was worth I know what my talents are worth I knew that if I sat the same exams at

326
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,480
the bar school if I I knew if I did the same assessments when I was being interviewed to be

327
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,880
a barrister that I'd be as good as anyone else but what I didn't know was if I walk into a room

328
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,040
and one of the softer skills is that you know did you get to see Richard the Third's performance

329
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:06,200
last weekend or or or which is the the longest Shakespearean play it turns out it's Hamlet

330
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,880
and you don't have that kind of cultural capital that you didn't learn in inner city London that kind

331
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,680
of feel that people have in a profession like mine where we all do it's not just my profession

332
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,560
every profession people recruit in their own image you recruit with people like us

333
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,200
you recruit in a way of do I like this person can I work with this person dare I say it happens

334
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,880
right here and so when you realize that and you realize that it's not just about your grades

335
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,320
although that's a good start it's not just about your performance and competence

336
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,640
but it's a lot what what what sociologists call the homophily which is the idea of you

337
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,640
recruiting people who are just like you because you are effectively then creating a tribe once you

338
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,520
appreciate that that's the key and so the ideal world is I'd like to think for example just on

339
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:10,280
the point about accents of course I'd like to live in a world where people judge me based on

340
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,440
what I have to say rather than how I have to say it but when you realize that there is a deeper

341
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,080
social conditioning that means that what I have to say will basically become muted after the first

342
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,720
couple of words and they've heard you speak in a particular accent you'd be mad to ignore that

343
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:36,760
you'd be mad that's my view people might disagree but that's my view thank you so much for coming

344
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,480
and sharing your story with us it's fascinating and I mean your point it's I think it's a very good

345
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,280
point and I'm just struggling with it a little bit because I I've been here for just over a year

346
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,080
and I am a member of the Gaglars which is one of the ERGs as an employee group

347
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:01,480
and we work really hard as volunteers to make sure that people like me can come here and be themselves

348
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:11,160
and I've always felt that at Google I can be myself I am gay I'm Latino and I talk to people

349
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:18,760
at work about everything that I do about who I am he has a heaven accent and sometimes I feel

350
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,840
the accent thing and I agree with you and I work in the legal department I know that people like me

351
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,400
if they want to become baristas like yourself it would be much much harder but how not the

352
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,600
coffee makers yeah yeah exactly so my question to you is how how do you how do you change that I

353
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,880
mean if it is so difficult how do you change that because I I think it's a little bit unrealistic

354
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,080
to expect that we all try to become something else so that we can fit in no I completely agree

355
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,880
in the sense that it's not easy I talk about it in the book I say look there is a tension

356
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,800
there is a tension between saying you need to adapt to the set of circumstances you're in

357
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,960
to be able to get on and the tension on the other side of that is well how are we going to change

358
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,680
everything when we're all aspiring to join this mono culture which is true it's a very good point

359
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:24,600
I accept that but then the the attack in my judgment has to be twofold the attack has to be on an

360
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:31,720
individual basis and on a systematic basis on an individual basis I've made the choices that I've

361
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:39,480
made and I'm not suggesting that everyone else should and on a systematic basis I am putting

362
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:48,440
the the feet to the fire by talking about it the trouble with expecting an individual to go up

363
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:57,000
against the sister is that you will always lose the game is rigged and as an individual you will

364
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,040
lose but then if there is a critical mass of people like me and you who are then hopefully

365
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:13,000
sitting at the top table slowly but surely we will get some sort of progress it probably won't

366
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:20,280
happen in our lifetime but we will get there but the trouble of insisting that an individual remains

367
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,720
who they are is to pit two different you know individuals you're you're pitting an individual

368
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:35,160
a giant against a matchstick and the giant will always win and so I accept that there is that

369
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,920
tension of course there is but it's not reconcilable within our lifetime and that's the conclusion I've

370
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,320
come to and the the the final thing is that we won't be able to reconcile it within our lifetime

371
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:58,840
and the insistent that individuals be themselves with all that that comes with that is that you

372
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:06,520
end up dying dying what I consider what I say in the book you end up dying at the altar of authenticity

373
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,920
and it's not worth it

374
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I want to hear if you disagree with me I want to hear like come on man I want people who

375
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:25,240
disagree with me because I want to write in the next book I was interested to hear about luck

376
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,960
and accents do you feel like that's a particularly British construct because I grew up in Australia

377
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,720
a similar private schooling system I've spent a lot of time studying in Germany and Holland where

378
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,400
they don't have as much of that yeah if there was it does exist in Australia as well yeah no I mean

379
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,280
the Australian system is directly geared uh from the British system but you know in places like

380
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,240
Germany they're very very by comparison to me like you have to submit your like high school

381
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,680
grades when you go for a job they try to be as objective as possible if you were to say there's

382
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,920
like 200 countries in the world just for round sake where would you put the UK in terms of like

383
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:07,240
meritocratic I did a quiz last night turns out that the UN recognizes 193 countries but yeah

384
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,040
uh the UK the UK yeah yeah yeah no that's a very where would I put the UK that's a very good

385
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,480
very good question very good question I'll take that another question there and then the guy over

386
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,920
there and then I'll answer three of them together yes um you spoke about confidence

387
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,720
but I'm also interested in your take about motivation if it's ever a real thing actually

388
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,480
definitely and you mean the the ability to motivate yourself yeah correct especially

389
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,840
when things are extremely hard and if you have like concrete examples yeah and the other thing

390
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,240
is you spoke at the very beginning about um controversial things that you write and trolls and

391
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,800
like what is it about it's on Twitter just people who who write to me about especially on the accent

392
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,760
thing the accent thing is a big is a big problem for a lot of English people trust me uh right there

393
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,520
I'll take the last one on there so a motivation on there and accents in Australia and the question

394
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,800
about meritocracy in the world I'll come to that sorry thank you very much um this may be covered

395
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,920
in your book but my question is it was on was an aspiration like us as a society aspiring to be

396
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,320
better than who we are and I want to get your thoughts on that um kind of giving the fact

397
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,920
giving your argument around um I guess accepting the world as it is as opposed to as it should be

398
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,520
and if we are doing that aren't we setting ourselves up to just remain just as we are or

399
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,720
evolve slower I don't know very yeah so in other words if you accept the world as it is

400
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,160
does that limit your aspiration okay good question so just dealing with the question about accents

401
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,640
Australia uh and even americans some to some extent have borrowed a huge part of the the class

402
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:08,040
structures it just manifests itself in a different way um I'd slightly disagree with you in Germany

403
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,440
because Germany has got a similar issue in one sense because actually if you're from Bavaria

404
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,080
as opposed to another region of Germany there is a slight snobbery depending on which part of

405
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,560
Germany you're in so they have their own bits as well but you're right in the sense that you know

406
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,720
they are trying a little bit harder the only problem with the German education system and I've

407
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,520
been looking into this is that they make people choose very early on what they want to be so you

408
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,880
pretty much by the age of 14 15 you pretty much have to decide whether you want to go down the

409
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,960
vocational route or or a professional route at 15 I could barely speak much English so the idea

410
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,560
that my destiny could have been determined at the age of 15 you know yeah but you know what I mean

411
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,240
and in terms of there's there's all these different indexes about where the UK is on

412
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:02,840
this thing and it turns out that the UK and the US are right at the bottom right at the bottom

413
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:08,680
in that index of of of what it means to be socially mobile but having said that I gave an

414
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:16,680
interview to the Guardian my wife is Swedish and she always bangs on about how the Scandinavian

415
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:26,200
countries are are super meritocratic and that's also nonsense because because what you then what

416
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:33,160
you find is that the Swedish and especially Scandinavian countries like you know Denmark,

417
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:39,640
Norway and Sweden Finland is part of the Nordic countries it isn't Scandinavian they they spend

418
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:48,360
a huge amount of money on education and really training people early on and so they make sure

419
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,720
that by the time you get to 15 16 you have really made huge amount of progress in terms of basic

420
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:03,240
education but then when you look at what we call absolute mobility in other words are you doing

421
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,880
better than your parents when it comes to the kind of progress that you make Sweden isn't doing

422
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:18,680
that much better there's a really good book called The Sun Also Rises and it shows different

423
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:25,320
surnames it tracks social mobility through surnames and it shows that basically Sweden is owned by

424
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:33,960
about five families for a millennium and that has just meant that basically so in in absolute terms

425
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,120
they're trying to galvanize and push people up but in relative terms I really don't think that

426
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,760
Sweden is making that as much progress as people give them credit for I'll have to answer these guys

427
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,320
and I'll come back to you on the question of motivation it's a very difficult one if you're

428
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:55,240
sitting there working hard pushing yourself and then you have to get up in the morning and it's

429
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,840
raining and it's cold and you just want to be under your duvet it's not easy and motivation is a

430
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,360
lot is a something I looked into for the book and there's a there's a lot in there about what's often

431
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:15,320
described as instant gratification and delayed gratification so the idea that when I was growing

432
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,200
up you walk around the streets and all the guys with the nicest cars are the drug dealers or

433
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:26,120
whatever but you have to believe that you've got to go to this crap school and get the grades and

434
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,680
that one day I'll be something that's delayed gratification instant gratification is just like

435
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,320
get this why don't I just go there now and I can have that car and those nice trainers

436
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,400
which is not you know reality so for me what I argue is that you've got to find that motivation

437
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,240
for yourself wherever it comes from my own personal motivation was always that I just wanted better

438
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,560
than what I had I was just like I want to buy a house because we've never had our own place we've

439
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,280
always lived six to a room I was like I want to be able to buy whatever I want without ever asking

440
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,640
anyone and just work towards that you know I mean it was materialistic to begin with but

441
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,840
it's just that visceral feeling of being able to control more of your own life that has been that

442
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,480
huge motivation for me and I and I struggle with it even now you know sometimes we're all lazy we're

443
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,920
all bored and we're all like trying to find different ways to motivate ourselves trust me even the

444
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,200
most driven people have their moments so don't ever believe that again it goes back to that thing

445
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,600
about I dropped out of Harvard you know I started my thing in a garage it's complete nonsense we're

446
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,600
all facing our own deep challenges whatever that might be on the question of the of the challenge

447
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:45,000
and the tension between accepting the world as it is and to what extent and then does that limit

448
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,120
your aspiration my point about accepting the world as it is isn't necessarily linked to aspiration

449
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:59,640
it's simply a question of tools so whatever your aspiration is keep it there but don't expect

450
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:07,800
that the world is going to be kind to you generous to you nice to you and treat you in good faith

451
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,680
simply because you want to aspire to that aspiration what I'm saying is you have to accept

452
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,760
the world as it is because they're not going to judge you just based on your grades they're not

453
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,720
just going to judge you based on your raw talent they're not going to just judge you based on your

454
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,160
competence which is what people tell you right people tell you just study hard work hard do the

455
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,760
right thing and it will come together and what I'm saying is that's not true there's a lot more

456
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,680
deeper that you need to dig that doesn't mean lower your aspiration it just means that the

457
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,560
roots that you're going to take is going to be a lot more bumpier because you're realistic about

458
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,160
the world as it is rather than as you would like it to be which is more likely to treat you to a

459
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,520
sort of instant failure any other couple of questions before we wrap all these I've been

460
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,160
told I don't mind I've got time so if as long as you guys go got time I'm happy to take whatever

461
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,840
questions I'll take a few together thank you so much for sharing your story I'm really looking

462
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,000
forward to reading the book you said at the beginning that you ultimately you don't think

463
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,360
education is the key to social mobility yet you yourself are a prime example of somebody that

464
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,960
who's pursued chose to pursue higher education and whose ultimate career and where you are now

465
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,240
is a result of doubt of that so if it's not education and you know we're talking about young

466
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,120
people that maybe don't have parents who can give them the best advice what is the the key

467
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:38,920
very good question I'll very good question I'm really interested in your definition of success

468
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,720
and I am I my hunch is that that that and you know you just said about being able to buy what

469
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,120
you want and you know that kind of sits with very much within a capitalist idea of success

470
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,960
and how does that sit against happiness and yeah what is what is the measure of being

471
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,840
successful or making it as you refer to but lady there and then there's one more here I think yeah

472
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:07,240
so I'll I'll take those two and then I haven't forgotten no that's all right we can start there

473
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:17,880
and then go there I guess to I group you on the one hand where we have to conform but on the other

474
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:26,760
hand we have to also push like HR departments to have a different system where they're not looking

475
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,040
like maybe maybe they're not allowed to look at people or listen to people until they

476
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,080
make a certain judgment that allows those people to get to a certain degree so I just wouldn't

477
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,120
want to discount that but I totally agree with you what you're saying seems to fit in with yet

478
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,360
you've got to dress a certain way it's not just accents you've got to dress a certain way you've

479
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,520
got to it's your mannerisms it's all sorts of things and totally agree that you have to play the

480
00:51:52,520 --> 00:52:00,280
game to degree how do we best help children or you know children and teenagers yeah good question

481
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:09,240
I'll take that last one to the lady there just lady there you haven't yet mentioned like inclinations

482
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,600
we talked about motivation but I'm looking at from a slightly different perspective I work a lot with

483
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,640
children with cancer and teenagers with cancer who miss out on a load of school their lives they

484
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,000
can either they've had a lot of bad luck you talk about cycling against the wind and the wind being

485
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,040
behind you their choice when the wind is behind them sometimes they don't even want to be on the

486
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,360
bike like how do you instill that inclination to be hungry to look for the opportunities because

487
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,800
that fits with everything you're talking about because you still have to look for those opportunities

488
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,320
so how do you instill that and what you discuss in the book about yes a very good question that's

489
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,120
a very good question about inclination so just starting out with education what I'm trying to

490
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,320
say is that education is not the answer I'm not suggesting that it's not part of the answer but

491
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:53,960
it's not even the main answer I would argue simply because if we see education as even having this

492
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:59,560
relationship with social mobility in the way that politicians talk about it we're setting kids up for

493
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,480
failure what I'm saying instead is that education is just one of those life things like breathing

494
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:12,440
like sleeping like just peace whatever like just the kind of think of anything that is just a

495
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,800
standard thing that you do when you brush your teeth that's what education is the idea of constantly

496
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,880
obsessing over then linking it to people becoming more socially mobile is where I'm disagreeing

497
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,760
and and I talk about that and the other stuff that I talk about that comes with that is exactly

498
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,880
as I've sort of alluded to in the end you know the circumstances in which you're growing up in

499
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,400
the kind of aspirations you're exposed to by your parents the fact that you can have a decent

500
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,560
diet at home to be able to allow your brain to grow and not have anxiety and not have the

501
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:51,080
kind of jittery ways in which you're then going to develop issues later on in life the kind of

502
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:58,920
things about mentoring that allows you to the chapter on mentoring I is subtitled it's subtitled

503
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,280
filling in the blanks so if you don't know what you don't know having those people around you to

504
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,600
be able to show you language so there's loads of other things I argue that make up the bigger

505
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,120
social mobility story but this intense focus on education there was a famous uh Tony Blair

506
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,240
former prime minister's uh speech where he said education education education again that was a

507
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,480
classic example of putting the emphasis in my judgment in the wrong place that's what I mean

508
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,840
so I don't hope I don't want to undermine uh the purpose and need of education just plowing

509
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,200
through a few of the other questions on the question of what what it means to be successful

510
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,480
you have to define that for yourself and I do talk about that in the book I talk about

511
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:46,760
happiness I do talk about not necessarily seeking out the kind of happiness that means that you are

512
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,000
monetarily more happy but rather that you're you're happy and successful in the sense that

513
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,360
you have pursued what you're good at and what you're not so good at what you enjoy what you don't

514
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:04,760
enjoy and and the kind of things that allow you to grow as a human being now to ignore money would

515
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,640
be a folly to ignore money and and and income is just nonsense either it's nonsense or you've grown up

516
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:18,440
you know financially secure and independently wealthy to which extent it means nothing to you

517
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,960
but I say in the book if you're going to try to be for example a lawyer pick an area of law

518
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,960
if you're a socially mobile person pick an area of law that will allow you to earn a lot of money

519
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:34,760
why why get obsessed over human rights and I want to save the world when you've come from

520
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,640
a very poor set of circumstances in that area those areas of law you're not likely to make

521
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,120
much money and therefore not likely to transform the lives of your family whereas if you pick an

522
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,920
area that does give you a decent income then you can change your life you can change that don't be

523
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,600
ashamed of that there's no shame in that this shame is when you make it your sole central goal

524
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:02,520
finally on that it's really interesting how football i'm a big football fan is a huge meritocracy

525
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,440
if you think about it it's raw raw talent and it's no wonder that a lot of the people who make it

526
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,880
into it are just dirt poor dirt dirt poor most of them and then when you meet a lot of these kids

527
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,040
who are growing up in inner city london today ask the vast majority that most kids even if they're

528
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,920
growing up in nice circumstances want to be footballers but disproportionately poor kids

529
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,440
want to be footballers why because it's the first opportunity that they think they can have through

530
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,080
their own hard work to change their lives there is something there on the question of inclination

531
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,240
i'm not a scientist i don't know what instinctively occurs to people but i do talk about

532
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:49,080
how much your early life exposure can make a difference to your inclination

533
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:56,120
so for example if you're growing up in a household where every morning everyone's leaving for work

534
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,880
at six in the in the morning and getting up and having breakfast as opposed to what is often

535
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,920
pejoratively termed by different governments working up in how waking up in households where

536
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,600
the curtains are never drawn until midday i think that there is something there about an

537
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:19,320
inclination that happens on for a child very early on that then sets the tone for the rest of their

538
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,920
lives but if you're somebody facing cancer and lots of issues with cancer and problems like that

539
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,440
chances of your inclinations being quite there is very hard because you probably believe i don't know

540
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,560
but you probably believe and feel the life's giving you a pretty raw deal and so why are you

541
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,080
going to be more inclined to get up if you think i didn't deserve this and now i'm ridden with this

542
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:47,080
horrible disease that i have no control over so i haven't gone into too much detail but i do talk

543
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,880
about inclination to an extent on the final question i remember it briefly but you're gonna have to

544
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:01,640
just tell me one word and i'll it'll come to me the hr the hr it's a very good point so the hr

545
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,840
points is a really interesting one so we have to do more to help hr so i did i interviewed a lot of

546
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,600
hr people for this book and what was really fascinating was they said to me actually we had

547
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:19,000
this amazing young lady she was really talented she was so good but she had an sx accent we can't

548
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,800
put her she was you know what she said to me she said i'd love to hire her but i can't put her in

549
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:31,000
front of the clients so think about that you get to a point where you've managed to convince the

550
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,400
hr people to not judge somebody based on their mannerisms or the way they speak but then the next

551
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,200
another hurdle appears out of nowhere where she says but what are the clients going to say

552
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,840
i can't put her in front of the clients so then i say we need to move towards an environment where

553
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,160
if the hr department has decided this person's competent then you should be prepared to put

554
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,440
that person in front of the clients or tell your clients to take their business elsewhere now

555
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,360
what company's going to do that on their bottom line come on come on think about it no not many

556
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,920
companies are going to be prepared to take that hit right now but we're slowly moving in the right

557
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,880
direction and the point i'm making is that what i'm learning in this process of writing is that

558
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:21,480
every time we seem to find a solution we seem to hit our heads against a new problem that we may

559
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:26,440
or may not have noticed before that has always been there but has become to the forefront of

560
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:36,440
where it is anyway thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
