1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Thank you, David. Thanks very much. Can everybody hear me in the back? So I get to talk about

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,440
my trips, but you don't. It doesn't seem fair. So I'm going to just talk for about 10 minutes

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,540
and just tell you a little bit about what this book's about, and then I'd love to take

4
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:32,940
your questions and let your interests dictate the path that we take this afternoon. First,

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,100
thanks. Thank you very much for coming. This book is a real departure for me. Those of

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,460
you who know me as someone who writes about food might think it's a little weird that

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,140
I'm turning to psychedelics. But in my head, there is some continuity as well as change.

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,180
And the continuity is that I see my writing about food as part of a larger interest in

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,460
writing about nature. And the way we eat affects nature dramatically, more than anything

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,580
else we do, actually, in terms of changing the landscape of the planet and the atmosphere.

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,820
It's your most powerful engagement with the natural world. And I've always been interested

12
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,500
in that engagement. And we use nature and plants, especially for many things. Food is

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:26,020
an obvious one. Beauty is another. But something we almost all use plants for that I've always

14
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,700
been kind of curious about is to change consciousness. Most of us today probably use the plant to

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,700
change the contents of your mind, or at least the feeling tone in your mind, you know, whether

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,420
it was coffee or tea or a cigarette or cannabis or whatever it is. I mean, this is something

17
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,340
we do in every culture on earth, does it? With the one exception that proves the rule,

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,540
the Inuit do not have any plant drugs. But it's only because not even grow where they

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,420
live. As soon as they go somewhere else, they get with the program. So it's been a longstanding

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,460
interest. And to me, it's all part of that story about this fascinating engagement we

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,740
have with other species that defines us and reveals a lot about us. So I've, and I wrote

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,420
a little bit about cannabis and botany of desire. And I wrote a long piece about growing

23
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,060
opium in my garden back in the 90s. And I've written about medical marijuana. So I had

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,460
this interest. And then along comes this new research, which I began reading about. In

25
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:40,060
2010, I read about a really interesting odd study where researchers at NYU and Johns Hopkins

26
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,380
were giving psilocybin, this is the ingredient in magic mushrooms, they were synthesizing

27
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,500
it, to people who had cancer diagnoses, people very sick, many of them terminal, in the hopes

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,420
that they would have what they call the mystical experience, a powerful spiritual experience

29
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,100
that would change their attitude toward their death and help them essentially to die with

30
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,020
more peace. These were all patients who were struggling with depression, anxiety and fear,

31
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,420
profound fear. And the stories, so I started writing about that because it seemed like

32
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,380
the last thing I would want to do is trip when I was facing a terminal diagnosis to

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:26,540
lose control like that. And you would presumably have a very dark experience. So I started

34
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,020
interviewing these people for a piece I did in the New Yorker in 2015. And just to give

35
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,460
you one example to give you the flavor of it, I remember talking to this woman, she

36
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,900
was a figure skating instructor in New York, in Manhattan, she was about 60. She was not

37
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,060
a psychonaut, she'd never used psychedelics before. And she had ovarian cancer. And her

38
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,220
cancer had been treated successfully, but she was paralyzed by the fear of recurrence.

39
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,380
She just couldn't function because she thought any day now this could be back. So she entered

40
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:07,900
into this trial at NYU and had a high dose psilocybin experience. And I should explain how

41
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,300
this is done because the image you may have in your head of taking psychedelics, you know,

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,180
taking a handful of mushrooms and going to a concert or something, this is not how it is

43
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,420
used in a clinical setting. It's a very controlled experience, it's guided. So you work with two

44
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,180
guides, a man and a woman, they prepare you over a course of several sessions as to what

45
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,580
to expect. So they'll talk to you what to do if the experience becomes frightening, which it

46
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,540
often does, and how to navigate that. They call it the flight instructions. And their main

47
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,500
advice is, you know, if you see a staircase, go up it. If you see a door, open it. If you see a

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,460
monster, don't run away. Just step right up to it and say, what are you doing in my head? What

49
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,620
do you have to teach me? In other words, surrender to the experience. Trust, relax. You

50
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,060
know, they quote John Lennon, relax the mind and float downstream. And that's very important

51
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,300
advice. And it's often the difference between a good trip and a bad trip. A bad trip is

52
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,420
essentially a panic reaction against what's happening in your head, which is very heavy.

53
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:21,020
I mean, you're experiencing your ego dissolving, in fact, in front of you. And then they sit with

54
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,940
you for the whole experience, and they give you a helping hand if you're getting upset or

55
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,380
struggling, and they take you to the bathroom and give you a glass of water. And then afterwards

56
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,500
is a really key moment called the integration session, where they sit with you, you tell the

57
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,820
story of your trip. And it usually is this narrative. It's almost like this intracyclic

58
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,020
movie where you go different places, and you try to make sense of it and apply the lessons to

59
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:54,580
your life. So in the case of this woman, her name is Dina Bezer. She had this trip, and there were

60
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:01,260
many elements I won't go into. It was like six hours. And she went into her body, imaginatively,

61
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:07,420
and she saw this black mass under her ribcage. And that was her fear. It wasn't her cancer,

62
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,020
because that wasn't in the right place. But she saw what she realized was her fear. And she screamed

63
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,060
at her fear. And you have to see this woman. She's a very timid, small woman. And she said,

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:26,420
get the fuck out of my body. And it did. It disappeared. The black mask was gone. And afterwards,

65
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:33,140
she said, I realized during that experience that I can't control my cancer, but I can control my

66
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,820
fear. And that distinction meant everything to her. And one of the hallmarks of the psychedelic

67
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:45,460
experience is that whatever insights you have during it have a force, the likes of which you've

68
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,580
never experienced. These are not just opinions or insights that reveal truths. This is something

69
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,940
William James a long time ago writing about the mystical experience called the noetic sense.

70
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,380
It's a very uncanny thing. And it's what allows people to change that if they think, say they're

71
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,580
trying to quit smoking, and they have some epiphany that, gee, my breath is really precious,

72
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,860
I should not ruin it by smoking, suddenly that'll be so strongly held as a belief that they can

73
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,140
actually stop smoking. So anyway, so that's the kind of experience that I was learning about.

74
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,540
And I became fascinated to understand the neuroscience behind it, what's going on in the

75
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,820
brain when people are taking one of these trips. And we now know some interesting things about

76
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,780
that. If you're interested, I can talk about that. And also the history of it, like, what happened to

77
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:41,860
psychedelics in the 60s that they became so stigmatized that research stopped. There had been a

78
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,260
very productive period of research all through the 50s that was yielding really promising results

79
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,820
in the treatment of alcoholism, in dealing with people who were dying, depression, anxiety, obsession.

80
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:03,220
And then after this moral panic that hits the culture around 1965, nobody studies it anymore.

81
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,380
The funding dries up, scientists are a little embarrassed by it. And we had an unprecedented

82
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,740
situation where a promising line of scientific investigation was stopped. That never happens.

83
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,740
And we lost 30, 35 years of research into psychedelics. Thankfully, it's resuming.

84
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,220
And my book is very much about the Renaissance, even though I go back and look at the history and

85
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,820
figure out why we had this panic reaction about them. And try to look at them in a very matter

86
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,260
of fact way as interesting tools, interesting tools for understanding the mind and for healing

87
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,660
the mind. Now, we haven't proven all this. There's still more research to be done.

88
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,700
We're kind of in phase two, and there's three phases to FDA drug approval. But so far the

89
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,180
results have been remarkably encouraging. It is one of the most powerful psychiatric interventions

90
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,740
that the researchers have ever seen. And we're in a situation where mental health care is so

91
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,140
broken in this country. It's failing to reach half the people who need it. The last major

92
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,980
innovation were the SSRI antidepressants in the late 80s. There really hasn't been anything since

93
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:23,540
that. And so we need some new ways of thinking. And along comes this powerful old but new innovation.

94
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,180
And the research is, you know, it's being privately funded for the most part. Big

95
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,780
pharma is not interested in this. There's no intellectual property that you can control.

96
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,860
But a lot of donors, many in the tech community actually have stepped up and are funding this

97
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,780
research. And I was just at a fundraiser where, you know, the last seven million dollars was raised.

98
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:54,020
And so we will find out. We'll get the real test, the scientific test of what are these drugs good

99
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,500
for. And then there's the question of what are they, what value might they have for the rest of

100
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,140
us? Because they help people who have serious problems. But as one researcher put it to me,

101
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,740
they're very important for the betterment of well people. And I can talk a little bit about

102
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,940
that too. So as part of this, because it's sort of my brand to do immersion journalism, you know,

103
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,060
when I wrote about the cattle industry, I bought a steer. When I wanted to learn about architecture,

104
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,540
I built a house. So of course I had to experiment. And I found some guides underground. And there

105
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,740
is a thriving community of underground guides in America who could give me an experience very much

106
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,860
like the ones at NYU and Hopkins. And they were, you know, transformative experiences, some of them.

107
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,300
Some of the most meaningful experiences of my life. And the idea that a molecule could occasion

108
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,300
that is to me still kind of mind blowing. So I'm going to, though, I've given you lots of leads

109
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,980
and things you might want to follow up on. And I'm happy to talk about anything. I advise you

110
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:07,380
not to talk about your own experiences. I want to welcome the Google Microdosing Club to today's event.

111
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:21,300
Anyway, so yeah, question. Alright, so I don't want to be the devil's advocate here.

112
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,420
Please do. This idea that we're going to, we're going to give somebody this drug,

113
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,300
they're going to have this transformative experience, and then it's going to change them.

114
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,140
I understand how that makes sense to me. But the idea that that change would necessarily be

115
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,140
for the better, that person comes back from a trip and decides they're going to quit smoking,

116
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,700
that's great. But why doesn't a person come back from a trip and decide they need to kill their

117
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:55,060
neighbor? Right. How do we break the symmetry there? Set and setting. So one of the important

118
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,140
features of psychedelics is how little the experience is foreordained or dictated by

119
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:07,780
the drug itself. The drug is like an unspecific mental amplifier. And so your expectation and

120
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,580
intention is very important to what happens. And one of the things that happens in the preparation

121
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,860
is that the guide is helping you set an intention. Like I want to quit smoking. I want to confront my

122
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:26,180
mortality. And you will usually have an experience in that realm because that's what you've been

123
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:35,380
primed to have. Could the drugs be used for evil? Well, we have the case of Charles Manson. Manson

124
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,820
apparently, we don't know that all the details, but used LSD on his little posse of what would

125
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:50,500
become murderers. And the drugs are incredibly suggestible and that you could imagine a charismatic

126
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,620
figure using them that way. Now, the CIA sought to use them that way too. The CIA had a very active

127
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,260
research program in the 50s. The same time all this university work was going on in the 50s to

128
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,460
help people, the CIA was trying to weaponize LSD and psilocybin. And they thought they went through

129
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,660
a series of different paradigms. One was you would use it as a truth serum. People could tell you

130
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,940
the truth if you gave it to them in interrogation. People said crazy shit. It didn't work. There

131
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,860
was no truth in that. And then they thought, well, we could use it to have foreign leaders. We could

132
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,260
dose them and they would do embarrassing things. That might work. I don't know. And we don't know

133
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,660
how far they got with it. And then the other one was his mind control, right? That you could use

134
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,100
this drug to control people's minds. As far as we know, that didn't work either, but we don't know

135
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:52,500
for sure. And we shouldn't put too much by them. So I think it all depends on your therapist and

136
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:01,540
how the situation is. People don't generally have violent episodes after psychedelics. In general,

137
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:07,140
the experience tends to be one where you discover that love is the most important thing in the

138
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,980
universe. And this hallmark card platitudes suddenly becomes this profundity. And it is a

139
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,620
profundity, but we've heard it so many times that it's banal. There's an interesting line between

140
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:27,060
the banal and the profound. And psychedelics definitely worked on that line. So I think

141
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,940
we should be mindful of that possibility, but I don't think we certainly haven't seen anything

142
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,300
like that. There have been a thousand dosings of volunteers since this next, this new wave of

143
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,380
research. And there has not been a single adverse event. No psychotic breaks, no jumping out of

144
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,220
windows. But there's no question that people can do stupid things on psychedelics as they can on

145
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:58,420
alcohol and any number of other drugs. So thanks for your question. Do you have any theories of why

146
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,900
our brains are wired to react to things from plants and fungi? And are there any things from the

147
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,820
animal kingdom that do the same thing? Well, animals do like plant drugs also. We have many cases of,

148
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,500
I mean, if you've had a cat, never given them catnip. No, I meant like any venoms that... Oh,

149
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,140
yeah. Well, one of the psychedelics I experimented with is something called Five-Meo-DMT. This is

150
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,860
a pretty obscure psychedelic. I see a couple of nods in the crowd that... Actually, only one.

151
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,820
That is the smoked venom of the Sonoran Desert Toad. Somebody figured that out, right? I mean,

152
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:51,860
what a species, huh? But why are we wired for this is a really interesting question. So the way the

153
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:00,180
drugs appear to work in the mind is that they bind to your serotonin, one particular serotonin

154
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,300
receptor that's very common in the cortex. And they start a cascade of effects. That's what

155
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,460
neuroscientists say when they really don't know what's happening for a while. But that that in

156
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:18,180
turn eventually down-regulates something called the default mode network. I'll tell you what that

157
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,620
is because it's very important, actually, and it explains a lot. So when they first started doing

158
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,140
fMRI imaging of people's brains on psychedelics, they would basically inject you with psilocybin

159
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,700
and slide you into the MRI machine, and you'd have what could be a very scary experience.

160
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,860
And then they took these pictures, and they expected to see lots of extra activity because

161
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,300
there's such fireworks in the experience. But they were very surprised to find that, in fact,

162
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,180
this particular network went quiet. And this is a network that's very active when you're not on task,

163
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,740
okay? It's in a seesaw relationship with the attentional networks when you're like working or

164
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,380
something like that. But when you're asked to just lie back in an MRI machine and they're trying to

165
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:07,140
get a baseline, this lights up. And they were like, why is that? What is it doing? Well, this appears

166
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,700
to be the part of your brain that is active when you're mind wandering, when you're ruminating or

167
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,700
worrying or reflecting on yourself. It's a center of self-reflection. It's also involved in time

168
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,780
travel, the ability to think about the future or the past. And it's involved in theory of mind.

169
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,860
This is the term for the ability to think about the mental states of other people,

170
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,420
central to compassion and imagination, things like that. And lastly, it's involved in something

171
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:43,620
called the narrative self or experiential self. And this is kind of where you knit together what

172
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,460
happens to you at any given moment with the story of who you are, based on who you've been and who

173
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,500
you want to be. And it's kind of where we sustain that story that our sense of self depends on.

174
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,260
And so this network, so if the ego has an address, it's in the default mode network.

175
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:13,300
This is what the research shows. It's really interesting that this is what gets down-regulated

176
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,900
during the experience. And it chimes with the experience of ego dissolution people report

177
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,980
on a high-dose experience. I had an experience on a guided psilocybin trip where I felt my

178
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,660
sense of self scattered to the wind like a blizzard of post-its. And then I looked out,

179
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,980
and I don't know, who's the eye who's looking out at this? I mean, there was a split in consciousness

180
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,260
where I could watch myself then get spread over the landscape like a coat of paint out there.

181
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,500
And I was fine with it. This other self was fine with it. And it was this kind of very

182
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:53,700
unperturbable consciousness that could behold this thing. And I realized I'm not identical to my ego.

183
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:01,060
And that's a very important insight to acquire, I think, and very useful. But what was going on

184
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,540
in my brain was the default mode network was going offline for a period of time.

185
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,620
The sense of self dissolves. And then something else happens, which is other networks in the brain,

186
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,660
which normally would only communicate through this hub, start talking directly to each other.

187
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,540
And there's a map in the book of the brain on a placebo and the brain on psilocybin.

188
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,860
And one looks like the root map of American Airlines. And the other looks like the root map

189
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:33,300
of some little commuter line that only goes to 10 places. So new connections form. And what are

190
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:39,940
those new connections? I mean, that's the interesting question. Is that your, say, your hippocampus

191
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,180
talking to your visual cortex? And so you start having images of things that you fear or desire?

192
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,500
Is it the basis of hallucination? Or is it perhaps the basis of a new metaphor or new insight

193
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,340
or new meme? We don't know yet. That's the next step is to really understand that. So these are

194
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,300
temporary changes in the brain. Eventually your ego kind of reconsolidates. But having had a glimpse

195
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:12,340
of that other way to behold experience is very powerful. And in my integration session, I said

196
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,020
to Mary, who was my guide, I said, well, okay, I've had this amazing experience of ego dissolution.

197
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,020
And I realized I'm not identical to my ego. I can have a little distance on it.

198
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,100
But I said, my ego is back in uniform and on patrol. So what good is that? And she said,

199
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,860
well, basically, you've had a taste of another way to react to life, a little less defensive,

200
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,020
a little less trigger happy, and you can cultivate that. And I said, how? And she said, through

201
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,140
meditation. And meditation is kind of how you keep alive the psychedelic experience. It makes

202
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,460
you a very good meditator. Although I know you're not supposed to say good or bad meditator.

203
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,820
But being trapped in that language. So that's kind of a real shorthand of what we understand

204
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,660
about the neuroscience. The neuroscientific investigation of this phenomenon is absolutely

205
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,780
fascinating. And for me, that chapter of the book was the most challenging to write. Well,

206
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,620
not the most challenging, but one of the most challenging and fascinating to learn about.

207
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:21,780
So thanks for your question. Hi. So I have heard rumors that monks have been able to achieve

208
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:30,740
similar thing to a psychedelic trip. Do you know anything about what that entails? Or if there's

209
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:37,380
any research that leads to it being a strong? I mean, there's anecdotal research that's really

210
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,620
interesting. So one very relevant fact, at the same time we were doing this imaging work on

211
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,540
psilocybin in the human brain, there was another researcher at Yale, imaging the brains of very

212
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,060
experienced meditators, people who had 10,000 hours of meditation experience, and they would go

213
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:02,340
into the fMRI and meditate. And their brains looked identical. They also had this suppression

214
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,180
of the default mode network. And of course, that is the state of kind of selflessness that people

215
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:14,820
report coming out of meditation. In terms of the monks, these are people with really long

216
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,060
experience meditation, meditation, and that they can almost it will probably quiet the default

217
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,740
mode network. There's a famous story about Ram Das, Richard Alpert, who was Timothy Leary's

218
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,460
collaborator, went during the Harvard psilocybin project in the early 60s. This guy went on to

219
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,500
become a guru, basically. And he's still alive. He's in Hawaii. And he was very interested in

220
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,060
psychedelics and then found Hindu religion. And he went to India and he told his guru about LSD.

221
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,500
And his guru said, I want to try it. I want to see what happens because you're telling me you're

222
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:01,380
reaching this spiritual plane on this drug and that's my territory. And so Ram Das apparently gave

223
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,980
him 600 micrograms of LSD, which is a beyond heroic dose. And that's what the guy wanted. He said,

224
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:16,020
give me as much as you have. And the monk, or whatever he is, he's a guru, I guess, takes it.

225
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:23,860
And so nothing happened. Is this true? I mean, it's, you know, Ram Das tells the story and

226
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,500
swears that it's true. But it goes to your point. There are other ways to achieve the same effect.

227
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,220
Psychedelics are probably a shortcut to becoming a really good meditator. But my guess is we will

228
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,860
find at some point that all the disciplines, the spiritual disciplines that share this sense of

229
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:51,940
of transcending the ego are doing the same thing in the brain, that that is where that's

230
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,900
happening. And I'm thinking of sensory deprivation, you know, if you get into these tanks, sensory

231
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:04,260
deprivation tanks, they're sort of coming back. They were a thing in the 60s, or fasting, or prayer,

232
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,220
or the right kind of music and breathing exercises. One of the psychedelic trips I had

233
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,380
involved no drugs, something called holotropic breathwork. It's based on a yogic breathing

234
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,220
exercise where you essentially hyperventilate. You breathe really fast, you exhale more than you

235
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:28,660
inhale, and you enter a trance state. It's the most uncanny thing. And my guess is that

236
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,460
hyperventilation is starving the default mode network of oxygen, and reducing the activity

237
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,060
there. So this is all areas to be explored. We may find other ways to achieve the same thing.

238
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,420
But I think it's all connected. Thank you so much. Thank you.

239
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,540
Hi. One of the interesting trends that I've read about on blogs and whatnot is the rise of

240
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:57,780
microdosing. For those who don't know, microdosing is taking small doses of psychedelics on a

241
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,180
somewhat regular basis, far too small to actually cause any sort of trip. And proponents of microdosing

242
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,580
claim that it can help with things such as depression and anxiety, improve mood, improve

243
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,900
creativity. I'm wondering if you've got a chance to investigate microdosing at all in your book.

244
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,660
And if you get a sense that some of the renewed research interest for

245
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,980
high dose experience might carry over into researching whether microdosing is clinically

246
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:27,460
significant or not. Excellent question. So microdosing is a very interesting phenomenon.

247
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,700
As the questioner said, it's taking a subperceptual dose, often with LSD,

248
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,180
about 10 micrograms every third or fourth day. And the reason you don't take it every day is

249
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,820
because it would lose its effect. The drugs kind of cancel themselves out at a certain point.

250
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,460
Many people anecdotally report success with this, that it's kind of a brain tonic,

251
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,340
and it does help with depression. There's a wonderful book written about it,

252
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,220
if you want to follow up, by Ayelet Waldman called A Really Good Day. And she's someone who's

253
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:02,100
struggled with depression for many years and found more relief on this regime of microdosing,

254
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,900
and she's been through the whole pharmacopoeia, I'm sure. The reason I don't spend a lot of time

255
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,500
on it in the book is that there isn't yet anything beyond the anecdotal reports. They're

256
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:20,260
interesting, they're really provocative, and they're being systematically connected. If you go online,

257
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,580
there's a guy named James Fadiman, who is one of the first generation researchers,

258
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,460
who's advising people on the protocol and soliciting reports and getting this interesting

259
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:37,620
dataset. But it has not been trialed the way the large dose psilocybin has. I hear that these

260
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,740
trials are about to happen, and so we may get some really solid information on whether microdosing

261
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,260
works. The fact is, though, there is such a strong placebo effect with psychedelics.

262
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,820
They're so suggestible that it's very easy to see how it would work. Just the very idea that

263
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,540
you're taking a small dose of LSD probably would have an effect. But is it a pharmacological effect

264
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:09,780
or a placebo effect? That's what remains to be learned. I'm skeptical about it. I do want the

265
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:16,820
research to happen, and this interest in macrodosing, if you will, has stimulated people to fund some

266
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,940
research, some of which will be underground and some of which will be above ground. So I'm very

267
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:29,780
excited to see what they come up with. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks for being here today. Wozniak

268
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,260
pretty famously said that LSD was one of the things that differentiated Apple from Microsoft.

269
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,900
Yeah. I think Job said that too. And at this organization, we selected, apocryphally,

270
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,700
Eric Schmidt, a CEO because he was the candidate that been to Burning Man.

271
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,380
As an external observer, I'm curious, what are your observations about the intersection between

272
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,300
psychedelics and the technology or the tech industry? It's a really interesting relationship.

273
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,420
So Steve Jobs famously said too, it had been formative to his intellectual development. And I

274
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,420
thought it was him, but maybe it was Wozniak who said that Windows would have been a much better

275
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:11,380
product had Gates ever taken LSD. It was like a really mean thing to say. I think Gates immediately

276
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,780
said, but I did, but I did. But it didn't work. It must not have been enough.

277
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,940
And I thought this was the beginning of the tech community's interest in these drugs.

278
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,860
And because it's very current, I mean, you know better than I, but I mean, I've talked to lots

279
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,420
of people in Silicon Valley and it's a big part of the culture right now. Microdosing,

280
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,540
macro dosing, there's, I mean, I know one prominent tech company that uses it in their

281
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,460
management training, you know, LSD. So it's, there's a lot of, you know,

282
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,060
a lot of interest there. And it is the tech community, as I said, that's funding a lot of

283
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:58,500
this research. But it turns out that engineers have been interested in LSD back in the 50s.

284
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,100
And that there's this very interesting episode before Timothy Leary and the whole 60s psychedelic

285
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,420
story that we think we know so well. There was this research period. And there was this very

286
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,980
interesting character who's kind of a counterpart to Leary named Al Hubbard. And I tell his story

287
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,180
in the book. He's a very mysterious figure. He's got, he's involved with the OSS, which became the

288
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:30,020
CIA. He's playing both sides of many worlds. But he had a vision in 1951 that told him he could be

289
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:36,420
involved in a major civilization change. He realized it was LSD. He went to Sando's where,

290
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,220
which owned the patent on it. It was a Swiss pharmaceutical company, persuaded them to give

291
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:49,700
him something like a liter bottle of LSD, which probably is enough to trip a third of the population

292
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,060
of earth at that point. I mean, just an incredible amount, which he keeps buried in Death Valley at

293
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,100
his place. And anyway, he's a great character. He's so much more interesting than Leary. So he's,

294
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,820
he becomes the Johnny Apple seed of LSD. And, but he's got a different theory. He said,

295
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,420
he was kind of a conservative guy. He wanted to turn on the elite. So he was going to do captains

296
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:18,100
of industry, you know, engineers, artists, people in the church, the Catholic church.

297
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,620
And he would go around with the satchel tripping people. Remember, it was legal then. And he became

298
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:30,820
a very gifted guide. So he has his eye on the tech world as one of the places where you could

299
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:37,780
have this multiplier effect. So he turns on a couple of engineers who are working at a company

300
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,100
called Ampex, which is actually one of the first Silicon Valley companies in the 50s.

301
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,420
They make magnetic tape on which, as you know, all computer information was stored,

302
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,780
but also video and sound recording. They had 40,000 people in the valley before it was called

303
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:58,660
Silicon Valley. And, and the head of strategic planning, he turned on another guy and actually

304
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,140
Ampex for a while was going to be the world's first psychedelic company. And, but the, the president

305
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,420
was Jewish and Al Hubbard was Catholic and he kept bringing in crucifixes and things and the

306
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:17,220
president said, go away. And so, but anyway, so these engineers though were so taken with this

307
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:24,180
experience that they left the company, a group of three or four engineers and started a big research,

308
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:31,780
something called the International Foundation for Advanced Research. And they were doing a lot of

309
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,580
psychedelic research. And I've always been interested as to why engineers in particular

310
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,860
had such a strong reaction to this drug. And I talked to, I talked to a couple engineers about

311
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,380
and you can tell me if this chimes with your sense of things. But this guy, this one guy in

312
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:53,700
particular told me that, oh, and the, some of the early chip designers were into LSD. It's very

313
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,100
hard to design a chip without a computer. But of course, at the beginning you had to. And you

314
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:06,100
could hold this complex 3D structure in your head with the help of the drug. And this guy said, oh,

315
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,860
and one of the, sorry, one of the early people at the International Foundation for Advanced

316
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,260
Study who was tripped was someone you probably know, if you know your history of your industry,

317
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:21,780
but a Doug Engelbart, right, who invented, you know, the mouse and the interface and email and

318
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,540
like everything, right? There was this mother of all demos. Well, that guy got LSD from those

319
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:33,940
Ampex guys. And under the influence, they were doing a creativity study. He invented something then.

320
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,580
It wasn't that profound. It was something he called a tinkle toy to toiletrain boys and was

321
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,660
something you could like aim a stream of urine at and it would make things happen. Okay, it's not

322
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:55,460
quite the, you know, the mouse, but it was pretty cool. But it primed the pump, you know. So anyway,

323
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,300
where was I? So this engineer was talking to you said, well, the problem, if you're an engineer,

324
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,900
as opposed to a scientist, scientists can like their goal is to reduce problems to the simplest

325
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,060
terms. But engineers are faced with an irreducible complexity and number of variables. So the

326
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:19,220
challenge is different. The challenge becomes finding pattern. And psychedelics, one of the

327
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,300
things that happens is you find pattern where you didn't see it before. And that he thought was why

328
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:31,060
so many engineers found this a useful tool. I think that's fascinating. I think there's,

329
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:37,380
John Markham wrote an interesting history about Silicon Valley and the 60s. And there's some

330
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:44,580
very good stuff on on drugs. And he interviewed jobs about his experience. But yeah, it's part

331
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:53,140
of the tradition you're in. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Hi. So you talked a little bit about

332
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,860
how like every culture in the world has experienced this to some degree or is integrated into their

333
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,020
their culture. And I'm curious from a sort of anthropological perspective, because I imagine

334
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:08,260
there's a huge range in the way that that these drugs are applied, right? It's a select few or

335
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,980
it's open to everyone or it's ritualistic or it's ordinary or whatever. Are there other sort of

336
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:20,180
cultural patterns that can be deduced or associated and, you know, from from drug use within those

337
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,260
it's a good question. I actually think we have a lot to learn from the traditional use of these

338
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,620
drugs. So we're going to stay on psychedelics. And there are lots of plant drugs that are not

339
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,660
that controversial like caffeine, although in some cultures they might be. But psychedelics have been

340
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:41,460
used for it looks like several thousand years. It appears that the ancient Greeks, all the writers

341
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,300
you've heard of participated in an annual ritual that involved what seems to be a psychedelic.

342
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,700
It was called the Kikion. It was an annual rite in honor of Demeter, harvest related.

343
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:01,620
It was called the Eleusinian Mysteries. And everybody was sworn to secrecy about this.

344
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,220
So we don't know that much about it. But everybody took this potion and went to the underworld,

345
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:12,340
had experiences of a beyond and it was very profound. And it was the only time you were ever

346
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,020
allowed to take this drug. We don't know what the drug was. And in fact, one person was caught

347
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,380
using the drug at like a party and, you know, was, you know, imprisoned or killed or something.

348
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:31,300
It was a big crime. The lesson I think the takeaway from lots of traditional cultures use

349
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,740
is that they recognize that these were very powerful medicines not to be treated casually.

350
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,260
And that they all surrounded the use of their plant medicine, as they often call it,

351
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,900
with ritual, ceremony, elders in attendance. It was never careless. It was never casual.

352
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,180
It was never recreational. It was a profound experience. And I think when the drugs hit the

353
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:05,860
West, beginning in the late fifties, early sixties, we didn't have any container for them.

354
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,140
We didn't have rituals. We just kind of like took a handful of mushrooms and went to a concert

355
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:18,100
or we drank LSD from the punch bowl. And I think that's why some people really got in trouble.

356
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,500
And so that the lesson that we failed to learn was that, yes, these drugs have an ancient lineage,

357
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,740
but look how they were used. Look at what those cultures learned by trial and error.

358
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,660
And now we see it in shamanic ceremonies in South America. There were mushroom cults in Mexico

359
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:42,100
that went back, we don't know how long, but at least a thousand years. But they were always taken

360
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:50,420
in a group with guidance, with someone who wasn't taking the drugs, and with enormous care. And

361
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,140
I think that's what we lost. And we need to now invent that container for ourselves. Maybe it's

362
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,100
this therapeutic protocol I'm describing. I'm not sure. But that's the cultural work that needs to

363
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:11,700
be done. So thank you. Sure. I was wondering whether in your research, you'd come across the video

364
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:22,340
of a debate from 1967 between Timothy Leary and Jerome Lethvin at MIT. No, Jerome Lethvin.

365
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,060
For those who don't recognize the name, Jerome Lethvin was one of the pioneers of neuroscience.

366
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:37,060
He was one of the four authors of one of the first papers on the physiology of perception

367
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:44,340
titled What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain. And he was also one of the most charismatic

368
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:54,100
professors at MIT in the 1960s. And they held this debate sometime in 1967. And Leary went first and

369
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:03,220
he had the whole audience lulled into going along. He was very charismatic. And Lethvin got up and

370
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,660
said, bullshit. I think it may have been the first time bullshit was allowed to be said on

371
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:20,820
broadcast television. Anyway, Lethvin's biggest argument against taking LSD was the phenomenon

372
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,380
of uncontrolled flashbacks and how that could get people into trouble. But as I was standing

373
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:34,740
in line here, I looked it up and it's on YouTube. The whole thing actually ran about two hours.

374
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:42,420
WGBH, public TV station, recorded it and broadcast it at a one hour edited version.

375
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:50,180
So Lethvin, L-E-T-V-I-N? Yes. Maybe one or two teas. Well, this is a good occasion to talk about

376
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:57,620
risk. So let me, unless you want to frame the question, but I'd love to. I'll let you talk

377
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:03,700
about it, but I just wanted to ask one more side question. When you talk about food, you almost

378
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,620
always bring a bag of groceries. Yeah, oh yeah. I was wondering if you brought a bag with you.

379
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:22,420
Let me tell you a little tutorial on the law. So I was a very nervous Nellie doing these

380
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,340
experiences. I didn't have a lot of experience with psychedelics in college. And even after,

381
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,100
I was really too afraid to take these drugs. I didn't think I was psychologically sturdy enough

382
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:38,900
at that point in my life. And so before I dove in for this project, I did a lot of research

383
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,500
as I want to do as a journalist to figure out, well, what are the dangers? Because there are

384
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,300
lots of stories you heard in the 60s. People staring at the sun to let go blind. That was one

385
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,620
story, scrambling of your chromosomes. Both those stories, by the way, were, one was made up. The

386
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,500
first was made up and that's been proven. And the chromosome story was withdrawn within months.

387
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,060
It was just really bad research. Psychotic breaks and that did happen sometimes. There are people

388
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,940
at risk for schizophrenia that an acid trip was what tripped them off. But a lot of what was,

389
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,340
well, let me divide it into two. There's physiological risk and there's psychological

390
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:27,780
risk. On the physiological side, it's stunning how, I don't want to overstate this, but that how,

391
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,620
compared to other drugs that we take routinely, how non-toxic, relatively non-toxic, classic

392
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:41,860
psychedelics are. And I'm talking about LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline. There is no known

393
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:48,900
lethal dose, which you can't say about over-the-counter drugs you take for a cold or for pain.

394
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,820
There are very few molecules in your brain that are washed out really quickly and they don't seem

395
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,340
to affect the, you know, they affect your brain and they don't affect other parts. If you have a

396
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,660
panic attack, your blood pressure is going to go up, but they don't directly affect other systems.

397
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,140
That's one thing. And they're also non-addictive. The first thought you have upon finishing a

398
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,460
psychedelic trip is like, when can I do that again? It's actually, do I ever have to do that again?

399
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,540
And because it's really intense and they're, so they're not habit forming. If you give the rat,

400
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,260
in that experiment where the rat has two levers, one's cocaine and one's

401
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,380
food and if you press it the lever, he gets a dose of cocaine and they'll press it till they die

402
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,820
over and over and over again. You put LSD in that contraption, they'll press it once and never again.

403
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:47,380
I mean, imagine being a rat on LSD. So from the physiological point of view,

404
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,380
they're safer than a lot of drugs we take routinely. And I was surprised to learn that,

405
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,020
frankly. Psychologically, you know, it's very hard to sort through the stories.

406
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:04,740
The flashback phenomenon, which I've heard reported, I have never found any really good

407
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,100
research on it. And I'm still looking for it. If anybody has a good paper on that, I'd love to see

408
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:17,380
it. There are, you know, I've had, I've kind of flashed on things that happened in my experience

409
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:23,220
because they're part of my store of psychic, powerful psychic memories. Is that a flashback?

410
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:28,980
I don't think so because I can get it out of my head. But there are people who have these unbidden

411
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,620
moments of consciousness that are, that, you know, may be connected to what happened to them.

412
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:43,700
I haven't heard that they interfere with people's life or mental health. But it's a question mark.

413
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,820
The great danger is the danger you have drinking too much also, which is doing stupid things,

414
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,820
walking into traffic, falling. All that happens on psychedelics as it happens with any powerful

415
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,740
drug. And that's why a guide is really important, somebody to look out for your body. In the

416
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:08,660
studies that have gone on, there have now been a thousand dosings of people who have been screened

417
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,420
for mental health problems and things like that. And there has not been a single serious adverse

418
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:20,420
event. So are there adverse events when people use the drugs recreationally? Yes, we all know

419
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,820
people who've had really bad trips and they usually stopped using it at that point, felt trapped,

420
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:33,940
had panic reactions. But often psychiatrists who didn't know this territory would misinterpret

421
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,300
a panic reaction as a psychotic break because it sure looks like that. You're having delusions,

422
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,820
you're hearing voices, you know, I mean, to an average psychiatrist, this would say psychosis.

423
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:51,220
But often it was a panic attack. I interviewed Andrew Weil, Dr. Andrew Weil about this. And he

424
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,180
was very interested in psychedelics in the 60s. He was at Harvard and Lyria was there. And when he

425
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,940
graduated from medical school in 1968, he went out to San Francisco and volunteered at the Haid

426
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:08,420
Ashbury Free Clinic. And they were seeing lots of LSD casualties as they call people coming in,

427
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,540
having bad trips, thinking they're losing their mind or they're dying. And he knew the territory

428
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,620
really well, having used a lot of psychedelics. And he would come into the little cubicle with

429
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:23,060
somebody who was completely freaking out. And he had on his white coat and his stethoscope and his

430
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,460
clipboard and he'd ask a few questions. Then he'd say to the person, well, excuse me, there's someone

431
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,100
in the next room who's really in trouble. And he'd leave. And they were like, wow, someone's more

432
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:39,460
fucked up than I am. And they would suddenly feel fine. They would just completely subside. So

433
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,340
suggestibility is a very big part of the experience. Yeah.

434
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,220
Thank you very much for coming to talk to us today.

435
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:56,740
Oh, thank you. Thanks for your great question. Thank you.
