0	11280	Thank you very much for coming. I will tell you a little bit about me and how effectively
11280	17840	the book came about in the first instance. Then I will touch upon the themes of the book,
17840	24160	which have been, if you've been following the press, quite provocative and controversial.
24160	29400	I know what it feels like to be chased by trolls on Twitter now. I will be very keen
29400	35120	on finding out whether there are some real life trolls here today. Then thirdly, I want
35120	39720	to just sort of get your thoughts from your own experiences because what I have found
39720	45560	is that in writing this book that there's a lot of what I'm saying that resonates for
45560	49200	a lot of people no matter where they've come from and no matter what kind of life experience
49200	54480	you've had. So that's essentially what I hope to do in the first sort of 25 minutes
54480	61200	and then we can open it up and then I will gladly sign your book as well afterwards.
61200	70000	So a little bit about me. I was born in Kenya to Somali parents and we were growing up in
70000	79880	a semi-slum called Isli in Nairobi and my parents met in Kenya about late 1980 and my
79880	89640	mother, bless her, has given birth to 12 children. So I'm number eight in that long list. I was
89640	96040	glad she didn't stop after number seven, but I wish she did after number eight and she
96040	101200	had got married and had the first six children with her first husband and the second six
101200	107360	children with my father and one of my younger siblings had died when he was very, very small.
107360	114720	And so they met in Kenya where they were living throughout the 80s when I was growing up there.
114720	122520	And roughly sort of when the war broke out in 1991-92 in Somalia, so many of my family
122520	129280	had moved over to Kenya seeking sort of some sort of refuge and help and it was roughly
129280	137120	around the time when the Dodab refugee camp had opened up in Kenya. And for my father,
137120	142120	we were always now settled in Kenya where he had lived and he had started his life and
142120	147480	had established himself and we were going to stay there, certainly his children and my
147520	153880	mother. And what was interesting about that was that I was the first person in my whole
153880	159680	family's history to be born outside of Somalia, so to be born in Kenya. And for my father,
159680	167320	that meant that our future was going to be in Kenya for all intents and purposes. But when
167320	173840	his mother, his sisters and his other siblings all were fleeing the war from Somalia and came
173880	179600	to Kenya, there was a choice to be made. There was a choice to be made as to whether or not
179600	188720	they were going to seek asylum outside of Africa or stay in Kenya or as most people were thinking
188720	193880	at that time, the war is just going to die down in a bit and we'll just go back over and it's
193880	201120	going to be fine. But then a lot of my siblings then sought asylum and I have brothers and sisters
201120	207200	who ended up in America, some ended up in Canada, I have cousins who ended up in Sweden,
207200	212320	Norway and all sorts of different countries. And for my father, we were going to stay and by
212320	219360	this point it's sort of like 92, 93. And then in 93 when vast majority of my family had sought
219360	226280	asylum where they could, my father died in a car crash in Kenya. So then that meant there was
226520	233640	another choice to be made. At this point my father's brother was given a full scholarship
234280	242040	to study and then work in Italy where he was starting to establish himself and maybe start
242040	249080	his own family. And he came back to Kenya to bury his brother, my father. And then there was another
249080	253000	choice to be made there because he had to have a conversation with my mum and say,
253960	260360	do you stay here with these kids? And my mum and father never learnt to read and write,
261000	268600	they never were formally educated. And they had to decide what to do. My uncle's advice was you're
268600	276360	here with no income, with no real way of feeding these children. Either you follow this wave of
276360	281640	people who are seeking asylum somewhere else in the world and try and find a new place to start
281640	289000	again with help or you stay here and nobody knows what's going to happen. You now have with you
290040	297240	five children under the age of 12. And my mother said, well, okay, well, I think I could make it
297240	307400	here but leave the youngest one and take the rest. Which meant that we, the elder ones, ended up in
307400	313000	London without our parents having just helped to bury our father. So you could just imagine for a
313000	321880	moment being a nine-year-old boy or as my sister's six-year-old girl, five-year-old girl, turning
321880	327960	up in a place like London without your mum, without your dad, not understanding the language. I'd
327960	333160	like to think I've mastered the English language now a little bit. Not understanding the culture,
333160	337800	not understanding anything about what's happening. Such was the shock for us
338600	343720	that I still remember to this day, and I talk about it in the book, walking down the street
344760	348520	and where I'd come from in the semi-slum in Nairobi, there were no street lights.
349240	354920	When walking down the street and literally walking into a lamppost and knocking myself out
354920	361320	as a child, that's just how different and new the environment was to us.
362840	368280	And settling into a place like this when you don't understand the culture and the customs,
368280	372840	when you don't have an adult to explain to you what's happening, why it's happening,
372840	380360	what it means to be here, how it's going to work, all of those things can be really, really difficult.
380680	387000	But here's the key point about that. That kind of beginning and that kind of start for a lot of
387000	393480	people like me, especially Somalis who came and sought asylum in this country, that was a really
393480	400680	remarkably unremarkable thing. In fact, in many ways we were lucky because we hadn't seen war.
400680	409560	I had my father's sister who had come to Kenya and then the UK to seek asylum. She had six kids
410440	417240	of her own, but her husband had been killed in the war and all of her children had experienced the
417240	422840	war. At least with us, we hadn't experienced the war directly, but we were victims of the war
422840	430840	indirectly. And so in that sense, the starting point was remarkably unremarkable in that sense.
430840	435960	There was nothing special about the difficulties that we were facing at that time.
436920	444440	Then what happens after that? Well, then it's, my mum comes four years later and we're having to
444440	450600	sort of get to know your mum all over again because we now all speak English. She doesn't speak any
450600	455240	English. You're trying to communicate with her. She's speaking to us in Swahili and Somali,
455240	460520	which we understand but not very well. And you can imagine all the difficulties that then that
460520	466760	causes. I try and talk about it in the book as much as detail as I can, but it was quite painful,
466760	471160	as you might imagine, to sort of dig all that up and think it through and what it meant and
471160	478520	why certain choices were made and why certain choices were not made and so on. But then I did
478520	486280	enough to get to the GCSEs, enough to get to the A levels, enough to get to an undergraduate degree
486280	492440	in law and French at the University of Hertfordshire. I then got a full scholarship to do my post
493320	498360	graduate studies at Oxford University. Then I got a full scholarship to study for the bar exams in
498360	506440	London. Then became a barrister fully qualified in 2012. And then here I am now promoting this book
506440	511320	that is telling that story. Now, you know, in many ways, it's a sort of shortened version of
511320	515080	people say, well, now it must mean that, you know, it's smooth sailing from here. Well, I mean,
515080	522520	there's still plenty of time to mess this up, you know, let's not get carried away. But it's that
522520	529000	kind of journey that I'm still digesting in many ways. And I will continue to digest for quite
529000	535320	some time because there's no shame in admitting that the pain and the sorrow and the grief will
535320	542120	take a lifetime. And one of the ways in which a sociologist and a psychologist and a neuroscientist
542120	546280	that I interviewed for the book and talked about were explaining how when grief, for example,
546920	553480	or a traumatic event, it's really important. Come on in. Trust you to be very late.
555560	559720	Just one of those things that, you know, I know him, I'm not just picking up on him.
561640	567720	I'm not just picking on him. And, you know, it's it's one of those things that people talk about
567720	574120	when, you know, trauma or a death, for example, people always say, well, you'll get over it,
574680	578040	you'll get over it. But actually, one of the ways in which people explain that is,
578920	584920	is they say, well, imagine your brain is just this one big sort of circle. When you're young,
584920	592200	and something very traumatic happens like death, that particular event will be also another big
592200	599240	circle within that brain circle of yours, because it will dominate a huge part of who you are.
599880	606920	But as you go older, and as you mourn properly, and as you digest that trauma, that inner circle
606920	613400	that signifies and represents that trauma just gets slightly smaller compared to that part of
613400	618280	your brain that is there to be dealing with it. So in other words, you never get over it. It just
618360	623960	becomes a smaller part of who you are, the contours of your life, the part of what makes
623960	630600	you a whole human being. And that is, for me, the best way in which somebody described to me,
630600	635240	the way in which we deal with trauma, and death, and that kind of thing that happens to you in
635240	639560	our life. So it's quite important that you don't always come across to people, say to somebody,
639560	644520	well, you'll get over it, it's fine, time will heal you. That's just not the right way to look at it.
644520	649400	Because if you do, you're going to come up against the wall that hits you and hits you and hits you.
650440	655960	So what about the book in terms of the themes? Well, the themes that I've looked into here
655960	662280	are quite varied and big. So the book ranges from what is happening to you as a child,
663160	669000	and sort of what is happening to you in the womb of your mother, and the kind of diet that your
669000	673800	mother's having in terms of what kind of human being that you grow up to become,
674920	680760	all the way through to whatever fulfilling career you're looking for, whatever fulfilling
681560	686200	destiny that you want, if you've ever dreamt of ever being at Google or whatever it is.
687160	693240	What exactly is happening at each stage that allows you to be able to succeed, and how does
693240	700280	it all come together is the kind of overall thesis of the book. So I touch upon this idea,
700280	706040	for example, which is that all the things that people talk about, biological determinism,
706040	713240	for example, are you born with your talents, or is it part of your environment that actually
713240	720280	teaches you? What does the science suggest? How does it affect me personally? How do I think
721240	726440	that my illiterate parents, who were never formally educated,
727480	733640	are a part of who I am now? And actually, does it mean that your intelligence can be measured
734280	740680	by way of sort of formal education as opposed to informal education and life lessons?
740680	746200	And does it mean that your destiny is determined purely by virtue of the fact that you may or may
746200	752360	not be born to people who actually know how to read and write, for example? It's quite controversial,
752360	758120	but I tackle it in the book. The answer is more or less it's 50-50. But equally,
759960	767400	you may be born with some talent, but your environment may well suppress it. You may be born
767400	772840	with very little talent, but the right environment might really, really accentuate that and make you
772840	778280	push whatever little talent you were born with to a level that it goes to. The way I put it is,
779160	785240	how do you make sure that somebody's environment doesn't determine their destiny
785240	791160	in the same way as somebody's environment manages to protect them from their destiny?
792360	799320	And that's the best way to look at the nature and nurture debate in that context. Education.
800200	807000	How many of you guys have heard governments, politicians, ministers always say education's
807000	812360	the answer. Education, education, education. If you just get them to school and they know how to
812360	817000	write and get a university degree, they will be fine. How many times do you always hear that? You
817000	824200	hear that so many times. Well, I've got a newsflash for you. The idea that education is the answer
824200	830200	or even the main answer to the conundrum of social mobility is nonsense.
832040	840600	Complete and utter nonsense. And I'll tell you why. Education, for education's sake, is fundamental
840600	846600	to the human progress. You need to learn how to be literate and numerate and be able to communicate
846600	850600	and be able to understand people. You need to be able to read a bank statement. You need to be able
850600	856040	to fill out forms. You need to be able to understand, you know, the mechanics of communicating with
856040	863080	human beings both in writing and in speaking. Of course, that's a given. But the idea that more
863080	872040	exams and more degrees and more qualifications necessarily equals a trajectory in which you
872040	878440	will become socially mobile, it just doesn't follow. It doesn't follow and we've got to tackle that
878520	884280	head on because the consequence of not tackling that is putting pressure on our education system.
885080	891800	It's putting pressures on our teachers. It's putting crazy pressure on the kids. And it's putting
891800	898280	forward unrealistic expectations on parents who are desperately trying to do what they can for
898280	904760	their children. And I set that out what that means in the book. And then when you translate that
904760	913960	into what that looks like, take this example that was found in, by a couple of academics at the
913960	918920	London School of Economics, Sam Friedman and Daniel Morrison, who wrote a book called The Class
918920	928040	Sealate. They looked at two individuals and took and made sure they controlled for degree
928040	935000	classification, the subject that they studied, the kind of university they went to, and then the
935000	940600	kind of entry job that they had. The only difference between these two people is that one went to a
940600	946360	state school and one went to a private school. Everything else is being controlled for, okay?
948840	955320	When they get into that same entry job, it turns out that the person who went to private school
955320	962920	within three and a half years is earning 16% more. How do you account for that?
964120	969400	These are two individuals who more or less had the exact same trajectory when you control for
969400	976680	everything else except for what school they went to. And yet, three and a half years later,
977640	986200	one is earning 16% more based on what school they went to. How do you explain that if education
986200	992520	and especially tertiary education was supposed to be this great equalizer, was supposed to be this
992520	1001480	moment that everybody becomes equal in terms of equality of opportunity? Again, there are no easy
1001480	1007560	answers to this, but I delve into it and I try and figure out what it could mean and what are the
1007560	1014920	kind of unwritten rules, the social capital connections, the cultural capital, how you
1014920	1019160	understand the culture in which you're going into. The Barrister profession, where I am now as a
1019160	1028680	Barrister. Cultural capital is huge. You know, being able to understand how people communicate
1029480	1033640	when they talk about what school and what college you went to, rather than saying,
1034440	1040360	what did you study? They will say, what did you read? And that's the kind of lingo that
1040360	1046120	Oxbridge types will understand and maybe others wouldn't. And that cultural capital can make a
1046120	1053000	difference. And again, what does that mean if we keep banging on about the fact that education is the
1053080	1061400	answer? Another big theme in the book is the role of luck. How many of you guys believe you're lucky
1061400	1068040	in life? Okay. And for those of you who don't put your hand up, do you think it's all you put your
1068040	1075480	hand up? You worked hard to be here. One person, that's good. I hope you're being ironic. Because
1075480	1083320	if you're not, you really need to read the book. Luck is important, because especially successful
1083320	1091320	people tend to tell a story that it's all them, that they worked hard, that it was all down to them.
1091320	1095960	And I give about four or five examples of that. But I'll share with you two examples.
1096280	1104200	Jeff Bezos. And I'm allowed to mention the names of competitor organizations.
1105960	1115240	Jeff Bezos talks about, and many of the sort of founding fathers or individuals who start
1115240	1120120	up tech companies always tell this story of, I founded my company in a garage. You know what
1120120	1125880	I mean? It was in my garage. I sat there and I worked hard and it came together. This
1125960	1131240	nonsense that they tell people about it all began in this garage. Have you seen that image of Jeff
1131240	1136760	Bezos sitting in his garage with Amazon written on fountain pen and sitting there hunched in
1136760	1142040	front of his computer and he built this billion dollar? Well, here's the footnote. The footnote is
1142040	1153080	in 1995, Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250,000 for free to start up his company. And all of the
1153160	1158520	connections and people that he needed to know and all of the things that he needed to push to be
1158520	1165000	where he is. And of course, things picked up in a way that has been exponential and arguably
1165000	1170600	in a way that we will never see happen again in the way that it happened at that particular
1170600	1176600	moment in time. Now, if that's not lucky, I don't know what is. But that's not the story we tell,
1176600	1180280	right? That's not the story we tell. The story we tell is he worked hard in this garage and look
1180280	1187160	at this guy now. He deserves to be there. And the reason why that's a problem is because we set
1187160	1194760	then unrealistic expectations about what success looks like. We then set people up for failure.
1194760	1201800	We then tell people the kind of stories that I consider to be irresponsible when it comes to
1201800	1208040	people's expectations of what they're worth, of what's possible and what's probable in your
1208040	1213000	set of circumstances. And that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about in the book and I try
1213000	1218120	and lay out. Another example is Bill Gates, who we all know about how he came about with the
1218120	1222600	natural stories he dropped out of Harvard. And, you know, he's amazing. Look at him now. What they
1222600	1229080	don't tell you is that he's one of the very few people who had access to the early computer
1229080	1237400	in a way that was unprecedented and learned hours and hours and hours of coding and programming
1237480	1243080	and being able to do it in such a way that his parents in that context, in that environment in
1243080	1250440	Seattle, allowed for him to grow in a way that, again, arguably will never see again.
1251960	1257560	But when you hear about his story, you hear he dropped out of Harvard, right? Dropouts are good.
1257560	1266040	Dropouts can succeed too. I won't get to the big guys of your... That's for another time. Don't bite
1266040	1273320	the hand that feeds you. But luck. Luck is an example of the way... There's a really good professor
1273320	1278680	briefly. I'll mention by the name of Robert Frank at Cornell University, who's written a really
1278680	1283960	fantastic book about luck, success and luck. And the way he describes luck is actually,
1285000	1288120	interestingly, Casey and I were talking about bikes earlier in a different context, but you're
1288120	1293080	riding a bicycle. And when you're riding your bicycle and you're riding it really strongly
1293080	1299160	and the wind is blowing at you, you're fully aware of the wind because it's pushing at you.
1299160	1307000	You're like struggling. Your feet are pedaling away. You're feeling that the wind, that current,
1307000	1313960	is pushing back at you. That's you being fully aware of your bad luck because it's there. It's
1313960	1322680	constant. It's consistent. But say you take a left and now you're going downhill in a slight incline
1323160	1328440	and now the wind is in your back and you're cycling fast and you're flying. You will only
1328440	1333800	notice that the wind is in your back and you're on the incline for the first 10 seconds. After that,
1333800	1339880	you're more likely to say it's all me. You're much more likely to say it's all me because look how
1339880	1348760	fit I am. That's you hardly ever noticing good luck. You will always be aware of bad luck,
1349720	1356280	but you're less likely to notice good luck. And again, I set that out in the book. Now don't
1356280	1362520	get me wrong. I'm no shrinking violet. I do think I'm special too. And I don't want to undermine
1362520	1369640	my own talents and what I'm good at, but it would be a complete nonsense and a folly to not acknowledge
1369640	1376120	the number of times I've had help, the number of mentors who've shown me the way, the number of
1376120	1381480	second chances I've had, the number of opportunities that people have given me,
1381480	1388280	that I then recognized, that I then worked on, that I then pushed. And that's important because
1388280	1394520	otherwise another different story is both irresponsible and sets people up for failure.
1395560	1400600	That's another, you know, it's really important that I impart that to you. The next themes in the
1400600	1408120	book are in relation to concepts like confidence. Where does this idea of confidence come from?
1408120	1413560	What does it take for you to be confident enough to be in a room like this and address people and
1413560	1419640	talk in a big meeting and hold your own and be confident? What does that actually look like?
1419640	1424360	What does it taste like? How do you teach it? Can you teach it? Can you learn it? Can you unlearn
1424360	1431480	it? What are the kind of contexts that give it a boost and what are the kind of contexts that
1431480	1437640	undermine it? It's all there. I delve into that. Imagination is another chapter which is about
1437640	1444360	this idea that if you're coming from, you know, one of the most deprived areas of the country
1444360	1450280	and you have never met a barrister or a programmer or somebody who works in an environment that you
1450280	1457800	hope to aspire to one day, how do you have the imagination to first of all picture yourself there
1458440	1464920	and then actually work towards it? How does that happen? It's a big question and I try and tackle
1464920	1472680	it. And then there's another question which is often quite controversial and I get in trouble for
1472680	1476680	it. This is a country in particular. How many of you guys grew up in the UK? Just out of interest.
1477640	1481240	Good. So those of you who grew up in the UK will recognize this instantly, perhaps less so the
1481240	1485960	ones who didn't, but you might recognize it now that you're living here more. This is a country
1485960	1489720	that is obsessed with a lot of things, but one of the things that it is really deeply obsessed with
1490440	1505000	is accents. And how you speak and how you communicate can in so many ways determine whether
1505080	1511080	or not you will be successful in this country, despite what your qualifications show and despite
1511720	1519720	how competent you might be and despite how gifted you might be. I am not ashamed of saying it.
1519720	1524520	English is my third language. I didn't speak like this when I was growing up and my accent has
1524520	1529720	undoubtedly changed. I speak in different ways depending on different languages, depending on
1529720	1534360	who I'm talking to, depending on where I am and depending on what I'm trying to achieve.
1535560	1543320	That's the reality of understanding the world as it is rather than the world as you would like it to
1543320	1550440	be. And so if it occurs to you very early on in your life, it turns out that they say that
1550440	1554440	it's very hard for you to change your accent after the age of 25, so some of you it's too late,
1555640	1564600	so don't worry about it. If very early on it occurs to you that this is a fundamental issue
1564600	1571320	for example, not me saying this, but the statistics show that if you have a Scouser accent from
1571320	1579400	Liverpool, a Geordie accent from Newcastle or the Northeast, or a Brummy accent from Birmingham
1579400	1587320	and the Black Country, you will be significantly and disproportionately discriminated against.
1587800	1593000	28% of people believe that they have been discriminated against based on their accents,
1593720	1602760	and they are right because 80%, 80% of employers say they have discriminated against people
1603320	1609720	during interviews based on their accents. Now if you're faced with that kind of fact,
1610440	1616520	do you still keep your accent or do you change how you speak? I'll ask a different question.
1618280	1622040	How many of you still speak how you spoke when you were 15? Put your hand up.
1623560	1628920	Exact same how you spoke when you were 15? Two people out of the rest of the other people who
1628920	1637160	are in this room. Sorry I didn't see if you guys might have said the same. Ish. For me,
1639080	1646040	if you still speak in that accent, I would argue that that suggests in some ways that you were
1646040	1651800	born into a particular accent that allows you to be able to keep it in one way or another.
1651800	1656600	It has to be. And those who say to you, oh you're changing and you're not being yourself,
1656600	1661880	you're being inauthentic, just be yourself, it's guff, it's nonsense. It sets you up for failure,
1661880	1670600	and I am not ashamed of saying so. You just got to read the book. Now the last thing I'd add is
1670600	1676040	there's a lot more about employment, what employers should be doing, how to improve
1677160	1684520	employment practices, and just generally about my reflections of how and where things are going.
1684520	1690120	I thought I'd read for you then a slight short bit in the book before we open it up to question
1690120	1697960	and answer. I've spoken for a bit longer. I hope this is not single use. I like it.
1698360	1705800	I'll read you this small passage here that just sort of encapsulates the book in a nutshell for
1705800	1711080	you so that when you are reading it you can kind of more or less know what it's about based on this
1711080	1717960	bit here. The reality remains that for a young refugee boy who buried his father at the age of
1717960	1722200	nine arrived in Britain without his mother and was brought up in poverty and among profound
1722200	1727320	deprivation. The chances that you would be writing a book like this one are minuscule,
1727400	1734280	not impossible, but highly improbable. In that context what politicians should really be saying
1734280	1741080	is this. The chance of you succeeding in Britain today is down to many factors. The wealth and
1741080	1746840	profession of your parents, the kind of school you attended, your mental and physical health,
1747800	1754120	and the quality of your early environment in terms of stability and attention. You'll need
1754120	1759880	to work harder than you have ever imagined and hope that whatever talents you have given the
1760680	1766360	fast-paced development of automation you are still going to be needed when you grow up.
1767320	1773960	You'll need a lot of luck as you go and let's hope that along the way someone explains to you the
1773960	1779800	unwritten rules of the world you want to join and you'll need to make it through all of that
1780360	1787160	with your belief in yourself and your vision in your future still intact and then
1788280	1794200	maybe you'll make it. It's a bit of a mouthful but it's certainly better than people that say
1794200	1798120	when we live in a meritocratic society. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.
1802680	1806600	Maybe up to questions. I'm going to ask mine first for I'm selfish. Please wait until you have
1806600	1811480	the mic because it is needed for the video. So my question which I know the answer but I also
1811480	1816600	like to hear the detail behind it is so would a child arriving from a similar situation now to
1816600	1823240	Britain have a better experience than you or a worse experience? It's a very good question. A child
1823240	1834840	arriving today would almost certainly not have the best experience that they might have had when I
1834840	1843800	was growing up partly because things have hardened in society these days. I don't think we've become
1843800	1848760	more racist or more intolerant. I personally don't think we have. I think we've more or less been
1848760	1854200	as racist and as intolerant as normal. It's just we're more aware of it now because of social media
1854200	1859880	and all of the things that are out there. So in some ways I think it's harder because it's all in
1859880	1867240	your face and it can be quite demoralizing but I think your life is easier because now more than
1867240	1874360	ever we're more aware generally. Now that doesn't mean that we're more aware because people are
1874360	1880520	aware because they're kind of curious. I think we're more aware because the information is out
1880520	1886120	there. The the data is out there. The opportunities are out there. People are talking about this
1886120	1891080	issue. Everywhere I go everyone's talking about diversity and inclusion and diversity and all
1891080	1895480	this that and the other. Now I talk about the book how a lot of organizations are doing this in a very
1895480	1900840	cat-handed way and actually some of them are causing more damage than good but at least it's out there.
1900840	1904760	At least we're talking about it and I gave an interview to The Guardian or The Observer I can't
1904760	1911240	remember where I said in the book I said in that interview I said I wish I had a book like this
1911240	1917960	where I'm talking about what it feels like to be growing up lonely without information without
1918520	1926040	data without understanding how to sort out my homelessness situation without getting somebody
1926040	1933000	to help you with application form or how do you know just anything any sort of information out there
1933000	1939000	how do we find it so in a way things are worse because of the kind of climate that we're living
1939080	1943240	in but actually things are a lot better because of the fact that so much of this information now
1943240	1945800	is available to you in a way that it's never been before.
1947720	1953640	Hi thanks Hashi this is an incredible story a lot kind of resonates a little bit with
1954680	1963240	some of the stuff that I've got for I guess it's advice really so people like from my community
1963240	1970360	to come and say look you know how do I crack this puzzle of British society how do I and
1970360	1976440	then now you can say to them buy this book yeah yeah yeah and and what you've articulated really
1976440	1985720	well is is like the facts of life all right and so I struggle sometimes with like what I would
1986840	1992440	aspire the culture to be versus what the culture actually is and perhaps what my experience was
1992520	1997640	was perhaps not the experience that you absolutely will be having so I can give the experience that
1997640	2003880	so my question I suppose is like how do we you know give advice without being too cynical or too
2003880	2008280	you know perhaps it's changed yeah yeah yeah well I mean it's a very good question because
2009960	2015960	my experience growing up as a you know as a young black kid with a Muslim name is not going to be
2015960	2021880	the same as a young Asian kid growing up in in a city London in similar or worse set of
2021880	2029080	circumstances right and for me the best advice I tell them and and there is some cynicism in that
2029960	2038840	is that it's really really basic and it's really fundamental it is critical that you treat the
2038840	2045720	world as you find it rather than some utopia of what you hope it to be and the sort of
2045720	2056040	advice that people give especially in my profession that just be yourself you'll be fine it is such
2056040	2064120	poisonous crap that for somebody who doesn't have the information the wherewithal the understanding
2064120	2072360	the context the ability to actually question that it is such poison for you because what then
2072360	2077640	happens is that you be yourself without understanding that the world doesn't work like that and pretty
2077640	2082200	soon you get to a point where you're in conflict with yourself because when you realize that the
2082200	2087960	world doesn't accept you as you are where are you going to turn to because what you've been told to
2087960	2094920	believe is be yourself because the world is fair and you'll be fine because soon when you realize
2094920	2101000	that doesn't work but you still believe the world is fair then the logical conclusion is that the
2101080	2109240	world that is fair won't accept me for who I am and that's the trouble and so you have to be cynical
2109240	2114760	in the you have to understand that the world as it is rather than as we would like it to be
2114760	2120760	isn't the same thing but then the question then becomes when you do make it and when you do get
2120760	2126360	to the point where you are successful whatever success looks like for you it is important that
2126360	2134360	you tell a responsible story of your eyes and that's what I'd like to say I'm doing now is yeah
2135000	2141960	I knew my what I was worth I know what my talents are worth I knew that if I sat the same exams at
2141960	2147480	the bar school if I I knew if I did the same assessments when I was being interviewed to be
2147480	2153880	a barrister that I'd be as good as anyone else but what I didn't know was if I walk into a room
2154440	2160040	and one of the softer skills is that you know did you get to see Richard the Third's performance
2160040	2166200	last weekend or or or which is the the longest Shakespearean play it turns out it's Hamlet
2166200	2171880	and you don't have that kind of cultural capital that you didn't learn in inner city London that kind
2171880	2178680	of feel that people have in a profession like mine where we all do it's not just my profession
2178760	2185560	every profession people recruit in their own image you recruit with people like us
2186120	2192200	you recruit in a way of do I like this person can I work with this person dare I say it happens
2192200	2199880	right here and so when you realize that and you realize that it's not just about your grades
2200680	2205320	although that's a good start it's not just about your performance and competence
2205880	2211640	but it's a lot what what what sociologists call the homophily which is the idea of you
2211640	2217640	recruiting people who are just like you because you are effectively then creating a tribe once you
2217640	2224520	appreciate that that's the key and so the ideal world is I'd like to think for example just on
2224520	2230280	the point about accents of course I'd like to live in a world where people judge me based on
2231240	2236440	what I have to say rather than how I have to say it but when you realize that there is a deeper
2236440	2243080	social conditioning that means that what I have to say will basically become muted after the first
2243080	2247720	couple of words and they've heard you speak in a particular accent you'd be mad to ignore that
2248760	2256760	you'd be mad that's my view people might disagree but that's my view thank you so much for coming
2256760	2263480	and sharing your story with us it's fascinating and I mean your point it's I think it's a very good
2263480	2270280	point and I'm just struggling with it a little bit because I I've been here for just over a year
2271080	2275080	and I am a member of the Gaglars which is one of the ERGs as an employee group
2275080	2281480	and we work really hard as volunteers to make sure that people like me can come here and be themselves
2282120	2291160	and I've always felt that at Google I can be myself I am gay I'm Latino and I talk to people
2291160	2298760	at work about everything that I do about who I am he has a heaven accent and sometimes I feel
2298760	2306840	the accent thing and I agree with you and I work in the legal department I know that people like me
2306840	2311400	if they want to become baristas like yourself it would be much much harder but how not the
2311400	2318600	coffee makers yeah yeah exactly so my question to you is how how do you how do you change that I
2318600	2323880	mean if it is so difficult how do you change that because I I think it's a little bit unrealistic
2323880	2331080	to expect that we all try to become something else so that we can fit in no I completely agree
2331640	2335880	in the sense that it's not easy I talk about it in the book I say look there is a tension
2336680	2343800	there is a tension between saying you need to adapt to the set of circumstances you're in
2343800	2349960	to be able to get on and the tension on the other side of that is well how are we going to change
2349960	2356680	everything when we're all aspiring to join this mono culture which is true it's a very good point
2356680	2364600	I accept that but then the the attack in my judgment has to be twofold the attack has to be on an
2364600	2371720	individual basis and on a systematic basis on an individual basis I've made the choices that I've
2371720	2379480	made and I'm not suggesting that everyone else should and on a systematic basis I am putting
2379480	2388440	the the feet to the fire by talking about it the trouble with expecting an individual to go up
2388440	2397000	against the sister is that you will always lose the game is rigged and as an individual you will
2397000	2406040	lose but then if there is a critical mass of people like me and you who are then hopefully
2406040	2413000	sitting at the top table slowly but surely we will get some sort of progress it probably won't
2413080	2420280	happen in our lifetime but we will get there but the trouble of insisting that an individual remains
2420280	2427720	who they are is to pit two different you know individuals you're you're pitting an individual
2427720	2435160	a giant against a matchstick and the giant will always win and so I accept that there is that
2435160	2442920	tension of course there is but it's not reconcilable within our lifetime and that's the conclusion I've
2442920	2449320	come to and the the the final thing is that we won't be able to reconcile it within our lifetime
2451320	2458840	and the insistent that individuals be themselves with all that that comes with that is that you
2458840	2466520	end up dying dying what I consider what I say in the book you end up dying at the altar of authenticity
2468040	2468920	and it's not worth it
2473880	2477880	I want to hear if you disagree with me I want to hear like come on man I want people who
2477880	2485240	disagree with me because I want to write in the next book I was interested to hear about luck
2485240	2489960	and accents do you feel like that's a particularly British construct because I grew up in Australia
2489960	2493720	a similar private schooling system I've spent a lot of time studying in Germany and Holland where
2493720	2499400	they don't have as much of that yeah if there was it does exist in Australia as well yeah no I mean
2499400	2504280	the Australian system is directly geared uh from the British system but you know in places like
2504280	2509240	Germany they're very very by comparison to me like you have to submit your like high school
2509240	2514680	grades when you go for a job they try to be as objective as possible if you were to say there's
2514680	2520920	like 200 countries in the world just for round sake where would you put the UK in terms of like
2520920	2527240	meritocratic I did a quiz last night turns out that the UN recognizes 193 countries but yeah
2527560	2534040	uh the UK the UK yeah yeah yeah no that's a very where would I put the UK that's a very good
2545240	2549480	very good question very good question I'll take that another question there and then the guy over
2549480	2554920	there and then I'll answer three of them together yes um you spoke about confidence
2555720	2561720	but I'm also interested in your take about motivation if it's ever a real thing actually
2562280	2567480	definitely and you mean the the ability to motivate yourself yeah correct especially
2567480	2572840	when things are extremely hard and if you have like concrete examples yeah and the other thing
2572840	2579240	is you spoke at the very beginning about um controversial things that you write and trolls and
2579240	2583800	like what is it about it's on Twitter just people who who write to me about especially on the accent
2583800	2590760	thing the accent thing is a big is a big problem for a lot of English people trust me uh right there
2590760	2596520	I'll take the last one on there so a motivation on there and accents in Australia and the question
2596520	2601800	about meritocracy in the world I'll come to that sorry thank you very much um this may be covered
2601800	2606920	in your book but my question is it was on was an aspiration like us as a society aspiring to be
2606920	2611320	better than who we are and I want to get your thoughts on that um kind of giving the fact
2611320	2616920	giving your argument around um I guess accepting the world as it is as opposed to as it should be
2616920	2622520	and if we are doing that aren't we setting ourselves up to just remain just as we are or
2623320	2629720	evolve slower I don't know very yeah so in other words if you accept the world as it is
2630440	2635160	does that limit your aspiration okay good question so just dealing with the question about accents
2635160	2641640	Australia uh and even americans some to some extent have borrowed a huge part of the the class
2641640	2648040	structures it just manifests itself in a different way um I'd slightly disagree with you in Germany
2648040	2652440	because Germany has got a similar issue in one sense because actually if you're from Bavaria
2653240	2659080	as opposed to another region of Germany there is a slight snobbery depending on which part of
2659080	2663560	Germany you're in so they have their own bits as well but you're right in the sense that you know
2663560	2667720	they are trying a little bit harder the only problem with the German education system and I've
2667720	2672520	been looking into this is that they make people choose very early on what they want to be so you
2672520	2677880	pretty much by the age of 14 15 you pretty much have to decide whether you want to go down the
2677880	2683960	vocational route or or a professional route at 15 I could barely speak much English so the idea
2683960	2689560	that my destiny could have been determined at the age of 15 you know yeah but you know what I mean
2690440	2695240	and in terms of there's there's all these different indexes about where the UK is on
2696040	2702840	this thing and it turns out that the UK and the US are right at the bottom right at the bottom
2702840	2708680	in that index of of of what it means to be socially mobile but having said that I gave an
2708680	2716680	interview to the Guardian my wife is Swedish and she always bangs on about how the Scandinavian
2716680	2726200	countries are are super meritocratic and that's also nonsense because because what you then what
2726200	2733160	you find is that the Swedish and especially Scandinavian countries like you know Denmark,
2733160	2739640	Norway and Sweden Finland is part of the Nordic countries it isn't Scandinavian they they spend
2739720	2748360	a huge amount of money on education and really training people early on and so they make sure
2749000	2755720	that by the time you get to 15 16 you have really made huge amount of progress in terms of basic
2755720	2763240	education but then when you look at what we call absolute mobility in other words are you doing
2763240	2769880	better than your parents when it comes to the kind of progress that you make Sweden isn't doing
2769880	2778680	that much better there's a really good book called The Sun Also Rises and it shows different
2778680	2785320	surnames it tracks social mobility through surnames and it shows that basically Sweden is owned by
2785320	2793960	about five families for a millennium and that has just meant that basically so in in absolute terms
2793960	2800120	they're trying to galvanize and push people up but in relative terms I really don't think that
2800120	2804760	Sweden is making that as much progress as people give them credit for I'll have to answer these guys
2804760	2809320	and I'll come back to you on the question of motivation it's a very difficult one if you're
2809320	2815240	sitting there working hard pushing yourself and then you have to get up in the morning and it's
2815240	2820840	raining and it's cold and you just want to be under your duvet it's not easy and motivation is a
2820840	2826360	lot is a something I looked into for the book and there's a there's a lot in there about what's often
2826360	2835320	described as instant gratification and delayed gratification so the idea that when I was growing
2835320	2840200	up you walk around the streets and all the guys with the nicest cars are the drug dealers or
2840200	2846120	whatever but you have to believe that you've got to go to this crap school and get the grades and
2846120	2850680	that one day I'll be something that's delayed gratification instant gratification is just like
2851240	2855320	get this why don't I just go there now and I can have that car and those nice trainers
2855880	2861400	which is not you know reality so for me what I argue is that you've got to find that motivation
2861400	2867240	for yourself wherever it comes from my own personal motivation was always that I just wanted better
2867240	2873560	than what I had I was just like I want to buy a house because we've never had our own place we've
2873560	2880280	always lived six to a room I was like I want to be able to buy whatever I want without ever asking
2880280	2885640	anyone and just work towards that you know I mean it was materialistic to begin with but
2886600	2892840	it's just that visceral feeling of being able to control more of your own life that has been that
2892840	2897480	huge motivation for me and I and I struggle with it even now you know sometimes we're all lazy we're
2897480	2902920	all bored and we're all like trying to find different ways to motivate ourselves trust me even the
2902920	2908200	most driven people have their moments so don't ever believe that again it goes back to that thing
2908200	2912600	about I dropped out of Harvard you know I started my thing in a garage it's complete nonsense we're
2912600	2918600	all facing our own deep challenges whatever that might be on the question of the of the challenge
2918600	2925000	and the tension between accepting the world as it is and to what extent and then does that limit
2925000	2932120	your aspiration my point about accepting the world as it is isn't necessarily linked to aspiration
2932120	2939640	it's simply a question of tools so whatever your aspiration is keep it there but don't expect
2940360	2947800	that the world is going to be kind to you generous to you nice to you and treat you in good faith
2948600	2954680	simply because you want to aspire to that aspiration what I'm saying is you have to accept
2954680	2960760	the world as it is because they're not going to judge you just based on your grades they're not
2960760	2965720	just going to judge you based on your raw talent they're not going to just judge you based on your
2965720	2971160	competence which is what people tell you right people tell you just study hard work hard do the
2971160	2976760	right thing and it will come together and what I'm saying is that's not true there's a lot more
2976760	2982680	deeper that you need to dig that doesn't mean lower your aspiration it just means that the
2982680	2987560	roots that you're going to take is going to be a lot more bumpier because you're realistic about
2987560	2993160	the world as it is rather than as you would like it to be which is more likely to treat you to a
2993160	2998520	sort of instant failure any other couple of questions before we wrap all these I've been
2998520	3003160	told I don't mind I've got time so if as long as you guys go got time I'm happy to take whatever
3003160	3006840	questions I'll take a few together thank you so much for sharing your story I'm really looking
3006840	3011000	forward to reading the book you said at the beginning that you ultimately you don't think
3011000	3016360	education is the key to social mobility yet you yourself are a prime example of somebody that
3016360	3021960	who's pursued chose to pursue higher education and whose ultimate career and where you are now
3021960	3027240	is a result of doubt of that so if it's not education and you know we're talking about young
3027240	3032120	people that maybe don't have parents who can give them the best advice what is the the key
3032120	3038920	very good question I'll very good question I'm really interested in your definition of success
3038920	3045720	and I am I my hunch is that that that and you know you just said about being able to buy what
3045720	3050120	you want and you know that kind of sits with very much within a capitalist idea of success
3051080	3055960	and how does that sit against happiness and yeah what is what is the measure of being
3055960	3060840	successful or making it as you refer to but lady there and then there's one more here I think yeah
3060840	3067240	so I'll I'll take those two and then I haven't forgotten no that's all right we can start there
3067240	3077880	and then go there I guess to I group you on the one hand where we have to conform but on the other
3077880	3086760	hand we have to also push like HR departments to have a different system where they're not looking
3087800	3092040	like maybe maybe they're not allowed to look at people or listen to people until they
3093080	3097080	make a certain judgment that allows those people to get to a certain degree so I just wouldn't
3097080	3102120	want to discount that but I totally agree with you what you're saying seems to fit in with yet
3102120	3106360	you've got to dress a certain way it's not just accents you've got to dress a certain way you've
3106360	3112520	got to it's your mannerisms it's all sorts of things and totally agree that you have to play the
3112520	3120280	game to degree how do we best help children or you know children and teenagers yeah good question
3120280	3129240	I'll take that last one to the lady there just lady there you haven't yet mentioned like inclinations
3129240	3132600	we talked about motivation but I'm looking at from a slightly different perspective I work a lot with
3132600	3137640	children with cancer and teenagers with cancer who miss out on a load of school their lives they
3137640	3141000	can either they've had a lot of bad luck you talk about cycling against the wind and the wind being
3141000	3146040	behind you their choice when the wind is behind them sometimes they don't even want to be on the
3146040	3150360	bike like how do you instill that inclination to be hungry to look for the opportunities because
3150360	3153800	that fits with everything you're talking about because you still have to look for those opportunities
3153800	3157320	so how do you instill that and what you discuss in the book about yes a very good question that's
3157320	3162120	a very good question about inclination so just starting out with education what I'm trying to
3162120	3167320	say is that education is not the answer I'm not suggesting that it's not part of the answer but
3167320	3173960	it's not even the main answer I would argue simply because if we see education as even having this
3173960	3179560	relationship with social mobility in the way that politicians talk about it we're setting kids up for
3179560	3185480	failure what I'm saying instead is that education is just one of those life things like breathing
3185560	3192440	like sleeping like just peace whatever like just the kind of think of anything that is just a
3192440	3197800	standard thing that you do when you brush your teeth that's what education is the idea of constantly
3197800	3203880	obsessing over then linking it to people becoming more socially mobile is where I'm disagreeing
3204520	3208760	and and I talk about that and the other stuff that I talk about that comes with that is exactly
3208760	3213880	as I've sort of alluded to in the end you know the circumstances in which you're growing up in
3213880	3219400	the kind of aspirations you're exposed to by your parents the fact that you can have a decent
3219400	3225560	diet at home to be able to allow your brain to grow and not have anxiety and not have the
3225560	3231080	kind of jittery ways in which you're then going to develop issues later on in life the kind of
3231080	3238920	things about mentoring that allows you to the chapter on mentoring I is subtitled it's subtitled
3238920	3244280	filling in the blanks so if you don't know what you don't know having those people around you to
3244280	3250600	be able to show you language so there's loads of other things I argue that make up the bigger
3250600	3256120	social mobility story but this intense focus on education there was a famous uh Tony Blair
3256120	3261240	former prime minister's uh speech where he said education education education again that was a
3261240	3265480	classic example of putting the emphasis in my judgment in the wrong place that's what I mean
3265480	3270840	so I don't hope I don't want to undermine uh the purpose and need of education just plowing
3270840	3274200	through a few of the other questions on the question of what what it means to be successful
3275160	3279480	you have to define that for yourself and I do talk about that in the book I talk about
3279480	3286760	happiness I do talk about not necessarily seeking out the kind of happiness that means that you are
3286760	3293000	monetarily more happy but rather that you're you're happy and successful in the sense that
3293000	3298360	you have pursued what you're good at and what you're not so good at what you enjoy what you don't
3298360	3304760	enjoy and and the kind of things that allow you to grow as a human being now to ignore money would
3304760	3311640	be a folly to ignore money and and and income is just nonsense either it's nonsense or you've grown up
3313160	3318440	you know financially secure and independently wealthy to which extent it means nothing to you
3318520	3323960	but I say in the book if you're going to try to be for example a lawyer pick an area of law
3323960	3327960	if you're a socially mobile person pick an area of law that will allow you to earn a lot of money
3328520	3334760	why why get obsessed over human rights and I want to save the world when you've come from
3334760	3339640	a very poor set of circumstances in that area those areas of law you're not likely to make
3339640	3344120	much money and therefore not likely to transform the lives of your family whereas if you pick an
3344120	3348920	area that does give you a decent income then you can change your life you can change that don't be
3348920	3354600	ashamed of that there's no shame in that this shame is when you make it your sole central goal
3354600	3362520	finally on that it's really interesting how football i'm a big football fan is a huge meritocracy
3362520	3368440	if you think about it it's raw raw talent and it's no wonder that a lot of the people who make it
3368440	3373880	into it are just dirt poor dirt dirt poor most of them and then when you meet a lot of these kids
3373880	3378040	who are growing up in inner city london today ask the vast majority that most kids even if they're
3378040	3382920	growing up in nice circumstances want to be footballers but disproportionately poor kids
3382920	3388440	want to be footballers why because it's the first opportunity that they think they can have through
3388440	3395080	their own hard work to change their lives there is something there on the question of inclination
3395960	3401240	i'm not a scientist i don't know what instinctively occurs to people but i do talk about
3401880	3409080	how much your early life exposure can make a difference to your inclination
3409080	3416120	so for example if you're growing up in a household where every morning everyone's leaving for work
3416120	3421880	at six in the in the morning and getting up and having breakfast as opposed to what is often
3421880	3426920	pejoratively termed by different governments working up in how waking up in households where
3426920	3432600	the curtains are never drawn until midday i think that there is something there about an
3432600	3439320	inclination that happens on for a child very early on that then sets the tone for the rest of their
3439320	3444920	lives but if you're somebody facing cancer and lots of issues with cancer and problems like that
3444920	3450440	chances of your inclinations being quite there is very hard because you probably believe i don't know
3450440	3455560	but you probably believe and feel the life's giving you a pretty raw deal and so why are you
3455560	3461080	going to be more inclined to get up if you think i didn't deserve this and now i'm ridden with this
3461640	3467080	horrible disease that i have no control over so i haven't gone into too much detail but i do talk
3467080	3473880	about inclination to an extent on the final question i remember it briefly but you're gonna have to
3473880	3481640	just tell me one word and i'll it'll come to me the hr the hr it's a very good point so the hr
3481720	3486840	points is a really interesting one so we have to do more to help hr so i did i interviewed a lot of
3486840	3492600	hr people for this book and what was really fascinating was they said to me actually we had
3492600	3499000	this amazing young lady she was really talented she was so good but she had an sx accent we can't
3499000	3503800	put her she was you know what she said to me she said i'd love to hire her but i can't put her in
3503800	3511000	front of the clients so think about that you get to a point where you've managed to convince the
3511000	3517400	hr people to not judge somebody based on their mannerisms or the way they speak but then the next
3517400	3522200	another hurdle appears out of nowhere where she says but what are the clients going to say
3523400	3528840	i can't put her in front of the clients so then i say we need to move towards an environment where
3528840	3533160	if the hr department has decided this person's competent then you should be prepared to put
3533160	3538440	that person in front of the clients or tell your clients to take their business elsewhere now
3539160	3544360	what company's going to do that on their bottom line come on come on think about it no not many
3544360	3548920	companies are going to be prepared to take that hit right now but we're slowly moving in the right
3548920	3553880	direction and the point i'm making is that what i'm learning in this process of writing is that
3554760	3561480	every time we seem to find a solution we seem to hit our heads against a new problem that we may
3561480	3566440	or may not have noticed before that has always been there but has become to the forefront of
3566440	3576440	where it is anyway thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
