00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
Thank you very much for coming. I will tell you a little bit about me and how effectively

00:11.280 --> 00:17.840
the book came about in the first instance. Then I will touch upon the themes of the book,

00:17.840 --> 00:24.160
which have been, if you've been following the press, quite provocative and controversial.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.400
I know what it feels like to be chased by trolls on Twitter now. I will be very keen

00:29.400 --> 00:35.120
on finding out whether there are some real life trolls here today. Then thirdly, I want

00:35.120 --> 00:39.720
to just sort of get your thoughts from your own experiences because what I have found

00:39.720 --> 00:45.560
is that in writing this book that there's a lot of what I'm saying that resonates for

00:45.560 --> 00:49.200
a lot of people no matter where they've come from and no matter what kind of life experience

00:49.200 --> 00:54.480
you've had. So that's essentially what I hope to do in the first sort of 25 minutes

00:54.480 --> 01:01.200
and then we can open it up and then I will gladly sign your book as well afterwards.

01:01.200 --> 01:10.000
So a little bit about me. I was born in Kenya to Somali parents and we were growing up in

01:10.000 --> 01:19.880
a semi-slum called Isli in Nairobi and my parents met in Kenya about late 1980 and my

01:19.880 --> 01:29.640
mother, bless her, has given birth to 12 children. So I'm number eight in that long list. I was

01:29.640 --> 01:36.040
glad she didn't stop after number seven, but I wish she did after number eight and she

01:36.040 --> 01:41.200
had got married and had the first six children with her first husband and the second six

01:41.200 --> 01:47.360
children with my father and one of my younger siblings had died when he was very, very small.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.720
And so they met in Kenya where they were living throughout the 80s when I was growing up there.

01:54.720 --> 02:02.520
And roughly sort of when the war broke out in 1991-92 in Somalia, so many of my family

02:02.520 --> 02:09.280
had moved over to Kenya seeking sort of some sort of refuge and help and it was roughly

02:09.280 --> 02:17.120
around the time when the Dodab refugee camp had opened up in Kenya. And for my father,

02:17.120 --> 02:22.120
we were always now settled in Kenya where he had lived and he had started his life and

02:22.120 --> 02:27.480
had established himself and we were going to stay there, certainly his children and my

02:27.520 --> 02:33.880
mother. And what was interesting about that was that I was the first person in my whole

02:33.880 --> 02:39.680
family's history to be born outside of Somalia, so to be born in Kenya. And for my father,

02:39.680 --> 02:47.320
that meant that our future was going to be in Kenya for all intents and purposes. But when

02:47.320 --> 02:53.840
his mother, his sisters and his other siblings all were fleeing the war from Somalia and came

02:53.880 --> 02:59.600
to Kenya, there was a choice to be made. There was a choice to be made as to whether or not

02:59.600 --> 03:08.720
they were going to seek asylum outside of Africa or stay in Kenya or as most people were thinking

03:08.720 --> 03:13.880
at that time, the war is just going to die down in a bit and we'll just go back over and it's

03:13.880 --> 03:21.120
going to be fine. But then a lot of my siblings then sought asylum and I have brothers and sisters

03:21.120 --> 03:27.200
who ended up in America, some ended up in Canada, I have cousins who ended up in Sweden,

03:27.200 --> 03:32.320
Norway and all sorts of different countries. And for my father, we were going to stay and by

03:32.320 --> 03:39.360
this point it's sort of like 92, 93. And then in 93 when vast majority of my family had sought

03:39.360 --> 03:46.280
asylum where they could, my father died in a car crash in Kenya. So then that meant there was

03:46.520 --> 03:53.640
another choice to be made. At this point my father's brother was given a full scholarship

03:54.280 --> 04:02.040
to study and then work in Italy where he was starting to establish himself and maybe start

04:02.040 --> 04:09.080
his own family. And he came back to Kenya to bury his brother, my father. And then there was another

04:09.080 --> 04:13.000
choice to be made there because he had to have a conversation with my mum and say,

04:13.960 --> 04:20.360
do you stay here with these kids? And my mum and father never learnt to read and write,

04:21.000 --> 04:28.600
they never were formally educated. And they had to decide what to do. My uncle's advice was you're

04:28.600 --> 04:36.360
here with no income, with no real way of feeding these children. Either you follow this wave of

04:36.360 --> 04:41.640
people who are seeking asylum somewhere else in the world and try and find a new place to start

04:41.640 --> 04:49.000
again with help or you stay here and nobody knows what's going to happen. You now have with you

04:50.040 --> 04:57.240
five children under the age of 12. And my mother said, well, okay, well, I think I could make it

04:57.240 --> 05:07.400
here but leave the youngest one and take the rest. Which meant that we, the elder ones, ended up in

05:07.400 --> 05:13.000
London without our parents having just helped to bury our father. So you could just imagine for a

05:13.000 --> 05:21.880
moment being a nine-year-old boy or as my sister's six-year-old girl, five-year-old girl, turning

05:21.880 --> 05:27.960
up in a place like London without your mum, without your dad, not understanding the language. I'd

05:27.960 --> 05:33.160
like to think I've mastered the English language now a little bit. Not understanding the culture,

05:33.160 --> 05:37.800
not understanding anything about what's happening. Such was the shock for us

05:38.600 --> 05:43.720
that I still remember to this day, and I talk about it in the book, walking down the street

05:44.760 --> 05:48.520
and where I'd come from in the semi-slum in Nairobi, there were no street lights.

05:49.240 --> 05:54.920
When walking down the street and literally walking into a lamppost and knocking myself out

05:54.920 --> 06:01.320
as a child, that's just how different and new the environment was to us.

06:02.840 --> 06:08.280
And settling into a place like this when you don't understand the culture and the customs,

06:08.280 --> 06:12.840
when you don't have an adult to explain to you what's happening, why it's happening,

06:12.840 --> 06:20.360
what it means to be here, how it's going to work, all of those things can be really, really difficult.

06:20.680 --> 06:27.000
But here's the key point about that. That kind of beginning and that kind of start for a lot of

06:27.000 --> 06:33.480
people like me, especially Somalis who came and sought asylum in this country, that was a really

06:33.480 --> 06:40.680
remarkably unremarkable thing. In fact, in many ways we were lucky because we hadn't seen war.

06:40.680 --> 06:49.560
I had my father's sister who had come to Kenya and then the UK to seek asylum. She had six kids

06:50.440 --> 06:57.240
of her own, but her husband had been killed in the war and all of her children had experienced the

06:57.240 --> 07:02.840
war. At least with us, we hadn't experienced the war directly, but we were victims of the war

07:02.840 --> 07:10.840
indirectly. And so in that sense, the starting point was remarkably unremarkable in that sense.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.960
There was nothing special about the difficulties that we were facing at that time.

07:16.920 --> 07:24.440
Then what happens after that? Well, then it's, my mum comes four years later and we're having to

07:24.440 --> 07:30.600
sort of get to know your mum all over again because we now all speak English. She doesn't speak any

07:30.600 --> 07:35.240
English. You're trying to communicate with her. She's speaking to us in Swahili and Somali,

07:35.240 --> 07:40.520
which we understand but not very well. And you can imagine all the difficulties that then that

07:40.520 --> 07:46.760
causes. I try and talk about it in the book as much as detail as I can, but it was quite painful,

07:46.760 --> 07:51.160
as you might imagine, to sort of dig all that up and think it through and what it meant and

07:51.160 --> 07:58.520
why certain choices were made and why certain choices were not made and so on. But then I did

07:58.520 --> 08:06.280
enough to get to the GCSEs, enough to get to the A levels, enough to get to an undergraduate degree

08:06.280 --> 08:12.440
in law and French at the University of Hertfordshire. I then got a full scholarship to do my post

08:13.320 --> 08:18.360
graduate studies at Oxford University. Then I got a full scholarship to study for the bar exams in

08:18.360 --> 08:26.440
London. Then became a barrister fully qualified in 2012. And then here I am now promoting this book

08:26.440 --> 08:31.320
that is telling that story. Now, you know, in many ways, it's a sort of shortened version of

08:31.320 --> 08:35.080
people say, well, now it must mean that, you know, it's smooth sailing from here. Well, I mean,

08:35.080 --> 08:42.520
there's still plenty of time to mess this up, you know, let's not get carried away. But it's that

08:42.520 --> 08:49.000
kind of journey that I'm still digesting in many ways. And I will continue to digest for quite

08:49.000 --> 08:55.320
some time because there's no shame in admitting that the pain and the sorrow and the grief will

08:55.320 --> 09:02.120
take a lifetime. And one of the ways in which a sociologist and a psychologist and a neuroscientist

09:02.120 --> 09:06.280
that I interviewed for the book and talked about were explaining how when grief, for example,

09:06.920 --> 09:13.480
or a traumatic event, it's really important. Come on in. Trust you to be very late.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.720
Just one of those things that, you know, I know him, I'm not just picking up on him.

09:21.640 --> 09:27.720
I'm not just picking on him. And, you know, it's it's one of those things that people talk about

09:27.720 --> 09:34.120
when, you know, trauma or a death, for example, people always say, well, you'll get over it,

09:34.680 --> 09:38.040
you'll get over it. But actually, one of the ways in which people explain that is,

09:38.920 --> 09:44.920
is they say, well, imagine your brain is just this one big sort of circle. When you're young,

09:44.920 --> 09:52.200
and something very traumatic happens like death, that particular event will be also another big

09:52.200 --> 09:59.240
circle within that brain circle of yours, because it will dominate a huge part of who you are.

09:59.880 --> 10:06.920
But as you go older, and as you mourn properly, and as you digest that trauma, that inner circle

10:06.920 --> 10:13.400
that signifies and represents that trauma just gets slightly smaller compared to that part of

10:13.400 --> 10:18.280
your brain that is there to be dealing with it. So in other words, you never get over it. It just

10:18.360 --> 10:23.960
becomes a smaller part of who you are, the contours of your life, the part of what makes

10:23.960 --> 10:30.600
you a whole human being. And that is, for me, the best way in which somebody described to me,

10:30.600 --> 10:35.240
the way in which we deal with trauma, and death, and that kind of thing that happens to you in

10:35.240 --> 10:39.560
our life. So it's quite important that you don't always come across to people, say to somebody,

10:39.560 --> 10:44.520
well, you'll get over it, it's fine, time will heal you. That's just not the right way to look at it.

10:44.520 --> 10:49.400
Because if you do, you're going to come up against the wall that hits you and hits you and hits you.

10:50.440 --> 10:55.960
So what about the book in terms of the themes? Well, the themes that I've looked into here

10:55.960 --> 11:02.280
are quite varied and big. So the book ranges from what is happening to you as a child,

11:03.160 --> 11:09.000
and sort of what is happening to you in the womb of your mother, and the kind of diet that your

11:09.000 --> 11:13.800
mother's having in terms of what kind of human being that you grow up to become,

11:14.920 --> 11:20.760
all the way through to whatever fulfilling career you're looking for, whatever fulfilling

11:21.560 --> 11:26.200
destiny that you want, if you've ever dreamt of ever being at Google or whatever it is.

11:27.160 --> 11:33.240
What exactly is happening at each stage that allows you to be able to succeed, and how does

11:33.240 --> 11:40.280
it all come together is the kind of overall thesis of the book. So I touch upon this idea,

11:40.280 --> 11:46.040
for example, which is that all the things that people talk about, biological determinism,

11:46.040 --> 11:53.240
for example, are you born with your talents, or is it part of your environment that actually

11:53.240 --> 12:00.280
teaches you? What does the science suggest? How does it affect me personally? How do I think

12:01.240 --> 12:06.440
that my illiterate parents, who were never formally educated,

12:07.480 --> 12:13.640
are a part of who I am now? And actually, does it mean that your intelligence can be measured

12:14.280 --> 12:20.680
by way of sort of formal education as opposed to informal education and life lessons?

12:20.680 --> 12:26.200
And does it mean that your destiny is determined purely by virtue of the fact that you may or may

12:26.200 --> 12:32.360
not be born to people who actually know how to read and write, for example? It's quite controversial,

12:32.360 --> 12:38.120
but I tackle it in the book. The answer is more or less it's 50-50. But equally,

12:39.960 --> 12:47.400
you may be born with some talent, but your environment may well suppress it. You may be born

12:47.400 --> 12:52.840
with very little talent, but the right environment might really, really accentuate that and make you

12:52.840 --> 12:58.280
push whatever little talent you were born with to a level that it goes to. The way I put it is,

12:59.160 --> 13:05.240
how do you make sure that somebody's environment doesn't determine their destiny

13:05.240 --> 13:11.160
in the same way as somebody's environment manages to protect them from their destiny?

13:12.360 --> 13:19.320
And that's the best way to look at the nature and nurture debate in that context. Education.

13:20.200 --> 13:27.000
How many of you guys have heard governments, politicians, ministers always say education's

13:27.000 --> 13:32.360
the answer. Education, education, education. If you just get them to school and they know how to

13:32.360 --> 13:37.000
write and get a university degree, they will be fine. How many times do you always hear that? You

13:37.000 --> 13:44.200
hear that so many times. Well, I've got a newsflash for you. The idea that education is the answer

13:44.200 --> 13:50.200
or even the main answer to the conundrum of social mobility is nonsense.

13:52.040 --> 14:00.600
Complete and utter nonsense. And I'll tell you why. Education, for education's sake, is fundamental

14:00.600 --> 14:06.600
to the human progress. You need to learn how to be literate and numerate and be able to communicate

14:06.600 --> 14:10.600
and be able to understand people. You need to be able to read a bank statement. You need to be able

14:10.600 --> 14:16.040
to fill out forms. You need to be able to understand, you know, the mechanics of communicating with

14:16.040 --> 14:23.080
human beings both in writing and in speaking. Of course, that's a given. But the idea that more

14:23.080 --> 14:32.040
exams and more degrees and more qualifications necessarily equals a trajectory in which you

14:32.040 --> 14:38.440
will become socially mobile, it just doesn't follow. It doesn't follow and we've got to tackle that

14:38.520 --> 14:44.280
head on because the consequence of not tackling that is putting pressure on our education system.

14:45.080 --> 14:51.800
It's putting pressures on our teachers. It's putting crazy pressure on the kids. And it's putting

14:51.800 --> 14:58.280
forward unrealistic expectations on parents who are desperately trying to do what they can for

14:58.280 --> 15:04.760
their children. And I set that out what that means in the book. And then when you translate that

15:04.760 --> 15:13.960
into what that looks like, take this example that was found in, by a couple of academics at the

15:13.960 --> 15:18.920
London School of Economics, Sam Friedman and Daniel Morrison, who wrote a book called The Class

15:18.920 --> 15:28.040
Sealate. They looked at two individuals and took and made sure they controlled for degree

15:28.040 --> 15:35.000
classification, the subject that they studied, the kind of university they went to, and then the

15:35.000 --> 15:40.600
kind of entry job that they had. The only difference between these two people is that one went to a

15:40.600 --> 15:46.360
state school and one went to a private school. Everything else is being controlled for, okay?

15:48.840 --> 15:55.320
When they get into that same entry job, it turns out that the person who went to private school

15:55.320 --> 16:02.920
within three and a half years is earning 16% more. How do you account for that?

16:04.120 --> 16:09.400
These are two individuals who more or less had the exact same trajectory when you control for

16:09.400 --> 16:16.680
everything else except for what school they went to. And yet, three and a half years later,

16:17.640 --> 16:26.200
one is earning 16% more based on what school they went to. How do you explain that if education

16:26.200 --> 16:32.520
and especially tertiary education was supposed to be this great equalizer, was supposed to be this

16:32.520 --> 16:41.480
moment that everybody becomes equal in terms of equality of opportunity? Again, there are no easy

16:41.480 --> 16:47.560
answers to this, but I delve into it and I try and figure out what it could mean and what are the

16:47.560 --> 16:54.920
kind of unwritten rules, the social capital connections, the cultural capital, how you

16:54.920 --> 16:59.160
understand the culture in which you're going into. The Barrister profession, where I am now as a

16:59.160 --> 17:08.680
Barrister. Cultural capital is huge. You know, being able to understand how people communicate

17:09.480 --> 17:13.640
when they talk about what school and what college you went to, rather than saying,

17:14.440 --> 17:20.360
what did you study? They will say, what did you read? And that's the kind of lingo that

17:20.360 --> 17:26.120
Oxbridge types will understand and maybe others wouldn't. And that cultural capital can make a

17:26.120 --> 17:33.000
difference. And again, what does that mean if we keep banging on about the fact that education is the

17:33.080 --> 17:41.400
answer? Another big theme in the book is the role of luck. How many of you guys believe you're lucky

17:41.400 --> 17:48.040
in life? Okay. And for those of you who don't put your hand up, do you think it's all you put your

17:48.040 --> 17:55.480
hand up? You worked hard to be here. One person, that's good. I hope you're being ironic. Because

17:55.480 --> 18:03.320
if you're not, you really need to read the book. Luck is important, because especially successful

18:03.320 --> 18:11.320
people tend to tell a story that it's all them, that they worked hard, that it was all down to them.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.960
And I give about four or five examples of that. But I'll share with you two examples.

18:16.280 --> 18:24.200
Jeff Bezos. And I'm allowed to mention the names of competitor organizations.

18:25.960 --> 18:35.240
Jeff Bezos talks about, and many of the sort of founding fathers or individuals who start

18:35.240 --> 18:40.120
up tech companies always tell this story of, I founded my company in a garage. You know what

18:40.120 --> 18:45.880
I mean? It was in my garage. I sat there and I worked hard and it came together. This

18:45.960 --> 18:51.240
nonsense that they tell people about it all began in this garage. Have you seen that image of Jeff

18:51.240 --> 18:56.760
Bezos sitting in his garage with Amazon written on fountain pen and sitting there hunched in

18:56.760 --> 19:02.040
front of his computer and he built this billion dollar? Well, here's the footnote. The footnote is

19:02.040 --> 19:13.080
in 1995, Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250,000 for free to start up his company. And all of the

19:13.160 --> 19:18.520
connections and people that he needed to know and all of the things that he needed to push to be

19:18.520 --> 19:25.000
where he is. And of course, things picked up in a way that has been exponential and arguably

19:25.000 --> 19:30.600
in a way that we will never see happen again in the way that it happened at that particular

19:30.600 --> 19:36.600
moment in time. Now, if that's not lucky, I don't know what is. But that's not the story we tell,

19:36.600 --> 19:40.280
right? That's not the story we tell. The story we tell is he worked hard in this garage and look

19:40.280 --> 19:47.160
at this guy now. He deserves to be there. And the reason why that's a problem is because we set

19:47.160 --> 19:54.760
then unrealistic expectations about what success looks like. We then set people up for failure.

19:54.760 --> 20:01.800
We then tell people the kind of stories that I consider to be irresponsible when it comes to

20:01.800 --> 20:08.040
people's expectations of what they're worth, of what's possible and what's probable in your

20:08.040 --> 20:13.000
set of circumstances. And that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about in the book and I try

20:13.000 --> 20:18.120
and lay out. Another example is Bill Gates, who we all know about how he came about with the

20:18.120 --> 20:22.600
natural stories he dropped out of Harvard. And, you know, he's amazing. Look at him now. What they

20:22.600 --> 20:29.080
don't tell you is that he's one of the very few people who had access to the early computer

20:29.080 --> 20:37.400
in a way that was unprecedented and learned hours and hours and hours of coding and programming

20:37.480 --> 20:43.080
and being able to do it in such a way that his parents in that context, in that environment in

20:43.080 --> 20:50.440
Seattle, allowed for him to grow in a way that, again, arguably will never see again.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.560
But when you hear about his story, you hear he dropped out of Harvard, right? Dropouts are good.

20:57.560 --> 21:06.040
Dropouts can succeed too. I won't get to the big guys of your... That's for another time. Don't bite

21:06.040 --> 21:13.320
the hand that feeds you. But luck. Luck is an example of the way... There's a really good professor

21:13.320 --> 21:18.680
briefly. I'll mention by the name of Robert Frank at Cornell University, who's written a really

21:18.680 --> 21:23.960
fantastic book about luck, success and luck. And the way he describes luck is actually,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.120
interestingly, Casey and I were talking about bikes earlier in a different context, but you're

21:28.120 --> 21:33.080
riding a bicycle. And when you're riding your bicycle and you're riding it really strongly

21:33.080 --> 21:39.160
and the wind is blowing at you, you're fully aware of the wind because it's pushing at you.

21:39.160 --> 21:47.000
You're like struggling. Your feet are pedaling away. You're feeling that the wind, that current,

21:47.000 --> 21:53.960
is pushing back at you. That's you being fully aware of your bad luck because it's there. It's

21:53.960 --> 22:02.680
constant. It's consistent. But say you take a left and now you're going downhill in a slight incline

22:03.160 --> 22:08.440
and now the wind is in your back and you're cycling fast and you're flying. You will only

22:08.440 --> 22:13.800
notice that the wind is in your back and you're on the incline for the first 10 seconds. After that,

22:13.800 --> 22:19.880
you're more likely to say it's all me. You're much more likely to say it's all me because look how

22:19.880 --> 22:28.760
fit I am. That's you hardly ever noticing good luck. You will always be aware of bad luck,

22:29.720 --> 22:36.280
but you're less likely to notice good luck. And again, I set that out in the book. Now don't

22:36.280 --> 22:42.520
get me wrong. I'm no shrinking violet. I do think I'm special too. And I don't want to undermine

22:42.520 --> 22:49.640
my own talents and what I'm good at, but it would be a complete nonsense and a folly to not acknowledge

22:49.640 --> 22:56.120
the number of times I've had help, the number of mentors who've shown me the way, the number of

22:56.120 --> 23:01.480
second chances I've had, the number of opportunities that people have given me,

23:01.480 --> 23:08.280
that I then recognized, that I then worked on, that I then pushed. And that's important because

23:08.280 --> 23:14.520
otherwise another different story is both irresponsible and sets people up for failure.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.600
That's another, you know, it's really important that I impart that to you. The next themes in the

23:20.600 --> 23:28.120
book are in relation to concepts like confidence. Where does this idea of confidence come from?

23:28.120 --> 23:33.560
What does it take for you to be confident enough to be in a room like this and address people and

23:33.560 --> 23:39.640
talk in a big meeting and hold your own and be confident? What does that actually look like?

23:39.640 --> 23:44.360
What does it taste like? How do you teach it? Can you teach it? Can you learn it? Can you unlearn

23:44.360 --> 23:51.480
it? What are the kind of contexts that give it a boost and what are the kind of contexts that

23:51.480 --> 23:57.640
undermine it? It's all there. I delve into that. Imagination is another chapter which is about

23:57.640 --> 24:04.360
this idea that if you're coming from, you know, one of the most deprived areas of the country

24:04.360 --> 24:10.280
and you have never met a barrister or a programmer or somebody who works in an environment that you

24:10.280 --> 24:17.800
hope to aspire to one day, how do you have the imagination to first of all picture yourself there

24:18.440 --> 24:24.920
and then actually work towards it? How does that happen? It's a big question and I try and tackle

24:24.920 --> 24:32.680
it. And then there's another question which is often quite controversial and I get in trouble for

24:32.680 --> 24:36.680
it. This is a country in particular. How many of you guys grew up in the UK? Just out of interest.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.240
Good. So those of you who grew up in the UK will recognize this instantly, perhaps less so the

24:41.240 --> 24:45.960
ones who didn't, but you might recognize it now that you're living here more. This is a country

24:45.960 --> 24:49.720
that is obsessed with a lot of things, but one of the things that it is really deeply obsessed with

24:50.440 --> 25:05.000
is accents. And how you speak and how you communicate can in so many ways determine whether

25:05.080 --> 25:11.080
or not you will be successful in this country, despite what your qualifications show and despite

25:11.720 --> 25:19.720
how competent you might be and despite how gifted you might be. I am not ashamed of saying it.

25:19.720 --> 25:24.520
English is my third language. I didn't speak like this when I was growing up and my accent has

25:24.520 --> 25:29.720
undoubtedly changed. I speak in different ways depending on different languages, depending on

25:29.720 --> 25:34.360
who I'm talking to, depending on where I am and depending on what I'm trying to achieve.

25:35.560 --> 25:43.320
That's the reality of understanding the world as it is rather than the world as you would like it to

25:43.320 --> 25:50.440
be. And so if it occurs to you very early on in your life, it turns out that they say that

25:50.440 --> 25:54.440
it's very hard for you to change your accent after the age of 25, so some of you it's too late,

25:55.640 --> 26:04.600
so don't worry about it. If very early on it occurs to you that this is a fundamental issue

26:04.600 --> 26:11.320
for example, not me saying this, but the statistics show that if you have a Scouser accent from

26:11.320 --> 26:19.400
Liverpool, a Geordie accent from Newcastle or the Northeast, or a Brummy accent from Birmingham

26:19.400 --> 26:27.320
and the Black Country, you will be significantly and disproportionately discriminated against.

26:27.800 --> 26:33.000
28% of people believe that they have been discriminated against based on their accents,

26:33.720 --> 26:42.760
and they are right because 80%, 80% of employers say they have discriminated against people

26:43.320 --> 26:49.720
during interviews based on their accents. Now if you're faced with that kind of fact,

26:50.440 --> 26:56.520
do you still keep your accent or do you change how you speak? I'll ask a different question.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.040
How many of you still speak how you spoke when you were 15? Put your hand up.

27:03.560 --> 27:08.920
Exact same how you spoke when you were 15? Two people out of the rest of the other people who

27:08.920 --> 27:17.160
are in this room. Sorry I didn't see if you guys might have said the same. Ish. For me,

27:19.080 --> 27:26.040
if you still speak in that accent, I would argue that that suggests in some ways that you were

27:26.040 --> 27:31.800
born into a particular accent that allows you to be able to keep it in one way or another.

27:31.800 --> 27:36.600
It has to be. And those who say to you, oh you're changing and you're not being yourself,

27:36.600 --> 27:41.880
you're being inauthentic, just be yourself, it's guff, it's nonsense. It sets you up for failure,

27:41.880 --> 27:50.600
and I am not ashamed of saying so. You just got to read the book. Now the last thing I'd add is

27:50.600 --> 27:56.040
there's a lot more about employment, what employers should be doing, how to improve

27:57.160 --> 28:04.520
employment practices, and just generally about my reflections of how and where things are going.

28:04.520 --> 28:10.120
I thought I'd read for you then a slight short bit in the book before we open it up to question

28:10.120 --> 28:17.960
and answer. I've spoken for a bit longer. I hope this is not single use. I like it.

28:18.360 --> 28:25.800
I'll read you this small passage here that just sort of encapsulates the book in a nutshell for

28:25.800 --> 28:31.080
you so that when you are reading it you can kind of more or less know what it's about based on this

28:31.080 --> 28:37.960
bit here. The reality remains that for a young refugee boy who buried his father at the age of

28:37.960 --> 28:42.200
nine arrived in Britain without his mother and was brought up in poverty and among profound

28:42.200 --> 28:47.320
deprivation. The chances that you would be writing a book like this one are minuscule,

28:47.400 --> 28:54.280
not impossible, but highly improbable. In that context what politicians should really be saying

28:54.280 --> 29:01.080
is this. The chance of you succeeding in Britain today is down to many factors. The wealth and

29:01.080 --> 29:06.840
profession of your parents, the kind of school you attended, your mental and physical health,

29:07.800 --> 29:14.120
and the quality of your early environment in terms of stability and attention. You'll need

29:14.120 --> 29:19.880
to work harder than you have ever imagined and hope that whatever talents you have given the

29:20.680 --> 29:26.360
fast-paced development of automation you are still going to be needed when you grow up.

29:27.320 --> 29:33.960
You'll need a lot of luck as you go and let's hope that along the way someone explains to you the

29:33.960 --> 29:39.800
unwritten rules of the world you want to join and you'll need to make it through all of that

29:40.360 --> 29:47.160
with your belief in yourself and your vision in your future still intact and then

29:48.280 --> 29:54.200
maybe you'll make it. It's a bit of a mouthful but it's certainly better than people that say

29:54.200 --> 29:58.120
when we live in a meritocratic society. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.

30:02.680 --> 30:06.600
Maybe up to questions. I'm going to ask mine first for I'm selfish. Please wait until you have

30:06.600 --> 30:11.480
the mic because it is needed for the video. So my question which I know the answer but I also

30:11.480 --> 30:16.600
like to hear the detail behind it is so would a child arriving from a similar situation now to

30:16.600 --> 30:23.240
Britain have a better experience than you or a worse experience? It's a very good question. A child

30:23.240 --> 30:34.840
arriving today would almost certainly not have the best experience that they might have had when I

30:34.840 --> 30:43.800
was growing up partly because things have hardened in society these days. I don't think we've become

30:43.800 --> 30:48.760
more racist or more intolerant. I personally don't think we have. I think we've more or less been

30:48.760 --> 30:54.200
as racist and as intolerant as normal. It's just we're more aware of it now because of social media

30:54.200 --> 30:59.880
and all of the things that are out there. So in some ways I think it's harder because it's all in

30:59.880 --> 31:07.240
your face and it can be quite demoralizing but I think your life is easier because now more than

31:07.240 --> 31:14.360
ever we're more aware generally. Now that doesn't mean that we're more aware because people are

31:14.360 --> 31:20.520
aware because they're kind of curious. I think we're more aware because the information is out

31:20.520 --> 31:26.120
there. The the data is out there. The opportunities are out there. People are talking about this

31:26.120 --> 31:31.080
issue. Everywhere I go everyone's talking about diversity and inclusion and diversity and all

31:31.080 --> 31:35.480
this that and the other. Now I talk about the book how a lot of organizations are doing this in a very

31:35.480 --> 31:40.840
cat-handed way and actually some of them are causing more damage than good but at least it's out there.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.760
At least we're talking about it and I gave an interview to The Guardian or The Observer I can't

31:44.760 --> 31:51.240
remember where I said in the book I said in that interview I said I wish I had a book like this

31:51.240 --> 31:57.960
where I'm talking about what it feels like to be growing up lonely without information without

31:58.520 --> 32:06.040
data without understanding how to sort out my homelessness situation without getting somebody

32:06.040 --> 32:13.000
to help you with application form or how do you know just anything any sort of information out there

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
how do we find it so in a way things are worse because of the kind of climate that we're living

32:19.080 --> 32:23.240
in but actually things are a lot better because of the fact that so much of this information now

32:23.240 --> 32:25.800
is available to you in a way that it's never been before.

32:27.720 --> 32:33.640
Hi thanks Hashi this is an incredible story a lot kind of resonates a little bit with

32:34.680 --> 32:43.240
some of the stuff that I've got for I guess it's advice really so people like from my community

32:43.240 --> 32:50.360
to come and say look you know how do I crack this puzzle of British society how do I and

32:50.360 --> 32:56.440
then now you can say to them buy this book yeah yeah yeah and and what you've articulated really

32:56.440 --> 33:05.720
well is is like the facts of life all right and so I struggle sometimes with like what I would

33:06.840 --> 33:12.440
aspire the culture to be versus what the culture actually is and perhaps what my experience was

33:12.520 --> 33:17.640
was perhaps not the experience that you absolutely will be having so I can give the experience that

33:17.640 --> 33:23.880
so my question I suppose is like how do we you know give advice without being too cynical or too

33:23.880 --> 33:28.280
you know perhaps it's changed yeah yeah yeah well I mean it's a very good question because

33:29.960 --> 33:35.960
my experience growing up as a you know as a young black kid with a Muslim name is not going to be

33:35.960 --> 33:41.880
the same as a young Asian kid growing up in in a city London in similar or worse set of

33:41.880 --> 33:49.080
circumstances right and for me the best advice I tell them and and there is some cynicism in that

33:49.960 --> 33:58.840
is that it's really really basic and it's really fundamental it is critical that you treat the

33:58.840 --> 34:05.720
world as you find it rather than some utopia of what you hope it to be and the sort of

34:05.720 --> 34:16.040
advice that people give especially in my profession that just be yourself you'll be fine it is such

34:16.040 --> 34:24.120
poisonous crap that for somebody who doesn't have the information the wherewithal the understanding

34:24.120 --> 34:32.360
the context the ability to actually question that it is such poison for you because what then

34:32.360 --> 34:37.640
happens is that you be yourself without understanding that the world doesn't work like that and pretty

34:37.640 --> 34:42.200
soon you get to a point where you're in conflict with yourself because when you realize that the

34:42.200 --> 34:47.960
world doesn't accept you as you are where are you going to turn to because what you've been told to

34:47.960 --> 34:54.920
believe is be yourself because the world is fair and you'll be fine because soon when you realize

34:54.920 --> 35:01.000
that doesn't work but you still believe the world is fair then the logical conclusion is that the

35:01.080 --> 35:09.240
world that is fair won't accept me for who I am and that's the trouble and so you have to be cynical

35:09.240 --> 35:14.760
in the you have to understand that the world as it is rather than as we would like it to be

35:14.760 --> 35:20.760
isn't the same thing but then the question then becomes when you do make it and when you do get

35:20.760 --> 35:26.360
to the point where you are successful whatever success looks like for you it is important that

35:26.360 --> 35:34.360
you tell a responsible story of your eyes and that's what I'd like to say I'm doing now is yeah

35:35.000 --> 35:41.960
I knew my what I was worth I know what my talents are worth I knew that if I sat the same exams at

35:41.960 --> 35:47.480
the bar school if I I knew if I did the same assessments when I was being interviewed to be

35:47.480 --> 35:53.880
a barrister that I'd be as good as anyone else but what I didn't know was if I walk into a room

35:54.440 --> 36:00.040
and one of the softer skills is that you know did you get to see Richard the Third's performance

36:00.040 --> 36:06.200
last weekend or or or which is the the longest Shakespearean play it turns out it's Hamlet

36:06.200 --> 36:11.880
and you don't have that kind of cultural capital that you didn't learn in inner city London that kind

36:11.880 --> 36:18.680
of feel that people have in a profession like mine where we all do it's not just my profession

36:18.760 --> 36:25.560
every profession people recruit in their own image you recruit with people like us

36:26.120 --> 36:32.200
you recruit in a way of do I like this person can I work with this person dare I say it happens

36:32.200 --> 36:39.880
right here and so when you realize that and you realize that it's not just about your grades

36:40.680 --> 36:45.320
although that's a good start it's not just about your performance and competence

36:45.880 --> 36:51.640
but it's a lot what what what sociologists call the homophily which is the idea of you

36:51.640 --> 36:57.640
recruiting people who are just like you because you are effectively then creating a tribe once you

36:57.640 --> 37:04.520
appreciate that that's the key and so the ideal world is I'd like to think for example just on

37:04.520 --> 37:10.280
the point about accents of course I'd like to live in a world where people judge me based on

37:11.240 --> 37:16.440
what I have to say rather than how I have to say it but when you realize that there is a deeper

37:16.440 --> 37:23.080
social conditioning that means that what I have to say will basically become muted after the first

37:23.080 --> 37:27.720
couple of words and they've heard you speak in a particular accent you'd be mad to ignore that

37:28.760 --> 37:36.760
you'd be mad that's my view people might disagree but that's my view thank you so much for coming

37:36.760 --> 37:43.480
and sharing your story with us it's fascinating and I mean your point it's I think it's a very good

37:43.480 --> 37:50.280
point and I'm just struggling with it a little bit because I I've been here for just over a year

37:51.080 --> 37:55.080
and I am a member of the Gaglars which is one of the ERGs as an employee group

37:55.080 --> 38:01.480
and we work really hard as volunteers to make sure that people like me can come here and be themselves

38:02.120 --> 38:11.160
and I've always felt that at Google I can be myself I am gay I'm Latino and I talk to people

38:11.160 --> 38:18.760
at work about everything that I do about who I am he has a heaven accent and sometimes I feel

38:18.760 --> 38:26.840
the accent thing and I agree with you and I work in the legal department I know that people like me

38:26.840 --> 38:31.400
if they want to become baristas like yourself it would be much much harder but how not the

38:31.400 --> 38:38.600
coffee makers yeah yeah exactly so my question to you is how how do you how do you change that I

38:38.600 --> 38:43.880
mean if it is so difficult how do you change that because I I think it's a little bit unrealistic

38:43.880 --> 38:51.080
to expect that we all try to become something else so that we can fit in no I completely agree

38:51.640 --> 38:55.880
in the sense that it's not easy I talk about it in the book I say look there is a tension

38:56.680 --> 39:03.800
there is a tension between saying you need to adapt to the set of circumstances you're in

39:03.800 --> 39:09.960
to be able to get on and the tension on the other side of that is well how are we going to change

39:09.960 --> 39:16.680
everything when we're all aspiring to join this mono culture which is true it's a very good point

39:16.680 --> 39:24.600
I accept that but then the the attack in my judgment has to be twofold the attack has to be on an

39:24.600 --> 39:31.720
individual basis and on a systematic basis on an individual basis I've made the choices that I've

39:31.720 --> 39:39.480
made and I'm not suggesting that everyone else should and on a systematic basis I am putting

39:39.480 --> 39:48.440
the the feet to the fire by talking about it the trouble with expecting an individual to go up

39:48.440 --> 39:57.000
against the sister is that you will always lose the game is rigged and as an individual you will

39:57.000 --> 40:06.040
lose but then if there is a critical mass of people like me and you who are then hopefully

40:06.040 --> 40:13.000
sitting at the top table slowly but surely we will get some sort of progress it probably won't

40:13.080 --> 40:20.280
happen in our lifetime but we will get there but the trouble of insisting that an individual remains

40:20.280 --> 40:27.720
who they are is to pit two different you know individuals you're you're pitting an individual

40:27.720 --> 40:35.160
a giant against a matchstick and the giant will always win and so I accept that there is that

40:35.160 --> 40:42.920
tension of course there is but it's not reconcilable within our lifetime and that's the conclusion I've

40:42.920 --> 40:49.320
come to and the the the final thing is that we won't be able to reconcile it within our lifetime

40:51.320 --> 40:58.840
and the insistent that individuals be themselves with all that that comes with that is that you

40:58.840 --> 41:06.520
end up dying dying what I consider what I say in the book you end up dying at the altar of authenticity

41:08.040 --> 41:08.920
and it's not worth it

41:13.880 --> 41:17.880
I want to hear if you disagree with me I want to hear like come on man I want people who

41:17.880 --> 41:25.240
disagree with me because I want to write in the next book I was interested to hear about luck

41:25.240 --> 41:29.960
and accents do you feel like that's a particularly British construct because I grew up in Australia

41:29.960 --> 41:33.720
a similar private schooling system I've spent a lot of time studying in Germany and Holland where

41:33.720 --> 41:39.400
they don't have as much of that yeah if there was it does exist in Australia as well yeah no I mean

41:39.400 --> 41:44.280
the Australian system is directly geared uh from the British system but you know in places like

41:44.280 --> 41:49.240
Germany they're very very by comparison to me like you have to submit your like high school

41:49.240 --> 41:54.680
grades when you go for a job they try to be as objective as possible if you were to say there's

41:54.680 --> 42:00.920
like 200 countries in the world just for round sake where would you put the UK in terms of like

42:00.920 --> 42:07.240
meritocratic I did a quiz last night turns out that the UN recognizes 193 countries but yeah

42:07.560 --> 42:14.040
uh the UK the UK yeah yeah yeah no that's a very where would I put the UK that's a very good

42:25.240 --> 42:29.480
very good question very good question I'll take that another question there and then the guy over

42:29.480 --> 42:34.920
there and then I'll answer three of them together yes um you spoke about confidence

42:35.720 --> 42:41.720
but I'm also interested in your take about motivation if it's ever a real thing actually

42:42.280 --> 42:47.480
definitely and you mean the the ability to motivate yourself yeah correct especially

42:47.480 --> 42:52.840
when things are extremely hard and if you have like concrete examples yeah and the other thing

42:52.840 --> 42:59.240
is you spoke at the very beginning about um controversial things that you write and trolls and

42:59.240 --> 43:03.800
like what is it about it's on Twitter just people who who write to me about especially on the accent

43:03.800 --> 43:10.760
thing the accent thing is a big is a big problem for a lot of English people trust me uh right there

43:10.760 --> 43:16.520
I'll take the last one on there so a motivation on there and accents in Australia and the question

43:16.520 --> 43:21.800
about meritocracy in the world I'll come to that sorry thank you very much um this may be covered

43:21.800 --> 43:26.920
in your book but my question is it was on was an aspiration like us as a society aspiring to be

43:26.920 --> 43:31.320
better than who we are and I want to get your thoughts on that um kind of giving the fact

43:31.320 --> 43:36.920
giving your argument around um I guess accepting the world as it is as opposed to as it should be

43:36.920 --> 43:42.520
and if we are doing that aren't we setting ourselves up to just remain just as we are or

43:43.320 --> 43:49.720
evolve slower I don't know very yeah so in other words if you accept the world as it is

43:50.440 --> 43:55.160
does that limit your aspiration okay good question so just dealing with the question about accents

43:55.160 --> 44:01.640
Australia uh and even americans some to some extent have borrowed a huge part of the the class

44:01.640 --> 44:08.040
structures it just manifests itself in a different way um I'd slightly disagree with you in Germany

44:08.040 --> 44:12.440
because Germany has got a similar issue in one sense because actually if you're from Bavaria

44:13.240 --> 44:19.080
as opposed to another region of Germany there is a slight snobbery depending on which part of

44:19.080 --> 44:23.560
Germany you're in so they have their own bits as well but you're right in the sense that you know

44:23.560 --> 44:27.720
they are trying a little bit harder the only problem with the German education system and I've

44:27.720 --> 44:32.520
been looking into this is that they make people choose very early on what they want to be so you

44:32.520 --> 44:37.880
pretty much by the age of 14 15 you pretty much have to decide whether you want to go down the

44:37.880 --> 44:43.960
vocational route or or a professional route at 15 I could barely speak much English so the idea

44:43.960 --> 44:49.560
that my destiny could have been determined at the age of 15 you know yeah but you know what I mean

44:50.440 --> 44:55.240
and in terms of there's there's all these different indexes about where the UK is on

44:56.040 --> 45:02.840
this thing and it turns out that the UK and the US are right at the bottom right at the bottom

45:02.840 --> 45:08.680
in that index of of of what it means to be socially mobile but having said that I gave an

45:08.680 --> 45:16.680
interview to the Guardian my wife is Swedish and she always bangs on about how the Scandinavian

45:16.680 --> 45:26.200
countries are are super meritocratic and that's also nonsense because because what you then what

45:26.200 --> 45:33.160
you find is that the Swedish and especially Scandinavian countries like you know Denmark,

45:33.160 --> 45:39.640
Norway and Sweden Finland is part of the Nordic countries it isn't Scandinavian they they spend

45:39.720 --> 45:48.360
a huge amount of money on education and really training people early on and so they make sure

45:49.000 --> 45:55.720
that by the time you get to 15 16 you have really made huge amount of progress in terms of basic

45:55.720 --> 46:03.240
education but then when you look at what we call absolute mobility in other words are you doing

46:03.240 --> 46:09.880
better than your parents when it comes to the kind of progress that you make Sweden isn't doing

46:09.880 --> 46:18.680
that much better there's a really good book called The Sun Also Rises and it shows different

46:18.680 --> 46:25.320
surnames it tracks social mobility through surnames and it shows that basically Sweden is owned by

46:25.320 --> 46:33.960
about five families for a millennium and that has just meant that basically so in in absolute terms

46:33.960 --> 46:40.120
they're trying to galvanize and push people up but in relative terms I really don't think that

46:40.120 --> 46:44.760
Sweden is making that as much progress as people give them credit for I'll have to answer these guys

46:44.760 --> 46:49.320
and I'll come back to you on the question of motivation it's a very difficult one if you're

46:49.320 --> 46:55.240
sitting there working hard pushing yourself and then you have to get up in the morning and it's

46:55.240 --> 47:00.840
raining and it's cold and you just want to be under your duvet it's not easy and motivation is a

47:00.840 --> 47:06.360
lot is a something I looked into for the book and there's a there's a lot in there about what's often

47:06.360 --> 47:15.320
described as instant gratification and delayed gratification so the idea that when I was growing

47:15.320 --> 47:20.200
up you walk around the streets and all the guys with the nicest cars are the drug dealers or

47:20.200 --> 47:26.120
whatever but you have to believe that you've got to go to this crap school and get the grades and

47:26.120 --> 47:30.680
that one day I'll be something that's delayed gratification instant gratification is just like

47:31.240 --> 47:35.320
get this why don't I just go there now and I can have that car and those nice trainers

47:35.880 --> 47:41.400
which is not you know reality so for me what I argue is that you've got to find that motivation

47:41.400 --> 47:47.240
for yourself wherever it comes from my own personal motivation was always that I just wanted better

47:47.240 --> 47:53.560
than what I had I was just like I want to buy a house because we've never had our own place we've

47:53.560 --> 48:00.280
always lived six to a room I was like I want to be able to buy whatever I want without ever asking

48:00.280 --> 48:05.640
anyone and just work towards that you know I mean it was materialistic to begin with but

48:06.600 --> 48:12.840
it's just that visceral feeling of being able to control more of your own life that has been that

48:12.840 --> 48:17.480
huge motivation for me and I and I struggle with it even now you know sometimes we're all lazy we're

48:17.480 --> 48:22.920
all bored and we're all like trying to find different ways to motivate ourselves trust me even the

48:22.920 --> 48:28.200
most driven people have their moments so don't ever believe that again it goes back to that thing

48:28.200 --> 48:32.600
about I dropped out of Harvard you know I started my thing in a garage it's complete nonsense we're

48:32.600 --> 48:38.600
all facing our own deep challenges whatever that might be on the question of the of the challenge

48:38.600 --> 48:45.000
and the tension between accepting the world as it is and to what extent and then does that limit

48:45.000 --> 48:52.120
your aspiration my point about accepting the world as it is isn't necessarily linked to aspiration

48:52.120 --> 48:59.640
it's simply a question of tools so whatever your aspiration is keep it there but don't expect

49:00.360 --> 49:07.800
that the world is going to be kind to you generous to you nice to you and treat you in good faith

49:08.600 --> 49:14.680
simply because you want to aspire to that aspiration what I'm saying is you have to accept

49:14.680 --> 49:20.760
the world as it is because they're not going to judge you just based on your grades they're not

49:20.760 --> 49:25.720
just going to judge you based on your raw talent they're not going to just judge you based on your

49:25.720 --> 49:31.160
competence which is what people tell you right people tell you just study hard work hard do the

49:31.160 --> 49:36.760
right thing and it will come together and what I'm saying is that's not true there's a lot more

49:36.760 --> 49:42.680
deeper that you need to dig that doesn't mean lower your aspiration it just means that the

49:42.680 --> 49:47.560
roots that you're going to take is going to be a lot more bumpier because you're realistic about

49:47.560 --> 49:53.160
the world as it is rather than as you would like it to be which is more likely to treat you to a

49:53.160 --> 49:58.520
sort of instant failure any other couple of questions before we wrap all these I've been

49:58.520 --> 50:03.160
told I don't mind I've got time so if as long as you guys go got time I'm happy to take whatever

50:03.160 --> 50:06.840
questions I'll take a few together thank you so much for sharing your story I'm really looking

50:06.840 --> 50:11.000
forward to reading the book you said at the beginning that you ultimately you don't think

50:11.000 --> 50:16.360
education is the key to social mobility yet you yourself are a prime example of somebody that

50:16.360 --> 50:21.960
who's pursued chose to pursue higher education and whose ultimate career and where you are now

50:21.960 --> 50:27.240
is a result of doubt of that so if it's not education and you know we're talking about young

50:27.240 --> 50:32.120
people that maybe don't have parents who can give them the best advice what is the the key

50:32.120 --> 50:38.920
very good question I'll very good question I'm really interested in your definition of success

50:38.920 --> 50:45.720
and I am I my hunch is that that that and you know you just said about being able to buy what

50:45.720 --> 50:50.120
you want and you know that kind of sits with very much within a capitalist idea of success

50:51.080 --> 50:55.960
and how does that sit against happiness and yeah what is what is the measure of being

50:55.960 --> 51:00.840
successful or making it as you refer to but lady there and then there's one more here I think yeah

51:00.840 --> 51:07.240
so I'll I'll take those two and then I haven't forgotten no that's all right we can start there

51:07.240 --> 51:17.880
and then go there I guess to I group you on the one hand where we have to conform but on the other

51:17.880 --> 51:26.760
hand we have to also push like HR departments to have a different system where they're not looking

51:27.800 --> 51:32.040
like maybe maybe they're not allowed to look at people or listen to people until they

51:33.080 --> 51:37.080
make a certain judgment that allows those people to get to a certain degree so I just wouldn't

51:37.080 --> 51:42.120
want to discount that but I totally agree with you what you're saying seems to fit in with yet

51:42.120 --> 51:46.360
you've got to dress a certain way it's not just accents you've got to dress a certain way you've

51:46.360 --> 51:52.520
got to it's your mannerisms it's all sorts of things and totally agree that you have to play the

51:52.520 --> 52:00.280
game to degree how do we best help children or you know children and teenagers yeah good question

52:00.280 --> 52:09.240
I'll take that last one to the lady there just lady there you haven't yet mentioned like inclinations

52:09.240 --> 52:12.600
we talked about motivation but I'm looking at from a slightly different perspective I work a lot with

52:12.600 --> 52:17.640
children with cancer and teenagers with cancer who miss out on a load of school their lives they

52:17.640 --> 52:21.000
can either they've had a lot of bad luck you talk about cycling against the wind and the wind being

52:21.000 --> 52:26.040
behind you their choice when the wind is behind them sometimes they don't even want to be on the

52:26.040 --> 52:30.360
bike like how do you instill that inclination to be hungry to look for the opportunities because

52:30.360 --> 52:33.800
that fits with everything you're talking about because you still have to look for those opportunities

52:33.800 --> 52:37.320
so how do you instill that and what you discuss in the book about yes a very good question that's

52:37.320 --> 52:42.120
a very good question about inclination so just starting out with education what I'm trying to

52:42.120 --> 52:47.320
say is that education is not the answer I'm not suggesting that it's not part of the answer but

52:47.320 --> 52:53.960
it's not even the main answer I would argue simply because if we see education as even having this

52:53.960 --> 52:59.560
relationship with social mobility in the way that politicians talk about it we're setting kids up for

52:59.560 --> 53:05.480
failure what I'm saying instead is that education is just one of those life things like breathing

53:05.560 --> 53:12.440
like sleeping like just peace whatever like just the kind of think of anything that is just a

53:12.440 --> 53:17.800
standard thing that you do when you brush your teeth that's what education is the idea of constantly

53:17.800 --> 53:23.880
obsessing over then linking it to people becoming more socially mobile is where I'm disagreeing

53:24.520 --> 53:28.760
and and I talk about that and the other stuff that I talk about that comes with that is exactly

53:28.760 --> 53:33.880
as I've sort of alluded to in the end you know the circumstances in which you're growing up in

53:33.880 --> 53:39.400
the kind of aspirations you're exposed to by your parents the fact that you can have a decent

53:39.400 --> 53:45.560
diet at home to be able to allow your brain to grow and not have anxiety and not have the

53:45.560 --> 53:51.080
kind of jittery ways in which you're then going to develop issues later on in life the kind of

53:51.080 --> 53:58.920
things about mentoring that allows you to the chapter on mentoring I is subtitled it's subtitled

53:58.920 --> 54:04.280
filling in the blanks so if you don't know what you don't know having those people around you to

54:04.280 --> 54:10.600
be able to show you language so there's loads of other things I argue that make up the bigger

54:10.600 --> 54:16.120
social mobility story but this intense focus on education there was a famous uh Tony Blair

54:16.120 --> 54:21.240
former prime minister's uh speech where he said education education education again that was a

54:21.240 --> 54:25.480
classic example of putting the emphasis in my judgment in the wrong place that's what I mean

54:25.480 --> 54:30.840
so I don't hope I don't want to undermine uh the purpose and need of education just plowing

54:30.840 --> 54:34.200
through a few of the other questions on the question of what what it means to be successful

54:35.160 --> 54:39.480
you have to define that for yourself and I do talk about that in the book I talk about

54:39.480 --> 54:46.760
happiness I do talk about not necessarily seeking out the kind of happiness that means that you are

54:46.760 --> 54:53.000
monetarily more happy but rather that you're you're happy and successful in the sense that

54:53.000 --> 54:58.360
you have pursued what you're good at and what you're not so good at what you enjoy what you don't

54:58.360 --> 55:04.760
enjoy and and the kind of things that allow you to grow as a human being now to ignore money would

55:04.760 --> 55:11.640
be a folly to ignore money and and and income is just nonsense either it's nonsense or you've grown up

55:13.160 --> 55:18.440
you know financially secure and independently wealthy to which extent it means nothing to you

55:18.520 --> 55:23.960
but I say in the book if you're going to try to be for example a lawyer pick an area of law

55:23.960 --> 55:27.960
if you're a socially mobile person pick an area of law that will allow you to earn a lot of money

55:28.520 --> 55:34.760
why why get obsessed over human rights and I want to save the world when you've come from

55:34.760 --> 55:39.640
a very poor set of circumstances in that area those areas of law you're not likely to make

55:39.640 --> 55:44.120
much money and therefore not likely to transform the lives of your family whereas if you pick an

55:44.120 --> 55:48.920
area that does give you a decent income then you can change your life you can change that don't be

55:48.920 --> 55:54.600
ashamed of that there's no shame in that this shame is when you make it your sole central goal

55:54.600 --> 56:02.520
finally on that it's really interesting how football i'm a big football fan is a huge meritocracy

56:02.520 --> 56:08.440
if you think about it it's raw raw talent and it's no wonder that a lot of the people who make it

56:08.440 --> 56:13.880
into it are just dirt poor dirt dirt poor most of them and then when you meet a lot of these kids

56:13.880 --> 56:18.040
who are growing up in inner city london today ask the vast majority that most kids even if they're

56:18.040 --> 56:22.920
growing up in nice circumstances want to be footballers but disproportionately poor kids

56:22.920 --> 56:28.440
want to be footballers why because it's the first opportunity that they think they can have through

56:28.440 --> 56:35.080
their own hard work to change their lives there is something there on the question of inclination

56:35.960 --> 56:41.240
i'm not a scientist i don't know what instinctively occurs to people but i do talk about

56:41.880 --> 56:49.080
how much your early life exposure can make a difference to your inclination

56:49.080 --> 56:56.120
so for example if you're growing up in a household where every morning everyone's leaving for work

56:56.120 --> 57:01.880
at six in the in the morning and getting up and having breakfast as opposed to what is often

57:01.880 --> 57:06.920
pejoratively termed by different governments working up in how waking up in households where

57:06.920 --> 57:12.600
the curtains are never drawn until midday i think that there is something there about an

57:12.600 --> 57:19.320
inclination that happens on for a child very early on that then sets the tone for the rest of their

57:19.320 --> 57:24.920
lives but if you're somebody facing cancer and lots of issues with cancer and problems like that

57:24.920 --> 57:30.440
chances of your inclinations being quite there is very hard because you probably believe i don't know

57:30.440 --> 57:35.560
but you probably believe and feel the life's giving you a pretty raw deal and so why are you

57:35.560 --> 57:41.080
going to be more inclined to get up if you think i didn't deserve this and now i'm ridden with this

57:41.640 --> 57:47.080
horrible disease that i have no control over so i haven't gone into too much detail but i do talk

57:47.080 --> 57:53.880
about inclination to an extent on the final question i remember it briefly but you're gonna have to

57:53.880 --> 58:01.640
just tell me one word and i'll it'll come to me the hr the hr it's a very good point so the hr

58:01.720 --> 58:06.840
points is a really interesting one so we have to do more to help hr so i did i interviewed a lot of

58:06.840 --> 58:12.600
hr people for this book and what was really fascinating was they said to me actually we had

58:12.600 --> 58:19.000
this amazing young lady she was really talented she was so good but she had an sx accent we can't

58:19.000 --> 58:23.800
put her she was you know what she said to me she said i'd love to hire her but i can't put her in

58:23.800 --> 58:31.000
front of the clients so think about that you get to a point where you've managed to convince the

58:31.000 --> 58:37.400
hr people to not judge somebody based on their mannerisms or the way they speak but then the next

58:37.400 --> 58:42.200
another hurdle appears out of nowhere where she says but what are the clients going to say

58:43.400 --> 58:48.840
i can't put her in front of the clients so then i say we need to move towards an environment where

58:48.840 --> 58:53.160
if the hr department has decided this person's competent then you should be prepared to put

58:53.160 --> 58:58.440
that person in front of the clients or tell your clients to take their business elsewhere now

58:59.160 --> 59:04.360
what company's going to do that on their bottom line come on come on think about it no not many

59:04.360 --> 59:08.920
companies are going to be prepared to take that hit right now but we're slowly moving in the right

59:08.920 --> 59:13.880
direction and the point i'm making is that what i'm learning in this process of writing is that

59:14.760 --> 59:21.480
every time we seem to find a solution we seem to hit our heads against a new problem that we may

59:21.480 --> 59:26.440
or may not have noticed before that has always been there but has become to the forefront of

59:26.440 --> 59:36.440
where it is anyway thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
