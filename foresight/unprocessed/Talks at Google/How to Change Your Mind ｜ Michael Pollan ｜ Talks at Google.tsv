0	16440	Thank you, David. Thanks very much. Can everybody hear me in the back? So I get to talk about
16440	22440	my trips, but you don't. It doesn't seem fair. So I'm going to just talk for about 10 minutes
22440	25540	and just tell you a little bit about what this book's about, and then I'd love to take
25540	32940	your questions and let your interests dictate the path that we take this afternoon. First,
32940	39100	thanks. Thank you very much for coming. This book is a real departure for me. Those of
39100	42460	you who know me as someone who writes about food might think it's a little weird that
42460	48140	I'm turning to psychedelics. But in my head, there is some continuity as well as change.
48140	54180	And the continuity is that I see my writing about food as part of a larger interest in
54180	60460	writing about nature. And the way we eat affects nature dramatically, more than anything
60460	66580	else we do, actually, in terms of changing the landscape of the planet and the atmosphere.
66580	71820	It's your most powerful engagement with the natural world. And I've always been interested
71820	78500	in that engagement. And we use nature and plants, especially for many things. Food is
78500	86020	an obvious one. Beauty is another. But something we almost all use plants for that I've always
86020	92700	been kind of curious about is to change consciousness. Most of us today probably use the plant to
92700	98700	change the contents of your mind, or at least the feeling tone in your mind, you know, whether
98700	104420	it was coffee or tea or a cigarette or cannabis or whatever it is. I mean, this is something
104420	110340	we do in every culture on earth, does it? With the one exception that proves the rule,
110340	114540	the Inuit do not have any plant drugs. But it's only because not even grow where they
114540	121420	live. As soon as they go somewhere else, they get with the program. So it's been a longstanding
121420	126460	interest. And to me, it's all part of that story about this fascinating engagement we
126460	132740	have with other species that defines us and reveals a lot about us. So I've, and I wrote
132740	138420	a little bit about cannabis and botany of desire. And I wrote a long piece about growing
138420	144060	opium in my garden back in the 90s. And I've written about medical marijuana. So I had
144060	150460	this interest. And then along comes this new research, which I began reading about. In
150460	160060	2010, I read about a really interesting odd study where researchers at NYU and Johns Hopkins
160060	164380	were giving psilocybin, this is the ingredient in magic mushrooms, they were synthesizing
164380	170500	it, to people who had cancer diagnoses, people very sick, many of them terminal, in the hopes
170500	176420	that they would have what they call the mystical experience, a powerful spiritual experience
176420	181100	that would change their attitude toward their death and help them essentially to die with
181100	188020	more peace. These were all patients who were struggling with depression, anxiety and fear,
188060	193420	profound fear. And the stories, so I started writing about that because it seemed like
193420	198380	the last thing I would want to do is trip when I was facing a terminal diagnosis to
198380	206540	lose control like that. And you would presumably have a very dark experience. So I started
206540	212020	interviewing these people for a piece I did in the New Yorker in 2015. And just to give
212020	216460	you one example to give you the flavor of it, I remember talking to this woman, she
216500	222900	was a figure skating instructor in New York, in Manhattan, she was about 60. She was not
222900	229060	a psychonaut, she'd never used psychedelics before. And she had ovarian cancer. And her
229060	234220	cancer had been treated successfully, but she was paralyzed by the fear of recurrence.
234220	239380	She just couldn't function because she thought any day now this could be back. So she entered
239420	247900	into this trial at NYU and had a high dose psilocybin experience. And I should explain how
247900	252300	this is done because the image you may have in your head of taking psychedelics, you know,
252300	256180	taking a handful of mushrooms and going to a concert or something, this is not how it is
256180	263420	used in a clinical setting. It's a very controlled experience, it's guided. So you work with two
263420	269180	guides, a man and a woman, they prepare you over a course of several sessions as to what
269220	275580	to expect. So they'll talk to you what to do if the experience becomes frightening, which it
275580	280540	often does, and how to navigate that. They call it the flight instructions. And their main
280540	286500	advice is, you know, if you see a staircase, go up it. If you see a door, open it. If you see a
286500	291460	monster, don't run away. Just step right up to it and say, what are you doing in my head? What
291460	298620	do you have to teach me? In other words, surrender to the experience. Trust, relax. You
298620	305060	know, they quote John Lennon, relax the mind and float downstream. And that's very important
305060	309300	advice. And it's often the difference between a good trip and a bad trip. A bad trip is
309300	313420	essentially a panic reaction against what's happening in your head, which is very heavy.
313420	321020	I mean, you're experiencing your ego dissolving, in fact, in front of you. And then they sit with
321020	325940	you for the whole experience, and they give you a helping hand if you're getting upset or
325980	330380	struggling, and they take you to the bathroom and give you a glass of water. And then afterwards
330380	336500	is a really key moment called the integration session, where they sit with you, you tell the
336500	340820	story of your trip. And it usually is this narrative. It's almost like this intracyclic
340820	346020	movie where you go different places, and you try to make sense of it and apply the lessons to
346020	354580	your life. So in the case of this woman, her name is Dina Bezer. She had this trip, and there were
354580	361260	many elements I won't go into. It was like six hours. And she went into her body, imaginatively,
361260	367420	and she saw this black mass under her ribcage. And that was her fear. It wasn't her cancer,
367420	373020	because that wasn't in the right place. But she saw what she realized was her fear. And she screamed
373020	377060	at her fear. And you have to see this woman. She's a very timid, small woman. And she said,
377300	386420	get the fuck out of my body. And it did. It disappeared. The black mask was gone. And afterwards,
386420	393140	she said, I realized during that experience that I can't control my cancer, but I can control my
393140	398820	fear. And that distinction meant everything to her. And one of the hallmarks of the psychedelic
398820	405460	experience is that whatever insights you have during it have a force, the likes of which you've
405460	410580	never experienced. These are not just opinions or insights that reveal truths. This is something
410580	415940	William James a long time ago writing about the mystical experience called the noetic sense.
415940	423380	It's a very uncanny thing. And it's what allows people to change that if they think, say they're
423380	428580	trying to quit smoking, and they have some epiphany that, gee, my breath is really precious,
428580	433860	I should not ruin it by smoking, suddenly that'll be so strongly held as a belief that they can
433860	439140	actually stop smoking. So anyway, so that's the kind of experience that I was learning about.
439140	443540	And I became fascinated to understand the neuroscience behind it, what's going on in the
443540	448820	brain when people are taking one of these trips. And we now know some interesting things about
448820	453780	that. If you're interested, I can talk about that. And also the history of it, like, what happened to
453780	461860	psychedelics in the 60s that they became so stigmatized that research stopped. There had been a
461860	468260	very productive period of research all through the 50s that was yielding really promising results
468260	474820	in the treatment of alcoholism, in dealing with people who were dying, depression, anxiety, obsession.
474820	483220	And then after this moral panic that hits the culture around 1965, nobody studies it anymore.
483220	489380	The funding dries up, scientists are a little embarrassed by it. And we had an unprecedented
489380	496740	situation where a promising line of scientific investigation was stopped. That never happens.
496740	502740	And we lost 30, 35 years of research into psychedelics. Thankfully, it's resuming.
502740	507220	And my book is very much about the Renaissance, even though I go back and look at the history and
507220	512820	figure out why we had this panic reaction about them. And try to look at them in a very matter
512820	518260	of fact way as interesting tools, interesting tools for understanding the mind and for healing
518260	522660	the mind. Now, we haven't proven all this. There's still more research to be done.
523620	529700	We're kind of in phase two, and there's three phases to FDA drug approval. But so far the
529700	536180	results have been remarkably encouraging. It is one of the most powerful psychiatric interventions
536180	542740	that the researchers have ever seen. And we're in a situation where mental health care is so
542740	549140	broken in this country. It's failing to reach half the people who need it. The last major
549140	554980	innovation were the SSRI antidepressants in the late 80s. There really hasn't been anything since
554980	563540	that. And so we need some new ways of thinking. And along comes this powerful old but new innovation.
563540	570180	And the research is, you know, it's being privately funded for the most part. Big
570180	573780	pharma is not interested in this. There's no intellectual property that you can control.
575540	581860	But a lot of donors, many in the tech community actually have stepped up and are funding this
581860	587780	research. And I was just at a fundraiser where, you know, the last seven million dollars was raised.
587780	594020	And so we will find out. We'll get the real test, the scientific test of what are these drugs good
594020	598500	for. And then there's the question of what are they, what value might they have for the rest of
598500	605140	us? Because they help people who have serious problems. But as one researcher put it to me,
605140	610740	they're very important for the betterment of well people. And I can talk a little bit about
610740	615940	that too. So as part of this, because it's sort of my brand to do immersion journalism, you know,
615940	623060	when I wrote about the cattle industry, I bought a steer. When I wanted to learn about architecture,
623060	631540	I built a house. So of course I had to experiment. And I found some guides underground. And there
631540	636740	is a thriving community of underground guides in America who could give me an experience very much
636740	643860	like the ones at NYU and Hopkins. And they were, you know, transformative experiences, some of them.
644500	649300	Some of the most meaningful experiences of my life. And the idea that a molecule could occasion
649380	655300	that is to me still kind of mind blowing. So I'm going to, though, I've given you lots of leads
655300	660980	and things you might want to follow up on. And I'm happy to talk about anything. I advise you
660980	667380	not to talk about your own experiences. I want to welcome the Google Microdosing Club to today's event.
667380	681300	Anyway, so yeah, question. Alright, so I don't want to be the devil's advocate here.
681300	686420	Please do. This idea that we're going to, we're going to give somebody this drug,
686420	689300	they're going to have this transformative experience, and then it's going to change them.
690420	695140	I understand how that makes sense to me. But the idea that that change would necessarily be
695700	701140	for the better, that person comes back from a trip and decides they're going to quit smoking,
701140	705700	that's great. But why doesn't a person come back from a trip and decide they need to kill their
705700	715060	neighbor? Right. How do we break the symmetry there? Set and setting. So one of the important
715060	721140	features of psychedelics is how little the experience is foreordained or dictated by
721140	727780	the drug itself. The drug is like an unspecific mental amplifier. And so your expectation and
727780	732580	intention is very important to what happens. And one of the things that happens in the preparation
732580	737860	is that the guide is helping you set an intention. Like I want to quit smoking. I want to confront my
737860	746180	mortality. And you will usually have an experience in that realm because that's what you've been
746260	755380	primed to have. Could the drugs be used for evil? Well, we have the case of Charles Manson. Manson
755940	762820	apparently, we don't know that all the details, but used LSD on his little posse of what would
762820	770500	become murderers. And the drugs are incredibly suggestible and that you could imagine a charismatic
770500	775620	figure using them that way. Now, the CIA sought to use them that way too. The CIA had a very active
775620	780260	research program in the 50s. The same time all this university work was going on in the 50s to
780260	787460	help people, the CIA was trying to weaponize LSD and psilocybin. And they thought they went through
787460	794660	a series of different paradigms. One was you would use it as a truth serum. People could tell you
794660	801940	the truth if you gave it to them in interrogation. People said crazy shit. It didn't work. There
801940	809860	was no truth in that. And then they thought, well, we could use it to have foreign leaders. We could
809860	814260	dose them and they would do embarrassing things. That might work. I don't know. And we don't know
814260	818660	how far they got with it. And then the other one was his mind control, right? That you could use
818660	824100	this drug to control people's minds. As far as we know, that didn't work either, but we don't know
824100	832500	for sure. And we shouldn't put too much by them. So I think it all depends on your therapist and
832500	841540	how the situation is. People don't generally have violent episodes after psychedelics. In general,
841540	847140	the experience tends to be one where you discover that love is the most important thing in the
847140	854980	universe. And this hallmark card platitudes suddenly becomes this profundity. And it is a
854980	859620	profundity, but we've heard it so many times that it's banal. There's an interesting line between
859620	867060	the banal and the profound. And psychedelics definitely worked on that line. So I think
867060	871940	we should be mindful of that possibility, but I don't think we certainly haven't seen anything
871940	877300	like that. There have been a thousand dosings of volunteers since this next, this new wave of
877300	883380	research. And there has not been a single adverse event. No psychotic breaks, no jumping out of
883380	889220	windows. But there's no question that people can do stupid things on psychedelics as they can on
889220	898420	alcohol and any number of other drugs. So thanks for your question. Do you have any theories of why
898420	904900	our brains are wired to react to things from plants and fungi? And are there any things from the
904900	912820	animal kingdom that do the same thing? Well, animals do like plant drugs also. We have many cases of,
912820	918500	I mean, if you've had a cat, never given them catnip. No, I meant like any venoms that... Oh,
918500	925140	yeah. Well, one of the psychedelics I experimented with is something called Five-Meo-DMT. This is
925140	931860	a pretty obscure psychedelic. I see a couple of nods in the crowd that... Actually, only one.
934180	940820	That is the smoked venom of the Sonoran Desert Toad. Somebody figured that out, right? I mean,
941940	951860	what a species, huh? But why are we wired for this is a really interesting question. So the way the
951860	960180	drugs appear to work in the mind is that they bind to your serotonin, one particular serotonin
960180	965300	receptor that's very common in the cortex. And they start a cascade of effects. That's what
965300	971460	neuroscientists say when they really don't know what's happening for a while. But that that in
971460	978180	turn eventually down-regulates something called the default mode network. I'll tell you what that
978180	983620	is because it's very important, actually, and it explains a lot. So when they first started doing
983620	989140	fMRI imaging of people's brains on psychedelics, they would basically inject you with psilocybin
989140	993700	and slide you into the MRI machine, and you'd have what could be a very scary experience.
995780	999860	And then they took these pictures, and they expected to see lots of extra activity because
999860	1005300	there's such fireworks in the experience. But they were very surprised to find that, in fact,
1005300	1012180	this particular network went quiet. And this is a network that's very active when you're not on task,
1012180	1016740	okay? It's in a seesaw relationship with the attentional networks when you're like working or
1016740	1021380	something like that. But when you're asked to just lie back in an MRI machine and they're trying to
1021380	1027140	get a baseline, this lights up. And they were like, why is that? What is it doing? Well, this appears
1027140	1033700	to be the part of your brain that is active when you're mind wandering, when you're ruminating or
1033700	1039700	worrying or reflecting on yourself. It's a center of self-reflection. It's also involved in time
1039700	1045780	travel, the ability to think about the future or the past. And it's involved in theory of mind.
1045780	1051860	This is the term for the ability to think about the mental states of other people,
1051860	1056420	central to compassion and imagination, things like that. And lastly, it's involved in something
1056420	1063620	called the narrative self or experiential self. And this is kind of where you knit together what
1063620	1071460	happens to you at any given moment with the story of who you are, based on who you've been and who
1071460	1078500	you want to be. And it's kind of where we sustain that story that our sense of self depends on.
1079220	1086260	And so this network, so if the ego has an address, it's in the default mode network.
1086820	1093300	This is what the research shows. It's really interesting that this is what gets down-regulated
1093300	1098900	during the experience. And it chimes with the experience of ego dissolution people report
1098900	1104980	on a high-dose experience. I had an experience on a guided psilocybin trip where I felt my
1104980	1110660	sense of self scattered to the wind like a blizzard of post-its. And then I looked out,
1110660	1114980	and I don't know, who's the eye who's looking out at this? I mean, there was a split in consciousness
1114980	1122260	where I could watch myself then get spread over the landscape like a coat of paint out there.
1122260	1126500	And I was fine with it. This other self was fine with it. And it was this kind of very
1127300	1133700	unperturbable consciousness that could behold this thing. And I realized I'm not identical to my ego.
1134420	1141060	And that's a very important insight to acquire, I think, and very useful. But what was going on
1141620	1145540	in my brain was the default mode network was going offline for a period of time.
1146100	1151620	The sense of self dissolves. And then something else happens, which is other networks in the brain,
1151620	1156660	which normally would only communicate through this hub, start talking directly to each other.
1156660	1161540	And there's a map in the book of the brain on a placebo and the brain on psilocybin.
1161540	1165860	And one looks like the root map of American Airlines. And the other looks like the root map
1165860	1173300	of some little commuter line that only goes to 10 places. So new connections form. And what are
1173300	1179940	those new connections? I mean, that's the interesting question. Is that your, say, your hippocampus
1179940	1186180	talking to your visual cortex? And so you start having images of things that you fear or desire?
1186820	1192500	Is it the basis of hallucination? Or is it perhaps the basis of a new metaphor or new insight
1192500	1198340	or new meme? We don't know yet. That's the next step is to really understand that. So these are
1198340	1205300	temporary changes in the brain. Eventually your ego kind of reconsolidates. But having had a glimpse
1205300	1212340	of that other way to behold experience is very powerful. And in my integration session, I said
1212420	1218020	to Mary, who was my guide, I said, well, okay, I've had this amazing experience of ego dissolution.
1218020	1222020	And I realized I'm not identical to my ego. I can have a little distance on it.
1223060	1228100	But I said, my ego is back in uniform and on patrol. So what good is that? And she said,
1228100	1233860	well, basically, you've had a taste of another way to react to life, a little less defensive,
1233860	1238020	a little less trigger happy, and you can cultivate that. And I said, how? And she said, through
1238020	1243140	meditation. And meditation is kind of how you keep alive the psychedelic experience. It makes
1243140	1247460	you a very good meditator. Although I know you're not supposed to say good or bad meditator.
1249700	1256820	But being trapped in that language. So that's kind of a real shorthand of what we understand
1256820	1262660	about the neuroscience. The neuroscientific investigation of this phenomenon is absolutely
1262660	1267780	fascinating. And for me, that chapter of the book was the most challenging to write. Well,
1267780	1271620	not the most challenging, but one of the most challenging and fascinating to learn about.
1271620	1281780	So thanks for your question. Hi. So I have heard rumors that monks have been able to achieve
1281780	1290740	similar thing to a psychedelic trip. Do you know anything about what that entails? Or if there's
1290740	1297380	any research that leads to it being a strong? I mean, there's anecdotal research that's really
1297380	1303620	interesting. So one very relevant fact, at the same time we were doing this imaging work on
1303620	1309540	psilocybin in the human brain, there was another researcher at Yale, imaging the brains of very
1309540	1315060	experienced meditators, people who had 10,000 hours of meditation experience, and they would go
1315060	1322340	into the fMRI and meditate. And their brains looked identical. They also had this suppression
1322340	1328180	of the default mode network. And of course, that is the state of kind of selflessness that people
1328180	1334820	report coming out of meditation. In terms of the monks, these are people with really long
1334820	1341060	experience meditation, meditation, and that they can almost it will probably quiet the default
1341140	1346740	mode network. There's a famous story about Ram Das, Richard Alpert, who was Timothy Leary's
1347620	1353460	collaborator, went during the Harvard psilocybin project in the early 60s. This guy went on to
1353460	1360500	become a guru, basically. And he's still alive. He's in Hawaii. And he was very interested in
1360500	1367060	psychedelics and then found Hindu religion. And he went to India and he told his guru about LSD.
1367780	1372500	And his guru said, I want to try it. I want to see what happens because you're telling me you're
1372500	1381380	reaching this spiritual plane on this drug and that's my territory. And so Ram Das apparently gave
1381380	1388980	him 600 micrograms of LSD, which is a beyond heroic dose. And that's what the guy wanted. He said,
1388980	1396020	give me as much as you have. And the monk, or whatever he is, he's a guru, I guess, takes it.
1396020	1403860	And so nothing happened. Is this true? I mean, it's, you know, Ram Das tells the story and
1403860	1410500	swears that it's true. But it goes to your point. There are other ways to achieve the same effect.
1411940	1417220	Psychedelics are probably a shortcut to becoming a really good meditator. But my guess is we will
1417220	1423860	find at some point that all the disciplines, the spiritual disciplines that share this sense of
1424260	1431940	of transcending the ego are doing the same thing in the brain, that that is where that's
1431940	1436900	happening. And I'm thinking of sensory deprivation, you know, if you get into these tanks, sensory
1436900	1444260	deprivation tanks, they're sort of coming back. They were a thing in the 60s, or fasting, or prayer,
1444260	1449220	or the right kind of music and breathing exercises. One of the psychedelic trips I had
1449220	1455380	involved no drugs, something called holotropic breathwork. It's based on a yogic breathing
1455380	1461220	exercise where you essentially hyperventilate. You breathe really fast, you exhale more than you
1461220	1468660	inhale, and you enter a trance state. It's the most uncanny thing. And my guess is that
1469220	1475460	hyperventilation is starving the default mode network of oxygen, and reducing the activity
1475460	1481060	there. So this is all areas to be explored. We may find other ways to achieve the same thing.
1481700	1484420	But I think it's all connected. Thank you so much. Thank you.
1486580	1491540	Hi. One of the interesting trends that I've read about on blogs and whatnot is the rise of
1491540	1497780	microdosing. For those who don't know, microdosing is taking small doses of psychedelics on a
1497780	1504180	somewhat regular basis, far too small to actually cause any sort of trip. And proponents of microdosing
1504260	1508580	claim that it can help with things such as depression and anxiety, improve mood, improve
1508580	1512900	creativity. I'm wondering if you've got a chance to investigate microdosing at all in your book.
1512900	1516660	And if you get a sense that some of the renewed research interest for
1516660	1520980	high dose experience might carry over into researching whether microdosing is clinically
1520980	1527460	significant or not. Excellent question. So microdosing is a very interesting phenomenon.
1527460	1531700	As the questioner said, it's taking a subperceptual dose, often with LSD,
1531700	1536180	about 10 micrograms every third or fourth day. And the reason you don't take it every day is
1536180	1540820	because it would lose its effect. The drugs kind of cancel themselves out at a certain point.
1542580	1547460	Many people anecdotally report success with this, that it's kind of a brain tonic,
1547460	1550340	and it does help with depression. There's a wonderful book written about it,
1550340	1555220	if you want to follow up, by Ayelet Waldman called A Really Good Day. And she's someone who's
1555220	1562100	struggled with depression for many years and found more relief on this regime of microdosing,
1562100	1568900	and she's been through the whole pharmacopoeia, I'm sure. The reason I don't spend a lot of time
1568900	1574500	on it in the book is that there isn't yet anything beyond the anecdotal reports. They're
1574500	1580260	interesting, they're really provocative, and they're being systematically connected. If you go online,
1580260	1584580	there's a guy named James Fadiman, who is one of the first generation researchers,
1584580	1589460	who's advising people on the protocol and soliciting reports and getting this interesting
1590260	1597620	dataset. But it has not been trialed the way the large dose psilocybin has. I hear that these
1597620	1602740	trials are about to happen, and so we may get some really solid information on whether microdosing
1602740	1608260	works. The fact is, though, there is such a strong placebo effect with psychedelics.
1609060	1614820	They're so suggestible that it's very easy to see how it would work. Just the very idea that
1614820	1621540	you're taking a small dose of LSD probably would have an effect. But is it a pharmacological effect
1621540	1629780	or a placebo effect? That's what remains to be learned. I'm skeptical about it. I do want the
1629780	1636820	research to happen, and this interest in macrodosing, if you will, has stimulated people to fund some
1636820	1641940	research, some of which will be underground and some of which will be above ground. So I'm very
1641940	1649780	excited to see what they come up with. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks for being here today. Wozniak
1649780	1654260	pretty famously said that LSD was one of the things that differentiated Apple from Microsoft.
1654260	1660900	Yeah. I think Job said that too. And at this organization, we selected, apocryphally,
1660900	1663700	Eric Schmidt, a CEO because he was the candidate that been to Burning Man.
1663940	1669380	As an external observer, I'm curious, what are your observations about the intersection between
1669380	1675300	psychedelics and the technology or the tech industry? It's a really interesting relationship.
1675940	1680420	So Steve Jobs famously said too, it had been formative to his intellectual development. And I
1680420	1684420	thought it was him, but maybe it was Wozniak who said that Windows would have been a much better
1684420	1691380	product had Gates ever taken LSD. It was like a really mean thing to say. I think Gates immediately
1691380	1695780	said, but I did, but I did. But it didn't work. It must not have been enough.
1698900	1703940	And I thought this was the beginning of the tech community's interest in these drugs.
1703940	1707860	And because it's very current, I mean, you know better than I, but I mean, I've talked to lots
1707860	1712420	of people in Silicon Valley and it's a big part of the culture right now. Microdosing,
1712420	1717540	macro dosing, there's, I mean, I know one prominent tech company that uses it in their
1717620	1723460	management training, you know, LSD. So it's, there's a lot of, you know,
1725380	1729060	a lot of interest there. And it is the tech community, as I said, that's funding a lot of
1729060	1738500	this research. But it turns out that engineers have been interested in LSD back in the 50s.
1739140	1744100	And that there's this very interesting episode before Timothy Leary and the whole 60s psychedelic
1744100	1750420	story that we think we know so well. There was this research period. And there was this very
1750420	1754980	interesting character who's kind of a counterpart to Leary named Al Hubbard. And I tell his story
1754980	1760180	in the book. He's a very mysterious figure. He's got, he's involved with the OSS, which became the
1760180	1770020	CIA. He's playing both sides of many worlds. But he had a vision in 1951 that told him he could be
1770020	1776420	involved in a major civilization change. He realized it was LSD. He went to Sando's where,
1776420	1781220	which owned the patent on it. It was a Swiss pharmaceutical company, persuaded them to give
1781220	1789700	him something like a liter bottle of LSD, which probably is enough to trip a third of the population
1789700	1795060	of earth at that point. I mean, just an incredible amount, which he keeps buried in Death Valley at
1795060	1800100	his place. And anyway, he's a great character. He's so much more interesting than Leary. So he's,
1800100	1804820	he becomes the Johnny Apple seed of LSD. And, but he's got a different theory. He said,
1805460	1810420	he was kind of a conservative guy. He wanted to turn on the elite. So he was going to do captains
1810420	1818100	of industry, you know, engineers, artists, people in the church, the Catholic church.
1818100	1823620	And he would go around with the satchel tripping people. Remember, it was legal then. And he became
1823620	1830820	a very gifted guide. So he has his eye on the tech world as one of the places where you could
1830820	1837780	have this multiplier effect. So he turns on a couple of engineers who are working at a company
1837780	1842100	called Ampex, which is actually one of the first Silicon Valley companies in the 50s.
1842100	1846420	They make magnetic tape on which, as you know, all computer information was stored,
1846420	1851780	but also video and sound recording. They had 40,000 people in the valley before it was called
1851780	1858660	Silicon Valley. And, and the head of strategic planning, he turned on another guy and actually
1858660	1865140	Ampex for a while was going to be the world's first psychedelic company. And, but the, the president
1865140	1870420	was Jewish and Al Hubbard was Catholic and he kept bringing in crucifixes and things and the
1870420	1877220	president said, go away. And so, but anyway, so these engineers though were so taken with this
1877220	1884180	experience that they left the company, a group of three or four engineers and started a big research,
1884980	1891780	something called the International Foundation for Advanced Research. And they were doing a lot of
1892420	1896580	psychedelic research. And I've always been interested as to why engineers in particular
1896580	1901860	had such a strong reaction to this drug. And I talked to, I talked to a couple engineers about
1902420	1907380	and you can tell me if this chimes with your sense of things. But this guy, this one guy in
1907380	1913700	particular told me that, oh, and the, some of the early chip designers were into LSD. It's very
1913700	1918100	hard to design a chip without a computer. But of course, at the beginning you had to. And you
1918100	1926100	could hold this complex 3D structure in your head with the help of the drug. And this guy said, oh,
1926100	1929860	and one of the, sorry, one of the early people at the International Foundation for Advanced
1929860	1934260	Study who was tripped was someone you probably know, if you know your history of your industry,
1934260	1941780	but a Doug Engelbart, right, who invented, you know, the mouse and the interface and email and
1941780	1947540	like everything, right? There was this mother of all demos. Well, that guy got LSD from those
1947540	1953940	Ampex guys. And under the influence, they were doing a creativity study. He invented something then.
1954740	1960580	It wasn't that profound. It was something he called a tinkle toy to toiletrain boys and was
1960580	1966660	something you could like aim a stream of urine at and it would make things happen. Okay, it's not
1966660	1975460	quite the, you know, the mouse, but it was pretty cool. But it primed the pump, you know. So anyway,
1975460	1981300	where was I? So this engineer was talking to you said, well, the problem, if you're an engineer,
1981300	1986900	as opposed to a scientist, scientists can like their goal is to reduce problems to the simplest
1986900	1993060	terms. But engineers are faced with an irreducible complexity and number of variables. So the
1993060	1999220	challenge is different. The challenge becomes finding pattern. And psychedelics, one of the
1999220	2005300	things that happens is you find pattern where you didn't see it before. And that he thought was why
2005380	2011060	so many engineers found this a useful tool. I think that's fascinating. I think there's,
2011060	2017380	John Markham wrote an interesting history about Silicon Valley and the 60s. And there's some
2017380	2024580	very good stuff on on drugs. And he interviewed jobs about his experience. But yeah, it's part
2024580	2033140	of the tradition you're in. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Hi. So you talked a little bit about
2033140	2037860	how like every culture in the world has experienced this to some degree or is integrated into their
2037860	2042020	their culture. And I'm curious from a sort of anthropological perspective, because I imagine
2042020	2048260	there's a huge range in the way that that these drugs are applied, right? It's a select few or
2048260	2052980	it's open to everyone or it's ritualistic or it's ordinary or whatever. Are there other sort of
2052980	2060180	cultural patterns that can be deduced or associated and, you know, from from drug use within those
2060260	2064260	it's a good question. I actually think we have a lot to learn from the traditional use of these
2064260	2069620	drugs. So we're going to stay on psychedelics. And there are lots of plant drugs that are not
2069620	2074660	that controversial like caffeine, although in some cultures they might be. But psychedelics have been
2074660	2081460	used for it looks like several thousand years. It appears that the ancient Greeks, all the writers
2081460	2087300	you've heard of participated in an annual ritual that involved what seems to be a psychedelic.
2087620	2093700	It was called the Kikion. It was an annual rite in honor of Demeter, harvest related.
2094500	2101620	It was called the Eleusinian Mysteries. And everybody was sworn to secrecy about this.
2101620	2107220	So we don't know that much about it. But everybody took this potion and went to the underworld,
2107220	2112340	had experiences of a beyond and it was very profound. And it was the only time you were ever
2112340	2118020	allowed to take this drug. We don't know what the drug was. And in fact, one person was caught
2118020	2123380	using the drug at like a party and, you know, was, you know, imprisoned or killed or something.
2123380	2131300	It was a big crime. The lesson I think the takeaway from lots of traditional cultures use
2131300	2138740	is that they recognize that these were very powerful medicines not to be treated casually.
2139300	2144260	And that they all surrounded the use of their plant medicine, as they often call it,
2144900	2152900	with ritual, ceremony, elders in attendance. It was never careless. It was never casual.
2152900	2158180	It was never recreational. It was a profound experience. And I think when the drugs hit the
2158180	2165860	West, beginning in the late fifties, early sixties, we didn't have any container for them.
2166260	2171140	We didn't have rituals. We just kind of like took a handful of mushrooms and went to a concert
2171140	2178100	or we drank LSD from the punch bowl. And I think that's why some people really got in trouble.
2179300	2184500	And so that the lesson that we failed to learn was that, yes, these drugs have an ancient lineage,
2184500	2188740	but look how they were used. Look at what those cultures learned by trial and error.
2189540	2196660	And now we see it in shamanic ceremonies in South America. There were mushroom cults in Mexico
2196660	2202100	that went back, we don't know how long, but at least a thousand years. But they were always taken
2202100	2210420	in a group with guidance, with someone who wasn't taking the drugs, and with enormous care. And
2210420	2215140	I think that's what we lost. And we need to now invent that container for ourselves. Maybe it's
2215220	2220100	this therapeutic protocol I'm describing. I'm not sure. But that's the cultural work that needs to
2220100	2231700	be done. So thank you. Sure. I was wondering whether in your research, you'd come across the video
2232420	2242340	of a debate from 1967 between Timothy Leary and Jerome Lethvin at MIT. No, Jerome Lethvin.
2243060	2249060	For those who don't recognize the name, Jerome Lethvin was one of the pioneers of neuroscience.
2249060	2257060	He was one of the four authors of one of the first papers on the physiology of perception
2257060	2264340	titled What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain. And he was also one of the most charismatic
2264340	2274100	professors at MIT in the 1960s. And they held this debate sometime in 1967. And Leary went first and
2274100	2283220	he had the whole audience lulled into going along. He was very charismatic. And Lethvin got up and
2283220	2288660	said, bullshit. I think it may have been the first time bullshit was allowed to be said on
2288660	2300820	broadcast television. Anyway, Lethvin's biggest argument against taking LSD was the phenomenon
2300820	2307380	of uncontrolled flashbacks and how that could get people into trouble. But as I was standing
2307380	2314740	in line here, I looked it up and it's on YouTube. The whole thing actually ran about two hours.
2314740	2322420	WGBH, public TV station, recorded it and broadcast it at a one hour edited version.
2322420	2330180	So Lethvin, L-E-T-V-I-N? Yes. Maybe one or two teas. Well, this is a good occasion to talk about
2330180	2337620	risk. So let me, unless you want to frame the question, but I'd love to. I'll let you talk
2337620	2343700	about it, but I just wanted to ask one more side question. When you talk about food, you almost
2343780	2349620	always bring a bag of groceries. Yeah, oh yeah. I was wondering if you brought a bag with you.
2352820	2362420	Let me tell you a little tutorial on the law. So I was a very nervous Nellie doing these
2362420	2368340	experiences. I didn't have a lot of experience with psychedelics in college. And even after,
2368340	2372100	I was really too afraid to take these drugs. I didn't think I was psychologically sturdy enough
2372100	2378900	at that point in my life. And so before I dove in for this project, I did a lot of research
2379860	2384500	as I want to do as a journalist to figure out, well, what are the dangers? Because there are
2384500	2389300	lots of stories you heard in the 60s. People staring at the sun to let go blind. That was one
2389300	2395620	story, scrambling of your chromosomes. Both those stories, by the way, were, one was made up. The
2395620	2400500	first was made up and that's been proven. And the chromosome story was withdrawn within months.
2400500	2407060	It was just really bad research. Psychotic breaks and that did happen sometimes. There are people
2407060	2413940	at risk for schizophrenia that an acid trip was what tripped them off. But a lot of what was,
2414660	2418340	well, let me divide it into two. There's physiological risk and there's psychological
2418340	2427780	risk. On the physiological side, it's stunning how, I don't want to overstate this, but that how,
2427780	2433620	compared to other drugs that we take routinely, how non-toxic, relatively non-toxic, classic
2433620	2441860	psychedelics are. And I'm talking about LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline. There is no known
2441860	2448900	lethal dose, which you can't say about over-the-counter drugs you take for a cold or for pain.
2450740	2454820	There are very few molecules in your brain that are washed out really quickly and they don't seem
2454820	2460340	to affect the, you know, they affect your brain and they don't affect other parts. If you have a
2460340	2464660	panic attack, your blood pressure is going to go up, but they don't directly affect other systems.
2465220	2471140	That's one thing. And they're also non-addictive. The first thought you have upon finishing a
2471140	2475460	psychedelic trip is like, when can I do that again? It's actually, do I ever have to do that again?
2476580	2481540	And because it's really intense and they're, so they're not habit forming. If you give the rat,
2482500	2486260	in that experiment where the rat has two levers, one's cocaine and one's
2486260	2491380	food and if you press it the lever, he gets a dose of cocaine and they'll press it till they die
2491380	2496820	over and over and over again. You put LSD in that contraption, they'll press it once and never again.
2498740	2507380	I mean, imagine being a rat on LSD. So from the physiological point of view,
2507380	2513380	they're safer than a lot of drugs we take routinely. And I was surprised to learn that,
2513380	2518020	frankly. Psychologically, you know, it's very hard to sort through the stories.
2518580	2524740	The flashback phenomenon, which I've heard reported, I have never found any really good
2524740	2530100	research on it. And I'm still looking for it. If anybody has a good paper on that, I'd love to see
2530100	2537380	it. There are, you know, I've had, I've kind of flashed on things that happened in my experience
2537380	2543220	because they're part of my store of psychic, powerful psychic memories. Is that a flashback?
2543220	2548980	I don't think so because I can get it out of my head. But there are people who have these unbidden
2551060	2555620	moments of consciousness that are, that, you know, may be connected to what happened to them.
2556580	2563700	I haven't heard that they interfere with people's life or mental health. But it's a question mark.
2565060	2570820	The great danger is the danger you have drinking too much also, which is doing stupid things,
2570820	2576820	walking into traffic, falling. All that happens on psychedelics as it happens with any powerful
2576820	2582740	drug. And that's why a guide is really important, somebody to look out for your body. In the
2582740	2588660	studies that have gone on, there have now been a thousand dosings of people who have been screened
2588660	2594420	for mental health problems and things like that. And there has not been a single serious adverse
2594420	2600420	event. So are there adverse events when people use the drugs recreationally? Yes, we all know
2600420	2604820	people who've had really bad trips and they usually stopped using it at that point, felt trapped,
2604900	2613940	had panic reactions. But often psychiatrists who didn't know this territory would misinterpret
2614500	2619300	a panic reaction as a psychotic break because it sure looks like that. You're having delusions,
2619300	2624820	you're hearing voices, you know, I mean, to an average psychiatrist, this would say psychosis.
2624820	2631220	But often it was a panic attack. I interviewed Andrew Weil, Dr. Andrew Weil about this. And he
2631220	2636180	was very interested in psychedelics in the 60s. He was at Harvard and Lyria was there. And when he
2636180	2641940	graduated from medical school in 1968, he went out to San Francisco and volunteered at the Haid
2641940	2648420	Ashbury Free Clinic. And they were seeing lots of LSD casualties as they call people coming in,
2648420	2653540	having bad trips, thinking they're losing their mind or they're dying. And he knew the territory
2653540	2657620	really well, having used a lot of psychedelics. And he would come into the little cubicle with
2657620	2663060	somebody who was completely freaking out. And he had on his white coat and his stethoscope and his
2663060	2667460	clipboard and he'd ask a few questions. Then he'd say to the person, well, excuse me, there's someone
2667460	2672100	in the next room who's really in trouble. And he'd leave. And they were like, wow, someone's more
2672100	2679460	fucked up than I am. And they would suddenly feel fine. They would just completely subside. So
2679540	2684340	suggestibility is a very big part of the experience. Yeah.
2687060	2689220	Thank you very much for coming to talk to us today.
2689220	2696740	Oh, thank you. Thanks for your great question. Thank you.
